I was a little surprised, thinking \"It's just a cemetary.\" But once I was there, I understood completely. It's unlike anything I've seen in the United States. It is an entire city for the dead, with streets and alleys, and huge, ornate mausoleums. The opulence and the architecture will leave you wanting to see every last edifice."

I would say this should be on your 'must see' list if you can afford the time. If you do go here there are quite a few surrounding things to see as well, so it is worth it.If cemeteries are not your thing or can be a bit off-putting, I still strongly recommend having a look. The sheer scale of the place is not unlike a small city - having said that you can get lost quite easily as paths go off in every direction, with your line of sight being obscured by a multitude of tombs. Sections of the cemetery have masses of tourists, but you can still wander off and find things of interest.There isn't really much to say about it except that there is so much to see, empathise with, and appreciate... while it can feel a bit morbid or a little irreverent that you are just touring through, there is a sense of solemnity amongst the locals and tourists."

An intriguing and often morbid collection of tombs - some with great stories you'll need to research on the internet first in order to appreciate - including Eva Peron's final rest place (after her body disappearance for decades - Google it).Prepare to wander aimless to find anything of interest (including Eva Peron's resting place, which is to the left of the main center, and then two blocks north). There is only one map with a list of names which is not very helpful or easy to look at. It seems they avoid giving out information on purpose in order to have people paying for the guided tour.Anyway, worth a visit if you're in Recoleta. It's free, so why not."

It is know to be one of the most visited places in Buenos Aires. Now among the important people burried there there is Eva Perron, Isabel Walewsk Kolona who was the gan child of Napoleon, Mr Guido who was a known general in the independence war. There could be tons of other information to write in here but I will only say that this is another must see within the many things of Buenos Aires has to show."

The cemetery itself is really beautiful, but it is also the resting place of so many significant people in the history of Argentina. A truly worthwhile stop for architecture lovers and history buffs alike."

The tomb is Eva Peron is the biggest attraction here but the stories of the other famous and infamous deceased are equally- if not more- as interesting. A guide would be a bonus as then you can full trap the whole experience."

Beautiful cemetery where you can find the graves of Argentinean historical heros and celebrities, or, who knows, a posible relative who immigrated to Argentina! Most foreigers look for the grave of Eva Peron the \"\"Evita\". It isn't so easy to find because it is under the name of \"Familia Duarte\"; I sugest to look for it in advance in Internet or in a map of the cemetery. There are guides offering their services and people selling maps at the entrance of the cemetery but I am not sure it's a good choice. Anyway, it's worthwhile to visit - don't miss it. Being in the near, take a rest at caf\u00e9 \"La Biela\", traditional caf\u00e9 where the writer Jorge Luis Borges used to go (you can even \"see\" him sitting at one of the tables inside the caf\u00e9). If you go there on a sunny day and wish to sit outside, be aware that the prices will be a bit more expensive (you pay the view)."

Her comment says what is says about what there is to see, or the lack there of, in this city. If the foregoing hasn't tipped you off, let me be clear, I'm not a fan of Buenos Aires. That's not to suggest that it isn't an interesting existential experience, just not a city one needs to see to be a citizen of the world. For goodness sakes, CNN of all organizations is reported to have rated La Recoetta as one of the top ten most beautiful cemeteries in the world. That has to count for something. Who would have thunk it? In any event, if you're into the macabre, or are looking for ideas for your final resting place, than this certainly is the place to window shop. You'll have the pleasure of viewing, and in large, every conceivable style of mausoleum there is to see including, but not limited to, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Baroque, Neo-Gothic and a few modernist. It is amazing the length to which individuals will go to make a statement that they existed, or is it vanity? Nevertheless, If nothing else it certainly is a captivating place (no pun intended)."

It's awkward reviewing a cemetery, except to say that you can buy a map at the entrance for 30 Argentine pesos (she also accepts US$2 cash), or just wander around on your own.Of course, the first place everyone visits is Eva Peron's burial site. From the entrance walk a quarter of the way in, turn left, walk almost to the end to the next street, turn right, then turn left just after the two benches. It's the Duarte Family mausoleum. Don't try this if you're given 15 minutes to get back to a tour bus, because you might get lost in the maze of tiled streets within the cemetery.The cemetery closes at 6 p.m. However, a bell starts ringing around 5:30 to warn visitors, and many times I saw guards not let people inside as early as 5:10 p.m."

One could easily get turned around wandering through it, and one could also spend hours just looking at different architectural styles and choices amongst all the mausoleums. What I kept mulling over is, what does a place like this say about the living? To be here is to lie among the most prominent citizens of Buenos Aires, and it's not cheap. Plots are rented, not bought. Although one does wonder what happens if anyone's family can't keep paying. It's also, frankly, ostentatious. Is this place a function more of status than of memorializing? It's well worth visiting, although I did wish I had taken some time to learn more about key people in Buenos Aires' history, as the names didn't have much meaning for me. I was reminded of trips I've made to Boston in the US, where visiting an old cemetery is like reopening my old US history textbook. I could have used something like that here, some kind of interactive online map that would have pop up single paragraph entries for specific families. Maybe it already exists, and if so, it would be a nice thing to know about!"

There are family mausoleums of the wealthy aristocrats of Argentina. Most of the mausoleums are beautiful adorned with magnificent sculptures. I strongly suggest getting a guide to take you around and provide interesting insight and history. Eva Peron is interred here. Getting the story of Eva Peron and what happened to her body after she died is really bizarre. Some of these mausoleums are so beautiful, i wouldn't mind spending my vacation in one."

Evan Peron, the First Lady, can be visited at site 88.

The cemetery is an eclectic collection of elaborate mausoleums and statues in the Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Baroque and Neo-Gothis styles.

That was my plan from the beginning, as I enjoy visiting cemeteries as a general rule, but when I arrived in Buenos Aires and asked my co-workers what I should visit, they all said \"the cemetery\" without hesitation. Despite my own preference, this surprised me because most people don't place visiting cemeteries high on their tourism to-do list. This made me realize that the cemetery in question must be pretty remarkable.Remarkable doesn't begin to cover it. Stunning and extraordinary are the first words that came to mind upon my arrival. You could easily forget that you are in a cemetery and believe instead that you're in a massive sculpture exhibit. The mausoleums spanned the gamut from simple to ornate, from modern to gothic. Many had stained glass windows. I spent more than an hour just wandering around in awe. I am so glad that I visited; it was the perfect choice for my sightseeing time in Buenos Aires.Note: despite what Google Maps will tell you, the entrance is NOT on Azcuenaga. The entrance is on Junin, which is on the opposite side. It's a large cemetery, so if you find yourself on the wrong side as I did, it's about a 10 minute walk around the perimeter to the entrance. It's not a big deal in retrospect, but at the time it was very frustrating as I thought as I was lost."

After that we just wandered and marvelled at the price paid to be the richest man in the cemetery. An interesting place to see and loose an hour or two. Nice surrounding, we went on a Saturday and there was a cool market, plus Palmero shopping centre, Starbucks etc."

It definitely helps to take a guided tour. But NOTE: when we visited in June 2016, signs indicated that the free English-language guided tours offered by the cemetery staff had been suspended. !! Quite an unpleasant surprise to us when we arrived. We accepted a guided tour by a fellow who approached us at the gates and said we could pay him whatever we felt right at the end. He told us great stories about the cemetery and surrounding area and was quite entertaining, so I'd say it was worth it. But since the cemetery staff were still giving Spanish-language free tours, it was hard not to shake the sense that something was amiss with the English tour suspension. We ultimately racked it up to a case of paying a penalty for having failed to learn any Spanish all these years (American hubris). You don't have to take a guided tour to enjoy the place, however. It's worth also visiting the church next door."

Having done little research about what to see in BA, the locals say this \"is\" the major tourist attraction for Buenos Aires, other than the Pink House and Tango. Our hotel, Mio Buenos Aires, was in Recoleta, steps away from the Cemetery so after checking in and a light breakfast, Googlemaps said it would be a 16 minute walk to the Cementario Recoleta. We literally did a full circle and walked right around the cemetery when we could have just walked directly to it. If you're walking from Alvear Palace Hotel / Mio Buenos Aires, go right and look for the entrance with the white pillars and gold tipped fence. The entrance is also to the left of the Recoleta Cultural Center. On the left there is a Map of all the different tombs the most famous being Eva Peron (C7). Free English and Spanish walking tours are offered - English at 11am Tuesday and Thursday and in Spanish at 11am and 3pm from Tuesday to Friday but were cancelled due to the rain. It was an unusual walk through history, very different to what you'd typically expect at a cemetery especially with some tombs with glass doors where you can see the casket (. We found Evita's tomb easily enough using the entrance map but didn't have the background knowledge to appreciate the significance of the other tombs."

Looking at the monuments allows the visitor to travel through the history of Buenos Aires and Argentina in general. With varying types of style and architecture, alongside statues and beautifully maintained \"streets\", it feels like a stroll in the park. The many cats that doze on or near the monuments are said to be the guardians of the loved ones at the cemetery. Of course it is worth mentioning that the tomb of Eva Peron can be found here as well."

Yes go see it- perhaps bring some deep and philosophical reading material ( I recommend Marcus Aurelius's Meditations for moments like this) and ponder how short our time here is on this planet. Marvel at how many of the graves in this super fashionable and exclusive neighborhood appear not to have been cared for by anyone in a century or more- really- is it sad- yes-is it life - yes. So come to Recoleta to check the box, but more importantly consider how lucky you are to have the opportunity to visit this fabulous city during the nanosecond you have on this planet. Then go get yourself another incredible ribeye and dont hesitate to order that second though likely unneeded bottle of Malbec- life is short - enjoy and savor every moment!"

A majority of the mausoleums have undergone a state of utter decay or disrepair, and others appear vandalized. It seems, as if time had finally caught up with reality that no amount of iconic or fervent immortalization can uplift death\u2019s affirmative pall: We are all here for a purpose for which our existence came to be necessary until our life sentence on earth is commuted by death."

            "review": "Don't leave B.A. without visiting it!. The cemetery of the rich and famous, an open book of Argentina's history and a national monument. It's in the middle of a fabulous residential area, but when it opened its doors in 1822, that wasn't the case. The Franciscan monks were growing vegetables there and after that land was expropiated, the cemetery was created. At that time it was named \"the cemetery of the North\" because Buenos Aires was mostly South. In late 19th Century, the center of gravity of B.A. started to displace to the North and a wonderful neighborhood developed around the cemetery.In early 20th Century, Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world and, that wealth can be perfectly seen just by looking at those mausoleums. In many cases, they are a show-off of money and pride.Jewish and Muslim people have to be buried in the ground but, with Catholics, anything can be done, and that's why we have funerals but no burials there. You can perfectly see those caskets on shelves. As most of the people that settled in Argentina came from Italy, France and Spain, we are a Mediterranean culture and there's some implicit cult of death in it. On average, there are 20 funerals per month and that's almost nothing for a city the size of B.A. There's a much bigger cemetery West of Buenos Aires, which is the one of the middle class. Mausoleums there are not that big there, but there are huge pantheons for professions and different regions of Italy, Spain and France. There's even another cemetery further West, for poorer people.The reasons for only having 20 funerals per month in Recoleta is that people are now very different and don't like those elaborated things full of symbolisms. Therefore, in suburbs of Buenos Aires, we have private cemeteries, where people can be buried in the ground. Let me give this example: My mother in-law inhereted a mausoleum in Recoleta but, as she didn't like the idea of one day ending there, she left it to her cousins and with her husband bought a piece of land at a private one. Jewish and Muslims can be buried there, without breaking the rules of their religions. My parents in-law, who were Catholics are surrounded by Jewish people.Back to Recoleta...it's a municipal cemetery, and those mausoleums are pieces of real state. People have a deed, have to pay taxes and can buy and sell. Partially thanks to Madonna, the most visited person there is Evita Per\u00f3n. Her final resting place makes some people get disappointed, as they expect to find something very big. It's just a black, shinny thing with the sign \"Familia Duarte\". (as her maiden name was Mar\u00eda Eva Duarte) She died in 1952 and wasn't sent there until 1976. She shares the place -among others- with her mother, her sisters, her brother and a brother in-law. But, visitors shouldn't miss the mausoleum of the Leloir family, in my opinion, the most impressive in the whole cemetry. There's a person at the entrance who sells a mao of the cemetery and you could ask her to show you where it is. (but, please buy the map, as the money goes to repair those mausoleums which are in very bad condition. Some are collapsing, as there's nobody left to take care of them)I'm pretty sure you'll find the cemetery very interesting. Walk through the area around the cemetery and, you'll see how lively it is, just next to the dead....Contradiction and ambiguity, what would B.A. be like without them?"

There are handful of absolute \u201cmust-do\u2019s\u201d for any first time visit to Buenos Aires of any length: as mentioned in my earlier reviews - don\u2019t miss the Teatro Colon (opera house), if you\u2019re there on a Sunday - don\u2019t miss the enormous San Telmo Flea Market, and by all means, make sure you have the famous Cementerio de la Recoleta (Recoleta Cemetery) on your list. While it might seem strange to mention a cemetery as a \u201cdon\u2019t miss\u201d destination, the Recoleta Cemetery lives up to the hype and is well worth the time. In this \u201ccity of the dead\u201d you will find buried or entombed the rich, famous and powerful of Argentina: politicians, generals, business magnates, people who made their names in the arts and, of course, Evita Peron - whose crypt is probably the most-visited. Guide books tell you the cemetery is set on 5.5 hectares (14 acres),and contains over 5000 vaults, all above ground, of which 94 have been declared National Historical Monuments by the Argentine government and are protected by the state. Laid out in blocks like a mini city, the cemetery contains hundreds of highly elaborate tombs and mausoleums, many as large as small houses, some looking like small churches or temples, and many more adorned with statues - some done by well-known sculptors - and worthy of a museum themselves. Visiting the Recoleta Cemetery is an adventure in history and art. It is considered one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world - and for good reason - reason which becomes immediately apparent as you begin your journey down its many alleyways.Entrance to the cemetery was free when we went in May. We had been told that free tours are offered in English at 11am Tuesday and Thursday and in Spanish at 11am and 3pm from Tuesday to Friday - but we did not find anyone there offering free tours in any language when we went - only people at the entrance either selling maps of the cemetery and/or offering to be a paid guide. Look into the possibility of a free tour in case we just missed our opportunity. We purchased a map for a couple of dollars and, having a list of some of the graves we knew we did not want to miss from doing some research online prior to our visit, we proceeded to visit the cemetery on our own. We had planned to spend only an hour or two at the cemetery but wound up spending over three hours - walking up and down row upon row of mausoleums - taking in the incredible artistry of so many of the tombs. Every now and then we passed some tour group where a guide was explaining whatever tomb they happened to be standing in front of and, I must say, each time we found the narrative interesting. If you want to know more about those interred and entombed at Recoleta, joining a paid tour or paying a guide to show you around may be a good idea to enhance your visit. We were okay just wandering around with our map. We learned later that there are free maps available online. Two points to keep in mind: First - not all of the tombs are well-kept. Some look like they have been broken into and/or vandalized. We saw broken glass and trash in some of the mausoleums and more than a few looked like the coffins had been disturbed. This might be upsetting to some people, especially small children - who might find the whole experience unsettling and for whom the cemetery visit might not be appropriate. Secondly - stay close together! It is very easy to get lost or separated in the labyrinth of tombs by taking a few turns away from your group. You\u2019ll find each other eventually, but it\u2019s a good idea to not get separated to begin with (yes - I am embarrassed to say this comes from our own experience).Even if cemeteries tend to give you the heebie jeebies, the Recoleta Cemetery is not to be missed!"

You could look in and see stained glass windows and coffins or ashes. Very interesting to see the tributes to Eva Peron brought back to Argentina after 30 years away. The poor adored her and the rich hated her. The guide told us her husband is interred somewhere else!! It was amazing to see huge statues of angels etc and then some \"houses\" in need of attention. Fascinating visit and interesting to see apartment blocks looking over the cemetery quite close. One not to be missed."

I knew a few before we arrived and had anticipated finding a guide at the entrance as many sources had told me was easy to arrange. The weather wasn't great though the day we visited and so no free-lance guides showed up! We took the official tour (regrettably in spanish) and while better than no tour it was limited to telling us the official facts and details of the cemetery and shared few of the interesting stories about the families buried there. If I could do it again I would contact a tour operator and arrange a scheduled time with a specific guide to hear all the stories. In this case this would be a good tour for families with pre-teen or teen kids."

I'm from the New Orleans area, and we have tombs above ground, too, but these are HUGE. The Recoleta cemetery is really a kind of city almost. It's walled, which makes it safer really. There are guides there, but you do NOT need a guide. Be polite, thank them, and just do your own tour. People come here to see Evita's tomb, which you can do, but it's not a big deal really. There are so many other more interesting crypts. My favorite is the one with glass and there's a room with a chair where you can go in (I mean, the family, with a key) and visit the dead person. There are some really old tombs that have bars, sort of like a barred window/wall, and you can see the coffins sitting right there. Wow. If you can go with a group or at least with a friend, I'd recommend that. I would not want to wonder the crypts too much by myself. I think it's very safe, but these tombs are close together, very big, and, well, kind of creepy at times. GO! You should definitely see this at least once!"

The endless rows of mausoleums and crypts are not a little creepy, but at the same time the dedication that has gone into remembering the city's dead is very humbling. When we were there it was pretty empty and we spent a long time quietly walking the avenues and getting caught in the stories and lives that have found rest here. There is an intense respect for the dead palpable throughout the cemetery and many of the carvings are done with great skill. One of the 'attractions' in the cemetery is Eva Peron's mausoleum, which is hidden on a small avenue near the back - look for the words 'Familia Duarte' and the flowers placed in the grill if you want to find this. A must see if you're in Buenos Aires and expect to spend a long time here. Go early in the morning if you can to avoid the crowds as being there feels like quite a personal journey."

The cemetery itself is absolutely beautiful, I could have spent literally all day looking at the beautiful monuments, picking out ones I wish I could have when I pass! You can't see any bodies of course, just the coffins inside some- but reading every plaque was addicting, it was just so beautiful.

Each crypt was unique, some of the structures were amazing works of art, while others were crumbling with broken windows and rusted ironwork. Each one could captivate you, though to look at each one would have taken days. There really are that many crypts in the cemetery! We took a 45 minute English tour offered by a women who was standing near the cemetery entrance for $7.00. It was well worth it to hear the history and for her to show us Eva Peron's family crypt. There is an official English tour offered at 11:00 am each day, but we could never get there that early."

The cemetery is packed full of mausoleums ranging from the grand monumental tomb of General Alvear that greets you on entry, to the elegant graceful tomb of Eva Peron through to the almost derelict or slightly vandalised tombs of lesser or expired family lines.Fascinating place, looking into the tombs seeing coffins of the long or recently dead with religious symbology everywhere and every mausoleum is different, in style, in character, in dediciation.Tips for visiting the cemetary:1. Visit the cloisters for a small fee in the neighbouring chuch (Iglesia Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Del Pilar) for a unrivalled view across the mausoleum rooftops2. Take a printout of the map or consult/photograph the big map at the entrance before heading in3. Locate Eva Peron's tomb on a map and navigate there - finding it without one is difficult!4. Look for the stray cats looking for tidbits from tourists, especially the ever so adorable grey cross-eyed cat5. Look into the tombs where you can - they are all fascinating and different inside6. Don't forget to look up!"

Regardless, I think this is something any first time visitor to the city must experience."

There is only one entrance open and it closes at 5.30. I understand they ring a bell to warn you of closing time. I really wouldn't like to get locked in! I would allow at least an hour to wander and bring a drink... it can be thirsty walking around in the heat."

Most people come here for one reason , to see Evitas Tomb.It is a really interesting place for sure , some of the tombs are really old and must have cost a fortune even in the days they wre made . Evitas Tomb is easy to find , just follow the tour groups,. It is still decked with fresh flowers every day by her loving fans .Many of the tombs have glass doors and you can see the ancient coffins inside crumbling away (Thats the creepy bit) stacked one above the other on shelves . Presumably there are no family members left for upkeep .Most of the tombs are architectural masterpieces and you will notice many of them belong to doctors and education people .It is really a \"Must Visit \"site in BA."

But even if you're not looking for the elusive Evita there's much to see and marvel at in the memorials to those who've passed. It's a beautiful site, well worth a couple of hours' time."

Small concrete mausoleums of varying style, simple to over-the-top extravagance, were constructed to hold family members. I expected to find sealed marble or stone containers, but was surprised to find weathered, wooden coffins sitting behind iron grates. In a number of the crypts, the plaster from the ceiling had failed and fallen to the floor and/or on top of the coffins. Many of the structures were in a bad condition. "

The variety of architecture is remarkable with many of the brick built vaults looking a little the worse for wear whilst the marble structures retained their magnificence. It's a big place, of great contrasts and you don't need to do it all and to be honest, even if you miss Eva Peron's resting place, you haven't missed much but many of the others are just magnificent.Probably not a good idea to let the kids stroke the cats though."

Family vaults capable of innumerable generations can be stored on their passing and, although there is no room for additional plots, it is still active and accepts new residents on a frequent basis.The families seem to have played a game of one-upmanship to have the most opulent tombs, engaging the most famous architects of the day. The Duarte family seem to have been wealthier than I imagined - Eva was no street urchin or working class daughter. Styles are mainly traditional. But occasionally a family fails to maintain their tomb and, after 30 years of neglect, it can be repossessed, cleared out of residents and re-sold. This is a rare chance for more modern designs, which add greatly to the experience of the visit. Take care of your belongings though. The Cemetary is just as attractive to pickpockets as it is to tourists."

Look for a square black stone door with the name DUARTE above the door. There are faded flowers stuffed into the grid-work on the door. Evita's name is on the side with other family members. The entire cemetery is made up of beautiful and interesting tombs. CNN has voted it one of the top 10 cemeteries in the world.

Families try to raise their social standing by having a grander and better maintained mausoleum than their social rivals. It is really quite an appalling attitude but it does result in row upon row of extraordinary tombs. Some of the mausoleums are fully enclosed but others have windows which allow you to peer in and see a mixture of coffins, portraits, floral tributes or perhaps some pertinent artefact of the deceased. Families are required to maintain the tombs and if they don't, they are emptied out and offered for sale.Many visitors just come to see Eva Peron's tomb. It is nothing special but it rather ironic that the people's hero should have been laid to rest in such a place."

It's a good item to check-off your sightseeing list but not a compelling reason to stop-by the cemetery. 80% of the other tombs are far more interesting and they should be why you visit.)"

Unless you hire a guide (I didn't) a bit of prior research into who is in the cemetery is useful, so you know where to go. There are lots of guides available. You could also listen in to any guided tour, but this is cheating a bit. Of course, everyone makes a bee line for the grave of Eva Peron. Clearly shown on the map but can be difficult to locate, just follow the trail of people. There is so much more to see though. Quite a spectacular sight. One note of caution. Beware pickpockets. I was targeted by a couple of young kids in the plaza outside the cemetery, but I always ensure all pockets/bags etc are firmly closed, so they didn't get anything. Lots of signs up warning about this. The church and cloisters next to the cemetery are also worth a visit."

You just show up. My Tuesday tour had a big crowd, but the guide had strong voice, well-spoken, and herded us well.(2) Guided tour is well-worth the hour.

Or to put it another way if Eva Peron had not been buried here would I - and for that matter many other people - have visited the place? The cemetery is the resting places of many of the wealthy citizens of the city as is testified by so many magnificent mausoleums. We went unaccompanied and we would probably have been better off with a guide who would have been able to relate some points of interest. Initially it was interesting to look at so many monuments of varying magnificence but, apart from Evita, there was no-one I had ever heard of and I fairly soon wearied. We probably shouldn't regard cemeteries as tourist hotspots but I cannot help but think that Recoleta cemetery isn't in the same league as the like of Pere Lachaise in Paris or even Highgate Cemetery in London. Nevertheless I felt that overall it was well worth visiting."

You will have to ask around and look where crowds are gathered to find her tomb because it does not have signs pointing the way like those of some other famous personages. I suspect that is because her burial here caused controversy amongst those who opposed Peron's politics and Evita's humble background.

Some of these tombs are very well kept while others need much work. Of course, the most famous tomb is of Eva Peron. However, one should take the time out and just walk among the many different styles of tombs. Very worthwhile place to visit."

My main reason for going was to see Evita's tomb, but I found myself intrigued by the many different, ornate tombs. I read what I could about the inhabitants of the tombs and their families. Fascinating! It was blazing hot while we were there, however we managed to spend an hour or so, wandering the maze of tombs. In cooler weather, I could see myself spending even more time as the architecture itself is intriguing. Upon leaving, we walked under the 200+ year old tree, Gomero De La Recoleta, and sat at an outdoor caf\u00e9, La Biela, located in the shade of the tree. We cooled ourselves with a fresh lemon juice and soda water. Don't miss Recoleta Cemetery, it's worth the visit."

At first glance, it is somewhat reminiscent of the grand tombs of New Orleans or London's Highgate Cemetery's Circle of Lebanon. But these tombs in Recoleta - instead of being walled up - often have either iron gates or glass doors and you can see the coffins and urns sitting on display. In many, you can see down narrow staircases into the depths of the mausoleums and see how well (or not) the unknowing occupants have been tended to. Some of the architecture is amazing and the styles are very eclectic. The state of repair varies quite a bit: we actually saw one with iron gates that had a couple of busted coffins (sans body parts, at least that we could see!) haphazardly stored. That was a bit strange, but I guess living family members are responsible for the upkeep as Recoleta Cemetery doesn't charge entry fees and - as far as I can tell - is still actively taking on new \"tenants.\" We walked around the place on our own; we had to go find someone selling inexpensive guides because it's difficult to find any particular grave just wandering. We went to find boxer Luis Firpo's tomb (found it, with the map) and, of course, we stopped by Eva Peron's tomb, even though it isn't all that fascinating if you're not a fan. There really were some impressive art pieces here and it's an interesting sociological view of how BA treated some of their richest and mightiest in death. If you're a fan of cemeteries, architecture, or Peron, I'd say it's a must see."

            "review": "The Cemetery that always sleeps. So fantastical is Recoleta Cemetery that a visit here is essential for all tourists and travellers. It is a graveyard, but one with magnificent architecture dating back to 1880 challenging eternity - eclipsing the protestant cemetery in Rome, the Jewish cemetery in Prague, and on a par with Pere Lachaise in Paris. Here are mausoleum follies and huge tombs above catacombs, decorated with fine sculpture in stone and bronze. They house the remains of politicians, statesmen and women, military leaders and artists. It is an almost death-defying collection of buildings and history. A tip - arrive early, bring a snack, drink, sun protection, your camera, binoculars if you have them, a cushion - and take time to wander and sit. Take a guided tour (with excellent guides) or allow at the very least an hour for a DIY tour; and do not stay on the tourist trail to the Peron tomb - take the side turnings and take time to ponder. Look upwards to see some extremely fine carving, and glance downwards to the turned stairs to underground chambers. Some of the finest detail is where you would least expect it. You should also look out for the book Cementerio de la Recoleta - Fotografias by Cecilia Pastore as a memento of your visit. When you are finished, head to La Biela - at 2 o'clock across the park for refreshment and another of Buenos Aires' must-do experiences."

Perhaps knowing a little history on it would have added to the experience, but overall you can give yourself a tour and be just fine. Bring some water with you as there is not much to purchase nearby for reasonable prices. Really easy to photograph a lot of different religious icons in one day."

The day I visited was also super hot, and this place has limited vegetation and rows upon rows of concrete passages that radiate the heat - so take water. The cemetary itself is the most amazing place to take pictures, and quite restful as it has a few seats and a few big trees in the central 'street' so you can sit down and rest when the heat gets too much."

A free guided tour in English was available at 1100 which would have been useful if we had realised. The notable and absolute \"must find\" is the vault containing Eva Peron (Evita).

Many are immensely ornate, just a few are tumble-down, with rough brickwork appearing under crumbling marble facades. We spent almost two hours here - photographers' paradise, one could say. Go early in the day if you can, before noisy and irreverent tour groups disturb the peace and do explore some of the side aisles as well as the main pathways: the diversity of the tombs and their contents is amazing. Reading some of the countless commemorative plaques gives a synthesis of the history of this amazing city and of its immense wealth."

Located in the most expensive barrio of Buenos aires the Recoleta Cemetery is one of Buenos Aires most famous 'must visit' destinations. My partner and I visited this as part of a day in the Recoleta/Palmero area. You are best of getting the metro 'green line' and getting off at either the Facultad de medicina or Pueyyredon stop and walking from there. After visiting the cemetery I suggest visiting either the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes OR MALBA > Floralis generalis before tracking home via the closest metro station by walking through one of Palmero's parks.This place is worth visiting both due it's fame the fact that it's free. It's pretty small but surprisingly a bit difficult to navigate so I suggest purchasing the map offered for 20AR. This will also give you a route which incorporates the famous 'Evita' grave - which despite being the most famous, is not the most impressive. The overall site is quite interesting seeing the grandeur and architecture on display. However, there is quite a lot of overlap so be ready for that. Excellent photo opportunities abound."

If all family members deceased or no longer have money, they can fall into disrepair. - Some have fancy coffins to show their wealth. - Some you can look inside to see the stairways to imagine how far down they go with all the generations of family."

It is the burial place of all significant political and historical figures. Each mausoleum has an interesting tale to be told.....as we were on our own, we listened to a tour guide and some of her explanations. We decided a tour guide was the way to go!We were there on an especially hot day with the sun beating down - I was thankful for our umbrella which reduced the heat by at least 15 - 20 degrees. The purchased map was also helpful to find our way around and back to the entrance. The cemetary is kept in excellent condition (maintained by all the donations).

Built in 1822, this art-rich cemetery features the tombs and mausoleums of many of Argentina's \"royalty\" and elite: past presidents, military heroes, influential politicians and other notable historical figures, including Eva Peron.PROS: It is very famous in BA that everyone knows where it is. All taxis know the place and many city tours include a free visit in their itinerary. A mere mention of \"Eva Peron\" and people on the street will point you in the general direction. For orientation, it is close to the Retiro train station. The non-descript entrance gate ushers you to an elaborate maze of ornate statues, marble sarcophagi and mausoleums. It is built like a city with streets, walkways and alleys. After several twists and turns, you arrive at the Familia Duarte's (Eva's maiden name) mausoleum. Plain and discrete, Evita's grave is inside here. To the side, a small plaque (see photo below) bearing her name confirms the spot. Flowers festoon the mausoleum's door. Quite touching.CONS: A few come to mind -- First, proximity is a liability. It's a bit out of the way that it took me the better of an hour to walk over from my hotel. Second, there are not that many POIs nearby to make a taxi ride worth it. Maybe combine it with a trip to the zoo. Third, the cemetery's gate does not have a sign \"Recoleta Cemetery\" to identify it as such, but instead the Latin phrase \"Requiescant In Pace\" (Rest In Peace). Also, Eva Peron's grave is not highlighted with signs or directions (unlike the Mona Lisa at the Louvre). Without a map or guide, you'll be going blindly around in a maze. (Even the cemetery map does not highlight Eva's grave; you'll have to search her name from a list on the side, then look it up using a numerical reference on the map.)TIP: There are free English tours every Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:00 am. I do recommend that you join one. It will greatly enhance your experience. (Other languages are available, but call in advance.) The cemetery is huge. Take a map with you; they are for sale at kiosks. Or else, do as I did, take a photo of the cemetery map at the entrance with your cell phone and use that.Verdict: To be honest, I'm not into cemeteries. The main draw for me was to see Eva Peron's final resting place, having casually known about her from the hit Broadway musical \"Evita\". Having said that, I treated my visit the same way I do an open-air museum, with all the statues, icons and mausoleums as art masterpieces in its private collection. As of this writing, it is my understanding that an entrance fee for tourists -- probably 100 pesos -- is in the works. If this is not your \"cup of tea,\" I understand. Worth a visit for its artistic and historical value, if nothing else. Your call. Grade B+.."

This cemetery is impressive for its size, its beauty, its location, and the number of dignataries buried there, including Eva Peron. Situated in the heart of the Recoleta district of Buenos Aires, this cemetery is surrounded on all sides by a high stone wall. You enter the cemetery from the side that faces onto a park on which craft fairs are held on the weekends. You can find maps in guide books and on site showing you who is buried where. You can also find a woman near the entrance who sells inexpensive maps in exchange for a donation to the preservation society. Inside, you will see a seemingly endless area of beautiful vaults, family alters, statues on top of the vaults etc. If you simply want to get in, see Peron's grave and leave, you can do it all in 20 minutes. However, if you want to soak it all in and find the vaults of some of the other famous people buried there, you should allow a couple of hours."

Well known politicians, celebrities, and the rich are buried here including Eva Peron, along with Bartolome Mitre, and Saenz Pena, former Argentine presidents. This cemetery is almost a small city filled with those who lived large, or rich in life and wished to believe they would be remembered in the after life. Some of the tombs are still shiny and new, but others, like those interred, are beginning to show the ravages of time. One of the main tourists venues in the city, it is worth the visit to think about where you are in life and where you will eventually be."

Each mausoleum is fascinating not only from an architectural perspective but also for providing a tiny glimpse into a family lineages. If you are a fan of cats, you will enjoy all the cats of the Cemetery who live there. In the summer it is best to go in the late afternoon to see the cats. The Cemetery is particularly famous as Evita's resting place. However, I highly recommend visiting the Cemetery regardless.

Instead of joining a very large group we opted to have our own private guide for our group of 4 adults. We met Simon (our guide) at the entry to the cemetery. He is a UK man who had been living in BA for about 20 years and has been guiding people through the cemetery for about 12 years. He is extremely knowledgeable and spent about 1.5 hours with us. He accepts any money you wish to pay him. We were extremely happy with this tour and rewarded him accordingly. The stories behind several mausoleums are fascinating. Eva Perons mausoleum is highly decorated in flowers and gathers a large crowd. There are around 4600 mausoleums in this cemetery and each varies in size, stature, opulence and finish. Absolutely worthwhile to go and try to find Simon to have an exceptional tour. Also there was a pickpocket their walking around that we had to alert the authorities about. Be careful and wary when someone stands too close!"

To each his own, I guess.Moving on to Eva; Oh, what a shame! No matter how you feel about her, she deserves more than an innocuous plaque on the crowded and small Durate family mosoleum.

Take a photo of it and get to know your way.Second, there are a lot of tour guides there (you can rent yours also). If lost, ask for assistance.Besides Evita, a lot of military men, presidents, poets, writers..etc are buried here."

It seems pretty macabre, but that's what the aristocracy of Buenos Aires have done. I'm sure the Kardashians would take up residency there if they could. Look at me, look at me, look at me! Eva Peron is supposedly buried here and that brings the visitors, but her tomb is by far less spectacular than her neighbors and it is worth walking around to appreciate the creativity and art that went into constructing many of these sites. Most of the family members are under the ground and I understand as many as 20 can be interned in any given site. If you look carefully you may see the stairs that lead underneath; there is often a coffin or two (sometimes small ones) that are laid to rest above ground. I am not a cemetery kind of guy, but I would still recommend this as a top place to visit in Buenos Aires. I'm not sure if there is an admission price as I stopped with a tour group.

I live in New Orleans where all we have are these beautiful above ground cemeteries, but this one is interesting because the mausoleums (right word?) are so elaborate.

Eva Peron's tomb is unassuming compared to much of this cemetery and not on the \"main drag\" so to speak, but you'll notice larger groups of people and be able to find it. If you walk in and go to the left, that's the direction it's in. I suggest spending some time researching it on your own, printing out and bringing facts along with you, or getting a guide as that's what really makes these places so much more interesting than the usual.It's right on the site of a fair/market (?) where they have crafts, snacks and drinks for sale. There's a Starbucks in this little complex, a Hard Rock, and a mall at the street level (the cemetery is higher up). Be sure to walk the fair around to the giant ficus tree.

It's also great that this place is free. In all, this place is definitely worth a visit, even without a guide. The surrounding area is also very nice for a walk."

We had two separate tour guides take us through the Recoleta cemetery, and, other than the Evita Peron tomb, both tour guides had unique and different stories to tell of different tombs. Art and impressiveness aside, I can't imagine having gotten as much out of the Recoleta experience if it had not been for the tour guides and their knowledge of the unique stories of each of the individuals there. It felt like walking through a story book, and I imagine that the individuals buried there must enjoy their people watching of us - possibly maybe even enjoy the visitors. Other than some stairs to enter the cemetery, a stroller was easy to push around (even flooring within the cemetery). There are bathrooms in the cemetery, but they had no toilet paper - so bring your own, just in case. I was fortunate that I had some toilet paper on hand. The restrooms were clean. There is no entrance fee. The Evita Peron tomb is a MUST - not for the impressiveness of the tomb, but for the touristy aspect of it. Read up on her before you go, it will mean more then."

If you get lost you will still have lots of interesting tombs to see along the way.Go on a Sunday if possible as there is an open air market outside features art, crafts, jewelry, etc. There are lots of open air cafe's in the square adjacent to the graveyard and the main BA art museum is located right across the street.

Obviously, this cemetery is for the rich and famous, not for the common people. But it was a unique experience and it's well kept.

Our visit was around November 11th, where we walked to it from our hotel on M.T. De Alvear. The weather was perfect and we took our time taking in the sights along the way. As we entered there was a lady handing out a map of the cemetery, for a donation. We gave her 20 pesos, her suggested donation. We spent about two hours here looking at many of the famous monuments. Evita Peron's grave naturally had a lot of tourists stopping to look and take pictures. There are many other famous people here - many from the 1800's as well as many families that have made arrangements for their relatives. Some of the monuments are in need of repair. Happily, we saw some workers dedicated to repairing some as we toured the cemetery. It was very peaceful and moving. Such loving tributes to important people and we were happy that it was open to the public, unlike some places in the United States where the cemetery for the famous people are private. All in all, if you're in Buenos Aires you'll definitely want to come here. In many of the monuments there were freshly placed flowers, candles ,etc. and you are able to see the coffins. Don't miss the opportunity to visit. Plenty of restaurants near by ( we ate at El Bien (sp)) right across the street and was very happy with our lunch,"

Why would so many people go to such extreme lengths and expense to place closet sized mausoleums next to each other hip to hip. The mix of old world designs next to modern (replacement) units was bewildering... what a jumble. In any case, worth a stroll to view some very nice sculpture and detail on some of the 'tenants' resting places.

We have had the experience of having tour guides for many sights along our travels and have found the experience to be an added bonus to the visit wherever we are. We were able to find Evita's tomb, hear the history of the cemetery, how it functions, and take in the majority of the cemetery within about an hour with the guide."

Originally, like probably most tourists, I went to visit the Eva Peron tomb- however, that wasn't all there was to see. Walking inside this cemetery made me feel as if I was walking into a museum. The sculptors this place has is unreal- and at times I had to remind myself that I was visiting the sacred place of people's remains and not a museum. We were on a tight schedule as we were doing an all day city tour and as such we didn't really get a chance to see much and were so impressed by the grandness of this place that we went back in the afternoon to take our time and visit these impressive memorial structures. A definite must see!"

The cemetery was so big that every isle (row) has a \u201cstreet sign\u201d, just like a little city! My wife and I followed the tour guide closely because it would be easy to get lost and separated from the group. Also noticed was some former distinguished or wealthy families had lost their power or fortune, and thus the maintenance on their family tombs became neglected, becoming very sad and rundown sights.

It is like an oasis in the heart of busy Recoleta. Eva Peron's grave is a must for visitors. The guided tour is very helpful.

Inside you see the casket of the last family member to pass away. You will note that their is either an opening in the floor or a stairway. When the next person dies the casket on view is moved to a lower level. I am told there could be 6 or more levels below ground. A must see if in Buenos Aires."

The place is beautiful with loads of history and the staff, even the landscapers were extremely nice. It was hard to understand the map as neither the cemetery or the map have names on the different streets it has (it has many streets!), so that made it hard to get from one place to the other in a limited amount of time. It's a place you definitely need to visit when in Buenos Aires, with the right amount of time, you can walk all of its streets and will be able to visit the most famous tombs. Definitely worth going"

We went there in search of the Tomb of Eva Peron and we did find it amongst the hundreds of others that are there. Totally by coincidence, the day we were there was the anniversary of her death and the were many wreaths adorning her tomb. It was quite moving really.It's certainly a place to behold and visit if you're in the area. Recoleta itself is a nice area and you feel very safe there.If you're going in search of Eva's Tomb, save time by knowing that she's buried under her Maiden name of Eva Duarte!"

On this spot were the monks of Recollect. This cemetery was created in their peaceful, beautiful, walled \"cloister\". Every single mausoleum was uniquely designed and perfectly maintained. The evenly tiled walkways are wide and beautifully landscaped. The stories of its inhabitants are rich and heartbreaking and historical and awe inspiring. Being on a tour, I did not get to spend near enough time. Please allow several hours for enjoying this sacred space.

The details and care paid to each Mausoleum shows the care and importance of the dead in this culture. While you have obvious headstones that are quite opulent in nature, you don't get the sense that any is more important than the other. I had to make about 3 tours of the cemetery and consult the map before I found \"Evita's\" final resting place. It was very nondescript and simple. Walking down one of the main pathways in the cemetery leaves you feeling like you are on a regular street with homes on each side.

Along with Paris' P\u00e8re Lachaise, it stands among the 10 most beautiful and famous cemeteries in the whole world! \"Recoleta Cemetery\" was the first public cemetery in Buenos Aires, being inaugurated in 1822. Tombs and mausoleums were built in many different styles: baroque, neo-gothic, art-deco and art-noveau. Some are still in very good conditions, others totally ruined: creepy and really scaring! The most visited mausoleum is Mrs. Eva Per\u00f3n's, former first lady of Argentina and founder of the Eva Per\u00f3n Foundation. Just follow the crowd and you'll find it, under the name of \"Fam\u00edlia Duarte\". Guided tours are available on non-official basis (check previous reviews with interesting information about tours in English). Leaving the cemetery, visit the nearby \"Basilica of Our Lady of Pilar\" and stop for lunch at one of the very many restaurants just opposite the cemetery. If you are going by taxi, ask help for calling a radio taxi, as Argentinean cab drivers are not at all reliable, always ready to trick you on alleged false bill notes. If that happens, call the police! You are just about to be robbed! But visiting \"Recoleta Cemetery\" may be a quite interesting experience. Enjoy!"

The tours in English are only on the two days noted and only at 11am. The tour is given by a 'volunteer'. It's a lady who basically comes in and gives the tour for tips. She is not associated with the cemetery in any professional way at all. I don't know what happens if she's busy or sick on a tour day - I guess you'd simply be out of luck. There are people inside the cemetery gates as well as directly outside soliciting to give tours. I do not know what the normal cost is if you went for a private tour (as we did the free tour and gave a tip at the end). The lady's English was very good and we had no problem understanding her. The group was rather large however on the day we went.The cemetery itself is an interesting place to visit with many beautufl and different tombs. Having someone explain the different tombs makes it a much better visit. To find Evita's tomb just follow the crowds or ask someone. It's the only one with lots of fresh flowers aroud it. The tomb is under her maiden name and is a regular one - not big or fancy like you'd expect.There are several restaurants near by as well. We ate at Dean & Denny's which is a burger and milkshake restaurant diagonally across the street. It was nice to get a USA food fix.The cemetery is not close to any metro/subte stop. You have to walk at least 15 minutes to get to the cemetery. It's a flat easy walk. I don't recall any signs pointing the way to the cemetery. Best to have a Google map or similar handy for directions. We did and had no problem finding it."

In spite of the fact that it is a cemetery, the ambiance is actually one of beauty and respect. Located right in the middle of the Recoleta neighborhood, it is a bit like a Central Park--albeit with a different sense of nature. And, certainly more interesting than the shopping mall across the street. It is well worth a visit to this collection of monument and memory."

Tip: If you want to see Evita's tomb, be sure to check the map on the left when you first enter --- once inside, it's a maze and not as easy to discover as one might expect. The cemetery closes at 5:30 and by 5:45 security rings a bell to ensure everyone is out. If you go around 4:30pm, you'll skip most of the crowds and get some gorgeous light bouncing off the tombs for photos. It's free to enter and guided tours are available."

Say hello to the cat (alive!)that curls up next to the statue of the faithful dog (and don't forget to rub the dog's nose for luck). For a different view of the amazing eclectic architecture - pay to visit the museum in the church next door and look out the windows on the cemetery - well worth it (and the museum has some nice artifacts and relics)."

The variety and extravagance of the monuments suggests many things--about the 19th Century: indulgence, pomposity, even an ability to enjoy grief via total immersion. IMPORTANT: beware the mosquitos! They're silent, hungry and present in millions (the cemetery itself has many warning signs); they feasted on my wife and made, and she came down with a debilitating fever, so douse yourself with DEET.Also not tha pickpockets are nearly as umerous as the mosquitos and present all over the city.

If you consider having your coffin starred at by thousands of tourists peaceful! It has a certain charm. There are a mixture of beautiful well maintained mausoleums and others in a state of disrepair. I found walking around both interesting and creepy!

The light can be harsh so if photography is your thing then you might want to have a map and come back more than once so you can get the shadows to place nice."

This is the area that feels the most sacred. Several people were standing in silence and simply reading all the inscriptions. It is interesting that so many years after her death people are still leaving flowers here.It is amazing how much architecture there is to admire in this cemetery.

People hand down fascinating stories about specific mausoleums and the circumstances surrounding the death of the people in them. Many of the mausoleums are over the top and meant to project the importance of the family or person buried there. Still others are in bad shape because they are not being maintained -- raising the possibility that the family line has died out leaving no descendants to care for the final resting place of the family. Many buildings look like they should be illustrations for Edgar Allen Poe stories. If you peer through the bars of some of the crumbling crypts, you can actually see coffins cracked open by time and weeds with shadowy \"objects\" inside surrounded by dust -- both creepy and sad. In many cases, you can see spiral stairs in the main crypt festooned with spider webs disappearing down into murky lower levels - adding to the air of morbidity and mystery. The cemetery is a definite must see - it will cause you to stop and ponder the mysteries of life and death."

The most popular site is the tomb of Eva \"Evita\" Per\u00f3n...when there, even though we were with a guide, another tour guide with a large group told us to move on! So perhaps better to visit at 11ish as I read on Net that there are free tours on some days then. It's worth taking a tour as there are some very interesting history/stories to hear that you might miss without a tour guide. If that's not possible, good to read up a bit on Net before your visit. A mix of Architectural styles used over the years is interesting as well - Baroque, Art Deco etc. Wandering around without some background information would be a very average experience so hard to rate this one but we're glad we went!"

The cemetery has the tombs and elaborate mausoleums of notable Argentinians including presidents, Nobel Prize winners, writers, poets, priests, military men, statesmen, Eva Per\u00f3n, and a granddaughter of Napoleon. It's known as one of the world's most beautiful cemeteries and the \"most relevant historical and artistic monument of Argentina\".Its residents \"lie in silent testimony honored by the presence of thousands of Argentine and foreign visitors who enjoy a truly magnificent human creation\". The cemetery is set on 14 acres in Recoleta and cordoned off by a brick wall. The tombs in the cemetery create an eerie yet mesmerizing symmetrical pattern of crosses and angels spread out on the sky.Most people find that visiting the cemetery one time isn't enough. Having a guide walk with you to point out the details of some of the more interesting mausoleums is worthwhile. There is so much history, art, and symbolism in the cemetery it's difficult to comprehend.The tombs are close to each other and depending on the time of day and weather, getting good photos can be difficult. Some of the tombs are marble and others stone. A few stray cats live in the cemetery and are known as the cemetery \u201ccaretakers\u201d. The groundskeepers must feed them as they are friendly and healthy.The cemetery was built around the convent gardens of the Jesuit Order of the Recoletos Monks who lived in the area in the early eighteenth century. Beautiful Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar built in 1732 is part of the grounds.Recoleta Cemetery became the first public cemetery in Buenos Aires In 1822. Governor Martin Rodr\u00edguez and government minister Bernardino Rivadavia were responsible for creating the cemetery. A French civil engineer designed the original layout and an Italian architect remodeled it in 1881.The cemetery has 4,691 vaults, all above ground. Ninety-four of the vaults are National Historical Monuments protected by the Argentine government. Entrance to the cemetery is through striking neo-classical gates with tall Doric columns.The elaborate marble mausoleums have decorative statues in a variety of architectural styles such as Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Baroque, and Neo-Gothic. Between 1880 and 1930 most materials used to build tombs were imported from Paris and Milan. The design of each mausoleum reflects the life of the family or person buried. Many are breathtakingly beautiful. The cemetery is laid out in sections like city blocks, with walkways branching into sidewalks filled with mausoleums.Among the memorials are works by Argentine sculptors like Lola Mora and Luis Perlotti. The unusual tomb of Liliana Crociati de Szaszak is of special interest. Many flock to the flower-covered tomb of Evita and the Duarte family which is beautiful but not the most impressive in the cemetery.The grounds are well maintained and most of the mausoleums are in good condition. A few of the older ones are crumbling and need repair. Sadly, a few have broken glass and litter."

We took about thirty pics, including Eva Peron's family tomb. We learned about the total hands off policy regarding anyone's interference in the manner of perpetual care. We went back on our own, and in our wanderings, found many, many tombs which had been ignored for decades. Centuries. With families completely gone, things are left to rot.

I didn't have a chance to do any research before a business trip to Buenos Aires. I'd vaguely heard about a cemetery there but it wasn't on the top of my \"to see\" list until I randomly ran into some folks I'd stood in line with at customs who said I HAD to go. So glad I did.It is a city of mausoleums of all different types of architecture. You can see modern and ancient ones. Some are not well kept (which makes you wonder about the story...what happened to the family and its ancestors?) and some have fresh flowers in front of them. Inside some, you only see tiny coffins. What happened to those babies? It so naturally conjures up stories and your imagination. Make it there!"

In many of the tombs/ buildings it is possible to see the coffins in side. Sadly many are in a poor state where there is no longer any family to care for the tombs. The streets are narrow but the main avenues are wider. Eva Perons tomb is behind large closed doors there are many famous Argentinians buried here, you will recognise the names if only from the many streets named after them.It is open from 7 am to 5 pm. I went by my self and followed my guide book, there were enough people there not to make it feel eerie. It is very large so to see most of it will take about one hour."

The largest group of people will be in front of her grave and you will see flowers laid at the foot of her mausoleum. Some of the mausoleums are not in good shape and are crumbling. The place is quite large and crowded and are arranged like a city with narrow streets. It is actually quite charming. Eva's husband Juan is also buried in the Recoleta Cemetery but not with her. You will find that you will not be the only ones enjoying the view. The place is filled with cats who lie down on the steps of the mausoleums and bask in the sun.

It is located in a very affluent neighborhood and as people died, they would build these very ornate mausoleums to honor their families. Over the years, each successive person who died tried to outdo the previous occupants, resulting in a small city of often beautiful mausoleums and statues. You can wander at leisure up and down the many roads and admire the stonework. The church nearby is worth popping into as well. There are not many must-sees in Buenos Aires, but this is one of them.

Now I know why this cemetery is talked about the world over. The mausoleums are too numerous to see in just one visit. The stories that go with them are haunting and fascinating. It opens very early (7 am) and that is a great time to go to beat the crowds, the heat and have great light to photograph."

If you are looking for Eva Peron's burial site look on the directory for the Duarte Family Tomb. We were wandering around and asked a worker who showed us her family tomb. Such a wonderful woman who died so young. Very special place."

Given this is a cemetery were you would have expected the mood to be sombre but there is more an air of morbid fascination as its wildly flamboyant & quite photogenic more befitting your average tourist attraction, its dificult to explain on here as you have to see the place to believe what you are looking at & absorb peoples curiosity, you will see that I mean when you go, the cemetery reminded me of a similar place in New Orleans in America that was also bizarre, but this place is in first place on the od front.The Recoleta Cemetery is right in the middle of a tourist market with live street entertainers some doing there own version of the Tango with various degrees of professionalism.Considering the main attraction if you will for coming here in the first place & endeavouring to discovering Eva Peron's plaque as she was cremated is more difficult that what you may consider.When you finally do find it, it is very underwhelming & you may think, oh is that it? as we did.However the other Hugh Morse alliums many in Italian marble are worth the trip. After one hour you have done it as there is limited interest in a goulash point of view.For me its a must do.Thoughts of the day:We are all G_Ds children.The people you meet on the way up are the same people you meet on the way back down.Time is short, try not to upset anybody."

Eva Per\u00f3n is buried in the Duarte - her maiden name - family crypt. A more interesting story is the reason why Eva Per\u00f3n is not buried with her husband, Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n."

You could peer into some of the older abandoned tombs and see the urns and coffins. Some vandalism has occurred unfortunately over the years which is evident from the broken glass, open coffins and missing contents!! Yikes! Not sure what happened in those cases. In other tombs where the family lineage appears to be continuing, the tombs have been upgraded and secured and are cared for. This cemetery appears to be for the advantaged in Buenos Aires, the heads of the military, government, lawyers and heads of large organizations. I wonder where the common people have been buried??"

Ask someone who seems heading back to the entrance. A lady was standing about eight feet from the vault and asked where it is.You could say it is worth the trip, but what I found most interesting was to see what terrible condition many vaults were in. It seemed they were a collection of family-owned vaults, and if the family was not taking care of it, the condition was allowed to deteriorate.You need to go; then enjoy the park and go to La Biela to eat, drink, and watch the people."

The cemetery was amazing in the fact that the very very rich families would spend millions of dollars to bury their family in these very elaborate mausoleums. The mausoleum of Eva Peron was the most popular and the most photographed. This attraction is truly amazing and should not be missed. The Recoleta area is a beautiful area in Buenos Aires."

What is amazing is the number of statues of angels - and the fact that here the dead are given \"homes\" that are better than those enjoyed by many who live in Rio.

            "review": "Excellent for a sense of history and architecture. Recoleta Cemetery is a large collection of private mausoleums. Some are immaculate; others in various states of disrepair and decay. As it was explained to me, this is because the families that own them are responsible to pay for their upkeep in perpetuity - and that doesn't always happen. Sometimes, there is no family member left to pay; sometimes they can't pay; sometimes they choose not to pay. Whatever the reason, if there is no payment, there is no upkeep, and that is why some of them look as they do. Like any cemetery, just walking through reviewing the birth and death dates of those interred gives one a sense of history; unlike most cemeteries, however, the immensity of these structures gives one a sense of the architectural styles popular at the various times encompassed by the mausoleums.As others have mentioned, there are cats - lots of cats - roaming the grounds. One in particular took a liking to us. He was skin and bones and looked as if he'd been injured, and we assumed there must be quite a competition for food. But then we learned that there is a group of ladies who comes every day to the cemetery to give food and water to the cats. They encourage their presence in the cemetery to ward off rats.You could spend an hour here, or you could easily spend a day - admiring the architecture, appreciating the history, and petting the cats. If you choose to spend a longer time, there are plenty of restaurants and coffee shops within easy walking distance when you need a break. Whether you come for a short or a long visit, you should definitely come."

Admission is free, but check carefully before you go in where the Eva Duarte (Evita) family tomb is as it is difficult to find. I also think it is worth googling the web about what happened to Evita's body, before it finally was laid to rest in the family tomb. The story is fantastic. Evita died from cancer in 1952 aged only 33. She received a state funeral and her embalmed body was displayed in the main trade union body building in Buenos Aires. After Juan Peron was overthrown the body disappeared for 16 years. In 1971, the military junta announced that her body had been reburied in Milan. That year she was exhumed and flown to Spain where Juan Peron maintained her corpse in his dining room. In 1973 Juan Peron returned to Argentina with his third wife, Isabel. He died in 1974 and Isabel Peron became president. She arranged for Evita's body to be returned to Argentina,, where for a short time it was displayed beside the corpse of Juan Peron before finally being buried in the Recoleta cemetery where it remains."

Plus the cats are the icing on the cake. The map sold at the entrance for a few dollars is helpful for locating the most noteworthy mausoleums, but it doesn't have much more information on it beyond the map. My only other advice is to time your visit, if in the summer, sometime in the morning or evening when there will be some shade. Otherwise it's very warm under the direct sun in here!"

(See attached pictures).We, visitors had the same question - where is the tomb of Eva Peron? The Duarte Family Mausoleum looks very ordinary, but I guess the person buried in it is a SPECIAL one so visitors were flocking to her tomb. The other tombs are fancier and more beautiful, with big statutes of angels and other ornate decorations. Be sure to visit the white church located on the way to the entrance of the Cemetery. It is called, Senora del Pilar Church. Admire the Gardens and the Statute carrying the branches of the big tree near the Cemetery."

Quite a fascinating place, with many notable Argentine families represented. We had never seen anything like it. After the tour, it was nice to just be able to walk around and take in the splendor of the place. Interesting to see how some of the crypts were in pristine condition while many are no longer attended to. Fascinating place to spend some time."

This cemetery does not give you creepy feeling but makes you realize the aristocracy really planned well for their funeral. You are in awe looking at and reading memorials to the dead. Of course you do not go to this cemetery without paying respect to Eva Peron's burial tomb. Come and spend an hour and walk through this cemetery.

La Recoleta CemeteryDavid Goldberg 5:10 PM Keep this message at the top of your inbox To: DAVID GOLDBERGFounded in 1822, this is virtually a City of the Dead, laid out in a rectangular pattern of streets in which every structure is a mansion, a mausoleum, a palace, a lavish monument, or a florid statue. It was designed by a Frenchman, and French architects and sculptors have been responsible for its most impressive components. It is in reality an open-air museum of architecture and sculpture holding the remains of almost 5,000 persons. Real-estate here comes at a heavy price --------- currently beginning above $US 350,000. Believe it or not, these structures actually change hands. The originals were usually built to order by a single family for use in perpetuity, but future generations frequently failed to keep up with the high taxes and costs of maintenance. After a period of arrears, the \"property\" is re-possessed by the cemetery authorities and auctioned to new owners after the bones of the original inhabitants have been removed for disposal elsewhere. An unusual feature is that the dead are not buried below ground, but stacked within the family morgue. There is enough of interest to spend half a day here, but most visitors come to make a brief visit to the grave of Eva Peron that is, paradoxically, about the least impressive of all those in the entire cemetery. It is under her family name of Duarte, and is notable only for the fresh flowers that her admirers bring daily. You can learn a great deal about Argentine history in this place. Most of its Presidents are buried here, and I recommend in particular the graves of Nicolas Avellameda, Julio Roca, Domingo Sarmiento, Carlos Pellegrini and Bartolomo Mitre. Military men abound, and look out for the memorials to Gen. Miguel Soler, Luis Maria Campos, and the Irishman William Brown who founded the country's Navy. The Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Luis Leloir and the boxer Luis Angel Firpo are also remembered by impressive sculptures. Our tour group was fortunate to have an excellent and informative guide. You might consider hiring one if you want to get the best out of what I would describe as the most astonishingly lovely cemetery I have ever seen. I wouldn't mind being buried here myself."

We found the shopping cheap and entertaining with a large variety of hand crafts. Adjacent to the cemetery is an avenue of cafes with indoor and outdoor dining. The shade of the cafe portico is very inviting after a few hours shopping In the market and visiting the cemetery.There is no charge to visit the cemetery.The cemetery boasts the final resting places of several Argentine historical figures. Evita Perone is one of the most famous internationally. When you enter the cemetery there is an illustrated map that shows the locations of the departed. Evita Peron is with her family in location 88. It can difficult to locate. Once you get in the general vicinity be on the lookout for the occasional tour group, this can be helpful. Besides Evita there are several very interesting sites. Highly recommended. Foreigners should bring small denomination of US $ if possible. Bargaining with all vendors, restaurants in Buenos Aires is better done with US $. Do not exchange $ at your hotel or a bank the exchange rate is 20-30% less than if you pay in $. My one regret is that I did not bring enough $20's, $5's and $1's. "

The most popular tomb to visit is Evita's, because probably to non-Argentinians, she is the most famous person buried here. Her tomb is rather unimpressive compared to the others, so don't expect too much. It's more of a \"check the box\" type thing to do while here, so definitely walk around and explore the other tombs, even thought you may not know any of the other people buried in the cemetery. Each tomb is different, with amazing attention to detail. Some are quite lavish (stained glass windows, altars, etc). Recoleta is the wealthy part of Buenos Aires, so it's also worth walking around the area surrounding the cemetery and seeing how the upper class lives.And yes, it's free! I guess it would be wrong to charge people to visit a cemetery.."

The Guide provides a lot of information about the history of the cemetery and the people buried there. The tour is about two hours long and well worth the time.

It's like a strange little isolated town in itself, the tombs are rather like elaborate houses, quite splendid in their own way. But the pretentiousness and the folly of it all leaves a nasty taste in one's mouth. Even in death these people had to draw attention to themselves as \"important\". Ultimately it can be seen as a symbol of Argentina itself - a land of appalling inequality where the rich spend money on themselves and keep the poor out of sight...."

It is indeed one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world. It can be warm and the only shade provided is from the tombs themselves as there are few trees. The tombs are magnificent. Although the cemetery is the final resting place for many of Argentina's most notable citizens and a number of Presidents, we were really only familiar with Eva Peron. Mostly we were fascinated to see all of the different last names on the graves. Expecting to see mostly Spanish sounding names (I guess because they speak Spanish in Argentina?), we saw many nationalities represented there including French, Italian, Russian, German, Dutch, you name it. For the past 500 years, Argentina has received more immigrants than any country in the world except for the USA and it is quite a melting pot. Nowhere is that more evident than in this cemetery. Some examples are Luis Federico Leloir, the Nobel prize winning chemist born in France, Mariette Lydis, a painter and illustrator born in Austria, and Irish born William Brown, who founded the Argentinian navy. Even the native born Argentinians born here have a variety of ethnic names such as actor Armando Bo, medical pioneer Cosme Argerich, and Juan Lavalle, governor of Buenos Aires province. I thought this was pretty interesting."

Similar to Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, or the St. Louis Cemetery 1 in New Orleans, this cemetery features above-ground tombs, and is a unique lesson in history, religion and culture of Argentina. The cemetery is laid out like a city - a true necropolis with tree-lined \"boulevards\", smaller \"streets\" and some even smaller \"alleys\". The tombs lined these passageways like row-houses, built one right next to the other, next to the other. In some cases, families bought large enough plots that their tombs didn't touch other tombs, and might have had a bench for the living to sit on when they come visit. The tombs were often family-based, with more than one person within. In many tombs, coffins were visible, stacked on shelves within the tomb, or you could peek at them down teeny-tiny staircases that led to space beneath the tombs. In some eras, the coffins were covered with beautiful white cloths edged in lace. Most of these cloths were fairly deteriorated and raggedy (adding to the creep-factor!)If you're unable to go on a tour (Spanish language tours daily, English language tour at 11 AM on Tuesdays), read the Wikipedia article about the cemetery before you go. Many rich-and-famous people are buried here, including a bunch of former presidents. Evita (who was born poor, but became famous) is also here.We visited the Recoleta Cemetery on Nov 1, aka Day of the Dead. It was interesting to see how many people were in the cemetery to clean the tombs inside and out. (Although it seemed like some of the cleaners were hired to do the job, not members of the family). Our kids were a little unsure about it when I first suggested that we go, but once there, and once they got over the slight sense-of-unease about visiting a cemetery, they were fascinated. They are 11 and 15. We saw lots of other teens and kids here, and all seemed to be interested."

So, for most people, it might be a short visit, but everyone will expect you to visit it. No matter what your length of visit is, It's a good/free experience though.

It is a cemetery, after all, and there are a couple of stories that are the stuff of nightmares. Otherwise it is a peaceful place in the heart of a big city. Once you walk through the entryway, you are bombarded with artwork. The mausoleums are very interesting. Of course, there are some very famous people buried there, most notably several Argentinian presidents and Evita Per\u00f3n. Some of the mausoleums have not been maintained for several years, adding to the creepy factor and a sense of sadness. Many cats roam around the place. Rated amongst the best cemeteries in the world, and something you should see when in Buenos Aires."

Some of the mausoleum's are huge, some are beautiful, some are sad and delapidated. The city is now maintaining some of the graves because there are no living family members to look after them. There are free guided tours but most people prefer just to wander. It is a slice of Argentine history and it is worthwhile spending time to read some of the stories of the famous and mainly wealthy people from this era. It is so large that you can explore in peace except for the very famous grave of Evita where you can expect to wait to be alone for a minute or two."

I was not familiar with it and would have missed it otherwise.The place is amazing. It is a very historical cemetery that was opened in 1822. It is absolutely huge and right in the middle of the city in the Recoleta neighborhood. I love taking pictures on vacation and could have spent hours in this place. Everywhere you look there is a beautiful old cross, angel or sculpture of some type. The monuments are weathered and some have plants and grass growing out of them but this just adds to the mystique and personality of the place.The rows of plots go on and on and since the monuments are all huge and above ground they form quite a maze. You can literally almost get lost roaming around. Each structure is more impressive than the last and they are all quite unique.Of course, the most popular spot in the cemetery is the Duarte family structure which includes the final resting place of Eva Perone.The place was hauntingly beautiful and should be a must-stop when visiting Buenos Aires. Especially if you're a photography enthusiast."

The cemetery is huge and it was nice just to know where you were sometimes.We spent a couple of hours here and morbid as it sounds I took loads of photos as turning every corner revealed another wonder.It is humbling that there are 'normal' family tombs here to and you do have to remember not to pry too much as many of the tombs are sealed only by a metal gate and you can easily see the memorials inside. Some are really only and crumbling, but this somehow added to the overall experience. Definitely worth a visit if your in Buenos Aries, no matter how sceptical you are about touring a cemetery, just do it."

I've been to lots of places in the world but only a few have given me a sense of awe: Venice, Alcatraz Prison, Pompeii, The Colosseum, The Karnack Temple; and now Recoleta Cemetery can be added to this list.The cemetery is, quite obviously, in the Recoletta district and my friend and I got there using the Subte and then about a 25 min walk, however there were lots of buses that go nearer to the site. We went on a Monday morning as my guide book - lonely planet - said that the English speaking tours ran that day. However, when we arrived at the cemetery the lady told us that the English speaking tours were on Tuesdays, so make sure you check this. So, we bought a map for 15 pesos and she told us where Evita's tomb was and that was that. The map gives you a suggested route and who the mausoleums belonged to, but that's about it really, no information on who that person was or any explanation about their story or indeed the architecture of the mausoleum. So I think if you can get a guide it would be well worth it.The site has 4,800 vaults and is laid out like a small village - honestly, that's what it looks like: streets upon streets of mausoleums with varying degrees of size, architecture and age. Some of the mausoleums date from 1850s and some of them are from 1980s. Some of them are small and simple vaults and some of them are so big, ornate and decorated with statues that they look more like small chapels! ...hence my sense of awe. Evita's vault is also a surprise, but I won't spoil it here.The entrance to the cemetery is free and is open from 7am to 6pm every day. Obviously, it is still a cemetery and families will still be visiting to pay their respects to their loved ones, so it goes without saying that you MUST be respectful.If you want a great view of the whole place, then head to the shopping mall at the side of the cemetery. If you go to the top floor McDonald's, they have a balcony which gives you an impressive view of the whole site."

Sadly, a few are poorly maintained, leaving the fragile and cobwebbed coffins exposed. (This does, however, add to the atmosphere.) Don't miss the tomb of Eva \"Evita\" Peron, the beloved first lady of Argentina. Word to the wise: despite the fact that her tomb is adorned with flowers from her admirers, it can be tricky to find as evidenced by the groups of confused people searching for it throughout the cemetery. There is a map at the front entrance and you can find her burial place by counting the cemetery rows and number of tombs. Take a picture of it as a reference. Wish we'd realised that before we spent more than an hour searching for her tomb in a wild panic as closing time approached, For other tombs of interest refer to Wikipedia's entry on the site, as it contains an extensive list and photographs of the tombs. For animal lovers, the place is heavily populated by well-tended cats. Apparently there is about 80 of them. This starts to feel creepy as sunset approaches, when considering the legend that a cat leaping over a grave will create a vampire..."

The mausoleums are very close together, so you have to look carefully to see the gorgeous detail on each one. And, with row after row of mausoleums, you could spend hours wandering through. Note the amazing work done in marble. There were many street-sellers outside, and our guide warned us to take off ALL jewelry in and around the cemetery as theft is rampant. But take 2 hours and see this amazing place."

A map can be purchased at the entrance for ARS 15 (USD 2). The cemetery is laid out like a city and has many small passageways which can be explored.

When we lived in Palermo in the late 90s I used to give a free, impromptu cemetery highlights tour when I happened to be here and people asked me where things were. We've been here many times. There are so many intricate and interesting mausoleums and stories of those who are buried here! People come here to see Evita's mausoleum, but honestly I don't find hers to be as special as many others. I like to just sit on the cement benches in the shaded courtyard which is straight in from the entrance at one of the 'hubs' of the hub and spoke layout. Even our 6yo enjoyed the visit... esp the cats! I wouldn't touch the cats, btw.Some tips...- I highly recommend a tour. If you just go there solely to see Evita's mausoleum then you've wasted your time, imo. - There's an English tour at 11am on Tues and Thurs that forms at the entrance -- check with your hotel to ensure that hasn't changed. - Nuestra Senor de Pilar is a catholic church offering English masses with entrance on the same side as the entrance to the cemetery. - On Saturday's there is a market in the area in front of the entrance. Really unique things on offer. We negotiated considering the blue rate when paying USD.- You can also go the Etoile Hotel 14th floor for a great view from above. We didn't this time, but we did sit in their lobby for the extreme air con! - People do blue rate money exchanges in the area surrounding the cemetery. Safer than Calle Florida, imo. It's a seriously significant savings.- There was no fee to enter. I heard that sometimes people stand outside handing out maps and make it sound like you're paying them an entrance fee."

The cemetery is relatively compact and you can see it in about an hour - which is roughly how long the tour took."

Prior to visiting, it might be helpful to take a look at the internet and see who is buried here - at the entrance to the cemetery, there is a map identifying where the mausoleums are located.The cemetery itself is a beautiful and eclectic conglomeration of different styles of mausoleums - some are quite traditionally religious with domes, angels, and crosses. Others are quite modern edifices of granite and glass. Regardless, it is fascinating to see them and read the plaques commemorating those buried there. The cemetery was designed by a French architect. Also interesting are the stories about some of the ghosts said to haunt the cemetery and some of the more horrific stories about how some came to be buried here.I highly recommend - it is like walking the history of Buenos Aires when you visit."

Old wealthy families are still being laid to rest here to this day. Like Argentina, there is great lavish beauty and heartbreaking poverty; some graves are neglected, rusting over, with trash and weeds. Others are marble masterpieces, with fresh cut flowers delivered daily.This is one site where you should VISIT WITH A TOUR, not because it's dangerous, but because it's much more interesting when you hear all the stories."

I am so thankful that we joined the tour around the cemetery, otherwise we would have been wondering aimlessly about not having any information. The guide was amazing, passionate, informative, friendly and made sure everyone's questions were answered! The tour took us to some of the integral mausoleums showing us the architectural difference from when some of the first mausoleum where built and the final ones. The guide also showed us some of the most infamous mausoleums including famous politicians, writers and Evita Peron. The history, architectural changes and political history was fascinating. Our guide also told us some really interesting tales of people that had passed and how the significance of the cemetery has changed over the years. Tours are in English on Tuesday and Thursdays at 11am and go for 1.5 hours. They are free of charge (so is entry to the cemetery) but you should leave a tip at the end! Tour is cancelled if it rains."

We visited on Sunday 9 March 2014The Recoleta Cemetery is a place that any visitor to Buenos Aires must make time to visit, If for no other reason than it is almost unique in its concept, and sheds light on Argentina\u2019s history and the character of its people. To me, the cemetery did not have the hushed and somber tone of a place of death, or even the religious piety of a Westminster Abby where many of Britain\u2019s famous are buried; but more of a window into Argentina\u2019s somewhat turbulent history.I believe English language tours are to be had on certain days, but I thought that might give us information overload, so we chose to wander around on our own with a couple of mausoleums in mind that we wanted in particular to see. EVITA\u2019s of course, everyone goes to see that one. It is the Duarte famine's tomb and it is not the grandest, but is never without fresh flowers I was told.Somewhat wilted when we were there.The one that I particularly wanted to see was that of Rufina Cambaceres, I had read her story and learned of this human tragedy. We are not people of faith, and have no expectation of an afterlife, but can certainly feel for the family of this young woman who was mistakenly buried alive. The tomb is both beautiful and poignant, and is worth the visit alone, and is recognized as a masterpiece.All the \u201cstreets\u201d are named and you can purchase a map as you walk in the gate, but we didn\u2019t want to spend time pouring over maps, so just wandered. It worked for us, and we found the two in particular we wanted to see."

Some of the crypts are unbelievably detailed (to the point of ostentatious) and some are actually so decrepit that one could reach in and touch the caskets. You can literally spend hours just wandering around and I made two trips over four days.Yes, Eva Peron's crypt is here (and, yes, EVERYONE goes and sees it), but the random presidents, generals, Nobel prize winners and others are what makes this unforgettable.I would definitely do this with a guide rather than by yourself. We got much more out of our second visit, which was guided, than the first. A word of warning. The area in front of the cemetery is a have for hucksters, vendors, etc. Do not get scammed into buying an \"unofficial\" guide and watch for pickpockets. It is not \"dangerous\", just annoying and by no means should it prevent you from going. This is truly a Buenos Aires \"can't miss\"."

This place is worth a leisurely walk around to see the assortment.On the one hand, a guide is useful to assist with the history of the people buried here. Additionally, if time is limited, then the guide can direct you expeditiously to some of the more significant tombs, such as that of Eva Peron (whose body was shuttled about extensively for political reasons). On the other hand, tours limit the time available and you may feel you have missed too much. The solution would seem to be: first, a visit with a guide, and second, a return on your own to browse.It appears to be relatively safe within the cemetery in the daytime; of course, one should always be aware of people who may linger nearby. No one should leave their pocketbook or backpack open and it is best not to go alone. Don't hand your camera to any stranger to take your picture. Sensible awareness is advisable.Probably it is best to arrange a guide in advance from a reputable agency, perhaps as part of a larger tour.

The cemetery is beautiful with quite a few tombs of porteno families, some left in disregard and some beautifully decorated. To get to Evita's tomb, either look for Duarte family on the map, or walk straight to the 1st statue, turn left and keep walking until a tomb blocks your way, walk around that tomb from the right, turn right at the next alley and walk 20 meters at which point you'll see a crowd and find the tomb."

The cemetery is laid out like a small city with very ornate burial areas, some with very beautiful and some in disrepair. The burial sites belong to individual families not the city and when no family is left to care for the structure, they fall into disrepair. Some have been sold and new ones built (the old family has to remove the bones) It is quite interesting to walk through and see and feel the history here.

It can get somewhat desolate and maze-like towards the back of the cemetery and I thought for a moment it would be a good place for bad people to lurk. Not sure about the security there so maybe I'm over reacting. Plan on being amazed by the sheer size and opulence of this place. And be prepared to see real coffins, sometimes stacked 5-high in tombs! Unlike most cemeteries where the inside is pretty hidden from lookers, many of these tombs are elaborate and almost invite you to peek in. Bring your camera."

Those of us from developed western countries would be accustomed to lawn cemeteries or the more standard variety of cemetery where some ethnic sections boast large monuments dedicated to the deceased - at Recoleta every single grave is marked with either a mausoleum or massive statue. The latter are created with the most expensive of building/ sculpting materials e.g marble, travertine. The artwork on the outside of these final resting palaces is alone worth the visit. There is no entry fee but we chose to purchase a map of the site for 15 pesos - about US $1.50 to $2.00 at the time. The tombs are all numbered on the map but unfortunately you need to be quite the sleuth to find the corresponding numbers on either the avenues or the individual monuments. It was definitely a case of look for the largest crowd to locate the tomb of Eva Peron ! We had been warned about pickpockets at the site but the Saturday morning in March when we visited it was fairly quiet and easy to remain safe. Be warned - some of the tombs have glass display fronts with the coffins on clear display inside. Other very old constructions are in disrepair - we actually stumbled across a cemetery labourer who was in the process of dragging a coffin out from behind a collapsed facade ! He looked a little startled and waved us on urgently ! There are cool stone benches on which to rest and take in the atmosphere - not a morose place - more like a gallery of sorts."

Forget about Evita's mausoleum which is quite well hidden away (it is relatively simple and discreet compared to some of the confections you will see,) and just marvel at the great company of angels gathered above you as you wander up and down the avenues of tombs and mausoleums dodging star cats and peering through gaping doorways into crumbling coffins. This is Gothic fantasy at its best. There is an eclectic array of architectural styles and many conundrums to ponder in this relatively small cemetery size-wise, but containing many souls. Get there early if you want to avoid the trailing mobs of guide-led tourists. If you are a cemetery fan This is NOT Pierre Lachaise (Paris) or Highgate (London) or Kensal Green (London), all of which are much larger, but for sheer density of memorials it is well worth visiting."

The sheer size,and amount of mausoleums here was something to experience. Many of them were absolutely beautiful. Of course, you can also find Evita's grave but for me, that wasn't the highlight of this place. Be sure to take your time and explore the rows upon rows. Definitely bring a camera. It was also nice that the entry is free."

If you are used to places like Pere Lachaise in Paris or the Central Cemetery in Vienna, you are going to be highly disappointed. The cemetery is (except for a few plants and trees) made up entirely of mausoleums. One next to the other with very small alleyways between them. So unless you have a personal reason to visit, I recommend you visit the surrounding areas instead. The restaurant La Biela is well worth a visit and so is the Recoleta Design Centre. Even the HardRockCafe nearby is a better choice to spend your time."

Sure, you can find Eva Peron's tomb if you look for the long line - but the real experience is seeing how truly large and amazing this cemetery is and learning about the many figures from Buenos Aires' history that are buried there. We had a local guide explain several important people from past presidents, unique deaths and others that are all over this cemetery. When you understand who these people are and then examine their tombs - based on the what they are made of and the types of statues and symbols that are decorated there - then you really get a better sense of the city's history. If you can't get a guide to walk you through, I'd suggest doing some research of several important tombs to check out along with the backstories of the people in them. Print it out, bring it along and then read each story as you examine the tomb. This is a truly amazing cemetery and a must see while visiting BA."

Gorgeous monuments are next to tombs that are aging and in disrepair but each still has great character. A good tour guide will also be very helpful the first time.

Eva Peron's grave is located here. Our tour was about an hour, and I could have easily spent the entire afternoon wandering around this peaceful place and enjoying the variety of ways the people of Buenos Aires honor their dead. Recoleta Cemetery is located near a park that was lined with booths for crafts, and a huge finca tree that shades a portion of Ballantine(?) cafe on the corner.

One is the tomb of the Paz family, who owned the newspaper La Prensa, as well as the palatial building on Plaza San Mart\u00edn now known as the C\u00edrculo Militar.Another tomb I recommend seeing is that of Rufina Cambaceres, a young woman who was buried alive in the early 1900s. She had perhaps suffered a coma, and a few days after her interment, workers heard screams from the tomb. When it was opened, there were scratches on her face and on the coffin from her attempts to escape. Her mother then built this Art Nouveau masterpiece, which has become a symbol of the cemetery. Her coffin is a Carrara marble slab, carved with a rose on top, and it sits behind a glass wall, as if her mother wanted to make up for her mistake in burying her and ensure she could see her coffin if she were ever to come back again. The corner of the tomb is adorned by a young girl carved of marble who turns her head to those watching her; she looks as if she is about to break into tears, and her right hand is on the door of her own tomb. Many locals often place delicate sprigs of flowers into her hand."

Also, while all the tourists are making a bee line for the Eva Peron mausoleum, I'd recommend ignoring them and wandering through the aisles of tombs to admire the design and construction of the other monuments. Many mausoleums are crumbling with visible caskets below the surface of the mausoleum floor and others offer some fantastic glimpses into the lives of those inside them (old photos, hand woven lace covers, stunning candelabras etc). Overall, this was a fascinating experience for us."

We had a guide as we walked through Recoleta and that undoubtedly helped enjoy its details, but my guidebook also had a two-page map with highlights so a guide is not imperative. The highlight for most folks is Eva Peron's tomb, the final resting place of the famous Evita. She's been here since 1976, having spent the prior 20 years in Italy and Spain after her embalmed body was spirited out of Argentina by the military. There are many spectacular mausoleums here (6,400+) but I was most struck by the wealthy family's tomb which had a little side plot next to the tomb for their beloved maid. It needed weeding."

The crypts are in states of exquisite to tumbledown, although nothing is plain nor uninteresting. The carvings and memorials are magnificent, and angels abound! Argentine writer Virginia Ocampo and Eva (Evita) Peron are among the famous names to find here. A very exclusive and expensive cemetery, the crypts carry the names of the founders of Buenos Aires - the sea captains, the bankers, the generals and the builders who raised this incredible city from the earth. Some died at it's hand, others brought it glory with their might. The cemetery will add another dimension to the historical aspect of your trip to Buenos Aires, absolutely!You WILL need a map to find particular graves (you can download a pdf to your mobile device from the cemetery website, http://www.recoletacemetery.com/ ). It is a maze, and sometimes you feel as if you must leave a trail of breadcrumbs to find your way out, but it will be a fascinating journey! Spend an hour or two, spend a long afternoon."

Do take a guided tour and do buy the book they sell at the entrance. After the tour or on a subsequent day, just start roaming the streets of the cemetery. It will be very helpful if you have an idea of which crypts you know you want to visit (research), then look up their location on the map inside the entrance, and always take a different street if you can. We visited at all different times of day to get different lighting for our photos. Also, do visit the church next door and pay to see their artifacts on display in the cloisters. It is really inexpensive and they have some really interesting pieces. Try and make sure that at least one of the days you visit the cemetery is a saturday or sunday so you can take advantage of the market that goes up outside the cemetery - it is well worth a visit. Don't worry about getting to the market early, as the vendors take their time setting up. You are best to go i.e. after lunch. If you want to buy artwork as gifts, or as a momento of your trip, this is a great place to do so. As well, listen for the tango playing, as sometimes local dancers will put on a beautiful show under the big rubber trees."

Seems strange to be spending time on holiday trawling round a cemetery, but what a cemetery!This was a most interesting experience despite the fact that I knew very few of the 'celebrities' - for want of a better word - entombed within the mausoleums. It was just fascinating to see what importance some people attach to the housing of the departed, and the variety of mausoleums was quite amazing. Many are sadly neglected, and some are obviously well tended and no expense has been spared. Still can't help but think that the money spent on some of them could have been put to better use for the living, but that is only a personal view and I appreciate that not everyone shares it.I had intended to join the English speaking tour but I'm glad that I missed it because I didn't arrive in time. It meant that I could just wander round at my own pace and look at what I wanted to see, rather than what someone else wanted me to see. It was good to be able to take my time and look at some of the mausoleums in close detail, especially some of those which seemed neglected and out of the way. There was the inevitable crush around the Duarte mausoleum but if you were patient and picked your moment when some SE Asian teenager wasn't standing plumb in front of it, grinning like a loon and making two V signs, the your photo opportunity came around eventually. At the entrance you are assailed by someone unconnected with the cemetery plying you with a photocopied map and requesting money for, apparently, AIDS victims. It is unlikely that this is the case, but just inside the entrance is a patient official representative of the cemetery with a proper map of the site which is 10 pesos, and you are invited to make a donation to the upkeep of the cemetery. I was happy to do this as I appreciate that these places must be maintained and there is a cost involved in that. Bearing mind that this is a cemetery, it is not surprising to find out that there is nothing in the way of visitor facilities other than a tiny block of WCs hidden away around the perimeter, and these were of the type where a young child provides you with a sheet of kitchen roll (yes, I do mean kitchen roll!) in exchange for some money. There is little or no shade on the site so be sure to take plenty of water with you if you are visiting, as I was, in the main heat of the day. There is nowhere to buy drinks. A surprisingly interesting and, dare I say it, entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. Highly recommended."

When going to a cemetery you should focus on whom you want to see, so if you are interested in taking pictures with tombs of famous people, take a tour, because going by yourself, without knowing the history of the person you are looking for, is useless. I didn't take any tour.My purpose was one, and is to see Evita's grave. I followed the Lonely Planet instructions and got to the grave, and as it was said, there are many people around the grave.

Was given so much interesting history about the different mausoleums. We gave the guide about $AUS20 each for about 1.5 hours but thought it was so worth the money. He then took us to a money changer near the Alvear Palace Hotel, not a street one, and virtually doubled our $US to peso exchange rate. Beware, outside there are scammers. They try and give you a pathetic map and ask for a donation. They pretend the money is going to AIDS research or to look for missing persons. Ignore them! A word of advice about BA public toilets.

The austere Augustinian Order of Recollects established a convent and church on the outskirts of Buenos Aires in the eighteenth century. The church is still there, and worth a visit. Less than a hundred years later, the order was disbanded in Argentina, and the vegetable garden of the convent became the first pubic cemetery, the Cementerio del Norte. The dead were not buried but held in mausoleums above ground. As yellow fever broke out in downtown Buenos Aires, culminating in the epidemic of 1871, wealthier citizens moved north to safer ground, and the status of the district rose. The cemetery was remodelled in 1880. When you catch sight of the statuary inside these gates, the effect is astonishing in its exuberance and richness.The impressive tomb of General Julio Argentino Roca stands out on its corner site. Bronze victor\u2019s wreaths adorn the side of the structure, and the angel atop the pediment holds two more \u2013 Roca was twice President of Argentina. Known as el Zorro - the Fox \u2013 he devised and led the 1878-1879 Conquista del Desierto, which pushed back the indigenous tribes \u2013 dominated by the Mapuche people \u2013 who attacked Argentinian settlements in Patagonia, killing about 1,000, capturing 15,000 more, and pre-empting Chilean-Mapuche domination of the area. With the help of the Remington rifle, he laid claim to huge tracts of land, which were awarded to his backers. The settlement of Patagonia by Welsh immigrants dates from this time. In a section of Recoleta set aside for prominent citizens, the Panteon Ciudadanos Meritorios, there\u2019s a charming bas-relief in marble illustrating the New Testament verse on children. Its low-key simplicity is restful to the eye.Many famous and prominent people are buried here - presidents, scientists, the wealthy - including the modest tomb of the family of Eva Peron. The (English) guide book is a worthwhile purchase. Funerary sculpture and architecture in abundance is laid out to delight the eye. The most haunting story though is associated with a memorial striking for its beauty.Rufina Cambaceres was found dead on the evening of her 19th birthday. Despite being examined by three physicians, no cause of death could be established. She was interred, but some day later cemetery attendants noticed that the coffin had been moved. When they opened it, Rufina\u2019s face was said to be scratched and injured, presumably in an attempt to escape or at least to be heard. She had been interred alive, while suffering from catalepsy. Her family commissioned the tomb you see. There are those who say they see a young lady in white wandering near the cemetery at night. Certainly the way death is treated quite casually here \u2013 all the dead above ground, ornate coffins on display behind glass and wrought iron \u2013 lends itself to such stories. Even if the sombre reminder as you exit frames mortality firmly in a Christian context. More at theproverbial.org."

Later, a cemetery guard saw the coffin moving so he ask for her family. when the young girl's mother said to open the coffin, all of them could see the top of the coffin scratched.

May be before I would never thougth that a cemetery could be a tourist attraction but then I realized thatI was wrong. Moreover, I find Recoleta Cemetery more interesting as a museum than other real museums. So,I recommend it absolutely; as soon as I have the oportunity to visit it again, I will not doubt!"

Legend has it that the cats in the Recoleta Cemetery play with the spirits each night to keep them within the walls of this amazing cluster of mausoleums. As the cemetery now holds nearly 5000 spirits they must be very busy each night. No wonder they were all asleep in the sun when we wandered the roads and alleyways of this city of the deceased. Our guide felt their presence may be more to do with the fact that they are fed everyday! This was one of the highlights of Buenos Aires. Set in the ritzy Recoleta area the cemetery was a mix of the weird and the wonderful. A green pole marks the final resting place of Irish born William Brown, founder of the Argentinian Navy, a huge black and white marble edifice houses the remains of Jose Paz founder of La Prensa (a BA daily newspaper) and a rather plain brownish construction houses members of the Duarte family, the most famous of which is Evita. Presidents, Nobel Prize winners, actors, writers and even a boxer are all buried in this labyrinth of marble and angels. Quiet and serene this is a must do for any visitor to Buenos Aires"

It's a historical place in Argentina, where many known argentine people are resting in peace...It is a bit creepy to think of a cemetery as something tourists would want to visit, but it's gorgeous, the building are old and have stories to tell; it's like a city in the middle of the city of Buenos Aires. You can see all the architecture, and see the buildings (where people actually live) behind it, it is a different world, and there are lots of CATS, which are cute and friendly (however, I would not pet them, cuz I don't know where they've been). They dont charge you for the visit, but they ask you how old you are, I believe this is for security reasons, like minors shouldn't be wondering around on their own, but it's free, and it's always opened. There are some guides, but you either have to get one of your own, or pay one if you see one. If you are a tourist, which you probably are, then I would recommend getting a guide to show you around, because, like I said before, the architecture is fantastic, and there is a lot of argenitne history in that cemetery. Take lots of pictures, it's a really nice place. However, be safe."

There are some fascinating tales about a girl buried alive (Rufina Cambaceres) or the Italian Grave night worker who worked so much so he could buy his own grave then comitted suicide and the story of the young girl whos dog died at exactly the same time as her....I could go on. Despite being so beautiful, it is very touristy due to Eva Peron/Duarte\u00b4s body being buried here but dont let that put you off. This place is a photographers dream - some of the graves are works of art yet some are delapidated and unloved. We never managed to get a map but there are some near the entrance apparantly for a small donation. I suggest getting one if possible. Evita is number 88, on the left of the cemetary and is relatively low key. You will know which is hers with the mountain of flowers outside her door. Seriously, get yourself here at weekend when you can also enjoy the outdoor market in Plaza Francia, its unmissable."

I live in Buenos Aires and take visitors to Cementerio de la Recoleta as a \"must see\" when they are here (the date I was forced to enter here is just a place holder). Technically the cemetery is a mausoleum because the bodies are interred in above ground tombs (for the most part). It is absolutely vast (14 acres), and is a rabbit warren of alleyways. The tombs range from the most amazingly ornate, decorated with elaborate stone work and statuary, to broken down wrecks that appear to have been abandoned -- last resting places of people who cover the waterfront from the rich and famous to people with no discernible pedigree. Some are very old and some are brand new. You cannot see it all in several hours or even a day. I've been many times and have never seen it all. At some point you reach tomb overload. There is a map at the entrance that indicates a number of famous people's tombs, but otherwise there is no other way to find your way around. However, there are always tour guides at the entrance touting for business (in different languages). I've never taken one of these tours, but I occasionally linger on the edges and listen in. They seem helpful and informative, especially if you are unfamilar with Argentine history, because they focus on the accomplishments of famous people. Naturally Evita's tomb is the main magnet, and even if you are on a tour you will have to wait to get up close. I'd recommend that even if you take a tour that you leave some time just to roam around afterwards on your own. I also recommend that you plan a whole morning or afternoon for your visit so that you can visit the Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (Our Lady of Pilar church) next door. It was originally a monastery and church that was disbanded in 1732. The garden was converted to the first cemetery but the current mausoleum was laid out in 1822. If you go on the weekends there is a large flea market in a park opposite the church. All the restaurants opposite the cemetery are good, and some of them have reasonably priced lunch menus which employees outside each will hound you about. I'd take a leaflet from each and then figure out it away from the clamor to drag you in."

Get a map when you enter but also just let yourself wander and get lost in the power of the place. When you leave, there are a number of great places to eat right along the cemetery to reflect and collect your thoughts."

Recoleta is not expansive like the huge Staglieno Cemetery in Genoa, but packs thousands of mausolea within a few acres. As you stroll along its shady avenues you will discover some astonishing examples in a wide variety of styles and often covered with delightfully over-ripe sculptural detail. Many of the family tombs are quite small with loved ones stacked up within. Evita is entombed in her family's (Duarte) mausoleum, but following some unfortunate and ghoulish incidents encased in concrete some thirty feet below grade. (Juan Peron is buried in another of the city's cemeteries.)Less melancholy is the adjacent Recoleta Church near the entrance. This 'city of the dead' is surrounded beyond its walls by a very lively assortment of restaurants and night clubs."

There are tour guides inside for a price and we were solicited for money outside the cemetary, with a guy who hang drew a fairly useless map on a piece of paper. I would steer clear of them. To navigate I downloaded the endless mile recoleta cemetary app, which helped us to find out way. They point out 25 tombs, which had pretty interesting stories behind them. We wandered the area ofr about two and half hours. There are lots of opportunities for great pictures so bring your camera!"

That's not the only reason to visit as there are plenty of sarcophagi and statues. The cemetery is part of Buenos Aires history. Nevertheless, if you want to find Evita's tomb, I recommend that you follow my traveling guide's directions (many people had a hard time finding it): I will quote Lonely Planet's Argentina guide (excellent aid to plan your trip, by the way! Tip: buy the book, not kindle) \"Go up to the first major \u2018intersection\u2019 from the entrance, where there\u2019s a statue. Turn left, continue until a mausoleum blocks your way, go around it to the right and turn right at the wide \u2018street.\u2019 After three blocks look to the left and you\u2019ll likely see people at her site, along with bunches of flowers.\" Taken from my LP guide."

We only had a quick wander round really. It\u2019s very exclusive and as you can imagine the graves are huge and some quite extravagant. It\u2019s very well kept with lovely tree lined avenues within the cemetery and is a nice place to have a walk around. It won\u2019t take you long, depending how much you want to look at I suppose. Most of the graves have glass doors so you can actually see the coffins inside. On a Saturday there\u2019s a cute market on the green outside the cemetery with lots of stalls selling gifts and crafts which was lovely. We had some lunch in one of the eateries opposite the cemetery which was nice but expensive as you\u2019d expect. If you\u2019re in the area, I would recommend a visit to the cinema to see Evita\u2019s grave and have a look round. It\u2019s a nice free attraction in BA and the area is worth a wander round."

It's interesting how some are fantastically kept, and some look like they haven't been touched in many many years. Completely falling apart and the wood on the caskets falling apart.

Anyway, we were meeting a guide at the cemetery so were anxious to get there. Asking directions of people on the street was useless as people either didn't speak English or were in a hurry (it was the middle of a business day) ... and our Spanish, evidently, wasn't as good as we thought. We finally arrived at the cemetery an hour late so missed our guide. After several minutes of frustration, we decided to try and decipher the cemetery ourselves. We enjoyed seeing the statuary and walking among the different crypts but probably would have gotten a lot more out of our visit with someone who could tell us about the history of the cemetery. All in all, it was actually one of the most interesting places we visited during our stay."

A good percentage had glass windows and doors where you could see the coffins inside, and many clearly were suffering from what appeared to be years of neglect - broken windows, exposing the coffins to the elements. One wonders whether the descendants are still around to support the upkeep.Of course, everyone makes sure they stop to take pictures of Eva Peron's mausoleum, distinguished primarily by the innumerable plaques that adorn the front. We found it interesting that the mausoleum next to hers is for sale (our guide pointed out the understated way in which it is communicated as for sale)."

The guide explains the architecture, customs and points out the resting places of some famous people, the most notable of course is that of Evita Peron. The guide gave some funny anecdotes, including how the plots are sold when the family needs to raise funds. I think the guide is very helpful in understanding the history and custom of the people.

Yes, it\u00b4s free but if you spend a few bucks to have a knowledgeable guide take you, the whole experience is magnified as you learn about who actually has enough money to rest there eternally, where the former presidents (and Evita, of course) are located, and about the rivalries between the buried that inspired some of the over-the-top crypts bigger and more elaborate than your family home. I actually work in the travel industry now at Class Adventure Travel and always include a walking tour of the cemetery alongside a city tour. It\u00b4s just taking that one additional step off the beaten trail.

When entering you can obtain a sheet helping you find your way around. One thing I thought was of great interest is that in this cemetery most tombs have glass doors. I was surprised that by looking in the glass doors you can see the caskets inside. It seems that there are usually one of two caskets on the main level with a stairway leading below where other caskets lay on different shelves. Very interesting!!

I thought I was going to be in and out but I found myself absolutely fascinated with it. All the crypts belong families (1000+?), and it seems, in some cases, that people spent more money to be buried well than to use to live. There are crypts of naval Commanders, well-known Doctors and Professors at Medical Schools, military Personnel, philanthropists, wealthy Businessman and Politicians. The outside walls are covered with plaques, the more plaques, the more well-esteemed you were--a tangible testment to a live well-lived to be considered in the fterlife.There were even pictures of people's marriages, families, automobiles, etc. In front of one Naval Commanders site, there was a statue of him, life sized, in his uniform. The statuary alone belongs in a museum by itself. Lots of angels, crying angels, crucifixion crosses, etc. just. Warning.....most of the crypts are closed with wrought iron and locked. Some have glass protecting them. There is nothing to prevent you from seeing the coffins lining the shelves inside the crypts. If that bothers you, be aware. The Cemetary is very compact, the space between the crypts allows for about two or three people to pass. Surrounding Recoleta are to apartment buldings that look right over Recoleta. I have been all over the world and not have seen anything like this.if you are in Buenos Aires for only a day, this should be on your list."

As it was off-season, there were no huge crowds; so it was very comfortable.As you enter the cemetry, there is a small desk in the lobby with a volunteer selling maps of the cemetery for 10 pesos. This small fee pays for the upkeep of the cemetery and is well worth it. There is one large map in the lobby for reference, but none in the cemetery itself. So if you are looking for Evita or the Paz Family plots, get the maps (or just follow the crowds or tour guides) to avoid walking in circles.You can easily spend 1-2 hours strolling here and taking photos of the beautiful mausoleums and crypts. It's quiet and peaceful; most tourists are still respectful that this is an active cemetery, with mourners paying their respects to the recently departed. Because the structures are so close together, there is a fair bit of shade; so it's cool and comfortable. And there are seating areas if you get tired.This is a perfect sight to visit towards the end of your stay in Buenos Aires. It'll be more meaningful when you recognize the names on the family tombs, names shared by streets and monuments throughout the city."

This is what is like to visit the Recoleta cemetery for an Argentinean. Every other mausoleum spells out famous last names - politicians, governors, presidents, military figures, artists, etc. Several Argentinean cities and street names call out as you walk by. If you're Argentinean or know Argentinean history then that is a huge allure, but also the sheer agglomeration of beatiful mausoleums is worth a visit. Outside the entrance you will be greeted by folks that will offer to guide you through the rows of tombstones, but you can also get a map from the volunteers at the gates and use that instead, for a nominal contribution."

It is easy to spend hours and hours here reading the plaques and marveling at the size and construction of the mausoleums. As explained to us families maintain the individual sites so if no one is left in the family the mausoleum falls into disrepair. (See pictures) The grounds, cobblestone walkways are well maintained and there are benches spread though out the site to sit and rest for a bit before you carry on. We were disappointed that they had no brochures left the day we were there but in the end it really didn\u2019t matter. Eva, Evita is buried with her family so you will not find her on the map when looking under the name Peron. She is buried with her family in the Durate family mausoleum. It is not what I expected to see. I thought it would be a huge site but after getting home and searching the internet I understand the history of why she is buried here. If you plan on going here make sure you give yourself time. It is easy to just walk and walk and forget about the time."

I have to say his knowledge was excellent and showed us some very interesting things. He wasn't at all pushy and really took his time showing us things. He didn't charge a certain amount for this at all. He just asked for what we thought was fair! After this we asked him for a bit of a walking tour around the area of which he was more than happy to do. Again his knowledge of the area was great. He really helped us find our way about, as this was our first day there. We gave him $25 u.s dollars he seemed very happy with this . All in all I would 100% recommend the cemetery wether you have a guide or not. Allow a couple of hours there and take a camera as people back home simply won't believe it....especially as you can still see all the coffins. Also see Simon if you need to know any thing he was great......"

It's home to many of the country's leaders and luminaries.

If we ever get to Buenos Aires again, we will definitely pay another visit to Recoleta Cemetery."

Even if one is unfamiliar with the various personages it is well worth a visit just to see the fantastic archecture and marble statuary. The famous tomb of Eva Peron is interesting, but not the highlight (which was another surprise).The entry is free and a map is available for a nominal fee (10 pesos).

I've been visiting graveyard art all over the world for the last 40 years so was looking forward to this cemetary which even the Lonely Planet rated as the best attraction in the city. I actually overheard a guide describing it as in the top three cemetaries in the world. Sorry have to disagree. Yes its fascinating but the the main cemetaries in Sao Paulo and in Krakow have the lead in interesting sculpture. The monuments here are more conservative although some are very grand. What did astound me, and I'd like to warn squemish travellors about, was the fact that the most recent coffins are in full view in most of the tombs. Some in broken tombs are suspended in mid air exposed for all to see. In 40 years of viewing tombs I have seen coffins down in vaults and sometimes accidentally exposed when graves are broken but this was the first time I've seen them so publicly on view. It made the hordes of visitors seem a little insensitve and (including myself) a bit voyeuristic. Evita's tomb is modest and probably not worth viewing if you're into good art in cemetaries but the fact she got into this hallowed ground despite the upper class objections makes it ironic that she has becone the main attraction. I believe the city are repairing the tombs so hopefully you won't have to view the open air nature of some of the tombs for too long.When you come out of the cemetary turn left and within 100 metres you'll come to a left turn onto a lovely terrace with some upmarket shops and restaurants looking down over the park - Hard Rock cafe at the very end. If you turn right and walk to the end of the cemetary wall you come to another big shopping mall which has some nice views over the cemetary from the upper floors."

Need to time visit to avoid major tours/cruise boat outings as the main attraction is down a very narrow alleyway and queues can be very long to take a quick look/photo.

Many visitors are there each day and it does move you to think she is actually there"

With such famous \"inhabitants\" as Eva Peron, whose simple tomb denies her audacious life, the cemetery at Recoleta has row after row of tiny houses with ornately carved doorways, many of which also have amazing statuary. Most of this housing is well kept up, someone in the family is still alive to sweep & dust, wash the windows, care for the statues. Others are falling apart, with broken windows, the glass of which still litters the floor within. Some of the walkways are crowded with visitors but many are as silent, well, as the tomb & there are trees & benches to contemplate the overwhelming array of sacred imagery. Most have a rather Catholic connotation but many are more political or having to do with work or play rather than religion. All in all, definitely worth a visit, especially since it's free to the public though it closes at sundown & is locked up tight to prevent the vandalism that has so obviously, & sadly, caused some of the apparent damage."

Our guide, a fellow named Simon, explained how the crypts needed to be vented to avoid the smell of decay, and that many of the crypts had several meters of underground lairs.Afterward, walk down the main avenues of Ricoleta before grabbing a cab.

The cemetary is a maze of mausoleums, from the rather plain to the elaborate. They are organized into \"streets\" and \"alleys\" giving the cemetary a \"City\" appearance/feeling. While the main attraction is the grave of Evita (Durante) Peron, many of the mausoleums have interesting stories behind them. Our particular guide, Alex, was very well versed in the stories of a number of the sites, and kept up a running commentary as we made our way through the various streets and passage ways. Without knowing the stories the mausoleums arelittle more than interesting pieces of architecture. However, hearing about the families, and/or the people buried there made the visit all the more interesting and in an odd way personal. If you do not go on a city tour, or you want to go a second time, there are always a number of guides at the entrance. It is well worth the money to hire one to shepherd you around this thought-provoking site."

Some of the vaults are simply grand, some are abandoned, but the architecture and the history makes for a nice several hour walk/visit.I can't remember its name, but there is an absolutely fabulous outdoor cafe near the large spreading limbs of a giant tree just off the cemetery. Be sure to stop there and have a beer and/or lunch."

We learned that her mother receives phone calls nearly every week from families that want to \"rent\" their crypt, just for one day, to hold a funeral service there, before interring their deceased loved one at a less-fashionable cemetery elsewhere! Even in death, class and status matter!With this background information, seeing the many hundreds of family crypts, in all states of repair and disrepair, some humble, others grandiose, and the messages they convey to visitors, gave us much to reflect upon."

Some are regularly maintained and others have fallen into such disrepair you can almost see the bones through the coffin's cracks. The statues throughout the cemetery will leave you in awe.

There is even a little section of English graves. Of course, everyone will need to visit Eva Duarte's (Evita's) family crypt, but the cemetery would be well worth a visit even if she were buried elsewhere.

The artwork is incredible as well as the stories behind many of the family mausoleums.I think it might be worthwhile to hire a guide or make friends with someone who can tell you a little about the background of a few of the family mausoleums. A friend went with me whom had visited often and was able to enlighten me as to the early deaths of a few of the people whom had monuments built in their honor. (Thank you Ismaela!)The surrounding area is very charming and there are many parilla restaurants to accommodate all budget sizes. I am not a big beef eater, but in Argentina I loved their beef. I could not get enough of it. There are some attractions close-by (an overly large tree and market, I believe) that make the trip a must-see on a short itinerary visit."

Finding out there were as much as two stories beneath the above ground crypts amazed us as much as what was found in some of them. Although parts of the cemetery were in disrepair and some of the crypts as well, that, too, is part of the story. You have to be very rich to be interred in Recoleta and your descendents must be rich as well and interested enough to pay for the upkeep of your crypt OR. ....We wandered with our guide and then by ourselves and could have spent hours here but it was a hot day and we wore out too quickly. One suggestion might be t have an overall map of the Cemetery with some of the names of the more prominent (or interesting) crypts listed on it. We did not expect Eva Peron Duarte's crypt to be anything special, but the flowers adorning it and the notes tucked into the front of it truly impressed us.

If you walk through the outer areas of the cemetery, you are likely to have the place to yourself, and you feel as though you are wandering through a city frozen in time. The guided tour in English, which we did not take but kept running into, sounded very thorough and interesting. If you are a photographer, this place provides an endless source of subjects - from monumental sculpture to decorative iron gratings. Go early in the morning (the cemetery opens at 7:30 am) or later in the afternoon so the sun isn't directly in your eyes when you try to take pictures.

The mausoleums of Buenos Aires' rich + famous are a riot of architectural styles, from Greek temples, to gothic to art nouveau. Eva Peron's is just one of many, tho the most visited."

We spent 90 minutes there and I could have left after 15 minutes. Okay...lots of history...but once you see a few hundred of these live and in person, you get it.

We were lucky to have our very own tour guide who showed the best way through the crowds (and were there crowds!) .. The draw here is the final resting place of Evita Peron ... but don't look for a Peron tomb, as she is buried in her family mousoleum .. Duarte. It is told that her family did not want her buried in the Peron tomb as she might be stolen ... so when she died, she was returned to her first family. We were told her tomb is the only one in the entire cemetery that has constant fresh flowers. There really is a pilgrimage to her tomb ... as she is still revered by many, many in this country. It is truly a beautiful cemetery ... interesting side note: lots of resident cats and as we were coming in, I noticed one woman leaving a bag of dry cat food with one of the attendants ... so they are well taken care of, too.

I believe that this English tour is free on Tues and Thurs at 11:00am BUT pls check with them. The tour was so wonderful because, they direct you to the specially interesting cemetery plots and give good stories of the reason the architecture is a certain way or the grandeur of a plot. If you wander by yourself, you are guaranteed to get lost. There at least three Presidents buried there and the guide gives you a decent explanation of their time as President and what they contributed to the nation. Of course, everyone wants to visit the tomb of Evita Peron. It is a simple memorial but everyone wants to take a photo there. The tour lasts for over an hour and it is perfect time to break for lunch following this tour and the many places nearby. Please try the Melanesa dish in Buenos Aires - a good specialty."

But seeing throngs of tourists in a burial place just didnt seem right.... Somewhat voyeuristic. I went out of curiosity and for what its worth, thought it was strangely beautiful. Evita Peron, if you're interested, is in the Duarte Familia tomb located to the left of the cemetary upon entry. Far less spectacular than many other tombs there, I personally think that it is more appropriate- these places of rest are afterall for the dead! Not to judge, but the expense of building and maintaining these tombs may be better spent on the many beggars stationed outside the grounds. I'd recommend only a short visit, if at all. There are enough other things going on around the area to make the trip there worth your while - the flea market (weekends only), church, Design Buenos Aires, Hard Rock Cafe, museums, shops, etc."

Evita's tomb was somewhat disappointing after all the hype about this woman in the city. To top it off there was at our group standing directly in front of it with the man speaking in Spanish and going on for far too long to allow other tourists to see. There's is only about the width of 10 feet between opposing crypts. It was clostraphobic and I got out of there as soon as possible.

I highly recommend that. It was free, in English, and I learned a great deal from it. For instance, I did not know that the tombs were purchased for eternity, and that generations of people are buried within. A \"medium sized\" crypt can hold up to 18 coffins, and when they get full - the choices for the family are either to seal them forever - or - more commonly, they take the oldest caskets/remains, cremate them, put them in small urns/boxes in the vault to make room for the newly dead. If you look inside those with windows you can see the caskets stacked on shelves - and small boxes that contain cremains, or small caskets of children. Also interesting is that they are often two below ground crypts, the first at 15 meters deep and the second at 5 meters. You can see the steps inside of the tombs that lead down to them. They fill up the bottom one first, then move to the next level, and some tombs also have above ground shelves where you can see additional caskets stacked. The tour guide said that some are pretty tough to get caskets down into - they use a series of ropes and pulleys to lower them (upright) down into the lower crypts. Families hold the key to the tomb, and come and visit inside. They can walk down the steps to the lower crypts to place flowers or memorials. Claustrophobia city down there - I bet.It is sad to see that some have fallen into disrepair, but the guide said that sometimes families die out, and there is no one to pay for the upkeep. While there we saw keepers inside of tombs, dusting, polishing, painting, plastering the tombs that have paying families. In the case of the falling apart tombs - because they are private property, the government cannot take them over. There is no rule that allows the government to do that in BA. The only thing they will do is put up scaffolding or caution tape to keep people away from falling tombs. Interestingly, families who are still around but don't care about the upkeep or who have lost their genealogy are missing out on a gold mine. According to the guide, if the tomb \"account\" is in arrears, a family member who can claim lineage can pay up the account, clear out the caskets (cremate them), then sell the crypt to someone else for a fortune. \"New\" families come in and rebuild the crypts. Argentinians should tap into Ancestry.com! Maybe your great-great-great-great-great grandparents are there, holding on to your inheritance!Anyway, a good, safe walk that is very interesting. Take a tour, learn about the place and the history, then hit one of the cafes nearby afterward to rest your feet and have a coffee or cold drink. This is not to be missed - and really it is NOT morbid, it is a fascinating history lesson."

Sure, you're meant to be sad and perhaps experience a bit of fear about your own mortality, but these wealthy departed spent a great deal of money to show you how fantastic they were and you could at least entertain their vanity. Do it for them!Seriously, though, it's beautiful. I could spend hours in here looking at all the statues and the buildings and you should, too.

One of the great Stone Gardens of the world, this city cemetery is now nearing its 200th year and houses the notables of Argentine society, one of whom - Eva Peron - garners most of the present day tourist attention. Take a guided tour offered by a local: these are Portenos looking to augment income and - in my experience - give more in the way of information than they are \"typically\" recompensed by their tourist clientele. The layout of the cemetery is like to a village, the side streets offering just enough clearence for foot trafic alone, wherein each of the masoleums is a small or larger dwelling housing its inhabitants mortal remains. My favorite casita is that of Lois Angel Fripo, the heavyweight known as El Toro Salvaje de las Pampas ( The Wild bull of the Pampas ) who in 1923 - though knocked to the canvas seven times in the first round - recovered to knock Jack Dempsey from the ring before secumbing to \"The Manassa Mauler\" in a 2nd round knockout. Take that Eva! Have your picture taken in muscular pose with his imposing stone figure. And once you've taken in Recoleta Cemetery, I highly recommend a trip To La Chacarita Cemetery in Bario Chacarita. Here is a magnificent city of stone with broad avenues and also the resting place of one of the truly great luminaries of Argentine society: Carlos Gardel! Have your picture taken in a Tango pose in front of his statue, and, if so inclined as many Argentines, place a cigarette between his fingers."

La Recoleta Cemetery is different, though.A cemetery of the rich classes (in Spanish known as Familias Patricias), with a European feel, very different from all cemeteries. Impressive. Some tombs look like palaces, temples or mansions. Entry is free. You can either buy a map with the cemetery\u2019s history and the description of selected grave sites to help support the restoration society to preserve this historical treasure or take a guided tour.It may sound weird to say that one enjoys a cemetery, but La Recoleta is not only a graveyard. It is much more than that: it is an open door museum, a History lesson, an Art lesson, a Cemetery-Museum, where you will feel no creepiness. Quite on the contrary, you can get a perspective of time and experience a living piece of history.The scale and grandeur of the mausoleums and tombs vary. The cemetery is a showcase of architectural styles. You can take a peek through the windows or doors of some mausoleums. If you dare do so, the reward will be beautiful stained glass windows, among other surprises (Rosas\u2019 coffin wrapped in an Argentinian Flag, for example!). The alleys between the graves are like a labyrinth so you can easily get lost. However, the place is always full of people so you can get help if needed.The main attraction and the big draw is the last resting place of Evita Peron. There are many other more interesting tombs, though. Take a look at some of the Argentinian Presidents\u2019 tombs (Marcelo T. de Alvear, Illia, Roca, Alfons\u00edn, Mitre, Sarmiento, Yrigoyen), San Martin\u2019s parents and wife are also buried there (San Martin is our National Hero). Many famous writers are buried here too: Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (famous by his book Mart\u00edn Fierro), Paul Groussac, Adolfo Bioy Casares, among many others. Alberdi (the writer of our Constitution), and many, many other renown personalities. Even the most amateur of photographers will be delighted by the cemetery\u2019s unique & gorgeous architecture. Still in use today, it will sure be an open mouth experience. Although it is not a lighthearted adventure you will simply get a feeling of opulence of the upper class in Bs. As. Take time to look up, down, and from different angles to really enjoy the beauty and majesty of the place. Take one thing for sure: you could visit La Recoleta Cemetery many times and always see something you didn't see before. Even if cemeteries don\u2019t ring a bell on you or you are not into cemeteries, don\u2019t miss it. It will be time spent worthwhile."

I wished we could have gone back another day when the light was right so we could have gotten better photos. I found an angel monument that is a replica of a statue that I bought a framed, hand-colored photo of at an arts fair here in Columbus. The original statue is in a cemetery in France, so I understand, and the statue there has glass eyes, which makes you feel like it's actually watching you. Creepy, but in a good way. The cemetery has a colony of cats living in it- we were lucky enough to see several of them- one jumping from top to top of a couple of the monuments! We took some cat food to donate to the woman who feeds the cats, which we were told she has been doing for many years. You can tour the grounds for free or hire a guide at the entrance for a small fee if you want more details or to perhaps help you find Eva Peron's burial site. A hauntingly beautiful place."

The tour was less than expected. It was large, the guide difficult to understand and soft spoken which with the size of the group made it very hard to hear and since she spoke with such a thick accent I was already straining for comprehension. Regardless, I would recommend the tour as it filled in some of the story that goes with the visuals of the cemetery. I would recommend also just wandering and going for a bit on your own away from a large group so that you can really experience it and notice the small details of the crypts that are easily missed in a larger tour."

We visited on a chilly but sunny afternoon. Several school groups and tourists wandered the paths. Otherwise, only two security guards at the gate, a few maintenance workers and a bunch of lounging cats shared the cemetery with us. The tombs are truly works of art and come in many different shapes, sizes and styles. Some of them are quite grand, others are smaller and quite a few need serious maintenance. The cemetery itself is beautiful with a few tree lined paths that soften all of the marble, stone and concrete tombs. Surprisingly, many of the tombs showoff the caskets holding the dead. Many have glass doors giving you full access to see what is inside. The larger tombs have what could be considered a place of worship at or above ground level with stairs leading to a basement full of caskets. In some cases the glass has broken and dust, dirt, plants and trash sit with the bodies. It is sad to think that some families spent so much to build these monuments only to have them disintegrate due to lack of care."

The attraction of course is the last resting place of Evita Peron. After I\u2019ve read a lot about the life of this well-known woman, I was curious to see this cemetery. The mausoleums are impressive, often opulent and a strange sight to those not used to this burial method. Beautiful statues and inscriptions often allow some insight to the impact important individuals had on the shaping of the country. Some mausoleums allow a peek through windows or doors and the reward can be a beautiful stained glass window to photograph against the outside light. The alleys between the graves are like a labyrinth and one can easily get lost especially if you are looking for a specific family site. At the entrance of the graveyard there is a guide map to all the residents. Although an eery place to visit, it was time spent worthwhile. As always, keep some change ready to use the well-maintained public toilets or face a grumpy stare!"

Each time, I wander in a new direction, and get a new perspective on the past and present, and take in beautiful sculptures. In the U.S., where I'm from, we visit cemeteries when the bad news strikes, then, perhaps, on Christmas or a birthday. Recoleta marks time gone by and a great respect for those past by inviting visitors to visit Evita's final resting place and getting to know some of Argentina's lesser known families. It's a picture taker's dream, and the wild cats that guard the place aren't as intimidating as they sound- often doing the familiar belly rolls for tourists (as they are fed daily by doting \"cat ladies\"- there isn't a skinny one in the lot) to get a scratch on the tummy.Place your skepticism aside and visit; it's a place of beauty."

One had a glass door so you could look inside to a mess of cobwebs with moldy, crumbly stone stairs going down to an underground sarcophagus. This cemetery is well worth the trip. You should also see the small church ajacent.For those with mobility challenges -- get the attention of one of the people at the entrance and they will lead you to a door near the steps and you can get it without going up several steps and then back down again to get into the cemetery. There are no handrails on the steps. The guards were very glad to help us out. It's flat inside the cemetary."

They wanted to be buried in grand style and they wanted everyone to know it!The sculptures, the statues, the friezes and most of all, above everything for me, the stained glass inside the crypts are too amazing for words. This is a life's history done in marble with wonderful artistic flair. Not all crypts are over the top and quite a number are in a very bad state of disrepair, but even with that being said they do have a tragic elegance to them.The overall feel of reflection and quietness still surrounds you while you take in these works of art.

Having seen nothing like this in my life, I was totally in awe of the amazing architecture and the grandness of this cemetery and enjoyed wondering through it. As much as I enjoyed this, it did make my stomach a little churned at the end, just visually being able to see the coffins stacked on top of one another and then seeing mother and baby coffins., reality shock!! Eva's family crypt was hard to get a photo as it was so crowded but it is very plain, at her request, she didn't want anything fancy, according to our guide. This is really amazing, I recommend that everyone in this beautiful city visits this attraction."

Evita's Mausoleum is Plebean, as was her family ( Duarte ), this is not to say it is not nice, not suitable, perhaps for a First Lady. As a cemetery Buff, above ground burials ( i.e. Mausoleums ) are not unusual. New Orleans has some, Charleston SC, etc. Savannah GA ( St. Boneventure is far more impressive, Spanish Moss, and some wonderful lyrics on benches, etc.). I would recommend, however, a visit to the adjoining Monastery where one might get a lovely view of Recoleta from 2 stories up and chance to see Alabaster Window panes ( this Tourist had not seen them before ) and a few other interesting wall decorations.While in the area, you may try to find some Empenadas ( flaky crust, sorta like a Pierogie, with cheese, beef, or chicken inside ). Unfortunately, the best place I can recommend is next to a Leather Store 3 blocks away... Lunch with Beer for 3, under $30. US."

Evita's resting place is far from the most expensive or impressive, but somehow this adds to its mystique. This is a great place to take a leisurely stroll down \"avenues\" and alleyways and to consider, as we often do in graveyards, what misadventures and scandals may have brought some of Recoleta's 'residents' here."

In some ways it reminds me of the cemeteries in New Orleans, but this is a more grand scale. It is free to go it, but they also offer a map guide for 10 pesos. If you don't have a guide, it is a good thing to purchase as it helps to point out where significant figures are buried. If you do not know much about Argentine or Buenos Aires history, most of the names will not mean a thing, but it does not matter. If you know a little Spanish, you can sometimes figure out why someone was important. The tombs are amazing architectural wonders in many cases and run the gamut from marble masoleums to more contempory structures built in the 1970s. The reason that most people come to visit is to see the grave of Eva Peron which is just tucked away in the middle of one of the rows with no extraordinary fanfare. You can generally find it by looking for a line of people or a ton of flowers tucked into the door. But you should take the time and walk up and down the rows. You will be astounded. The statuary is better than you will find in some museums. As one other reveiwer said some of the crypts are in horrible shape. It is sad that for whatever reason the families of thise people have forgotten them. It reminded us of a phrase that we use at Lent in our Episcopal Church: \"Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.\""

Evita lies there, finally, with many plaques proclaiming her greatness.

It\u2019s in bronze, unlike most of the statues that were marble. And it had a Tim Burton-esque feel to her mausoleum, so it\u2019s quite unique within the cemetery.

One is the tomb of the Paz family, who owned the newspaper La Prensa, as well as the palatial building on Plaza San Mart\u00edn now known as the C\u00edrculo Militar. It is an enormous black stone structure covered with white marble angels in turn-of-the-20th-century dress. The angels seem to soar to the heavens, lifting the spirit of those inside with their massive wings. The sculptures were all made in Paris and shipped here. Masonic symbols such as anchors and pyramid-like shapes adorn this as well as many other Recoleta tombs.Another tomb I recommend seeing is that of Rufina Cambaceres, a young woman who was buried alive in the early 1900s. She had perhaps suffered a coma, and a few days after her interment, workers heard screams from the tomb. When it was opened, there were scratches on her face and on the coffin from her attempts to escape. Her mother then built this Art Nouveau masterpiece, which has become a symbol of the cemetery. Her coffin is a Carrara marble slab, carved with a rose on top, and it sits behind a glass wall, as if her mother wanted to make up for her mistake in burying her and ensure she could see her coffin if she were ever to come back again. The corner of the tomb is adorned by a young girl carved of marble who turns her head to those watching her; she looks as if she is about to break into tears, and her right hand is on the door of her own tomb. Many locals often place delicate sprigs of flowers into her hand."

We had a very long tour with Raul who gave us an extensive and very interesting overview of Argentina history and the various (and most impressive) monuments. I would urge you to take a tour guide as most of the people who visit the site only look for Evita Peron\u2019s monument which is not that impressive in comparison to the entire site. Raul was able to take us to the right places and add the commentary and draw our intention to the details which are unique for each of the monuments.In a nutshell, highly recommended and a tour guide is a must!

The cemetery is free, but there are \"volunteers\" outside who will draw you a map and talk to you for a few minutes, then ask for a donation to a local charity. We got caught by one of these volunteers, who have name tags and look official, and we were guilted into donating. You can walk right by them if you want, because the cemetery is free. You can also purchase a map of the cemetery for 8 pesos, but it is not really necessary. The main sites are easy to find, there is a large map just inside the main gate, and you can find Evita easily by following the crowds."

It highlights the graves of note and was useful when we wanted to navigate our way back to the entrance. But don't just wander to points of interest, and from one famous crypt to another. Spend some time, look up - there are some impressive statuary on top of some of the crypts, look in - there are some beautiful shrines and stained glass windows within some, and look down as in some of the crypts you can see into the basements containing ornate and fabric draped coffins. Its an amazing place, this city for the dead."

Many of the tombs and edifices of what are essentially the aristocracy and leaders of Argentina/BA are truly magnificent (Eva Peron\u2019s included).The Recoleta cemtery certainly ranks up there with eg the American war cemetery in Normandy in terms of \u201cimpressiveness\u201d of cemeteries.

The cemetery is so large that I felt I didn't get to see enough the first visit two years before so back in I went. First off, a great value as it is free entry. There was a lady selling cemetery maps at the entrance. At first I declined but then I found out it was for the cemetery restoration and only $2. Can't beat that and want to give a little back to the places I visit. A great place to wander alone in and out of the different alleyways. First time I visited Eva Peron gravesite but not this time, too many people and there are many other graves to see and take time with. Really a must see and give yourself a lot of time (2-4 hours) if you are a photographer as a I am."

All tourists to B.A. come here to see the crypt of Eve Peron, who still holds a soft spot in the average Argentine's heart. Aside from the rumors, she did have a good effect on society, all in favor of the working classes. If you come here, bear in mind that she is actually buried in the family crypt, Not the Peron crypt ... her family name is Duarte, so look for that name on the doorway. There will be map sellers at the entrance (free entry ... but beggars will ask for money) but don't buy one. Just follow the tourist groups and they will lead you directly to where you want to go to see the Duarte crypt. As for the rest ... just wander about and see what's there. Very interesting."

Its a nice sized cemetery but in no way will you get lost. I should restate that; your going to get lost and its kind of the appeal. But its pretty easy to find your way out. They have free maps at the entrance that mark the more significant people who reside there but not even that is needed.

It is also interesting to see the variety of tombs and the varying state of repair - from polished coffins and fresh flowers to broken dusty vaults with a few bones sticking out. There is also a bargain basement on the principle of a warehouse shelf with the several boxes built in. Some of the vaults are stunning and the Cemetery is testimony to the importance of family life in Argentina. Certainly a place not to be missed"

On exploring the graveyard it is easy to walk past the tomb as it is nothing spectacular compared to some of the tombs. in fact it is quite hard to locate without some guidance. We were given a number to find her grave but that didn't help as we could not work out any order in the way the tombs were laid out. In the end we found it by looking where the crowds were going! "

A lot of money has been spent on these family tombs - some are spectacular. We were not expecting the place to be so wonderful. An absolute gem of a site. Entrance is free, but you are asked for a small donation and you get a map of the site."

You may be asking, \"What is so interesting about visiting a cemetary?\" This cemetary is full of the most architecturally beautiful mausoleums you have ever seen. Many of them are pieces of art, worthy of being in any museum. As we learned on our tour, well-to-do Buenos Aires residents at the turn-of-the-last-century would build a beautiful home to live in first and a beautiful mausoleum \"for their eternal life\" second. You really do have to see it to believe it. If you visit on a Saturday or Sunday, one of the city's best arts/crafts fair is set up in the huge park in front of the cemetary.

A few months later I went back to the site after having heard about it from various other people, and having learned about some of the people buried there (Eva Peron, for instance) and their significance. I enjoyed my second trip much more. Pay Attention to the Details!! The graves are spectacular and their layout is also impeccable. Make sure you go in between the graves when you can there is interesting history and sculptures in every nook and cranny. People are ACTUALLY buried there and some of them are people who have profoundly shaped Argentine history, politics, and culture. It is an amazing and recommended site."

As I wandered around this graveyard with its elaborate tombs of people who were once VIPs but are now mostly all but forgotten---with 2 or 3 exceptions for now, it makes one think. Unfortunately, when I think about these things, I rarely come up with actual answers, so it can be a bit depressing. Many of the tombs are beautiful, but rather than coming away with an idea to emulate them, I concluded that it was all fairly useless, and that I might as well leave my assets when I die to my kids, than blow them on a monument. (If my kids had any inkling that this was my conclusion, they'd pack me off weekly to other cemetaries, so don't tell them!) I suppose there are a couple other reactions you might have. Some will blow through, just check out Evita's tomb and move on. Cool enough if it fits. Others will look at the beauty of the tombs, take 2 or 3 hours, and think of legacy, essentially those with much more faith than me. If it helps you connect with god, I'm envious, as it only helped me connect with dust-to-dust. I thought this was worth doing, but I wouldn't want to do it too often."

The Cemetery of Recoleta was opened in 1822 and houses the most important protagonists of Argentine history - presidents, politicians, soldiers, statesmen, writers, poets, there are 4,800 tombs distributed in a area of 54 000 m\u00b2.But undoubtedly the most famous tomb is of Eva Peron. Evita, who died in 1952 and had her body stolen and hidden in a graveyard in Milan in 1971. It had her body moved to Spain and only in 1974, it was brought back to Argentina.But do not forget to visit the Familia Paz mausoleum - the founder of the newspaper La Prensa. It is a black granite mausoleum with white marble sculptures of angels, Those sculptures were made in Paris. It also has many symbols of Freemasonry - is considered by many the most beautiful.And for those who like urban legends, an account that young Rufina Cambaceres was buried after a supposed sudden death. It is said that after a few days after her death, the employee who took care of the mausoleum of Cambaceres noticed that the lid of the tomb Rufina was broken and the coffin was moved, when he opened it he found her all scratched in an attempt to escape. In fact, she had suffered an attack of catalepsy, and therefore having died asphyxiated. Her mother built a mausoleum in Art Nouveau, with a tomb of Carrara marble, it has a rose engraved and sits behind a glass wall - as if her mother wanted to see her if she would return again. Other residents are also found in this cemetery. About 84 cats live there and are maintained by a group of volunteers women .The entrance to the cemetery is free. It is open every day from 7 am to 18 pm. A kiosk at the entrance you can buy a map for 8 pesos, but it isn't worth buying as the most famous tombs are easy to find - and it is more interesting to walk aimlessly through them.Amen!"

The juxtoposition of the two makes for a great experience. It's a little off-putting to consider that you are photographing tombs and meandering through the final resting place of BA's elite. But once you acknowledge that, and move on, it's a cool experience. The main attraction is Eva Peron's tomb (Familia Duarte). You won't miss it, just follow the droves of people and stop when you get to the tomb with constantly fresh flowers.In summary, this is a beautiful cemetery and is worth 15 minutes or 2 hours of your time.

However to get the best out of it, I recommend one of the free guided tours in English that take place at 11am from the main entrance on Tuesday's and Thursdays. You get to hear about the history of the cemetery and stories about some of its incumbents. The tour lasts just short of 2 hours."

Sure, I'd read about the Recoleta Cemetery before my trip to Buenos Aires ... but nothing prepared me for the enormity and intricacy of this historic place. While it was sort of interesting seeing the tomb of Eva Peron (the biggest \"draw\" there), the real fun came from wandering the \"streets\" and admiring the architecture and artwork of the thousands of tombs. This place is a photographer's dream."

We bought a map and of course went to see Evita's mausoleum, but we did not know many of the other Argentinean poets/politicians/etc. buried here so we just wandered around, taking pictures of interesting monuments/mausoleums, and playing with several of the cats that live here. If you are a cat lover, like I am, this is a must stop for you. The cats are being cared for by an old lady that lives nearby and her staff (she's now too old to do the rounds herself). I petted several of them. Some are cautious, while others are super friendly. Definitely visit and give them some love.There is no entry fee. Bathrooms are very basic."

We were staying near there and so wandered in on our first evening. It is amazing but with little information on site and the maps really only say who's buried where, it left us a bit cold. We went back on the afternoon walking tour run by BA Walking Tours (www.ba-walking-tours.com) and it was a completely different experience. We were told the sad, gruesome and occasionally funny stories behind the graves. Our guide was fantastic as was the rest of the afternoon tour which runs for a bit over two hours, of which the first hour is in the Cemetery. Our guide gave us a great insights into Argentina, that we'd really not understood till that point in time. We did this on our last afternoon and if we'd been staying longer we would definitely have done their morning walking tour as well."

It was Saturday morning, and very hot, and when we got to the cemetery, we could see it was very crowded (people who went in said it was so jammed it was hard to walk down many of the \"streets.\") So we stayed at the bus. (Weekends, we were told, tend to be extremely crowded, especially in the summer.) We took a taxi back to the cemetery on Monday morning. It was delightful to walk through (no crowds at all) and to sit on a bench and observe the visitors. When we left, we went straight out across the little plaza in front, and to the cafe - La Biela - that is under the huge gum tree - for a shaded, excellent lunch. The inside dining room is fine too, but if it's good weather, having breakfast, coffee, or lunch on the outdoor terrace is a treat."

Some date back hundreds of years and they are beautiful and extremely ornate - there's one we saw with a mosaic inside the dome; many have stained-glass windows; and they can be as much as 40 or so feet tall! Each tomb is different and you could easily spend all day wandering around here admiring the details and art, because they really are works of art. Admission to the cemetery is free, and there will be people selling maps outside the entrance for around 6 Argentine pesos. With that, it is easy to find the tomb of Eva Peron, who is the cemetery's most famous resident. There are also many Argentine leaders in the cemetery, and the map includes several tombs that might be of interest to individuals with more than a cursory knowledge of Argentina's history. And the cemetery was large enough that it didn't seem crowded when we were there (except for around Eva's grave), even though there were a decent number of people there. Definitely go to Cementerio de la Recoleta when in Buenos Aires!"

It is located in the Recoleta district, which is a hill.It is the most fascinating place to spend time in this city. All the tombs are pieces of art.The sculptures on the crypts are so beautiful that you wish to be buried right then and there. There are tombs for very famous Argentinians, like Duarte family-Eva Peron, etc. You have to be really wealthy to afford such a grave. Please don't skip any of them, take your time to see the personal belongings, pictures inside the crypts.You may find most of them have open doors.it is for the family members to come in and pray. Some of them are really dilapidated, which means there are no family members left to take care of them and some of them are in immaculate condition as if the deceased was placed there yesterday. You can check the board at the entrance to find English speaking tours. The best bet is to sign on with the free walking tours of Buenos Aires and visit the entire area with a guide."

There was a lot about the sightseeing that reminded us of places we'd been in Europe. One absolutely distinctive thing, though was Recoleta. It feels a bit weird to be recommending a cemetery as a must-see, but after wandering the countless alleys - we left saying this was undoubtedly a unique view into the history of BA. As you wonder at the grandioseness of most and the simplicity of some, the meticulous upkeep we saw next to the sheer decay of others, poets next to politicians next to business people. It's a historical m\u00e9lange that plays itself out very well for a half-day visit. Grab some empanadas and tamales afterwards at El Sanjuanino on Calle Posados"

I just followed the crowd to Evita's grave which was straight into the middle of the place then turn left about 3/4 into the cemetery. It is in the family name of Duarte and can survive a nuclear bomb with trap doors so no one can steal her body (again). The whole place is all crypts and no headstones, so it very different than what you are used to seeing in America. You can peep in the crypts and actually see caskets, which freaked me out a bit. It is a great place to wander around and take pictures. The place is open 10am- 5:50pm. Don't miss it when you are in Buenos Aires."

In order to help me find out as much information, I have taken 6 different tours of the Cemetery. Each one has offered me a new piece of information. There are so many interesting stories in the cemetery. The woman that was buried alive is the crowd pleaser. And all the political legends and finsters buried side by side. There is no cemetery like in the world. On my first visit, I was simply amazed at the architecture and visual treat that it was and had a hard time remembering the stories behind the tombs. There are free tours of the cemetery offered twice a week. I took both of them, each from a different tour guide. The first one was very entertining however I almost felt embarassed for the young women who clearly has a future in drama. The second one was very dead pan (no pun intended) but some good info. I hired a private tour guide for 25$USD, and found that tour to be overpriced but still, I learned about about the architecture of the cemetery. One of the last tours I took was for 30 pesos (10USD). It included both Recoleta and the Cemetery. I really learned the most here and was able to ask questions and explore and enjoy myself. It was a private tour. Just me and the guide. Very fun and entertinaing and great ideas for my book. The cats of the cemetery included. Found it here - Tango-History-ToursThere are many good tours of the Cemetery. If you search around a little you can find a real bargin. But no matter what you do, you should take a tour. Because there is simply so many treasures buried there, that you will never discover unless you spend days and days of researching."

One day I decided to go and check out the Recoleta Cemetery to see what all the fuss was about.It was beautiful certainly, but I was a little bored because I had no idea who any of the people were with their names on the tombs, apart from Evita, but then I didn\u00b4t really know much about her apart from the fact that Madonna played her in a movie. So I got a little bored very quickly, and after a while started to walk out. On the way out I noticed a board saying there were free cemetery tours, and luckily one of them was due to start in half an hour. I waited around, and some other tourists gathered, but half an hour after the tour was due to start, still no sign of a tour guide. We were all a little annoyed at that point, so asked around to see if anyone knew what had happened, but no one knew anything. So I left the cemetery at that.HOWEVER, that night I got talking to a guy in the Kilkenny pub who happened to be a tour guide for an English Walking Tours company. I didn't know this at first, and started to tell him about my cemetery experience and how I thought it was a little boring. He told me about his job and persuaded me to come on the tour the next day, claiming he would bring the cemetery to life with interesting stories of the famous people buried there, plus also the tour would include a section on the rest of Recoleta, the most stylish area of Buenos Aires apparently.So I took his tour the next day at 11am, and it was fantastic. Just 20 pesos, he even turned up on time where he was supposed to unlike the free tour theday before! They were daily scheduled tours so there were 4 other people on it, but that was fine as they all seemed nice and the tour guide, Thom, made sure we all felt included. He showed us some great places to shop, eat and go out at night in Recoleta along the way to the cemetery, which although I couldn\u00b4t afford, all looked very nice, and I will definitely return one day when I am rich and famous!The famous people in the cemetery had some really interesting stories about them too, and the tour guide really did bring them to life with some funny jokes too. So I recommend that to get the most out of Recoleta and the Cemetery that you take an organised walking tour from that company, whose web address is Buenostours.That way, I hope you enjoy the cemetery and recoleta as much as I did, eventually!"

We decided to go to Recoleta on our own and stroll around the cemetery. Outside the front entrance a young woman handed us a very nice and free map of the cemetery. A young man who was with her handed us a tract about Aids and explained that he has Aids and would we like to donate to help Aids patients. My husband handed him a few pesos. We then proceeded to use the map to navigate our way around to some of the main mausoleums. Once we entered the cemetery there were several people who offered to be guides but we turned them down. They were not pushy at all.We enjoyed wandering around the tombs. It was interesting to see how people had competed to see who could have the most impressive memorial. It was also surprising to see that others are neglected and even have trash thrown in them. The photos I am posting with this review are located in the center of the spoke where number 44 is. It is a shady spot where we were able to rest for a few minutes on a bench.I would recommend going to the cemetery. It is possible to go for a casual tour such as we did or get a more in depth tour once you get there. These options are available for those who want to be flexible in their plans."

I highly recommend that folks who want to see and hear a little more than Evita\u00b4s burial try to get the english tour. I think they only give it one or two days a week, presently one of those days is Thursday at 11 (or 11:30). Your hotel can call to confirm. The volunteer guide (Florence) had was very enthusiastic and entertaining.2nd tip that may appear elsewhere - across from Cemetary, along the sidewalk cafes, there is Etoile Hotel. They have a little bar with sun terrace on 14th floor, and you can ride up and get a drink and look out over an amazing view. I also highly recommend that."

Everyone heads to Evita's tomb (which is nothing to write home about), then just wander round aimlessly.

My first visit was on a sunny day (shortly after Christmas 2005) and many tourists were walking around looking for Evita's tomb. Evita's family tomb is beautiful but not outstanding or memorable. I visited again a couple days later by myself on a rainy day. It was quiet and almost ghostly. No other tourists were around. Many tombs have glass doors so you can see inside. The coffins are on shelves and sometimes decorated with religious items. Some tombs have stained glass, many had elaborate and amazing statues. In one area I saw a lot of stray cats sitting in the doorways to avoid the rain. I have to admit that I creeped myself out when walking in narrow paths with tombs surrounding me. It really was an incredible experience.   My mother and I stayed at the Alvear Palace a few blocks from the cemetery. Alvear is the most elegant and sophisticated hotel I have ever stayed in. It is quite expensive, but I recommend it to anyone who wants to vacation in luxury. Although I was in Buenos Aires for almost a week, I felt like I didn't see anything because the city is so impressive. I highly recommend staying in the Recoleta neighborhood."
