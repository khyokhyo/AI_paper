We arrived on Saturday night so it was nice to find a church with an English mass near the resort where we stayed at. It was a full house when we went and it was heartwarming."

Lots of people were arriving, and a lot had to stay outside, but also taking part of the ceremony. The surprise was that when we got outside, the illumination of the church was so beautiful! Not really a big one, but really cute. As mexican people are very catholic practising, the ceremony was nice and full of energy; devout."

It is tiny; it has about 80 seats total so get there early for a seat. each pew seats 4 tightly. The 10 am mass is suppose to be in English but there was only one reading in English and the rest in Spanish; still it was lovely. This church is on 5th Ave and the main cross street so it is easy to find - right near the beach. Would definitely go again if in the area!"

We noticed a few tables of locals selling items and among the locals, there was a couple of tables that were tended by nuns. I was thinking that was pretty cool that the nuns had some very nice hand crafted items to sell, but looking beyond the nuns, there was a church right behind them! I couldnt help but think, along with all of these people, local and tourist, live music playing, and a beautiful beach in the backround was this little church! The doors were open and noticed a few people inside, so we went inside. It was Saturday night, and the people inside were locals participating in a prayer service, so we joined them for a moment. There are a few photos inside of wedding ceremonys that have been performed at this church, and with the closed end of the church being one large window, and the beach in plain view, the vows are given in this setting. Simply fantastic! Make a point to check out this little gem, you wont be sorry."

It was amazing to be walking 5th Avenue and see such a beautiful little church in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of life passing by. It made you stop and take a breath and be reminded of what's important in life. And when passing by, they were having a service inside with the doors open so anyone could participate, so inviting. I am not Catholic but a photographer instead so I walked around the outside taking photos and loved the stark contrast of the white building next to the green palm trees. Such a beautiful little place!"

The service was like our services in Connecticut so we were able to take part using English. For the offertory we saw many small donations in the basket and added our $20 US too. A beautiful elderly woman seated next to us look us in the eye and smiled from ear to ear. We strongly recommend taking in a service and commune with such wonderful Christians."

The chapel is a beautiful, simple place of worship that welcomes all. The 10 am Mass is usually half in English and half in Spanish depending on the priest. Many of the priests that say Mass are visitors themselves and are always extremely friendly. It is worth a short visit to just step in on any day at any time of day for a few moments of reflection."

Once for Ash Wednesday and then for Sunday mass which was in English. The church is small and was packed, standing room only so get there early if you want a seat. I was very staying at Playacar Palace which is within walking distance to the church. If you're in the area and want to just stop in for a prayer or meditation the doors are open and I would recommend it. If you want to attend mass I highly recommend this quaint, welcoming church.I will be going back to Playa del Carmen again this year and will definetely be attending mass here."

Not noteworthy if you are looking for some good pictures or a church with architectural significance. Parishoners were friendly. Service was 95% in Spanish."

Virtually every commercial establishment permits you to pay in pesos or USD. For almost every transaction made, I found out that if you make a quick calculation, one alternative is better than another. Here is what to do: Take USD with you and use a debit card that does not charge a fee and also reimburses you for any third party charges. The savings really add up. I saved about $40 just on the hotel bill."

Its hard to miss this little white church while in Playa del Carmen as it certainly stands out amongst all the bars and shops. Just past the church, behind it, is one of the main entrances to the beach itself with a nice monument arch. The church itself is small and quaint, very reverent and peaceful feeling upon stepping inside. Although we didn't stay for a Mass, I can see this church being a nice place to take in a Mass while on vacation."

Benito Juarez and Quinta Avenida, but we ended up here instead...the challenges of our first venture out while in Mexico. The church was beautiful, vibrantly decorated inside. We went to 10am mass, which was predominantly in Spanish, altough the first reading was in English. There was an English translation of the mass available, but it was easier to follow the Spanish missal. At the end of mass, many people pressed forward toward the altar...unusual in our experience. The priest and the deacon sprinkled the congregation with holy water and gave a blessing, and it was great to see the families come forward.I suspect that we had a more authentic experience of a parish than if we had gone to the Chapel by the beach. Most of the pictures appear to be of the Chapel, not the Parish."

You walk in right off busy 5th Avenue and are immediately hit with an uncanny sense of peace and serenity. The feeling you get when you walk into this chapel really cannot be described...it just is.

It was a neat and surprising outpost in a bustling, touristy neighborhood.

He was very friendly and made the ceremony fun and had everyone smiling and laughing. I did not have a wedding coordinator and I took care of all the paperwork with the help of Carmita. She was available to answer all my questions, which were many! It does help if you speak Spanish to get a faster response from her, but even if you do not, she does ask someone to reply to you. She also suggested a few vendors which I ended up using, such as the florists and mariachis. There were three weddings scheduled the day I got married (including mine) and I ended up sharing the ceremony flowers with the other two brides. You can ask Carmita for the contact person or ask her to send your information to them so you can discuss sharing the flowers. It was very cost effective and the flowers turned out beautiful! The flowers used at the ceremony have to be left behind, since they're viewed as an offering, so sharing the flowers is the way to go. I was very happy with the wedding ceremony and I'm very happy we choose this chapel."

At the moment of offering the peace of the Lord he went around to very single person in the church to give them the peace of the Lord. It was so beautiful and impressive. The church itself is breathtaking, small but glorious. Although sunday non mass was packed, the peace felt was refreshing.You definitely must visit and plan to stay a while to pray and contemplate God's beauty and if you can, attend mass you will be happy you did!!"

After mass began a young woman (around 18-20) wearing a canary yellow dress walked to the front of the pulpit and a bench was placed there to make her the focal point. At the homily the priest came and sat beside her and spoke(in Spanish) directly to her. Many people then brought her flowers and small gifts. Many pictures were taken. I sure wish I understood Spanish....our best guess...it she was entering a convent. But that IS just a guess. Try and visit this church near Christmas or Easter as they decorate it so nicely. youw ill be welcome there anytime you go."

            "review": "Nice place for Mass. We enjoy going to Mass with locals when traveling, so sought out this church. The Sunday evening Mass seems to the the most popular. The church is full of young families, older couples, and residents and some tourists, a nice mix. The mass I went to was in Spanish, but you can check their schedule for English masses. The church is easy to find in Playa, a few streets off 5th Avenue."

Wonderful music. There is a glass wall behind the atlar overlooking the beach, palms, and the sea (you may be easily distracted:)\nThe prist spoke fluent English. Highly recommended!"

Gives mass in a short, sweet, simple and concise fashion without beating around the bushes and makes it enjoyable and spiritual. The chapel is just the right size, not too big or not to small. Has air conditioning. The view is to the sea and nature. Great location at the start of 5th avenue! "

They provide you English versions of the readings so you can follow along. It was very warm as there is no air conditioning, so if you can sit near the door it will be cooler."
