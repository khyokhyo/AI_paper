It was really easy to navigate to the building and find the very short queue for bag check and the get the elevator up to the ?42nd floor. The views are basically 360 (a small portion blocked by a gift store) and even though overcast you could make out the silhouette of mt. Fuji! They also had little pictorial explanations of all the major buildings/sites so you could identify them. There is gift show with things from all the different regions of Japan and a bar which we had a beer at while waiting for it to become properly dark. The bar is pretty overpriced I think but the view is free so I can't complain!"

You have a 360-degree view of Tokyo (on a reasonably clear day otherwise you will just see the fog and the mist). Entry is free which is a bonus. You can visit the north and the south towers going up to the 45th floor. After viewing and taking your photos, you can enjoy a light lunch or coffee whist enjoying the view. The grounds outside, and surrounding street offer exceptional photo taking opportunities of the famous Sky Scrapers."

The queue to go up is not very long during weekdays and its one of the very few observation towers with free entrance. There are 2 souvenir kiosk on the observation floor selling good variety of things esp for kids. Don't eat at the restaurant on the observation deck. Go back down and get a visitor pass from security and make your way up to the 38th floor cafeteria via the main building elevators. All orders are done via vending machines after you preview the plastic sample dishes and food pick up at the different stalls. Cheap and good is how I would describe the menu. Lunch is before 2pm, after which only light meals."

I submitted a review of the Tokyo Tower, and feel I need to compare it to the Metropolitan Government Office.The TMGO, first of all, is a free attraction. Visitors go to the bottom level of this building, and enter a line to an elevator. (I had difficulty finding this building. It's rather nondescript and in an area with many sky scrapers. I used a GPS to find it and was thankful I had it.Okay, so after a brief security check (searching through bags) you are allowed on the elevator, and travel up to the top. The views are really great, but you couldn't see the whole city (I mean, it's huge, right?)The best part was seeing Mt. Fuji!! I could not see it from the Tokyo Tower. Note that Mt. Fuji is not always visible- and we just were fortunate!The windows didn't seem as big as those in TT. There are thicker, more visible beams, and more people crowd around them. But hey- it's a free exhibit, so no complaints.There is a gift shop in the center, and a (sit down?) restaurant. These made it a bit harder to walk around the perimeter to see views.All in all, the views were really cool and I'm happy I went. If you're in the area, try to check this out."

We got to the building around 7p.m, construction was taking place outside so we had to walk through some building works, as we got to the building we were met by a kind security guard who pointed us to bag search and then to the elevator to take us up to the top. It wasn't too crowded, this must be because not many tourists know about this place but tend to go for Skytree instead for a good view. At the viewing floor you can also find two small souvenir shops, the view is great and you have a good panoramic view over Tokyo. We stayed there for about an hour. This place is a short walk from Shinjuku station, about 7min walk (if you take the right exit).

The North Observatory stays open until 10 pm. There's NO ENTRY FEE to go up and check the city out. They will check your bags for dangerous items before entering the elevator, though. Despite it being for free the line to get up was actually way shorter than for the Skytree. We visited Saturday or Sunday evening/night and waited only for about a quarter of an hour. If you want to see Tokyo as a whole or take stunning pictures, then this attraction is a must do! I recommend going there for the sunset. There's no time limit up on the platform as long as you're within their opening times. On a clear day you will be able to see iconic buildings such as the Tokyo Tower or the Skytree and even Mount Fuji!"

At the elevator area to get the observation area there is a basic security check of your backpacks and large bags. There are no admission fees. Groups of 8 to 10 go up at a time. We waited for about five minutes before reaching the front of the line. At the top you can get panoramic views of Tokyo. There are a cafe, a souvenir shop with various regional specialties, and free bathrooms. To come down you enter another elevator line. Again, we didn't have to wait long.

There is a coffee shop at the top which services wine/beer/tea/coffee and very reasonable priced shopping.

We arrived early so it was very fast to get there in the 45 floor, but when we left the building the queue was a bit longer.You don't need to pay to go up, this is the good thing. There is a restaurant/cafe where you can see another side of the building but this is only allowed if you have something in the restaurant, I haven't joined so I don't know if the view would be better from this side of the floor.In the neighborhood of this building you can find many other buildings and the Love sign which is nice to take some pictures."

Elevator took some time to get us to the top that was floor 45. The view was breath taking even thou there are higher places nearby. Good thing was that it didn't cost anything to get there. Although the souvenir shop and cafe were nicely priced. Tip: You should take a try for Yokohama Landmark Tower Sky Garden as well. Another similar place to go if you are near by there."

Also no tripods or monopods are allowed but the windows all have a windowsill to put your camera on.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office was only two blocks away from Shinjuku Chuo Park and Kumano Shrine, so we were able to see multiple free attractions rather quickly. We visited on a work day (Wednesay) in the early afternoon so there were no lines for the elevator and it was not crowded in the building. We easily took the elevator to the North Observatory on the 45th floor after a minor security bag check and were able to view a breathtaking views of the entire city, which expanded as far as the eye could see. We did not explore the first and second floor in depth before heading up, but did see Tourist Information Shops that had many brochures with English speaking staff that were helping other tourists plan out other visits. These little shops also had free food samples of local dishes, which was pretty cool. It was a pretty clear day but we weren\u2019t able to see Mt. Fuji unfortunately. Regardless, the view was incredible. There were also cool shops up there selling many local toys, gadgets, etc. and a caf\u00e9 so we took a little time to shop around for small Japan Trinkets before heading out. It was a short and cost-free trip that was very enjoyable. Highly recommended for those who are staying close and are able to access it easily/with minimal travel costs. Even with the add-ons of the park being close by, I would not recommend spending a large amount of money to transport here to see the views. It was incredible but not worth at 30 dollar cab ride to see."

Also there is a tourist information center at the first floor with plenty of helpful brochures for traveling in Tokyo and other prefectures in Japan.If you plan to walk there, you may want to check out the LOVE sculpture located nearby; it's a popular meeting spot for couples (though nowadays Hachiko in Shibuya is gaining traction). Of course it's also the perfect place to go wild with your camera."

The best thing about this building as compared to the many other skyscrapers in Tokyo is that it's free and gives you a nearly 360 degree view (you'd need to visit both towers to get the full 360). There is a little food and some beverages available at the top, but no required purchase. The seating at the cafe area is far from the windows, though, which is why I'm only rating it a 4 instead of 5. I'm sure if you could see more from the eating area, there would be a lot of people buying a croissant and sitting there for hours... Too bad because I would gladly keep buying food and/or drinks to sit there and enjoy the view."

It is in Shinjuku with free entrance and you have to pass by a control service. So you should not take big suitcases. We can go from 9h30am to 11pm. Take the 1st floor of the main building to access the deck observatory. You will have information of what you are seeing and you have useful guides. Take your camera to save this amazing view of the city, and choose where and what to visit in Tokyo!"

The Touchou was the tallest building when it was built in Tokyo but it has been surpassed by other buildings and structures (Yokohama Landmark Tower for example and SkyTree). Nevertheless, it is free when the other observatories charge fees.From the east exit of Shinjuku Station we went straight out through the underground pedestrian passage (nice on the return leg since it started to rain) and just followed the signs to the Touchou or Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office. I believe we exited at A4, went through the nearest doorway, passed through security, and took the first tower closest to us. There is a North and South Tower and I think we went to the North one (we also passed a tourist information center on the way in).We took the designated express elevator, which takes less than a minute, to the top and then saw nice views all around us. From various viewppoints, we saw the Tokyo Tower, Skytree and many other landmarks. Since it was overcast we did not see Mt. Fuji (harder to see during summer anyway). The views got hazier once the rain started however.There is a caf\u00e9 and toy store on the observation deck as well."

The views are amazing and the Japanese toys, trinkets and other items are worth buying since you are out of the hustle and bustle of other area of Tokyo. However, I am recommending stopping by the cafeteria on the 32nd floor. When back at the lobby of the government building, you can ask any of the security staff for the cafeteria and you will fill out a card with your information in order to get a visitor's pass to the building. Take the elevator to the 32nd floor and you are presented with two \"vendors\" to choose from, each serving 10+ dishes each day. One vendor has the north side and the south side belongs to another vendor, so when exiting the elevators, make sure to walk around the central area to look at all of the dishes. Note the cafeteria is only open on weekdays from 11:30 AM to 2PM and form 2-4PM for lighter meals. Prices are very affordable. Last time I was there only a handful of dishes were over 1,000 yen."

The place is wide open - there are windows everywhere and some gift shops in the middle along with a small cafe. As you walk around the perimeter of the building, they have overhead maps highlighting different sights. We thought about going up Tokyo Tower and the SkyTree, but after doing this - it's absolutely free - we didn't feel like spending the $30+ per person ($70+ for fast pass) to go up the SkyTree. Plus, we never really had a clear day - it was rainy season and was overcast most of the time. Don't get me wrong, I don't know that it's worth it to trek all the way here just for this, but if you're in the area or staying at one of the local hotels, it's well worth the time."

The place was easy to find and the elevator ride was smooth and there was no line. However, the floor was quite crowded with very poor ventilation. It was about 70 degrees outside but it felt like 85 inside with humidity. This was not helped by having a restaurant and a kitchen on the same floor with no windows. The view was really quite average. The glass window gave a lot of glare and reflection making taking photos difficult. But I think mostly because of the stuffiness we left after a quick 10 minutes.

But if there's one spot where one can observe this, in all its glory, it is from the top of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office building. And there's a good reason to get excited. Access to the top level of the building is absolutely free. You might need to spend some time in a queue leading to one of two lifts that take you into two corners of the top floor, but the wait it well worth it. What you are confronted with, when you reach your destination, is a view that, on a good clear viewing day, could take you as far as Mt Fuji (which I, personally was not privileged to see, given the overcast nature of the weather on the day of my visit). Weather notwithstanding, Tokyo is spread just in front of your eyes and you can discern things that otherwise would not be visible from ground level. For instance, one thing I discovered (actually my wife did) was that the taller buildings were masking whole blocks of lower apartment buildings, creating an interesting maze of blocks of tall and low buildings in a fairly organized manner. You can also spot the multitude of high rising buildings with helipads on their roofs. All in all, an excellent spot to grasp nearly the whole of Tokyo in one go. Well worth the time investment."

We went back when it was dark to see how it looked with the city lit up. Worth visiting at night too but not necessary if you're after the view. Restaurant seemed expensive but there's too not much around if you're hungry.

I had read reviews regarding tourists accessing the staff cafeteria on the 32nd floor for meals so we decided to try it. Firstly it is not so easy to access. You have to each complete a form carrying address and phone number details ( no english version), then receive a visitor's pass and be ushered to an elevator. Once at the cafeteria, you can see glass cases exhibiting the plastic versions of the meals on offer plus prices. Next, you order these through a machine, inserting appropriate payment. Then proceed to the appropriate counter for your meal. We were assisted by a very helpful staff member. Note that we arrived shortly after opening at 11.30 am. If we had been much later, we would have been included in the hundreds of workers arriving for lunch. Ditto with the cafeteria seating. The meal was great value. We were the only westerners in the room and hurried through our meal as we did not wish to interfere with workers on their lunch break. Verdict? Authentic Japanese food, great value, but not so easy to access."

This is a big complex with a semicircular plaza. The design was made by the famous architect Kenzo Tange. The facades are very interesting as they recreate traditional architecture and electronic circuitry. The skyscrapers are impressive and their architecture very modern and with a clear Japanese style. Just pay attention to all the buildings around the Metropolitan buildings. To detail the architecture you have to visit at day time. At night time the views from the tower are very nice. They are also nice at day time simply a different perspective.There are small shops where you can buy small and cheap souvenirs.Look for the cute Lady Bugs in the ground floor, close the building.

We were lucky and caught a lift to the deck that wasn't too crowded (it might have helped that we had the baby in a stroller).

You can choose whether to go up the South or North tower, or both. The view from the top is very impressive. I was surprised with how large the viewing room is, which was also a bonus, as it can seem quite packed at times. You get a great view of the whole city, especially if it is a clear day.

I don't know how many days a year you actually get a view of Fuji from anywhere in Japan but it certainly isn't very frequently from my experience and from what I've heard. Still, it's worth making the short walk from Shinjuku station to the government buildings to go up to the observation decks as it's an amazing overview of Tokyo and surrounding areas. The souvenir shops are also surprisingly good and reasonably priced."

You will have to register with security guards and your access will be granted. The food ordering can be a bit challenging since there is no signs in English. In any case consider it as a game (at least we did) and we had real fun, You will have to match the color and the number from the displayed food, purchase the ticket from the vending machine and then match the color of the food outlet.

This was nowhere near that which was why the experience was a bit deflating. There was also no information about the skyline etc, where different buildings and areas were, which would have enhanced this experience and I would've expected this as a minimum. There's literally just an overpriced gift shop and restaurant and nothing else.Perhaps the paid-for Sky Tree is better but I don't think you should have to pay for a decent view and experience."

You can view Tokyo from the observation platforms of the Tokyo Skytree or the Tokyo Tower, at a cost, or you can go to the 45th floor observatory of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office (either or both north and south towers) and see it all, for free! And that includes seeing the Tokyo Tower and the Skytree themselves (which you can't see if you're in them!). On a fine day, you can even see Mt Fuji (good luck with that!). Day or night. Indeed we went twice - once in the daylight and once at night.Easily accessible by subway to one of the Shinjuku stations (one is right underneath the building). We didn't find the queues that long - 5-10 minutes wait to get up and down.There are gift shops and toilets at the top.There are other interesting skyscrapers around, plus department stores with big basement food halls, and Shinjuku itself.Do yourself a favour - it's free!"

And I used to get lots of complaints from tourists on why it costs 1800 JPY (around 15 USD) to simply get into the observatory, as they asked me if there is a observatory free of charge. The answer for their question was of course HERE.Located around 10 minutes by walk from the west side of Shinjuku Station, there is a couple elevators that brings you all the way to the top.The only problem about this observatory is the location, since it is located in the West side of the Tokyo Metro, you don't get the best view of the entire Tokyo, but it is more easier to see the Mount Fuji since there is not many buildings that obstructs the view.The big plus is definitely the FREE admission. Before heading to the elevator there is a brief security check, but nothing special.I advise you to take the Toei Subway Oedo Line and get off at Tochomae since it's just right behind the building.Also, you can get free English guidance at the entrance, so make sure to take advantage."

The station itself is enormous and has about 60 different exits, so if going here from Shinjuku directly, make sure you have clear directions. I got lost for about 45 minutes trying to find it, as it was hidden among dozens of other skyscrapers just west of Shinjuku!That said, it was great to visit in the early evening, when there was a fantastic view in the last hour of daylight, and again in the darkness when the whole city was lit up. There are a few chairs on the observation deck as well to rest weary feet. Would definitely recommend!"

The building does give a good view of Tokyo but the time I went there it is so crowded . I took some pictures then spent most of my time looking at a wide array of souvenirs sold on the stores. What's great about this place is it don't have any entrance fee unlike Tokyo Skytree. Both offers the same awesome view so you got to save a few bucks by going to this place."

In Shinjuku, Japan, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Observatories are one of the few locations to get a great look at the city, but also to get night shots of Tokyo at night (if you are a photographer).Unfortunately, the location does not allow for a tripod and there is light being reflected on the window, so you will have to put your lens on the glass and have a towel to block out light.But the South Observation Deck is great for taking photos during the day, while the North Observation Deck, which is open until 10:30 p.m. are for those who want to enjoy the Tokyo view at night and also want to eat at the cafe and bar.My first time going to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building (back in \u201999 \u2013 shown above), I went to the South Observation Deck and personally, I feel you get a better view without the obstructions during the night shots versus the day. So, I recommend the North Observation Deck at night (just remember that it closes at 10:30 p.m.).But the South Observation Deck does give you a good peek through Odaiba, which is a plus."

Plenty of signages to help you find it, starting from Shinjuku train station, which is about 10-15-walk away, part of it is a travelator, saving you quite a few steps. Just follow the direction on the signages. There are two towers, the escalator is about 50 meters from each other, which you can choose at the last moment once you are inside the building. One of them opens much longer into the night (up until around 10pm). I arrived around 4pm,so it didn't matter to me. The service was great with courteous attendants, although it was completely free of charge. There was a caf\u00e9 at the top and an exhibition of various local products from different areas. No obligation to pay for or buy anything, though; no pressure at all. This place is as good as any other towers in Tokyo for the view, and - once again - it's free. What more could you ask for?"

I did have a lot of trouble finding the entrance to the North Tower though and it was only due to the kindness of some English-speaking young locals that I found it! So do your research! There's a little gift shop there and you do have to be patient and wait for people to move away from the windows if you want to get a good clear shot of the view, and at night you need to get right up to them because of the interior lights reflecting in the glass. I wish I'd gone there during the day as well. NB: I travelled here in April 2014 - not 2015."

I have given this 5/5, because you cannot grumble with this free opportunity to see such glorious views of Tokyo!I visited this the morning of my first day in Tokyo, at about 9:30am (when it opened). Mt. Fuji was majestically shaping the skyline, and it was very, very beautiful. I also visited this attraction on the last night of my visit to watch the sunset, which again, was incredible. It is easily accessible by the subway system, and sign posted clearly from the station. It's just a short elevator ride up to the top, and going on weekdays, there wasn't any queue, even at sunset. It did however get a little crowded at the windows looking out at Fuji. For this I have a cheeky tip. If you follow the signs down to the toilets on the floor below, there is a smoking area with a huge window looking out at Fuji. This is usually more or less empty, so it's a good space to get your own personal viewing. It would obviously be better if this was open air, so that you can feel more on top of the world and get better photos. But honestly, it is such an amazing gift to tourists, to see these views for free!"

On the top floor you can see all across Shinjuku, and at night with the city lights it is truly breathtaking.

I don't know if this happens often, but I can't imagine they didn't know about the event when we called -- they just chose not to warn us.However, the tower is as awesome as everyone says, both to go up and look at the city from, and to look at from afar, such as points further west up the Kanda river. At night, it's a striking sight, lit up in green, pink or whatever (it varies).The nearby park (Chuo koen) is not bad for a visit too, though watch out not to trip over the homeless folks if you're there at dusk, and watch out for the cyclists silently careering around ignoring the no-cycling signs.

We visited once in the morning then returned at night & neither times was it overly busy so the viewing was outstanding. The souvenir shops in the viewing area are very reasonably priced also. The only problem we had was actually finding where to enter the building from the square outside. There was some construction going on so quite a lot of boards were up & the entrance wasn't signed at all (in English). We had to ask a worker how to get in. However the view was spectacular & a must to do while in Shinjuku"

During our recent visit to Tokyo our hotel recommended we go to the Government Building across the road from the hotel and take the elevator to the spectators lounge at the top of the building which had unrivalled views of Tokyo in all directions.The bonus is - its totally free of charge.It was a busy attraction and there was strict security with regards to bags being checked but that's not a bad thing in these turbulent times.The views were 360 degrees and amazing. There was a gift shop, a restaurant and toilet facilities so everything you need.With regards to transport, there is a metro station close by and the Tokyo metro is so cheap.A great location and great attraction. You don't get things for free usually these days so make sure you use this attraction."

On a busy day, it can have queues, but never as bad as the touristy towers. The view from up here is breathtaking. You can even see the famous Mt Fuji! Btw if you go on a weekend, there are no workers and the area is a lot quieter. Also the square 'inside' the building is worth to visit, with its beautiful flower beds and interesting sculptures. "

Fuji's ice-capped summit. The room itself, although big, was nothing special though. There's a caf\u00e9 in the middle that serve food and beverage. You may expect to pay a minimum of 500Yen for a hot/cold drink and a minimum of 900Yen for food. I just looked at the menu and decided not to eat there. There's a small souvenir shop behind the caf\u00e9 where you can buy small trinkets like Sushi Keychains, postcards, etc. The overall feel was a bit dated and it would do well if they could provide seats outside of the caf\u00e9 so visitors can rest up a bit. Do remember that there is no entrance fee so if you're on a tight budget and do not want to pay just to get a good view of the city from high up, then really, this is the place to go."

We didn't manage as the sky was very cloudy and foggy. We could only view Shinjuku area and slightly beyond. The tourist volunteer did a great job. She looks like a retiree but she could speak excellent Chinese in which we had no barriers at all. It's good to employ retirees for such work in which is value added to the society. You can either walk there if you live near the Shinjuku Station area or you may take the Oedo Line one stop to there. We took the Oedo Line. I think walking there may be better, for you can see more of the other side of Shinjuku away from the shopping areas."

There's even a Tourist Information Counter on the 1st floor. Show your passport and you can get free wifi ID. Not many places to eat here( or at least, I didn't find cheaper alternatives). There's a place to eat on the 75th storey but I thought it wasn't worth the price. Eat elsewhere before going there."

Started with the North building and went on to the South building which we think have a better view of Mt. Fuji. Lovely view of sky in shades of orange and red with hint of Mt. Fuji on a not very clear day. After that, one by one, the buildings' and streets' lights came to life. A wonderful view.If you have the time, check the weather, come once in the morning when the morning sun from the east shine at Mt. Fuji. Tour Shinjuku and Harajuku areas including the lovely gardens and Meiji Shrine during the day and come back again for the sunset view. The cafe there offers decent cakes and local sweet stuffs."

First of all, the evening guards told us to go around to the back of the building although their front entrance where the guards were standing can lead us to the elevator within 10 seconds. And the arrow signs lead us to another direction, the upper deck, to access to the same elevator. This was really confusing. When we called their office, no one answered.Free entry with a bag check.It was a run down cheap sad tourist trap.When I first visited here in 1993, it was nothing like this. Because of the added souvenir store in the center, you cannot see much of night spectacle due to the lighting reflection on the windows.The whole place is dingy, with few seats. The cheesy restaurant also takes up 1/3 of the best viewing angles. We felt disappointed for how it was advertised as a tourist destination. We had visited Mori center skydeck previous night. You will have a better spectacles 360 degree from Ropponggi hill over Shinjuku and afar. It took us an hour to get to this government building but we left in 10 min. It was a humiliating experience. From here to Shinjuku, we took a taxi as the tranport wasn't too good in the dark. Getting to a Taxi waiting was also a bit of a walk. Without street signs, it was very disorienting, altough we were using smart phone gps map. That was equakly discouraging. Definitely thumbs down unless yiu have nothing else to do."

The 45 story elevator ride takes less than a minute and the observation deck is completely enclosed. Those that want to take pictures of themselves with the city backdrop will have a difficult time since windows are tinted and the lighting is not optimal. The North observation deck offers a cafe and has a gift shop. The best kept secret in this building lies on the 32nd floor; the cafeteria. To access this you must check in with the security on the 2nd floor (just fill out a paper and get a visitor pass). Lunch starts at 11:30am and is paid for by vending machines. The cafeteria offers very affordable food when compared to other eateries in the immediate area. For an example, Tonkotsu ramen was one \u00a5460 and a soba set was around \u00a5300.

Once you return to the ground floor after viewing- ask the security staff for a pass to access the canteen. They will give you a temporary pass. Now go up on the general access elevator to level 32 and you will find the most amazing canteen, loads of choices at crazy low prices. 500 yen for a main meal, 150 for a drink. There is a system- all meals are on display with a code, take a note of the code, buy a ticket from a vending machine with the relevant code, then go to the relevant serving station with your ticket.Find a seat and enjoy lunch with great views for next to nothing!"

It has twin observatory buildings on the 45th floor that allows one to see a vast area of Tokyo and other areas of Japan. On a clear day, one can even see Mt. Fuji, although there was too much cloud cover during my visit to see it. There is a gift shop and drink/snack lounge there. Lots of windows to see out of with informational plaques to name certain landscapes that are visible. You have to go down to first floor, then wait to take an elevator up. When leaving, it brings you back to the 2nd floor. If you exit from the interior and not the street level, you can walk out into a park that makes a nice interlude. It has a waterfall, but it was out of service during my visit. So if you tire of all the buildings, this makes a nice respite. I enjoyed my visit even through the drizzling rain. The temperature was in the 50's F. The foliage has the trees changing colors and leaves falling, but still lots of foliage at this time. The building itself is worth a look."

At Skytree we queued for 30 minutes, then paid a fair amount of money to go up.Here, we queued for perhaps 10 seconds, then paid absolutely nothing. And guess what the view was? The same.Although, in fairness, we also went up Roppongi Hills Tower, which you do pay for (but less than Skytree), but you get to go out on the roof in the open air.So, this is my favourite free viewpoint in Tokyo, and my second favourite after Roppongi Hills Tower.Recommended."

To go there l took the JR Yamamote line from Tokyo station Gate 5 and exited at the Shinjuku Station. After that l took the western exit and walked through a covered passageway for about 10 minutes passing the entrance to many shops under office buildings. After coming out of the underground passageway l passed by a tree lined boulevard for a distance of about 100 metres to reach the compund of the Tokyo Metropolitan Office Buildings which comprise of two towers north and south. The northern tower was opened until 11am whilst the southern tower is only opened until 5pm. I was ushered into a lift after a brief security check that took me to the 45th floor. I was not disappointed at all. The view was out of the world!!! I was there around 10pm and couldnot see Mt Fuji which was obvious on a clear day. The views of the surroundings was really incredible amazing. The only thing you coukd not do was to set up a tripod to take long exposures. They close at 11pm."

If you get an orange juice then you can relax without problems, but if you have in mind to go up there and drink a coffee, you'll be left disappointed. The mt. Fuji is visible, but super small.

This is one of the few places that helps to dismantle that perception. You will have a good time here without paying a single yen. It is also a good thing that the building is not far from JR Shinjuku station and it will only take a 10-15 minute walk to get there.The North and South observation decks (on 45th floor) are all free to enter - all you need to do is to show up at the 1st floor lift landing and a guard will wave you through after checking your belongings. Once you're at the observatory, enjoy the free view of the Tokyo skyline - from the South Observatory you can see Yoyogi Park and even the Tokyo station district from afar! If you are lucky, on clearer days you would be able to see Mount Fuji. There is also a small cafe for drinks and a gift shop for souvenirs. The money you can save going here and not to the Tokyo Tower or Skytree can be spent on a nice meal. This is an excellent place for a view and a must-do in Tokyo. Highly recommended."

We wandered around the front at night and couldn't work it out, but took a chance at some dark stairs and eventually saw some other people and followed them. It is completely free and we went straight into an elevator as soon as we arrived. Mostly tourists at that time but not overly crowded. The room has windows on every side so you can see the entire city. The view was amazing at night and I would highly recommend. I cannot say what it is like during the day.

My wife and I may have taken an absurdly long route, which maybe is our fault, but as you know ... Tokyo is quite a complicated, overwhelming city so it's quite easy to follow directions not knowing you're taking the long way. With that said, if you DONT go underground and walk in the walkway underground, you will be about 1000 steps less than you would if you had just walked above ground. Trust me - you will thank me for this advice later.Now! The top of the building is very nice. I personally love skydecks, watching the city and etc. However, I will say, it's more a tourist attraction than anything since it's free (and Tokyo is incredibly expensive) and the views aren't so spectacular, while they have shoved every possible item for sale, or restaurant upstairs just so you have something to spend your money on.Again, I'm not saying I disliked it - especially if you have a day with bad weather, this could be almost the perfect attraction. However, it's not going to give you views of anything you're expecting and unless you have money or a really nice camera - expect it to be rather an in-and-out experience."

The people who worked there were efficient, friendly and courteous. The Observation deck was great. We walked right round, and at different windows there is a big photo telling you names of buildings and districts. I am pretty sure on a good day you can see Mt Fuji. It had been raining and was actually raining whilst we were at the deck so it made the view a bit foggy. Having said that it was great to take photos of Tokyo on a rainy day! Gave it a different perspective. On the same floor are many souvenir stalls and vending machines.I recommend TMG highly to any visitor to Tokyo, especially if you are a first time visitor. I found it very hassle-free, calm and peaceful. Perhaps the rain had put off many visitors but for us it was a plus! Remember that it is a working office building for many of TMG's workers and not just a tourist attraction. It is very convenient to get it, being on top of Tochomae metro station."

There is a restaurant at the viewing area, but we did not try it. Didn't look like much. But I guess, I cannot say as we did not try it. You can buy souvenirs also if you like. Over all, glad we did it. And would recommend if you are visiting the area."

I was surprised at how quiet it was given how busy my experience of other viewing platforms in other cities has been. I went to the Skytree on a previous Tokyo visit. Whilst this isn't as high you are more in the centre of Tokyo so feel 'closer to the action'. Also I recommend the restaurant - nothing sensational but it is good value for money especially as admission is free."

Terrific way to start a Japanese trip if you're staying in Shinjuku, as it will give you a good sense of perspective.Each tower has two lifts, and both towers not always open together. You can't get directly between towers, but not really necessary to go up both. Generally a queue to get up and down again, but rarely a long queue. Your bags will be searched by security before entering the lift.The views are described a little so you know what features of the urban agglomeration of greater Tokyo you are seeing. On a clear day, you can see Fuji san (Mt Fuji) well, but this is pretty rare. Both levels have souvenir shops and a little exhibition space, while one has a coffee shop.At the bottom of the building, there is an excellent Tokyo visitor centre. Perhaps the best spot in Tokyo to get maps and tourist advice. Different areas of Tokyo displayed well and very helpful staff who have an encyclopaedic collection of information available on request."

I would recommend getting off at Nishi Shinjuku if you are on the Marounuchi line instead of Shinjuku station. Try to avoid Shinjuku if you can. It is a short walk to the complex. There is construction on the ground level, so you have to hunt for the entrance. Look for big arrows. There is a security check as you go in, and an attendant loads you onto the elevator. The views from the 45th floor are spectacular, The is a restaurant and a toy shop on he floor. Like other buildings and train stations, they have turned the A/C down to save energy. So it is hot inside. On the way out, we saw some art exhibits. Try to find he brochure, and it will tell you where they are. This is late August 2015, I don't know how long the art exhibits are. The best one was the interactive exhibit under the Keio Plaza hotel. You get to it from he outside of the hotel, not inside. It is a underground plazanade that links one side to the other.This area of town is also relatively quiet at night compared to right next to Shinjuku station. You see plenty to salarymen getting off work at 9 - 10PM, With less crowds, you can enjoy the architecture of the buildings. Try to find the cocoon building, a futuristic building with external lattice metal beams.The free view was great, along with the nice stroll back to the metro."

Furthermore it is free (save the money you would have spent on Tokyo Tower or Skytree and spend it on something else), and the views are great. You can also do a free tour with a guide from the bottom floor who provides some good information on the building and the views. Departure is just based on there being a guide available who speaks your language. So when I arrived we just left and did it one-on-one. I took the advice of my guide and had lunch after at a cafeteria on floor 32 which was quite the experience of buying a ticket and collecting the food etc. Even got a seat with a view! All for a grand total of ~$5!"

The day we were there it was a bit hazy but we could still see Fuji - beautifulI enjoyed the high viewpoint as it gave me a better understanding of the Tokyo layout in its various train hubs. Ikebukuro (nearest hub to my daughter's home in Nerima) was clearly visible as well as the other major hubs. I had my little blond grand daughter with me when I visited. We stopped on one of the levels to observe some crafts people work. One man was a word working artist. Kalista and I watched a while and she had questions I couldn't answer (zero Japanese language skills). She posed them directly to the gentleman and he was so surprised and overjoyed he stopped everything and he and K made a special pair of chopsticks for her to take home. They sanded them with mulberry leaves. Magical moment - some will tell you that the Japanese are rude, but in three trips there, I've found quite the opposite is true. If you're lost, there is always somebody about to try to help. I love Japan and love visiting this Met centre."

And one of the most amazing skyscrapers is Tokyo Metropolitan Building! Getting up is no hassle. They will do a security check. However they are very polite and will first ask you if it's okay if they check your bag. Of course you have to say yes, but they were much more polite and friendly than the guards in Main Tower in Frankfurt that I visited last year...The architecture of the bulding by Kenzo Tange is cool, strict yet elegant. Make sure to spend a few minutes outside in the square just in front of the towers before you go in. Reaching the top the view is amazing. You can really feel how vast Tokyo is and you get a great view of the other skyscrapers in Shinjuku as well! The view is quite different from Tokyo Sky Tree since Shinjuku is quite far from where Tokyo Sky Tree is located. You will have a better chance of seeing Fuji from Tokyo Metropolitan Building. The few downsides with this attraction is that the best view can be seen from within an expensive restaurant... And in addition it's starting to show its age, the carpet looked a bit worn down in the tower we were in. But these are small niggles, definitely make sure to make a visit if you're in Tokyo!"

Although I could see most of Tokyo city I could not see too much of Tokyo Bay as it was smoggy. Only a little of Mt Fuji can be seen due to cloud cover. There wasn't much on the 40th floor. There was a little Italian restaurant where the displayed food didn't look appetising. I would've preferred Japanese food since this is Tokyo and it's a tourist site. If I had wanted Italian food I would have gone to Italy."

I recommend a sunset visit, but it will be difficult to see Mount Fuji unless you're lucky with the weather.Other places in Tokyo offer a high view (Mori Tower, Tokyo SkyTree, Tokyo Tower, etc) but they're all expensive :( So this is a welcome option.

After going through airport style security (beware, it says that you may need to present ID, although we never did) you are loaded into a lift and taken to floor 45. Upstairs you are free to spend as long as you like admiring the excellent view. Make sure to find the Fuji window if it's a clear day, and also check out the one next to the lift. It's also worth noting that there is a fun little shop selling souvenirs at reasonable prices. The only downside is that it is a bit of a journey from Shinjuku Station, but that can't really be helped. We'll worth the visit."

There is a nice restaurant at the viewing area but the windows of the building were quite dirty and reflective, so pictures were not the best.My tip would be to go instead to the Tokyo World Trade centre, which is close to the Tokyo tower. It is not free to go to the 40th floor, but the views are very spectacular. There is no food or drink available at the top so take your own. This is the place to watch the sunset over the Tokyo skyline. Make sure you get a good seat as it will be very popular just before it starts getting towards evening. You have a choice of vistas before you. The harbour area of the city or towards Tokyo tower. I spent a lovely hour or two watching the city come alive with the night lights. There is also some nice Jazz music playing in the background. A must for romantic couples to enjoy the sunsets."

We were offered a lovely FREE tour, which was run by a japanese lady who spoke good English, and it happened to be her first day and first tour. Rather empty and not a lot to see, it was a great way to walk around the building and actually see how big it was in comparison to what we have back home. If you go up to the 42nd floor you can get a great view of Japan, and get a guage for where things are. Apparently you can see Mt Fuji on a day with great visibility. It's June now, so its fairly hot, make sure you dress accordingly. The information centre on the main floor is really helpful and has free wi-fi."

We went to the South Tower because we intended to eat lunch at the employee\u2019s cafeteria after visiting the Observation Deck. Sorry, I couldn't remember which floor it is. You can just ask the English-speaking staff at the Information Desk because the cafeteria is easy to find. When we reached the cafeteria's floor, we followed the lunch crowd as it wove through labyrinthine corridors. The first thing we saw was a display window of plastic food replicas with English and Japanese description and corresponding price. As we walked further, we discovered that there were many more food displays that offered a variety of Japanese and international cuisine. Just choose your food, remember the code and pay using the vendo machines. There are separate vendo machines for drinks and dessert. Bring the color-coded ticket to the right colored kitchen counter and wait while they whip up your food. Cafeteria food at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office lives up to the Japanese high quality standard. Why shouldn\u2019t it? All the employees and guests eat here. The food quality is good and the price is very affordable. The cafeteria might not serve dinner because the kitchen closed after the lunch break. The South Tower is also closed every first and third Tuesday of every month so plan your visit well."

The line was long, with 20 minutes of waiting to get in to the north tower, and we viewed the whole level in about 15. But being tired we made the best decision of the day and went into the little sky restaurant for a drink. For the next hour we sat there with a glass of wine in hand and soaked it all in. By far the best view is from the restaurant, and there was virtually no crowd to impede the view. We ended up having a wonderful day."

The observation deck is free to visit, which is a huge plus in my book, and the views of the city are spectacular. It's hard to comprehend just how large Tokyo is unless you see it for yourself. One complaint is that in the south tower observation deck, there is a restaurant, and it completely blocks the view of all the recognizable landmarks like the Tokyo Tower and Skytree, so you have to eat the restaurant to get the view. Otherwise a pretty good alternative if you don't want to pay to go to the Tokyo Tower for a view of Tokyo."

It started getting a little overcast when we arrived at the building, but the views were still good, if not crystal clear. The condition of the observation area was not what I had expected. It was a little run down and some of the windows could use a good cleaning (or complete replacement). We didn't spend much time here, and only went up in one of the two towers. If you're looking for something free it's worth a visit, but if you're short on time and have other observation deck opportunites I would probably pass on this."

You get a 360 degree of Tokyo and on a good day, can probably see Mt Fuji as well (we didn't - too hazy!) There is also a cafe where you can get a coffee and sweets. Price is on the high side but I felt that I should support it since we saved so much on entrance fee..."

A must-do if visiting Tokyo, to experience the FREE views of Tokyo from the penultimate floor (as far as Mount Fuji on a clear day, apparently, though it rarely is a clear day!). Note though that as it is free there can be long-ish queues, although we queued on a Saturday evening and got through within half an hour, which I don't think is bad. We also went midweek during the day and there was no queue.Perhaps the best thing about it is the restaurant, not only for the views but the inexpensive Wagyu beef dish on the menu. From memory the dish is about 1400 Yen at lunchtime, we went in the evening so it was around double that price, which is still good value for an upmarket restaurant dish!"

Tokyo tower and sky tree and yoyogi park and meiji shrine\u2026 And the place where the viewing platform is is very warm and cozy. I went for sunset (just for luck) and I strongly recommend it!! It is an amazing sunset. I'll attach the picture so you believe me hehe good luck! Also if you go to Tokyo tower & sky tree, and still have time to come here, do it. (I did 3 of them! worth it!!!)"

I would recommend going a bit before sunset so you can see the almost 360 degree (maybe 280?) views during the daylight and then at night as well. They are absolutely breathtaking. I still haven't decided if I like the sunset views or the nighttime views better. There is also a restaurant at the top where you can eat or grab a bite, but it is definitely overpriced. There is also a small gift shop at the top. Be aware that the lines to get back down are often quite long."

We spent 4 nights in Tokyo and wished we had stayed longer. I'd say 1-2 nights in Kyoto and 1 night in Osaka is sufficient unless you're venturing outside the city.

We only went up one tower (there are two) but really enjoyed the views over the city. there is a small gift shop and a nice cafe as well on the viewing deck."

The signs are marked very well \"Observatory\" in green and white. The elevators take you up to the 45th floor and there is a huge hit circular room with windows on all but 1/6 of the sides. We went at 5pm and the sun was blazing hot into the room. It was gorgeous but quite hot. We had coats and hats from the 40degree weather outside. I seriously recommend this sightseeing stop!!!"

When I visited, on multiple occassions, queues for the elevators were bearable (less than 10 minutes each way). Visiting the observatory is absolutely free, no registration is necessary, you just queue in for the elevators. Chances of seeing Mount Fuji are highest on clear days in winter and lowest in summer. If you would like to experience it in daylight, go there in the morning (the observatories open at 9:30am). Viewing from Shinjuku, the sun sets almost exactly behind Mount Fuji. Because of this I couldn\u2019t see much of Mount Fuji in the late afternoon, but then seeing the sun setting behind the mountain, giving it a golden backdrop was a truly amazing sight."

Very knowledgable and helpful with any questions about Tokyo and Japan. The views are spectacular. Just as good as Tokyo Tower, with more on offer here (two viewing decks, tours of govt offices, tourist info). Everything is in English and Japanese.

Only a 5-10 minute work from Shinjuku station altogether and is certainly worth a visit to see the sprawling skyline that the urban city of Tokyo has to offer. This metropolitan government building is the tallest in the Nishishinjuku area but 7th tallest in Tokyo at 243 metres. The tallest is only 5 metres taller. The building itself is impressive with 2 towers both offering viewing points from the 45th floor. I was initially weary about distance up or down in the lifts, but was pleasantly surprised as I did not feel it moving (unlike my experience at empire state building in nyc). Free to enter. We opted for south tower to try to get a view of Mount Fuji. Luck was however not with us as it was an overcast day. The observation is well equipped with maps that pinpoint important buildings in site and there is also a free guide stationed there whom can highlight many things for you for free. Lovely touch.

Fuji wasn't visible, but it was exciting to see weather systems roll down over the mountains and hills in front of it. We took a cheap (Y1000/\u00a35.20) curry lunch at the top with views towards Tokyo bay and Haneda."

There are a few different options you can take if you want to get a birds-eye view of Tokyo (the Skytree, Tokyo Tower, Mori Tower), but if you're on a budget, the Metropolitan Government Office is the one to choose. I went to the Mori Tower on a previous trip (but not the other two), and while the view was indeed good, it also cost 1500 yen. Visiting the observatory of the Metropolitan Government Office is completely free.My brother and I went there on a sunny afternoon, and the views were breathtaking. You get a 360 degree view of the city, and if the sky is clear, you can see Mt Fuji quite well. There's a caf\u00e9 on the top floor (where the observatory is) and also a little gift shop, if you want somewhere to chill for a bit after admiring the view (which is what we did).All in all, considering it's completely free, you really can't go wrong with making a stop here. I honestly would have paid for the experience if you had to. The Metropolitan Government Office is fairly easy to reach from the JR Shinjuku station - try and spot the towers if you can, so you can get a visual reference, as Shinjuku can be a bit of a maze."

(4) The observatory platform is actually on Level 45. (5) Entrance to two special lifts is on Level 1, after passing through security check. (6) Adjacent to the entrance is a tourist information office where foreign visitors can get a 14-day free WIFI pass (user id and password) by presenting their passports to confirm their foreign visitor status. (7) However, not everywhere have such WIFI network. (8) There is a pedestrian underpass connecting the Shinjuku JR Train/Subway Station to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office Building (with clear direction sign in the Station. (9) The office building is quite close to the Keio Plaza Hotel on one side and opposite to the Hyatt Regency Hotel on another side. (10) Both Towers open at 9.30 am. Check latest information about closing time (generally 10:30 pm) on the internet."

It seemed that, the more interesting the vista was, the more lights you had to deal with. I felt that the actual window areas could have done with some kind of curtain screening to block out the light pollution. Not beyond the wit and ken of man, surely, but there you have it. As you walked around the windows, photographers, straining and audibly cursing, while trying to get the \u2018killer shot\u2019, accompanied you. To compound my irritation with this avoidable blight, the queue for the lifts taking you back down to ground level was immense and required, on this occasion, a twenty-minute wait. I was in some doubt whether I would be able to make it down and across town the second leg of my evening, at the Robot Restaurant. I did make it, but the queue made it nerve-wracking."

I've visited the Tokyo \"City Hall\" on a couple of holiday occasions and enjoyed the place as a sort of off-beat tourist attraction. As noted, the view is great and it is free. Most of the people there seemed to be visiting Japanese. We first went in December of 2010 and while at the tourist information centre near the ground floor we noticed a desk with a sign offering free guided tours in English. The four of us were the only guests on the tour. A very pleasant volunteer guide showed us around the building for over an hour, ending up at the observation deck. She also mentioned that the employee restaurant was open to the public, so we ate our lunch in the very large employee's cafeteria as the only outside guests (buy ticket for the chosen meal from a machine then give the ticket to the appropriate counter person and grab a table). On my return trip to the 45th floor in November 2014 we had a very reasonable set lunch meal at the small restaurant on the south observation deck. The observatory is entirely glassed in. In 2010 we had a fine view of Fuji-san from the south tower. Easy access from Shinjuku."

It is amazing to me that the Japanese set such a high standard of cleanliness and elegance, while we in the West put up with graffiti and trash everywhere.

Nevertheless, it is well worth the effort first to see the towers and then to take the elevator to the top of one of (or both) the towers to see the view of the city. The view from the tower will illustrate the immensity of Tokyo both in terms of people and size. If the skies are clear, you will even get a view of Mt Fuji. There are staff available that will also give you a free 10-15 minute tour of the views and what you are seeing. Take advantage of this free activity and the tour."

They told us to go here, and we are certain we made the right decision. There was no charge, and there was no waiting to go up. The city couldn't be different looking from the other towers, as we were able to go all the way around the building to see from every angle. We couldn't see Mount Fuji, but this isn't a good time of year to see it. Winter has better views, as there are fewer clouds. If there is a good time to go off season, it would be early and when it is windy."

There are seven buildings in Tokyo where visitors can access a high-rise observation deck for spectacular 360 degree views of the city. Most have (nearly) floor-to-ceiling glass panels thereby offering the maximum amount of viewing space while one is open-air. Because they're all at different heights and are located in different parts of the city, the perspective from these galleries do differ slightly. However, the most important thing about the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office viewing gallery is that there's no admission fee. And in a city like Toyko, that's a benefit not easily found. Located on the 45th floors of both the north and south towers, and slightly over 200 metres high, it's possible to see the elusive Mount Fuji...but only on a clear day. Nevertheless, explanation panels are available to point out other highlights around the city. There is also a small souvenir shop which sells snacks. Note the opening hours of the observation decks - only the north tower is open till late and night."

Not very crowded, lift fast enough reaches the top floor, where a huge glass window at 360 degrees projected over the city to enjoy a panoramic view quite good. Sky Tree is not the obvious but being totally free it's ok! One side of the top floor is closed and is occupied by a restaurant lounge bar. The panoramic view of much of the city in particular of the Shinjuku district. Beautiful at night with all the surrounding buildings lit and if you are very lucky you can also see Mount Fuji. All in all a positive experience, maybe it is a bit 'hard to take pictures when is getting dark outside, with the reflection of light inside the photo did not come out perfect."

We were lucky when we got there. Shinjuku is on the west side of Tokyo and much closer to the mountains including Mt. Fuji. Compared to views from Tokyo Tower or Tokyo Skytree, though much lower at 600 ft, I think the view from this building is much better with more green and mountains. Looking to the east you can see the great views of multitude of skyscrapers of Tokyo. The observation floor stays open until 11:00 PM which is rare in Japan. Nice cafe and bar here too.Only problem, it was quite a walk from Shinjuku JR Station. I learned that you can be closer taking the subways. But that's extra when you have JR pass.Worth the visit."

The glass is slightly tinted and fairly clean offering some good views over the city.The South tower offers better views over the Meiji Shrine area. In the afternoon this had better views over the city due to the location of the sun. If you are in a rush and don't have time for both towers I recommend the South tower over the North.Both towers have a shop and a cafe.The views were quite good and on a clear day you can see the city of Tokyo spread out before, you all the way to the horizon. I do think the view from The World Trade Centre is better as you get 360' view over the city. Part of view at the metropolitan government tower is blocked by the other tower that makes up the government offices. However, it is free so do go take a look."

There are souvenir shops on both decks (North has more toys, South has more Japanese-related items) and I think the items are reasonably priced.

So my initial plan to Shinjuku was to visit the shopping centre within the metro station (yes , I spotted Isetan nearby from my pocket Lonely Planet guide, and immediately had some excuse to find some decent rain coat.... ). I split with my friend at the metro station, and we agreed to meet each other again in about 1.5 hours. I decided that I didn't need to be inside shopping mall for 1.5 hours, so I walked towards Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office. At the beginning I didn't realize that there were observatory towers at the top of the building. As I arrived at the entrance, I realized that it was free, so I decided to give it a go. The view from above is really nice, in fact, it is one of the most descriptive viewing tower I have ever been (after the NYC's Empire State Building, but only because there is English auditory in NYC....). The view of the landmark skyscrappers were described with the photograph by the side of the viewing windows. You can find some other events' explanatory boards also, depending on what is the closest event in the city. There is nice looking restaurant there (I didn't try), and of course souvenir shop. I felt lucky to stumble into this spot, especially after cancelling to go up to Tokyo Skytree the day before (you need to pay for Tokyo Skytree). When I was done, I strolled back to the metro station, however the building complex nearby were also fabulous, with very well maintained gardens at the side of the street. I ended up walking towards Takashimaya Times Square (yes another shopping mall) afterwards."

Worse than that , when we showed up at 13.00 hrs to meet for the tour we had booked and received confirmation of our request , we were told that there was no tour available on that day and that we should have called prior to showing up !!!  We had considered so far that Tokyo had one of the most interesting places in the world for free services for tourists but unfortunately it seems to be a thing of the past !

It's a striking futuristic twin tower structure and for me this was actually the best photo from the visit. I also visited the Sky Tree and Mori tower (Tokyo City view) which were far better but were 2000 and 1500 Yen respectively. Obviously this is free but I think if you were short of time I'd pass and do one of the others and of course don't mind paying the entrance! The reason they are better is because you get floor to ceiling views and a full 360 view, whereas with the TMG building one side is taken with a restaurant and it feels cramped to get a decent view. It's also not as high with Mori 52nd floor and Sky Tree at 350m Vs 45th floor. In terms of getting there it's in Shinjuku but the nearest station is Tochomae (E28). I visited at 5 pm on a Saturday and it was a 5 min queue but on leaving half an hour later it had grown considerably and the barriers were suggesting a 30 + min wait. Possibly there was a rush to catch sunset. In summary I think this was OK as it was free but would suggest the Sky Tree if you don't mind the entrance fee, BUT for the Sky Tree you MUST go early to avoid the queues."

It is a swift ride up to the observation level. And with good weather, what a lovely view. Fujisan is visible when there is no haze, and both SkyTree and Tokyo Tower can be seen 'together'.For good free-of-charge views over Tokyo, this is about as good as it gets.

As soon as exit elevator, from a panoramic window, you can view the whole Tokyo (or almost) from 663ft above the ground . On a clear day, you can also view Mt Fuji (I took a picture from my cellphone, I could see just the top of Mt Fuji which covered with snow). Observation deck also has a gifts shop and cafeteria.I enjoyed this place a lot. The view is awesome and best of all, IT'S FREE. (Where can you find a free attraction in Tokyo? Lol).Tips: - Before you leave, don't forget to get all travel pamphlets from Japan National Tourist Organization (JNTO) office on 1st Floor. This is only place that I could find those pamphlets or brochures in English.- Depends on where are you coming from, these are trains that pass by Shinjuku station: Yamanote, Chuo, Keio, Sobu, Odakyu, and Marunouchi lines."

Before reaching the TMGO, you will come across a huge bookstore which you can take a rest and read some books if you're solo-ing the trip taking time, else, follow the sign board, there will be Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office all the way from Shinjuku Area. With a little help from Google Map, things will be easy and simple.Once you exit the tunnel, look up, and look for the twin looking building which is the TMGO, walk towards it, pass a traffic light, it'll be on your left once you exit the tunnel and another 5 min walk. There is a restaurant located on the observatory level, and 2-3 stores for souvenirs, selling Tokyo Tower's goods, etc. Nice and clean washrooms too.

Unfortunately, the south tower had closed by then (1730) so we had to enter the north tower observatory. There are some great views, especially as the lights came on in the evenings.However, be aware that it is pretty cluttered up there. I guess since it is free, they have to make some money back by putting a small restaurant and stalls selling souvenirs and toys to kids. As a result, navigating around when the place is crowded is a bit tricky plus the restaurant blocks off one entire side.For a free attraction, you can't complain - and it is still a buzz to see the city from so high. Views of Mt Fuji will depend on the weather. We were a bit unlucky that the air wasn't clear enough. Worth a visit but apparently the south tower is better so try and arrive earlier"

The night time views from the top of the tower were excellent, although as had been said in a previous review the lights are on full blast and it does affect the view. The other downside is that 20% of the view (and from what i could glimpse through the partitions, the best views) can only be seen if you are in the restaurant. However it was free and warm and a short walk from Shinjuku Station."

Very quite when I visited but easily located, take the subway to Tochomae and come up exit A4, which is right at the base of the towers. The follow the green signs for observatory, depending on days they open either the south and north tower.I am not sure what made me feel more queasy looking from the top or looking up from the bottom.There are some tourist shops at the top and a caf\u00e9 in one of the towers. They were open till 11pm. Unfortunately for night shots the lights reflect on the graph, so take a coat to cover the camera and lens. Saw Mt Fuji through the mist so on a clear day, it would be excellent.They search the bags at the bottom of the lift."

How much? Free. There is a couple of downsides to the TMG. First, it is not very close to other tourist attractions. Second, there are two towers. Both are free, but because they are almost back-to-back, each tower only has about a 270 degree view. Even with these inconveniences, this is the way that I recommend getting above Tokyo."

Yes, there are great views of Tokyo from either of the two observatories - there are two sections/buildings. However, it really is just a simple observatory only fit for a one hour visit. You will definitely want to come here on a clear day - otherwise, you won't see much. I visited in the afternoon so I don't no if the night view was any better. It is indoor and not outdoor. There are large windows on the observatory floor. There are a few places to sit (e.g. cafe) and there are a few benches.Note that there is a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station, of which part of the walk is uncovered so remember to bring your umbrella if there is the threat of rain. There is a gift shop and cafe in the observatory. There's not much else in the building though as I recall there was a shop or two in the first floor of TMG. If you're short on time during your visit to Tokyo, there are plenty of other places to visit instead."

But it's free, so who am I to complain?On our way out from Tokyo, we stopped by here again for a day time view, this time from the South tower. We were approached by an official guide who was able to show us around and what we were looking at (including a rare view of Mt. Fuji!). She didn't ask for any money or tip, and was quite helpful!I would highly recommend visiting here, especially given its convenience and price (free!)!"

So if you like them, you won't be disappointed by this one, although the view is partly obstructed by a near-by high building, walls of the building itself, and in one corner of the Northern tower there is restaurant prohibiting the view in that direction. That said, you will get a fair share of views in most directions, the restaurant itself is reasonably priced so it may be worth trying (I didn't) esp. for couples, the entrance is free and it's quite close to the train station. The major let-down is the souvenir shop, which is way worse than shops at comparable tourist spots. Recommended overall - you probably want to see Shinjuku at night anyway, it wouldn't take you too long, and you can save a few bucks if you are traveling on budget."

There's clear pictorial displays pointing out important buildings and landmarks (including the elusive Mt Fuji) so you get a sense of where everything is. We were most impressed by the huge park we could see as it was an usual sight amongst such tall buildings. There was a cafe and a souvenir shop at the top although we avoided both due to the price.Worth the trek for a free stunning view.Tip: Visit at dusk and watch the sun go down."

Yes it's free and yes you have a view, however, the elevator ride up to the observation floor is extremely slow and hot. Then once on the floor, since it's floor to ceiling glass it is very, very hot - didn't feel like the air conditioning was even on. Since there is a restaurant on this floor and it is hot, the entire floor did not smell very good. Additionally, suggest using the restrooms on the TMG's ground floor as if you need to use one while on the 45th, must walk down and very dirty (which was surprising) dingy stairwell one floor to use what turned out to be the crummiest public restroom in Japan (had western toilets but I would have preferred to use a nicer Japanese toilet restroom). On the plus side, since we went to the TMG around 5:30 p.m. - 6:00 p.m., there wasn't a very long wait time. I did have to have my bag checked by a security guard which was no big deal - he was very polite and respectful. This was the one and only bag check I had during my entire Japan trip (expect for the airport)."

The view isn't as good as it would be from the south observatory and it is rare that it is clear enough to see all the way to Mt Fuji.

Kinda hard not to visit the place since my hotel room overlooked the building and seeing it everyday merely piqued my curiosity. I didn't think the wait for the elevators was too long, actually--i didn't think it was too busy either. The observatory is divided in half: the North Observatory and the South Observatory. The room was spacious and massive, giving visitors an almost-360 degree view of most of Tokyo. There's a restaurant smack in the center of the room and a souvenir shop near the elevators that descend down to the lobby. Quite a marketing strategy--what do you do when you're waiting in line to go back down? Well, if you have eyes like mines, they'll wonder to the souvenir shop. Yes, I did end up buying things. Hehehe.Honestly, the experience is not only looking at Tokyo's city-scape, but learning the background of the city's famous buildings and landmarks. When I arrived, a couple of nice elderly women handed me an iTouch look-alike device. As I walk to certain areas, I listen to narrations of famous buildings, parks, and stations. Each area of the observatory is equipped with a sensor that pings the audio device notifying the change of view. Basically, the narration changes based on the change of view. Pretty nifty, huh?Gorgeous view. Did I mention admission is free? Yes, it's free. You can't go wrong with an observatory that is free."

There is a restauraunt which takes up one side so you don't really get a 360 degree view but almost.To get good photos we got my coat and put it over my head to black out the glare from the internal lights and make a kind of mini tent around the camera - rested the lens on the glass for satbility and got some really good photos.There are the usual souvenier shops etc on the viewing level but nothing too intrusive.All in all a fantastic free hour or so spent here - certainly worth the effort to get here."

These guides, many of whom are retired, speak good English, and are part of a service provided through the tourism office.

Of course, the view from this spot is slightly impressive, and you can take a good look at the another buildings, but japanese people absolutely neglected of tourists. Sometimes I think that they disdain them. For example, in this observatory they have a restaurant. Nice! But... they close it at 5 p.m.!!! Very disappointing. Almost every park, observatory etc. in Japan close at 5 or 6 p.m. maximum. It's dull, really. They just kill tourism in Japan by their own arms."

If you are in Shinjuku area (whether staying at a hotel in Shinjuku or intending to spend a good part of the day in Shinjuku), TMG is worth a visit (10 to 15min walk from South exit of Shinjuku station). Have yet to visit Tokyo Skytree so can't comment whether or not which building gives a better view but as far as I am concerned, it is more than decent on a clear day, and you can even spot Mount Fuji as well.Apart from both the North and South observatories, there are also tourist information centres - handy for picking up information on various tourist spots in Japan. As well as food outlets (basement levels and on the observatories itself - in North observatory, the cafe actually turns into a chill out bar at night, must say its a cool place to work in, heh) .... a 'hidden gem' will be the staff canteen at level 32 where you can get good value japanese meals for less than 700 yen."

We were in the Shinjuku area and had to stop at the TMG. We had several days of heavy rains, but didn't get to go up the observatory until a few days later (we should have gone right afterwards). Even so, we still had a glimpse of Mt. Fuji. The elevator was fast, and we didn't experience any lines or waiting. Once at the observation deck, an English speaking tour guide showed us some of the major landmarks. Since there wasn't a wait, we also rode the elevator up the other tower's observatory. The views were almost the same, so if there's a long line, don't bother doing both. Overall, this is a must do. It really does complete your \"sky scraper\" tour of Shinjuku - and it's free!"

The views are fantastic and we didn't find the line ups to be that long - we visited during November, not sure what it would be like during the high season. Even with a long wait, the price can't be beat! During the day, we were lucky to have fairly clear skies, the only thing we couldn't see was Mt. Fuji, which seemed to be a trend during our trip. At night, It was incredibly romantic - very few people, mostly young couples - and all the lights twinkling in the distance. Couldn't stop taking photos and videos. The only issue was that the gift shops had tons of lights on in the store and the vending machines, so it was difficult to take pictures - you really have to put your camera right up to the glass, and even then there was some reflection. But other than that, it was beautiful and I'll say again, you can't beat the price!"

The key buildings and landmarks are identified in Japanese and English to assist you with your bearings which I found very useful.

Take your camera, sunglasses (the sun is really blinding up there) and leave your fear of heights/earthquakes at the bottom.

I actually could see top of Mount Fuji from 45th floor. and it was really worth it, moreover considering that it's free. I really suggest you to make some place in your itinerary for a visit to TMG"

The view was nice but nothing to brag about. You can see the \"cocoon\" building, the Tokyo Skytree but overall I was not impressed with the city's panoramic view. Probably as they don't have that many very tall buildings and if you've been on top of Empire State Building that will not impress you, was just ok. I'm happy we didn't go to any of the other buildings that you have to pay for to get on top. This one is free. There are souvenir stands in the middle of the floor and also a restaurant with view."

After reading reviews on TA about all the line ups and long waits to get into the new tower my husband and I opted to take in the birds eye view of Tokyo from the south tower of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building instead on the last day of our 3 day visit in Tokyo. We are so glad we did! Regrettably, it was only after we got there that we learned the north tower is open until 11pm for people to take in a beautiful night view of all the lights of the city which we weren't able to do as we were leaving Tokyo that afternoon. After taking the elevator to the 45th floor, as soon as we got off we were approached by an English speaking volunteer who took us around the 180 degree perimeter of the room to point out and explain various buildings. Some of the architecture was really interesting (the \"cocoon\" building for students of the arts) as well as both of the towers that Tokyo has become and is so famous for. We also saw the building where the Park Hyatt is located, the hotel featured in the Bill Murray movie Lost in Translation.One building she pointed out was 40 years old, with our guide telling us she remembers it being constructed and how special it was due to it's height back then. Since that time, buildings have become taller and taller.We didn't have time to explore the souvenir shop or dine in the cafe, both located on the 45th floor. We did obtain our \"souvenir stamp\" just in front of the elevator before leaving, two stamps actually; one with a picture of these twin towers and the other with the date and the name of the location. The lobby of the building is quite impressive and is directly above the subway, I believe it was the Odeo line. I believe our guide informed us the south tower is closed at 6pm (the north tower 11pm). Our hotel was able to direct us to this attraction so you may wish to have your hotel call to confirm the hours for you.This is definitely a great spot to take in a panoramic view of Tokyo without any cost or line ups for that matter."

Yes, the view from the 45th floor of both the north and south towers is great - and it is free - but what a lot of people don't know is that you can get a great meal from the Government workers cafeteria on the 32nd floor. Even though it is primarily for the workers of this building, the public is allowed in as well. My top tip for lunch or dinner is to go to the 32nd floor of the north tower of the Metropolitan Government Office Building. There is a cafeteria for the workers there but the public is allowed in. Meals are very reasonable (all around 550Y) and the servings are large. Also provide free cold water. We ate here nearly every night as it was much better value that the restaurants around Shinjuku. The food was hot and fresh. When you get out of the lift on the 32nd floor, turn right and walk down the hallway about 150 metres. Food displays will be on the left down a small hallway. Note there are two lots of food displays so look at both before making your decision. Most of the words are in Japanese, but there is some english. But looking at the displays you can get a good idea of what each meal is. Then put your money into the vending machine and choose the corresponding number to the meal you want. Take the ticket to the counter and the staff will get your meal. Then sit at a table near the window for a great view over Shinjuku (remember you are on the 32nd floor). Return your tray to the mobile food racks (you can't miss them). If you are staying in the Shinjuku area, this is a real bargain, Enjoy!"

The view is very good (the places that you see are marked and named in a map next to the window, so you actually know what you are seeing). However, there is a lot of space around the windows that are used for multiple exhibitions, so it's a little busy. There is a restaurant also in the center of the floor, but has almost no view of the city beneath, since it's surronded by 4 foot high potted plants. A souvenir shop is also available.

I went at night and unfortunately the interior lighting is so bright and close to the mirrors they will ruin all your pictures. It's painful to travel to japan with expensive photography equipment with the hope of getting beatiful nighttime skyline shots only to find out that the interior setup is geared more towards selling you kitchy souvenirs than providing a proper observation platform.Second, a majority of the east facing windows, the ones you WANT to be looking thru are dedicated for a restaurant. So non-restaurant patrons have to fight over limited viewing space. There are more windows facing west but all you'll see is bland featureless suburbs.Honestly, I'd recommend going over to the Rippongi City View observation deck instead. It costs money, but the setup there is fantastic. At night the areas by the windows are isolated and not lit, photographers will be able to capture wonderful photos here."

Making it even more memorable is the free guided tour from English speaking docents. The very sweet lady who walked me around the observatory was 56 like me and was able to add her own insight into the growth of Tokyo from post- war years to the present. This conversation was totally unexpected and very memorable. Take the 10 minute walk west from Shinjuku station. It will be well worth your time."

Apparantly you can see all the way to Mount Fuji on a good day but it was too hazy for us to see that far. We took some really good photos as we were allowed cameras, which was good. There was a cafe but we didn;t have anything. There was also a few little displays, where I was able to dress up as a Japanese farmer & an underwater diver, getting ridiculous but fun pictures taken.

The day I was there wasn't so clear, but you're so far up, you can still see quite a large portion of Shinjuku. Worth the money, and make sure you check out all the windows, the view is different from some of them."

There are two observatories on the 45th floor at 202 m. On a clear day you might see mount Fuji. Overall you get a great 360 degree view of Tokyo, for free. It is also the starting place for the annual Tokyo marathon, so for many of us it's an emotial place to return to. To sum it up: it is wort the visit for the great view alone. In my opinion the view of the city is not surpassed by Tokyo tower especially if you can visit in the evening as well."

I was there my first stay day in Tokyo and this visit was really usefull. The view from observatory, I only can tell it are great."

I went to the observation level twice \u2013 once during the day on a tour of the building with a volunteer guide, and again at night to see the Tokyo lights. The guided tour is worthwhile in its own right \u2013 some interesting features got pointed out and a lot of questions I had about the buildings were answered. The trip to the observation level was a bonus, and the fact that it was free was even better. The guide said that on a clear day Mt Fuji can be seen \u2013 the direction to look is marked above a window. (In fact, a lot of landmarks are named on the displays above the windows.)"

If you're in Shinjuku you should walk over to the the Tokyo Metropolitan Government buildings, each of which has a free top floor very large observatory with 360 degree views. When we went there was a man playing the flute and we met a Japanese man who hangs around taking photos and teaching people origami for free. We even got to see Mt. Fuji, which was pretty amazing since it had rained that morning. Highly recommended. It's on the west side of the train station with all the skyscapers."

Unfortunately this was a big waste of time by the time we travelled from our Tokyo hotel to the TMG by train and did all the walking in the train tunnels, etc...then found our way to the TMG elevators, and waited to go up...and just do a brief look at Tokyo from this vantage point. I imagine it to be much more interesting to the Japanese who are more familiar with what city buildings they are seeing. I think it would be worth your time if you were at a nearby hotel, but it isn't worth the time to travel there to see it. Our time would have been much better spent doing other things."

The view from the government offices is every bit as good as from the Tokyo tower, and you are that much closer to Mount Fuji so are a bit more likely to get a glimpse of it through the haze. Shinjuku station is a treat in itself to experience the ultimate crowds and it is not far to walk to the municipal buildings; mostly along moving walkways and all signposted in English too. The coffee shop on the viewing level was a complete rip off but entrance was free so I guess it evens out."

As busy as the streets are, and as looming as the neon-covered buildings can be, you can't ever really get a true feeling for the sheer endlessness of Tokyo until you have looked down upon it from above. To say that the view from this building is completely staggering would be to understate it. Access to the building and observation deck is completely free (but you must pass through the gift shop on your way out). Of everything I saw in Tokyo, the TMG Building stands above all else. The breathtaking three-sixty degree view of Tokyo in all it's glory (with Fuji-san visible on a clear day) makes it very clear how you fit 12 million people into a city: you make it unfathomably huge!This place is free to visit, quietly beautiful, and mind-bendingly fascinating. I don't think any visit to Tokyo would be complete without seeing it."

            "review": "View Tokyo From a Free Observation Floor at Tokyo City Hall. The vast urban vista of Tokyo can be viewed for free from the two observation floors of the Tokyo City Hall building. Standing at 48 floors tall, the City Hall building is one of the tallest in Tokyo and is a striking design by the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. There are two observation floors on the 45th floor of both the North and South towers. The South tower observation floor offers a view towards Meiji Shrine and Tokyo Bay can be viewed on a clear day. The North tower offers a view of the urban sprawl towards Saitama. An express elevator, which is boarded on the 1st floor of the tower, takes visitors to the observation floors in 55 seconds. Each tower hosts a simple food outlet - the South tower has a coffee shop, while the North tower has an Italian themed cafe. The North tower also has a large souvenir stand operated by Hakuhinkan, the famous Ginza toy retailer. Better and cheaper food is available across from the 1st floor of the main tower in the Citizen's Underground Plaza (Tomin Chika Hiroba), with excellent and cheap Japanese and Western food available. Try the Tonkatsu restaurant for delicious and traditional Japanese style pork cutlet. Although not fancy, the City Government makes a good effort at providing a quality attraction at a great price - free. Its not as flashy as Roppongi Hills, but worth a visit.One disappointment is the observation tower closes at 1730, so is not suitable for viewing Tokyo's dramtic night scene. A trip over to Roppongi Hills is the alternative."

For a city which is relatively taxing on the wallet for a budget traveller, this is a good breather in between shopping and shrine trips. We stayed at the Shinjuku Washington and naturally visited TMG which was a hop skip and a jump across. There are 2 towers and I suggest that you visit both of them. Though the view from up there seems similar when you're there, the photos I brought back with me suggested otherwise. We didn't manage to see Mt Fuji as it was super foggy but the view of the city was just breathtaking. There are shops at the viewing gallery selling all sorts of souvenirs which is great if you're hard-pressed for time and need to get something cute for someone back home. There are these gachapon machines (slot in 100yen and turn the knob to get a plastic ball with an item inside) with small keychains and handphone thingys which look like they date back to the 80s. Nice...There's a park nearby which had a mini flea market when we visted TMG on a saturday. I'm not sure if it's a weekly event but we managed to pick up some 2nd hand clothing and cool knick knacks."

I stayed in a hotel in a different area of Tokyo, a low-rise building, so I seriously enjoyed the high-rise view of Tokyo.. Wow, Tokyo is a really huge area taking advantage of every square inch of space. The observing area is an entire floor, so you have a lot of space and look out the windows. No open air area here. Height of the building is on the shorter side of large skyscrappers but one of the tallest in Japan (I imagine due to Japan's higher engineering requirements due to earthquakes most buildings aren't built so tall). Anyways, it's FREE to go up. Yes, Free. No lines the time I went either, though of course YMMV. Now as I said, the trip was worth it to me because I stayed in a different area of Tokyo that was completley different in scenery (Ikebukuro) so I really liked to see the modern Shinjuku area, which reminds me of downtown LA when I went during the weekend (i.e. ghost town). If one was already staying in Shinjuku then they may not find it worth the time at all, I could understand that."
