The Tokyo Tower had great views of the city and was fun to see all the Halloween decorations but probably pricey since you only spend 15-30 mins on the observation decks.

The friends I went to see the Tokyo Tower with said they thought it was a budget Skytree, but I disagree - the Skytree is impressive and it is its own sort of enjoyment to look down on everything, but the Tokyo Tower is about the same level as the skyline in every direction, so you get to see skyscrapers, lights and traffic all around.I recommend going at night - we arrived in the afternoon and spend a couple of hours on the observation deck, into night time - the lights and were fantastic! Spent a good while taking long-exposure photos of nearby highways and such.Tokyo Tower and Skytree both have their place, I highly recommend visiting both."

Go there at night with a can of Asahi and enjoy the lighting up at sunset. Romantic to the max."

( one pieace is a famous anime ) they have two/three floors that is just a one pieace experience with photo options, restaurants and interactive games. They even have a show with all the characters from the show. You don't have to be a fan of the anime to fully enjoy the experience. I believe that you can do the whole experience in 2.5 hours, IF the tower and experience isn't too crowded. You have the options of gout chasing a double ticket to go up to the tokyo tower and one pieace experience or you can just go up to the tower.When you go up to the tower, I recommending timing it out so you can take some photos with the daylight and watching the city turn into lights. We went during a weekday, which is probably why we could do the whole experience in 3.5 hours"

Easy to find as it is enormous so just head towards the tower! We arrived at 920 and as the tower opens at 9am it was still very quiet. Good cafes and souvenirs and the staff are so friendly and helpful. We stayed about an hour and once we were leaving it began to get quite busy with many buses arriving. I recommend going early. We can also see the tower from our room at night which is a beautiful sight. The tower is very easy to get around with a pram. The tower aquarium is more like a fish store so I wouldnt bother with that."

It was a fairly nice day with a bit of cloud when we visited but we could not see Mount Fuji (a star attraction!) although we had seen it from our hotel room in the distance on previous days. The service was very friendly and it's always good to get a 360 degree view of a city to get your bearings. The glass floor viewing panels are a great idea but we could only go to the 150ft viewing gallery. Apparently a higher one is under construction"

There was no option to climb steps, the only way up was by elevator. The views from the top were pretty good, with Mount Fuji visible in the distance. The Sky tree may be a higher tower, but was probably busier."

Here's how vising works (on your own, not a tour.)You pay at the base for an elevator ride to the 1/2 way point. I did not experience any line to go up. You walk around, looking out huge windows, on the middle observation deck. If you wish to go to the top, you must purchase your tickets on the middle deck and take another elevator up. I did not do this, and stayed in the first deck.There is a tourist shop in the center of the room. There you may purchase Tokyo Tower themed souvenirs. Note that they sell post cards (and stamps) and if you mail the card from the middle deck, the cards receive a special postage stamp.Famous landmarks are pointed out and labeled at various windows, including Mt. Fuji (which is not always visible, and was not the day we went.)Overall, this was a cool observation deck. Visitors get an impressive, sprawling view of the city. And their system of purchasing halfway first was logical. I can't say this is the best observation deck Tokyo has to offer, but it's charming and if you have time, I recommend it.The ground floor of the tower is filled with shops selling traditional Japanese objects, to food and beverages."

However, the Tokyo Tower is in my opinion a must-do.It's not as tall as the SkyTree, but that's a good thing. SkyTree is also worth a visit but it's views are from such a height that they almost resemble those seen from a plane. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Tower offers a slightly closer to Earth view which really allows you to appreciate the scope of the city. The views are less expansive but no less breathtaking. I'd recommend going up the tower about an hour before sunset and staying up there to see the sun disappear behind the buildings. It seems the tower has recently been acquired by the group who own One Piece (the animated show). This doesn't mean much to me, but didn't subtract from the overall experience. If you're a fan of the show, I'm sure you'll enjoy this even more.When you're done on the observation deck, be sure to visit the Crepe store just outside at the base of the tower for a delicious, cheesecake-filled crepe!"

Granted I didn't understand the Godzilla merchandise connection, and the 'lookdown windows' were stunningly mediocre (geez even my 2 year old jumped up and down on them with disdain) but we lingered a lot longer than expected and enjoyed the experience."

Like a lot of famous attractions abroad I felt an obligation to see this, even if it's not my cup of tea.The most enjoyable part for me was the journey to the tower. There are some nice parks and shrines on the way and it was nice to take a slow walk through the area.The tower itself is impressive and striking with its bright orange colour. Standing beneath it was a great moment, as it's a landmark I've always seen pop up in movies and on TV.The line for tickets was small. I'm guessing this was in part due to it being a week day, and in part because the (taller) Tokyo skytree is now the more popular tower. I paid for the the main level. There is another level above it but I decided the extra cost wasn't worth it, as I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about going up the tower anyway. The lift takes you up to your level, which the operator will help you find depending on the ticket purchased. The view is alright, but it's really just concrete jungle as far as the eye can see. I'm told that on a clear day you can see Fuji, but it wasn't visible on this particular day. I'm not hugely fussed on views anyway so I found it a bit boring, and I was over it after 5 mins. The floor windows are cool. You can see how far off the ground you are, but the mesh and what not blocks the view a bit.I explored the other levels on the way down. One of them had a lot of Godzilla memorabilia on display. I'm not sure if this was a special event at the time or whether it's always there, but I found it to be pretty interesting.All in all I'm glad I can say I've done it, but it wasn't thrilling. It certainly didn't make me want to go and see Tokyo skytree. Not a bad thing, as imagine it would be more of the same, more expensive, and a lot more crowded."

Arrived at the ticket booth with price for lower viewing point, special viewing point, both of them which we got at the price of \u00a51600 or the One Piece Viewing if you're a fan of that Anime. After easy purchase, we were greeted and went up the first elevator. On the lower viewing there's a gift shop and photo booth which offers to do your picture with theirs which you can buy (\u00a51300) and a picture of it on one of your cameras. The special viewing is a smaller elevator to a smaller room but massive view, and on a clear day get a free distant viewing of Mount Fuji. We made our way down and down the stairs of the floors we missed and found the glass floor panels with a near by restaurant and then a whole floor of souvenirs and food retailers. It is cheapest in comparison to the sky tree. An amazing experience and a good price to have a look at the city and maybe even Mount Fuji on a very clear day. Highly Recommended if you don't want to do both towers in Tokyo!"

Unfortunately the mist and rain came so the distance you should have seen to the mountains was obliterated. There are the usual gift shops and cafes but not much seating. Also photographer to take staged pictures. On the lower floors many shops selling clothes, fancy goods and food. Well worth a visit.

But there is a helpful printout of the skyline and buildings of interest to help orient you, if you are interested in seeing those things. The main observatory has a \"look down window\", a plate of glass you can stand on and see from your shoes all the way to the ground. While not as tall as the flashy Skytree, the Tokyo Tower is still an important part of Tokyo and has a really cute little mascot too. Go early in the morning or at night to avoid the crowds."

It was STUNNING! Of course, the lights are dimmed in order to limit glare on the windows, so this can make it a bit of a challenge when taking photos. That might be irritating if you feel like \"why do it if you can't post it?\" But I think it's a wonderful place to be in the moment. It's on the pricey side, but to me it was worth it. I live in the U.S. and it may be years before I am able to go back, but the memories will stay with me until then."

The Tokyo Tower is a great place to get some good views and a great impression of how large Tokyo actually is.Even from the lower platforms you get a decent view, but like with all towers the grand gem is the view from the top platform.The lower platforms have quite a few shops and attractions so it is a place to visit should you have bad weather on the outside.Just keep in mind that the lines to get in here can be loooong, especially around the evenings when it is getting dark (due to the great views of the city lights in the evenings) and also on hot days (due to the fact that the observations platforms are all air conditioned). Standing in line in the summer heat isn't actually too bad as they always remember to keep those small vapor dispensers over the lines to keep things cool.So check the conditions, set aside some time for standing in line and enjoying the views from the platforms and don't forget to bring a camera. The Tokyo Tower is worth the visit!"

If you are a big fan of One Piece, I'd recommend a visit to Tokyo Tower even if you don't go up, but for non-fans who've already seen Tokyo from above (e.g. from Skytree), Tokyo Tower offers nothing but crowds and waiting times."

There were cartoons encouraging you ever 25M or so.The 150M observatory was worth the trip. Amazing views including a floor viewing below. Then purchase another ticket and go up another 100M. This was great. The later it got the easier to see Mt Fuji it was. The Panoramic picks came out amazing. I would gladly pay again for both experiences.A must do in Tokyo. It's a historic ICON."

Wait in the normal queue (cheapest) depending on the queue it can take an hour to reach the top.2. Express which was the option we took. 15 minutes from buying the ticket to the top. Which gives you access to the normal viewing platform which is a 360 degree view with glass floor platform. Same view as the standard just quicker too see. 3. Straight to the top above the normal viewing platform (didn't do this option as we arrived at 1pm and the view was hazy) We didn't manage to see Mt Fuji due to the haze. I believe before 10pm is best for those viewings. I would advise you e mail them and they will advise better. Seeing Mt Fuji from the tower is going to be incredible picture opportunity and not one to be missed out on."

Once inside, there were eating places and stores on the lower levels to entertain before proceeding up the viewing decks/observatories.Weather is obviously a big factor. Fortunately, in March we were blessed with perfect weather and a full moon. We did both the regular and special observatory...I'm not sure the special observatory was worth the extra money but since it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, we did it anyway, especially since the weather was so good. The inside is dimly lit so it's kinda hard to get decent pics...so plan accordingly."

I loved the fact that they had a little post office inside where you can send cards. You can buy the stamps and the cards from the souvenir shop, but make sure you have some cash with you, as you can't purchase stamps with credit card. While you're here, make sure you walk around the tower and you'll find at least two temples which you can visit. I don't remember the names though, but it's worth it to walk around the area."

I've read many reviews saying that going up on Tokyo Tower isn't worth spending 1.600 Yen (900 Yen main observation deck + 700 Yen special observation deck). I doubt that. I went there in the evening hours and there was no waiting line in front of the ticket booth and the lower elevators. In deed there was a waiting line (about 20 minutes) for the elevators going up from the main observation deck to the special observation deck. But the view from the special observation deck is stunning and worth the additional waiting time and additional price. When you go there after sunset, make sure you have a good camera that is able to take good low light pictures.Although there were many people I could still get around the deck to take good pictures of all directions.Going down back to the main observation deck means another time waiting for about 5 to 10 Minutes. On the way down from the main observation deck you pass by a caf\u00e9 and a stage (club 333). When I went down a popular J-Pop girl group was performing on the stage so it was really crowded but a funny experience.There are several shops, attractions and restaurants on the lower levels of the tower mainly for kids and teenagers. I just bought Tokyo Bananas to eat on my way back to the hotel."

We also went up to the next level. Once up there we saw a lady cleaning the windows on the outside. She was in a harness and had a bungee like rope strapped to her. The panel on the outside where she was standing weren't overly wide. I must admit my family and I spent most of the time we were up there just looking at her while she worked. It was a little freaky. After we came down back to the first level, there were some kids entertainment. After we left the tower we descended to a food court where we had lunch. The food court was reasonably priced. There was also a couple of souvenir shops that we were able to get a few things at. Would recommend visiting the Tower especially if you are staying in the Shiba Park area."

Worth a visit if you are in Tokyo but it's quite expensive. $900 yen per adult to get to the first observation deck and then you pay further amount to walk up to the next observation deck (takes about 14 mins to walk up - no elevator)There was a light installation on the first observation deck which was nice at night, but the glass was quite scratched and it's looking a bit old, so if you want to get a good clean photo - it might be a bit hard."

Great experience!In comparison to the Skytree it is a reasonably priced ghost town. Cannot remember the price, but after a week in Tokyo it seemed cheap.Walked straight in, the wait for the elevator was just that, no people queuing in front of us.The view I felt was better too, the tower is in the heart of Tokyo and it feels like there is a multitude of things to see in every direction. You can see the ferris wheel at Odaiba, Shinjuku and Shibuya are clear.We went later in the evening, and had a first walk around in the daylight. We sat in the cafe for 30 minutes (tip - the coffee is the worst coffee I have had in my life - get a water) while the kids had an icecream and it went dark.then we went up to the upper observation deck and had a walk round in the dark and checked out the lights.Great experience.If you do go, try to find out when sundown is on goodle and go there 30 minutes before, get the day and night views. The shrine just down the hill was worth a visit too."

Lemme tell you...going all the way to the top was not worth it. If you wanna go up, pay the fee to go up but don't pay the extra fee to go all the way to the top. There was a little cafe inside the second tier and the views of Tokyo at night were fantastic.When we decided to go see what the top was all about, we were a bit disappointed. First, the line at the elevator to go up was long, and once we got to the top, it felt very crowded because the space is pretty small. The views are essentially the same. As soon as we got up, we immediately got in the line that wrapped around the top floor to go back down because the line was so long (we just looked out the windoes from the line). We wished we had just stayed on the 2nd tier. We also wish we had known this before paying to go all the way to the top, which leads me to write this review. That being said, I recommend going at night :). Happy travels!"

Experience :-\"A beacon of Light in the darkness that overlook Tokyo\"Having resided in Daiba on my previous trip, sights of the Tokyo Tower were frequent, especially in the evenings when it shore ever so brightly; although I did not have a chance to pay a visit then.This time though, it was one of my designated locations - it does not disappoint. Fresh out from Hamamatsucho Station, I walked through the streets that led to a temple along the path to the Tower. It was plenty scenic with the Lights from the Tower shining through the Cherry Blossoms. For many like myself that may not yet have a chance to see the Eiffel Tower, this is probably the closest thing next to it. Apart from a glorious view from the observatory, the Tower also offers many eateries and gift shop; in particular the One Piece Tower which I did end up grabbing many souvenirs.Tips/Advice:-1) Preferred Time of Visiting? Strongly encourage to visit in the evenings.2) Admission Fee? Vicinity is free to enter but heading to Observatory Decks cost between 900-1600 yen.Wayne\u2019s ratings (As ticked):-i) Must-GO!ii) Recommended \u2714\u2714\u2714iii) Nay.. or best go as a fillerIt is short of Must-GO! from my experience due to the Observatory Decks and One Piece Tower costing quite a fair bit to enter. Definitely visit if you wish to get a good view of Tokyo's night and surroundings.PS: Thank you for reading and hope my input and photos help."

It's imposing as you get close and we were excited to go up.You have two choices, one to go to the observation deck and an upgrade to go the top of the tower. We went to the top!!!The elevator ride from the observation tower to the top was with the price. It's hit a bump almost at the top and you freak out. And then you arrive and take pictures and go back down. Touristy yes, but a must do. Filled with other folks doing the same.The staff are so polite and nice. The four stars is just the very basic food and gift choices. Not much to do other than look at least for me. Epic views and pay for the upgrade. Eat somewhere else. "

This place is a great start to your Tokyo adventure as it allows you to see the whole sprawling urban jungle that is Tokyo from the all directions. On a good day (this was not one for my experience) one can see Mt. Fuji in the distance unless it's cloudy. The price is a little steep but it's Japan so probably not the most expensive cool thing you'll do here. I would suggest to do your souvenir shopping downstairs once you come down on the 3rd floor is some great and sometimes better less expensive options on Tokyo tower items. Try the the custard filled pastry down here too it's delicious. Try to avoid during cloudy days as you'll be getting mostly gray skies."

The gift shop was kind of cute although nothing to get super excited about. They sold a lot of Tokyo tower themed merchandise, of course, like cookies, charms, postcards, etc. Overall I enjoyed my time there and feel that the price was worth it.

Well, the views from Tokyo Tower didn't disappoint and the smaller crowds make it more memorable. To get there, I used the Toei-Asakusa line to the Daimon station, and then it's a 10-15 minutes walk to the Z\u014dj\u014d-ji Temple first. From there, it's another 10 minutes or so.

A few of the detracting features of the tower include smallish windows that are tinted oddly making taking unobstructed, clear pictures a little difficult; cheesy music and bright blue lights while you are on the observation levels that are distracting; in order to get to the very top, it requires buying two separate tickets in different lines which can be a pain when it is busy; and outside lights get turned off sporadically which ruins the outside aesthetics. Overall, I would highly recommend saving yourself the lines and going to one of the fabulous observation bars or restaurants whose views are spectacular and the ambiance is much better."

Greeted by plastic models of the Tokyo Tower's two mascots named Noppon, we had to wait for the tower to open at 9am. We paid to go to the large and the main observatory 1600 yen (about $16 in May 2016). Its well worth the trip if you like towers / skyscrapers. It was hazy when we were up there but the views of Eastern Tokyo were still worth it. There is a restaurant, aquarium and some great hawker stores in Foot Town. Outside is a pleasant beer garden. Well worth a trip coupled with the Zojo-ji temple close by"

When this was built it was the tallest tower in the world but now that Tokyo is a land of high rises you can get great views from other spots. Currently ranking at #22 in the world, in1958 it edged out the Eiffel Tower built in 1889, which it copied, by 8 meters. While not nearly as spectacular as the Eiffel Tower either, which stands like a monolith in a vast park, towering over the much lower city around it, Tokyo Tower nevertheless gets you up well enough to see the massive and endless city of skyscrapers stretched around it. Also close to the bay, you get a good view in that direction.Cheaper than the Tokyo Sky Tree, which almost doubles it in height, I have been up here 2x on two separate trips. Years ago when I stayed in Shinjuku we went to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building there (free and higher than TT observation deck) and as it was winter the air was clear and the great Fuji-san rose majestic in the distance. But this last time when I went up it was a bit hazy, hence Fuji was invisible. Nonetheless it was cool to see my hotel below, Zojo-ji, and the city I had been exploring on foot."

However the visit up to the viewing area of Tokyo Tower is not that expensive in comparison....$20-$30 depending on whether or not you want the express line. Once your up the top it's standing room only...literally, there is no general seating. The 360 degrees view of Tokyo are outstanding and well worth the effort. Movement up and down the tower is relatively smooth considering the number of people visiting and the staff facilitating this are very good. Yes, there is a wait but that's life. For me, this is a must do in Tokyo."

As it turned out, we were wanting to go to the Skytree, but asked the concierge for directions to the Tokyo Tower (forgot there were two \"towers\") by mistake. And we did not originally plan to visit either tower, but it had rained the day before so the skies were clear and sunny, we decided it would be a great chance to look at the city.The view at the Tokyo Tower did not disappoint. We even saw Mt Fuji, was was really awesome! There was almost no waiting at the Tower. The whole time, I kept thinking, \"where is everyone\". From the Tower, we saw the Skytree and realized that's where we wanted to go. We did go, since it was such a beautiful day. There were soooo many more people at the Skytree! The regular line was going to take 40 minutes to an hour, so we paid extra for the express line, which took about 10 minutes. We did not go all the way to the top (had to pay extra). While the Skytree is very impressive, if all you want is a great view of Tokyo, you should consider the Tower instead. Shorter lines (no lines when we were there) and cheaper but still very good views. (We did not go to the top of the Skytree but did go to the top of the Tower, so we can't comment about that)."

Totally recommended to visit if you travel to Tokyo. They have good coffee shops in the lower floors of the tower, some souvenir shops and restaurants (including a Hello Kitty Japanese Restaurant). Tickets are not that cheap, but is worth the price."

The tix was quite pricey I think. We (price for 2 persons) spend Y1800+Y1400(for upper deck). Try visiting this tower when you are having birthday, they might give you something (I forgot). The observation area is not really spacious, so expect long queue to get in, to wander around and to go down. We waited for around 30-45mins to go from lower deck to upper deck, because of the structure, they can only put 1 lift (to go up and down). In the upper deck you can see more clearly. Less people, of course coz we pay more :p. When going down the tower you can choose 'outside stairs', however due to the wind they won't allow us that time to go outside.At ground level there are lots of shops and resto/food court. Try visiting around 4:30pm then you can see this tower with blue sky then when it gets dark, pretty illumination will come out."

Additionally, Tokyo Skytree is way taller than this, so I recommend seeing one attraction during the day and the other during the night. You wont' regret seeing this during the night!You can Spot Odaiba's Giant Ferris wheel and many Tokyo's landmarks. The night view of Tokyo is amazing too!Bring your camera and comfortable shoes, as you'll have to walk a few blocks before arriving, and you'll have so many souvenirs to buy that you may get tired.If you're fan of Animes, there's a special priced ticket with both Tokyo Tower + One Piece Tower pass, which we bought (around 45 dollars).Another important thing: Go see this attraction before Skytree, otherwise you might be disappointed with this one."

Although the the glass isn't very crystal clear and so you view is not sharp in photos, it's very romantic.

It was well worth it as there were fewer people up there with an even better view. Another nice thing was that after coming down from the second observation deck, we were allowed to wander around again on the main observation deck to enjoy the views one more time before heading down.One thing that I found out after I got there is that there is a huge shop on the first floor that is dedicated to one piece. I knew that there was a One Piece amusement park and I was hoping for a souvenir shop but I was overjoyed to see such a large shop dedicated just to One Piece. There is also a decent general anime/figure shop on the second floor that actually had very good prices compared to some of the stores we saw in Akihabara.Overall we were very happy that we chose Tokyo Tower over Tokyo Skytree."

So we had to be sorted into tours then transported by bus be prepared to use the 3rd seat (it is a little seat which swings out from a main seat which sits in the aisle)to bus depot which was where we picked up a more comfortable coach. From there to the Tokyo tower - it was a good view of Tokyo - same ideas as the Eiffel Tower The Japanese tea ceremony was very traditional - lovely The imperial gardens was a bit disappointing as all views from a distanceLunch was good value at the Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo was on Japanese hot stone - this the highlight for us Then onto the cruise on Sumida River - ordinary nothing spectacular The onto the Sensoji Temple - combination markets & temple. If you don't want to shop then not much more to do. The temple is beautiful. There are plenty of street foods available. They drop you off at railway station, for us it was Tokyo station with instructions to back to your accommodation. We chose to take a cab which from Tokyo station to Shinjuku was 2500yen. Our tour guide was lovely and made sure everyone was enjoying itValue for money I felt. "

The lights in the toilet made it look nice, it makes you feel like you are in outer space, it was the nicest toilet I have used in my life. The lift going up the tower was very nice as the lights were very special and it kept changing colours. There was also a piece of glass to look down from the tower, it was scary. There were also computer games for young children to play, I wanted to play but unfortunately I cannot read Japanese. There were beautiful lights almost everywhere inside the tower. The way they used the lights to decorate the place made it extremely nice and serene. They even made a normal stairs look very nice by putting lights. Tokyo Tower would be a nice place to visit and I would recommend it and go again.Ethan Kor (12 y.o.)"

            "review": "Tokyo Tower may have lost its luster due to Skytree, but they manage to make things exciting with new attractions. Tokyo Tower is one of the most recognized towers in the world. Now the second-tallest structure in Japan (#1 is Tokyo Skytree), Tokyo Tower functioned as a communications and observation tower.Built in 1958 and did its job of broadcasting radio signals, unfortunately when Japan transitioned to digital television, the height was not good enough to support complete terrestrial digital broadcasting and so, Tokyo Skytree was built for that purpose and was made public back in 2012.As the main revenue source for Tokyo tower was antenna leasing and tourism, and for decades, many paying to take photos from the main observatory and the special observatory, with many flocking to Tokyo Skytree, many wondered what would happen to Tokyo Tower.Fortunately, Tokyo Tower managed to bring in tourists with the same observatories but also with the addition of the \"One Piece\" Tokyo Tower (Tokyo One Piece Tower) attraction.The special observatory is 250m (9:00-22:00 which costs 1,600 yen for HS students and older and includes both observatories, 1000 yen for JR HS students and 800 yen for four years and older) and the main observatory is 150m (9:00-22:00 and costs 900 yen for HS students and older, 500 yen for elementary students and 400 yen for four years of age and older).For the Tokyo One Piece Tower, price is 3900 yen (HS students and older), 3500 yen for JR HS students, 2000 yen for elementary school and 1900 yen for four-years old and older.First floor is the lobby and aquarium plus restaurants. Second floor is the cafe and restaurants + Souvenir Shop. Third floor is the Official Shop, Lovespo Tokyo and where to purchase tickets for Tokyo One Piece Tower and fourth and fifth floor is now occupied by Tokyo One Piece Tower.As for the observatories, you can get really cool shots of the skyline. For me, it was great to visit and compare my father's 1972 photos with my photos of how things look today and how much the area has changed.Tokyo One Piece Tower is great for those who enjoy the \"One Piece\" manga and anime series.And I also enjoyed the areas that showcased the history of the building of Tokyo Tower.Overall, Tokyo Tower is still a happening place to visit and not as crowded as Tokyo Skytree. Also, make this a trip of going to Tokyo Tower and then across the street to Zozoji Temple.Recommended!"

For my wife and I, it holds many good memories from our past visits. Nevertheless, it'll still be our first stop in Tokyo for our subsequent trips to Japan."

It was valentine's day and it was a popular choice for couples who were getting their photos taken with the tower in the background. There was a winter festival theme with fairy lights and pine trees which looked very pretty for everyone's photos. It was a great way to spend the evening. There was a cafe at the top serving food and drink and there was a singer entertaining the diners. Apparently there are often live bands here at weekends and not only valentine's day.

In my opinion i think its much better to go up to the very top, you will get the greatest view of the city and will even be able to see, the much larger, Tokyo Skytree.

The Zojoji Shrine which is a family shrine for the Tokugawa Family is near the base of the Tower, next to the Tokyo Prince Hotel."

We went in January so it was still decked out in Christmas lights and they had a winter-esque projector show going on in the Tower. The Tower has landmarks written in on the walls to show where the places are in relation to it. It's pretty neat. Would love to go back during the day with a pair of binoculars.Unfortunately, since we went late, the Aquarium was already closed so we didn't get to see that. They had a Once Piece shop on the ground floor and it had great stuff."

We tried all the elevated viewing items and would rate them Municipal Building Shinjuku, Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree in that order. Our trip to the Skytree had weather issues. Our day at Tokyo Tower was on a clear morning. No lines and not very crowded. Our views were rather good but Mt Fuji was hard to make out. I liked that you could match the labeled photos to the view so you knew what you are looking at. They also had two glass panels in the floor so you could stand on them and look straight down. We also stopped by one night just to see the Tower lit-up at night which was rather impressive. I probably would not go a second time but it is definitely worth the visit at least once while in Tokyo. We rode the subway and when we came out of the subway the Tower was right in front of us so we only had a 3 - 4 block walk. I am not a curio shop type person but they had a lot of them in the Tower."

Although older and more simple than the new Tokyo Skytree, it is still a nice spot to chill and relax. On a good and nice day, you can see the Tokyo Disneyland and Mount Fuji from the observation deck. At the foor of the tower are shops selling all kinds of Tokyo Tower related goods from shirts to keychains to mugs. There are a variety of goods to see. Some cafes and restaurants are also at the foot of the tower. If you have no plans to go up the tower, you could just shop around the shops, it's still a nice experience. There is not much crowds on weekdays. But if there is a special event going on, the crowd can be large. Personally, i prefer Tokyo Tower than Tokyo Skytree because of it's simplicity and design."

In Japan, people believe we are born with 108 earthly desires, which are removed when the temples bells across Japan are struck 108 times. It was a nice experience as I was able to witness a different kind of New Year\u2019s Eve celebration. Tokyo Tower is like the Eiffel Tower of Asia \u2013 easily spotted with bright orange light at night.

Be sure to get the discount if you bought the tower ticket itself.We spent 2 hours on the first level. There is a nice cafe there with soft cream. We were lucky to watch a free jazz show there. We've made key chains with our names and the date on them. Piece of advice, take many photos before the sunsets. There is a see-through, glass, floor panel. It's a great photo spot. They also take your photo professionally with your own camera for free. My sister bought a printed copy for 1000 Yen. We decided to go to the top after sunset. It was a great move. We got to see the Ferris Wheel lit. Toilets are clean. No Halal food though, so Muslims, take a snack with you.For One Piece fans, there is a HUGE place for you to go crazy there.Overall, a great experience. Don't go on rainy or cloudy days."

There were no place for a good photograph, under the Tower was a outdoor carpark.13 meters taller than its model, the Eiffel Tower which we had visited it before Tokyo Tower. Eiffel Tower doesn't blocked by any building, you able to see the Tower everywhere around it, you can have many great photo shots or sit on the big field land next to the Tower to relax your feet & mind.Not attractive at all, not worth during our visited! Definitely will not go back!Thanks for the vote if you found this helpful :D"

The place has a great one piece store, restaurant, and cafe in addition to the attraction. Also, the viewing floor is decent. There's a nami casino (not a real casino), Sogeking shooting area, Franky Hentai Gatcha , Franky cola restaurant, Sanji buffet restaurant, mini games, zoro vs kuma game. Really. It's just so much fun. I am a little biased because this has been one of my favourite cartoons since I was young. The one piece live action show was GREAT. In addition to this, there are also a number of souvenir shops and restaurants. This is definitely a must do for one piece fans."

It has a nice view of Tokyo but you cannot take decent panorama shot of the city since there are rails/divider (not sure about the case in the higher deck).One thing that i like is the snow globe!!! They have a nice one at 1200\u00a5. No need to go up (and pay) to buy the snowglobe as there is a shop at 3rd floor.If you can afford the highest deck, go for it. I bet the view is much nicer up there. :)"

The line up for tickets wasn't long at all, and in no time I was through the lobby and in the elevator headed for the main observatory level.For all there were a lot of people on the main level, it was spacious and didn't seem crowded. The views from the 360\u00b0 windows were quite impressive, affording a panoramic view of the city. It was fun to finally work up the courage to stand on the 'lookdown' window - which felt a lot higher than 150m!I then bought a ticket to take the elevator to the special observatory, a further 100m up. The lineup for this elevator was long, and it took about 20 minutes of waiting before boarding to ascend. This was mainly down to the fact that the upper level is significantly smaller than the main level. It was worth the wait. The views were stunning, and I was able to get a better appreciation of the size of the city. I had originally only set out for the Tower as I saw it was within walking distance from my hotel, and hadn't been on my 'to do' list. I'm glad my wanderings took me there though! My only regret is that I didn't return for an evening visit, I imagine the views are differently, though equally stunning with the city illuminated."

The ascent is done in groups and you can spend as little or as long time as you want depending on what time your bus leaves. The views from the tower are quite spectacular on a clear day. There isn't a direct elevator to the top. You need to go up some levels first then take another elevator to the top. There are souvenirs galore available and a few eateries on the bottom level.

I would have liked a little more information on the tower itself beyond the basics but as a big tall place to go lookout across the city it did the job well.Oh and a great crepe place down near the entrance!"

Tokyo Tower is located slightly further away than you would expect, to get out here we had to take a couple of different trains, and then a bit of a walk to get to its location.It was a very cheap admission price, however it costs extra to go to the highest peak - which we personally did. We travelled here during the day and unfortunately, did not see it at night. It is definitely recommended to go here as there is magnificent views, you can slightly see Mount Fuji if it's a clear day, however due to how cold it was (End of January, Beginning of February) the sky was quite foggy so it made it a little more difficult and also.. it is very far away and so don't go here just to see mount Fuji.There are platforms that you can look down to see how high up you are, it is a very surreal experience. I personally found that by the highest level, I had gotten a bit over the sight. I was able to acknowledge how amazing it was, however it got very repetitive. In the highest viewing point, it was really warm, I felt a bit dizzy and was nearly having an altitude nose-bleed (so ensure if you are prone to this, you don't go too high).Overall the experience was great and I would definitely recommend paying the extra yen to go higher, the gift shops were beautiful and the staff were friendly. May not come back as there isn't much more to do there, but would recommend it to others."

We paid a little extra and went the International speed ahead route as the lines at 10am were horrendous. I definitely recommend doing this, just be sure to have your passports. The day was a beautiful one and you could see for miles when on the 350 meter floor. The interactive maps added a nice touch so that you could get an idea of what you were looking at/for. At 11:30 we still could not see Mt Fuji as the clouds in the distance hindered our view. Sooo we elected to pay another 1030 yen each to go up another 150 meters (Another line too) Ok, so cool to say you did it but soo not necessary. If you do go you will see pillars with numbers on them. Mt Fuji happens to be between 8 and 9 if that is your particular interest. Unfortunately, we left without the sighting... but DID see it from our hotel room that night, go figure! The lines were the only reason I gave this a 3."

But it is still worth a visit.Brilliantly lit it is impressive from the ground. We arrived about 7:00 and there were no queues. We just went to the lower observatory which was 900 yen each. It is an additional 500 for the higher level. Most of the other visitors were younger than us. This is obviously one of the places to bring your girl at night in Tokyo!

You may as well after going to visit the tower, the view is better but not amazingly. They have worked hard to have other features which make it more than just a view. The bar is also very cheap, only 300\u00a5 for a beer with a great view, you will pay x10 for that view in other Tokyo bars! Worth doing."

It is a much smaller version of the Eiffel Tower in Paris , but appeals to the Japanese. We were greeted by Girls wearing uniforms and ushered to the elevator and whisked t the top. the view was nice. Probably the most fascinating thing to us was this was our first taste of Halloween in Japan. There was a huge display with rusty gates and a pumpkinheaded giant, among other things, and the a rack of costumes for families who wanted a photo op. Halloween is a great time for a party in Japan. Parades, displays events: Remarkable!"

Even though Tokyo Tower is not as high up as the newer Sky Tree or recently opened Roppongi City View, it still has a lot of charm, especially at night. I'd advise to only visit the first deck though, because besides a somehow claustrophobic and scary elevator ride, the view from the upper deck is not much different. In the evening the exit floor is lit up with hundreds of led lights which make for nice pictures. It's probably better to visit Tokyo Tower in the week as the weekends tend to attract bigger crowds."

The views from the observation platform were beyond amazing, at night. A must see, even for a fee. Many vendors and some street performers- some with monkeys abound at Tokyo Tower, on the weekends. I got to enjoy the red bean ice cream and enjoyed the atmosphere. The crowds are astounding, but not overwhelming. Definitely a pleasant place to visit, even with the commercial souvenir shops, which have the typical charming Japanese air about them.

Mount Fuji can be seen on clear days. Night time probably best otherwise. Not much to expect other than a 360 view of the city.

There's a cafe where you can relax and look outside at the view. On the bottom floor there's also glass on the floor so you can look down at ground level (see my photo), which is really cool. If pay an extra ~\u00a5700 to go to the top floor, which is the best place to take pictures of the city view. It was cloudy/drizzling when we went so upstairs was the best photo spot compared to the main deck. There's around a 5-10min wait to go up, but nothing too long and it's worth the short wait. If you're looking for a panoramic view of the city, I recommend the Tokyo Sky Tree because it's a lot taller than the Tokyo Tower so it has a better view."

There were definitely not any twinkling lights. It also seemed like because of its location and proximity to other buildings, there were no good places to go to get a good view of it and photograph. I'm guessing a lot of these I've seen online were taken from inside a building nearby. I didn't think it was worth the cost of the cab ride we took over there to see it. Wouldn't make it a stop on my next trip."

Naturally we could have had the metro ride, but instead chose the pleasant stroll to the foot of lattice structure.It is about 333 metres high construction, and serves as communication and observation tower.

Despite Skytree looking brand new and everything, Tokyo Tower is still the one that tugs my heart towards what represents Tokyo city. The day and night view is vastly different so it is encourage to go during late evening, and get a good glimpse of the red orange look of the tower. The good thing about it is that, the queue is manageable and not as insane as Skytree. Seriously, I have no idea why Japanese like queues. The food at the observatory deck is not too pricey, so take light dinner there is fine too. Be sure to to when there's still light outside, so you may have a chance to view Mt Fuji ( if you're lucky) I was there bitting away my delicious sandwhich, looking at Mt Fuji as it slowly disappears in the sunset. During night view, there's one angle from the tower, where you can see lines of street lights resembling the alphabet \"A\". It sort of looks like another Tokyo Tower lying on ground. Good luck if you found that ;)Enjoy"

It does have more character than the Skytree and is based on the Eiffel Tower in Paris design. As the japanese were keen to point out - it is actually taller than the Eiffel Tower! The view platform up the tower (which you have to pay for to get to) is well worth the trip as you get panoramic views of the city. Parts of the viewing platform floor are made of glass so you can stand on these spots suspended in the air looking at the traffic rushing by below! When you're through with viewing return to the ground floor and enjoy the fast food restaurant village. We chose the Ramen Quick outlet where you load your money into a machine and press buttons for what you want. You are then given a pager which tells you when your ramen is ready for collection. Yen 1,030 for the two of us (about \u00a36). Fantastic value."

Having landed early in the AM and checking in we decided we would use the afternoon to head to Tokyo Tower as it was on the list of things to see and do of my youngest son. The weather was pretty much overcast but the city was still visible. We only went to the 1st viewing deck as we planned to go to the top of the much taller Sky Tree later on our visit and it was a good call. Whilst the Tokyo Tower is a well known icon of the Tokyo skyline it fails into comparison after visiting the Tokyo Sky Tree. If you are planning on going up to a viewing deck and only have time to visit one of the towers then this is not it. The only advantage I found was that the windows of the viewing deck at the Tokyo Tower are larger and better for taking shots of the city-scape. It is still nice to visit but if you have already been to the Sky Tree you may feel somewhat disappointed, although at the time we were impressed. Suggest taking photos from the ground and saving your vertigo and cash for the other tower."

I went just as the sun was about to set so I had the most incredible views imaginable - the sun set where Mt. Fuji was and it was a tear-jerking experience. I forgot all about my fear of height and spent so much time just walking around taking lots of photos. Going to the highest point was a little scary as you are in a small elevator with lots of people. There is a voice in Japanese and English that tells you the elevator will jerk at one point and is normal, but I still freaked out!The views at the top were even more incredible than the main deck. The lit up city in the distance was an experience in itself. I would recommend this to anyone - a must."

The price of admission is reasonable and you get absolutely phenomenal 360 views of the entire city. Really interesting to see the incredible population density. There's are reasonably good gift shop on the way out that actually has some pretty good prices. At the top there are assorted things to keep the kids busy.

Close up its a wonderful piece of engineering."

There was viewing spread over two floors, with look down windows on the lower floors. It was run very smoothly, and the second floor contained a variety of restaurants and stalls to buy souvenirs.I believe there is also an aquarium here but we didn't visit it at the time.If you are going to visit, I would really recommend you do so at night."

It only costs 1600 yen (approx $17 AUD) to visit both levels, but if you're on a very tight budget level one is sufficient for the beautiful views. Easily accessible via the Tokyo subway, catch the Oedo Line and get off at Akabanebashi. From there it's only about a five minute walk to the tower."

The stalls are spacious and have the same bubbly music as the women's facility's.It is my hope that the U.S. Will take notice and start doing the same.I'm sure this is not the review anyone was looking for but it hold some pleasant observations.

Tokyo Tower (\u6771\u4eac\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc T\u014dky\u014d taw\u0101?) is a communications and observation tower located in the Shiba-koen district of Minato, Tokyo, Japan. At 332.9 metres (1,092 ft), it is the second-tallest structure in Japan. The structure is an Eiffel Tower-inspired lattice tower that is painted white and international orange to comply with air safety regulations.Built in 1958, the tower's main sources of revenue are tourism and antenna leasing. Over 150 million people have visited the tower since its opening. FootTown, a four-story building located directly under the tower, houses museums, restaurants and shops. Departing from there, guests can visit two observation decks. The two-story Main Observatory is located at 150 metres (490 ft), while the smaller Special Observatory reaches a height of 249.6 metres (819 ft).FootTown's third and fourth floors house several tourist attractions. The third floor is home to the Guinness World Records Museum Tokyo, a museum that houses life-size figures, photo panels and memorabilia depicting interesting records that have been authenticated by the Guinness Book.[26] The Tokyo Tower Wax Museum, opened in 1970, displays wax figures imported from London where they were made.The figures on display range from pop culture icons such as The Beatles to religious figures such as Jesus Christ. A hologram gallery named the Gallery DeLux, a lounge and a few specialty stores are also located on this floor. Tokyo Tower's Trick Art Gallery is located on the building's fourth and final floor. This gallery displays optical illusions, including paintings and objects that visitors can interact with.On the roof of the FootTown building is a small amusement park that contains several small rides and hosts live performances for children. On weekends and holidays, visitors can use the roof to access the tower's outside stairwell. At approximately 660 steps, the stairwell is an alternative to the tower's elevators and leads directly to the Main Observatory."

It was fun though to get a bird's eye view of the area; the tower was built in an area full of old temples & cemeteries so it seemed that every time you looked down you were looking at yet another cemetery. In the foyer 2 clowns were entertaining a load of local kids, they were such good fun our tour guide had a job rounding our group up!"

Like the gardens it's missing.. but when you will look up.. you will skip a beat..There is a train station near world trade center, start your walk from there in the evening and you will see the sky lit up and the tower's shadow on the streets and buildings as you walk towards it. This is another great experience which adds excitement to your walk. Every step you take towards this tower you realize that you are gonna experience some greatness... some richness.. and the moment you reach to its base, it's worth the walk.You then buy the ticket to the top station, it's costly but trust me it's worth it. You then enter the tower, there are some restaurants, some shops to look around and some other attractions. But at this point you are only excited for you turn to step into the elevator. The mesmerization restarts when you step out of the elevator on the first floor. On your right is a band and a coffee shop. Take a sip, listen to good music, with great views of the city. There are some souvenir shops as well.. a little overly priced but look around at what altitude you are standing. It's worth it... but don't get carried away there... ;)Take a walk around look at the well lit up and fast running city. But if you will arrive here in the evening before its dark you can witness a completely different and a beautiful city.From there you go to the top floor, the elevator and the ride is scary but too exciting... :) from here uih actually get the feeling of being on top if the world... everything looks too small still it's a great feeling.This u s a place where you have to go by yorself to experience what I have shared and what I can only experience but couldn't share..I hope you all will have a great time exploring the facts and history of the tower too.A must visit place if you are in Tokyo.."

The main lobby is interesting and has a lot of \"one piece\" memorabilia store merchandise and cafe space. The next level is interesting as it offers tourists a place to sit have a coffee or beer while looking at the grandiose Cityscape.

Visiting during the daytime is great also, but visiting during the night will provide a full satisfying experience."

Our Grayline Tour guide was awesome and told us a lot about the area as we mover around the tower. There is a cool spot where there is a viewing window on the floor: you can look down and take some great pictures. There are plenty of places to shop for souvenirs in the towe.Gray Line Tours is super- consider taking one! The bus was very comfortable, tour guide knowedegable. Very comfortable and well worth the tour cost. All fees for visiting sites included in the overall cost."

This structure reminded me of Eiffel Tower in Paris. There are two observation decks, we only went up to the150 meter one. We had a clear panoramic view of the city of Tokyo. We also went down by staircase one story lower (if you have difficulty to use the stairs, you can use the elevator). There was an area with a glass floor for people to have a view of the street.

I only went up to the first level of the tower thus going further up only cost 600 yen, as it was a bit too foggy due to heat that day. The Tokyo Tower is placed nearby the Hamamatsucho St., where I went to an arranged sumo tour afterwards. The tower is visible from the station and the road leads nearly directly up to it. Do enjoy this tower (or preferably the Tokyo Sky Tree) when in Tokyo - the temple park at the bottom of the tower is beautiful as well. I'm not into trained animals of anykind, but the Japanese people seemed to enjoy seeing the trained and dressed macacas below the tower."

All that you see are tall concrete buildings of Tokyo. The only positive thing is the look down window in the main observatory. Walk over it, looking straight down and get dizzy. The other nice thing is the view of the tower from the ground, at night. The tower is all lit up and looks pretty. So I would suggest one comes here just before sunset, goes to the main observatory (no need to spend extra on the special observatory unless u have never been to a tall tower before), and come down to see the tower all lit up. In case u reach early visit the nearby zojoji temple or the shiba park."

We managed to see it in daylight and at night with all the city lights on as we went just before sunset :) Oh and the building toilets had a load of features that I didn't see in other places xD"

They have two different rates. The principal observatory offers a wonderful view of the city. The \"special\" is 100 meters higher. My teens want me to tell you \"it's not worth it\". I actually think it was a good additional experience. Not necessarily for the view but the elevator is small, you get to see part of the tower structure and this second observatory is smaller. It creates an anxiety provoking feeling which can be a thrill. Then we went back to the main observatory (it has two floors), we had a snack and a beer."

It's height is around 333 m. which is just around the height of the Eiffel tower in Paris, upon which it was modeled. Unlike the Eiffel, that height isn't that obvious since it's settled among other high rise buildings very close. You even can't see it from everywhere in the city, unlike the Eiffel again.Just like the Sky tree there are two platforms you can climb. The first is at 150 m, and the second at 250 m., separately paying. Here we did climb the second deck, and it is advisable, since it is in the city center, so you need to be higher than the surrounding buildings to get a great view.In my opinion the views from the Tokyo tower are even better than from the Sky tree, maybe just because it's downtown.Come at night when all Tokyo is lit up."

The Tokyo Tower is a bit far off but because it is a well known landmark in Japan, we had to check it out. When we got there, there were makeshift food stall tents. The aroma of the newly grilled scallops was so amazing, no wonder there was a long queue! We got our tickets for the Tower, around \u00a5900, with an additional fee if one wanted to go up to the special higher observation deck. We were about to go up to the view deck when my teen sons spotted this One Piece Anime Store so we had to follow them. If you follow One Piece anime like they do, then you will go crazy in this store! But there was again such a long queue that we ended up without any One Piece merchandise save for the capsule toys and coin keychain/necklace the kids got from individual machines. Up on the observation deck, we got to see a 360 degree panoramic view of Tokyo and all the city lights. (Actually, you can get a good panoramic view of Tokyo as well from the Tokyo Metropolitan Gov't Authority Bldg at Shinjuku for free!) Apart from that, there were some souvenir shops with all sorts of merchandise (which you probably can get at a cheaper price elsewhere at Don Quijote or Akihabara). The kids got hungry so we decided to eat at Curry Lab on the 2nd floor, where they had the restaurants and more souvenir stands, including Hello Kitty merchandise and Tokyo Banana pastries. When we got out of Tokyo Tower, the food stalls were closed so we were disappointed not to have taste those great smelling scallops! The tower, by this time, was lit up with yellow orange lights that made for a fantastic photo op. Though the Tokyo Tower is no longer the tallest tower in Tokyo, a bit pricey and a bit far off from city center, it remains to be a must see landmark to visit if you are new to Tokyo."

This was our first visit to Tokyo and whilst I cannot cope with heights, the Tokyo Tower was on my tick list of things to do and see.We arrived late afternoon and quite pleasantly the queues were virtually none existent, more surprisingly were the entrance prices, unlike other towers elsewhere on the globe, the Tokyo Tower prices were affordable and you didn't feel aggrieved at paying them.There are two lift/ elevator rides to get you to the top. The first can hold about 30 people, but the second holds 10 so at busy times I guess this is the bottle neck.When you get to the top the views are fantastic, but it was a clear day when we went up! The information panels are good at explaining what you can or should be able to see, but for me it was a bit claustrophobic (please bear in mind I don't do heights though). The viewing area is fully enclosed so photo's are a bit difficult, although you can opt to walk up to the top so I guess the views would be great from the external stairs.On the way down, make sure that you take a look at the 'Sky Views' which are Perspex panels in the floor of the middle platform, there's a small one and a larger one. Also, on the way down, you get dropped off on the 3rd floor so that you can enjoy 2 floors of gift shops, this is something which irritates me and finding the way out when it is busy will be a challenge.Overall, I enjoyed the experience didn't feel cheated and am glad we went."

I came here before a few years back and since my gf and I are holidaying in Tokyo it would only be natural to visit a landmark of Tokyo! Needless to say I am very happy even visiting it again! The tower isn't as big as Eiffel Tower but there is way more things to do! For starters you can go up the main observatory which obviously includes good views and also some floor glass panels! Also dotted around are various things to see such as a wishing shrine, souvenir shop, cafe etc. if you wish to have an even higher view you can choose to pay a bit more and go up the special observatory area. This part is solely for views day/night. Take note that if you do go up the special observatory make sure you give them the right tickets!Then beneath the observatory areas are some floors of interaction, shopping, food court! The food court has a decent selection of foods ranging from mos burger, to baskin robins, to sushi rice bowls to ramen shops! Also on the same level has a wide selection of souvenir shops so there's plenty to pick from! And on top of that they have recently installed the awesome Tokyo one piece tower attraction!(which will be on a separate review)All in all a nice tourist spot for any visitors and with the recent inclusion of the one piece attraction all adults and children will both enjoy it!"

Going late in the evening meant not much crowd, but, perhaps because there were fewer bodies to soak up sound, the background music was loud and distracting. The fee was a little steep compared to other attractions, and I didn't feel like I gained much from the experience. Also, they played a horrifically cheesy computer-animated video of a city fly-over with fireworks in the background that was laughably terrible. Skip the line for the video- you're missing nothing."

My wife and I visited this location during our last evening in Tokyo and while the views were spectacular, they were somewhat marred by how crowded the tower was and how long the waits were to get from the ground to the first deck and then from the first deck to the \"special observation\" deck at the top. All told we probably spent as much time waiting in line as we did gazing out over the spectacular cityscape (around 45m to an hour, respectively). It's certainly worth checking out if you enjoy great views and a bit of history, just be prepared for a fair amount of waiting on line."

The Tower is definitely worth a visit if you're in the area - great panoramic views of Tokyo. The one bit of caution I would advise would be to check the weather before you go, there are two observation areas, the main area and the upper part of the tower. During intimate weather they will close off the top area (which is what I encountered - it was raining during my visit).Access is very easy - there's a ticket booth on the bottom floor (East side on the down-slope of the parking lot). There you can purchase a ticket for the main observatory (about $3 U.S.) - once you exit the ticket area you'll walk into a lobby on the bottom floor - attendants will point you towards an elevator for a brief ride up - inside the elevator the attendant will give you a brief history of the tower.The main observatory has a cafe and there was a live band playing while I was up there. The coolest feature of the tower are several sections where the floor is glass - so you can stand with your feet floating above the ground (see pic). If you want access to the second observatory, you buy a ticket and then walk up some stairs - although like I said, due to rain and lightning they closed access while I was there.When you take the elevator down you enter a very chaotic shopping area - very busy and packed with all kinds of trinkets. There are also several more places to eat. Felt a bit claustrophobic to me so I skipped out of there fairly quickly. Outside of the tower shopping area itself, the area around the tower seemed fairy business/industrial, there didn't appear much else to see in the immediate area.But overall, the 360 view of Tokyo is pretty amazing, so it's worth a visit."

Once the tower opens for the you can take a ride up to the observation deck and look out over the city of Tokyo. Fun to do during the day as well as at night. Once the city lights come on it takes on a very different look as you can imagine. After my ride to the top and came back down I enjoyed an ice cream at the base. All in all its one of those attractions you should make time to see.It's a fun destination to do alone, with friends and or family. Enjoy you visit."

We only went half way up, though there is a higher observation deck because that was what the tour company had purchased. The tower was quite crowded inside when we were there (around 9am). The view is good but not as good as the view from Tokyo City View in Roppongi, we visited there later and I would definitely recommend there as an observation deck over Tokyo Tower. The tower is a staple tourist attraction and good to see up close if you have time, but if you're looking for picturesque views of the city then Tokyo City View is better - probably also because Tokyo Tower is a part of the cityscape when viewing from Roppongi."

While only half the size of the Tokyo SkyTree, if you are in the area, it is well worth the price (~ $20 USD) to go up to the Special Observatory [at the very top]. From there, you are well above most structures of Tokyo and can truly take in and appreciate the amazing city. On a clear day, you can easily see Mount Fuji - even though the volcano is 97 km away, it is an impressive backdrop to the city. I would recommend going up shortly before sunset, as you can then enjoy the city by day and night.The central section of the tower includes a cafe, and is worth stopping for a coffee or snack. Near the bottom of the tower is an entire shopping level and you can find some great gifts and keepsakes of Japan that are very reasonably priced.If you have time, near the base of the tower is the impressive Buddhist temple and temple grounds of Zoji-ji. I would recommend going here before Tokyo Tower, as you can best appreciate this area during the day, and can snap some great photos of the tower as well. If you time it right, you can even watch one of the Buddhist ceremonies, complete with chanting, singing, and incense burning."

We visited this attraction in Oct 2013 and unfortunately were running short of cash and could not use credit card to pay and there were no ATM's on site or nearby that were working. This impacted on our ability to acquire food and souvenirs during our visit (with 4 children between 10 & 15).The views were interesting and the Tower's history good to know and was/is a compelling attraction to visit but the related facilities could do with improvement."

Passing by the mesmerizing view of the cherry blossom in the night. The view of the tower from outside has to be one of the most beautiful things i saw amongst so many places that i travelled. The tower has a museum as well. There is a fee that you need to pay to go upto the tower, there are two stops within the tower, you need to pay extra again to see the top view. But i would suggest the first stop view is as good as the top. The outer design looks so much like Eiffel tower. Its a good attraction to see the city at night especially, its very beautiful and see a city lit up"

There was also a live band playing when we visited - which was neat. You can find a spot to sit and get a beer for about 500Y which is pretty reasonable and relax with the view. Only thing I can say is if you are only going to do this OR the sky tree - the sky tree is 100% more worth your time."

I would suggest taking a 1/2 day or full day tour, in which case all the entrance fees and transport are covered as part of the package.The telecommunication tower also doubles as a vantage point to see the city. The lower floors close to ground level have some restaurants, souvenir shops and toilets. To get to the top viewing level one has to take an elevator from the ground level and it is a well organised attraction. There are guides that direct visitors into the elevators and get you the viewing deck. One can get a 360 degree view of Tokyo and in our case as we had a tour guide he explained the buildings we saw in each direction including some which we would visit later that day as part of our tour like the Imperial Palace. As long as it is a clear day one can see quite far into the horizon. Plenty of photo taking opportunities including a glass bottom floor at some parts. Worth a visit if its your first visit to Tokyo."

The line was very long and it took 30-40 minutes to get our turn to the elevator. On top of that they crammed us tight to get more people in. The second time was last week, we arrived there at around 3 pm and this time there was no crowd. We didn't wait, the top of the observatory deck wasn't crowded too.I definitely recommend to come early and stay until close to sunset. On a clear day you get to see Mt. Fuji from afar. Tokyo was pretty to look at too during sunset."

Lower deck you can barely see some of the trees near the imperial palace...once you go up you get a better vantage point. On a clear day, one can see Fuji-san. I sadly only was able to get a glimpse of an outline of sorts. My only regret, not having done this in the evening too as I suspect that the city light show would have been so beautiful. So perhaps someone should consider doing the Tokyo Sky Tree too....one during the day and one in the evening."

I just kneeled down and watched the Tokyo night skyline just to enjoy the moment. I also bought the special observation deck ticket which was a bit pricey. I didn't regret it though because I thought I wouldn't be back in Tokyo for a long time so I had to use this chance. I think the main observation deck is not bad either, just more crowded that's why I suggest to visit during weekdays."

There is a separate fee for each observation deck; I purchased admission to both decks, but, with my inherent fear of heights, I never made it up to the second deck. The staff graciously offered to refund my admission to the higher deck, but I declined, since it wasn't their fault that I \"chickened out\". The views even from the lower deck were fantastic. I was fortunate enough to be there on a clear night, and had fantastic views of hte city. The middle observation deck has two levels. One of the levels has a cafe, which I proceeded to oder a drink and dessert, while looking outside over the city...and listening to a fantastic acoustic band that was playing there! There is a small gift shop on the observation deck, but a much larger souveneir shopping area and dining area on the second floor as you exit the tower.All in all, it was a good stop, and definitely not a bad place to check out."

The line for it was really long when we went, so we opted not to go. The view was spectacular! It offers a 360 panoramic of the entire Tokyo cityscape. Oddly, the buildings were not as tall and expansive as I thought it would be but this is probably due to the fact that land use and resource allocation in Tokyo is just so efficient! If you are going at night, don't bother taking long exposures shots since the reflection from the glass and indoor lighting kind of ruins that.

They have different fees, of course, we went to the first and it was great. People were ok, not too crowded. It was night, so the views were amazing. It's a short visit, like something you can do before dinner. I recommend it."

I visited early in the morning and found some pleasant eateries and traditional gardens around the base. The tower is accessed via glass elevators. It is much less spectacular than the Tokyo Sky Tree but Tokyo Tower has a sort of old-style quirkiness even if a bit of a tourist trap. A local told me that the tower was constructed from old Sherman tanks.....it was such a good story I believed it."

However as a structure, it is still very impressive being the Eiffel Tower of the east. The tower is located adjacent to Shiba park close to central Tokyo. The tower is brightly painted so it is almost impossible to miss. Looking up at the structure is just awe inspiring and provides plenty of photo opportunities. There are two observation levels at Tokyo tower with the first and lower located just 150 metres above ground level and the second located 250 metres above ground level. In comparison, the observation levels at Skytree are 350 and 450 metres above ground level. Both towers have their appeal however Tokyo tower is perhaps easier to get to and is the historic of the two towers in Tokyo. Do try and go on a clear day. Worth doing for sure."

They are all towers. They provide views. But there are a few differences. If you prefer free, then choose Tokyo Govt Bldg, or if it is vintage for you, then go for Tokyo Tower with the added bonus of views of the Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo Bay. The Landmark Tower, shaped like a lighthouse, is all about the water, with the Minato Mirai area and Yokohama port, Yamashita park and the Bay Bridge within view.

The purpose of the tower was for TV and radio transmission just like the new Tokyo Skytree. Its design was based on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. The construction started in 1957 and was completed in 1958. It opened to the public on December 23, 1658. The orange and white colors make the Tokyo Tower stand out from a far distance. It is now the 2nd highest structure in Japan. This lattice tower is made of steel just like the Eiffel Tower, but its 333 m (1,093 ft) height makes it taller than the Eiffel Tower\u2019s 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall and used far less materials. Its primary purpose was for television broadcasting. Since the digital era is coming and the tower is not high enough due to the development of Tokyo, the new Tokyo Skytree (634 m / 2,080 ft) took over its purpose. Tokyo Tower is now used for broadcasting Japanese media outlets. We walked from the subway station and visited the Tokyo Tower in the morning because we already saw the night scene at the Tokyo Skytree. The first time we visited Tokyo Tower was about 8 years ago, and we only had a vague memory. We loved to visit it again. 2014 is its 55th anniversary. We purchased tickets that included both the Main Observatory and Special Observatory. The two-story Main Observatory is located at 150 meters (490 ft), while the smaller Special Observatory reaches a height of 250 meters (820 ft). At the observatory, people enjoyed the view of Tokyo through the windows. Although it was sunny, it was not clear enough to see far distances. On the Main Observatory, we found the glass \u201cLookdown Window\u201d. We took photos right through the window, and it was amazing. Just like all indoor observatories, the reflection from the glass might be a problem for taking photos. We did not spend the time to visit the lower 4-story building \u2013 FootTown. There were not many visitors. It might be because the new Tokyo Skytree attracts most of the tourists. The bright orange / white color makes it stands out in Tokyo skyline, and it certainly is the most important landmark in the city of Tokyo.You can take the Hibiya Line and get off at Kamiyacho Station (\u795e\u8c37\u753a). It takes about 10 to 15 minutes by foot. Tokyo Tower is located on a small hill, and the last few walks were good exercise \u2013 especially on a hot, sunny day. It opens year-round, and the admission is \u00a51,600 (both the Main Observatory + Special Observatory) for adult. You can visit their website for more information."

My only complaint is not the tower itself, but the aquarium at the base of it. I would avoid this at all costs. I've seen fish in pet shops kept in better conditions. There where big 4ft fish crammed into 3ft tanks with no place to swim. No plants or gravel/sand in the tanks. I used to keep fish myself and actually left this 'aquarium' feeling quite upset."

Once inside a robot points out points of interest trouble was that everytime a human got within a certain distance he stopped talkinga nd moving, and children loved to touch him. I gave up on the robot and used the interactive screens which show landmarks and distances. I could easily see Disneyland and Skytree from here.

Once in the first observation deck, the view is secured by windows. The view is mesmerizing and you feel the power of this capital but also the serenity that it has during the night. There are 2 small floor windows so you can see through to the street. The cherry on the pie was a live jazz concert the same night I went there (not sure but I think they do it twice a week).

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku has a view that is just as good (or bad) but it is free. Also there is plenty to do in Shinjuku so it will not be a wasted trip even if the view disappoints. However the view of the Tokyo Tower can be pretty from the outside.

There's also a cozy cafe in it, that's where we mostly spent time watching for sunset until it's fully dark, then I move to the top level observation deck using the lift (wait around for 10 minutes in queue). the top level observation deck is narrower then the one below, but it gives you even a better look of the sparkling city. But I gotta say the top level is more \"romantic\" than the one below that is more suitable for families with children as they can roam around better than on the top level deck.Below the tower, there's a small complex of food booths you can visit to grab some grub (I had one of the most delicious pizza here!

As such, what would have initially been a 4-star review is now only a 3-star. One interesting view that I have not experienced is that of the SkyTree from Tokyo's 'Eiffel' Tower. I have seen vice versa, and managed to capture both towers in the same photo when visiting the Metropolitan Building in Shinjuku.All in all, if you are passing through the area and it is a clear day it would be worth your while, but I wouldn't recommend a specific visit otherwise.(And apologies for the poor quality of the photos!)"

Situated near Zojo-ji there is the opportunity to have the old and new Japan combine. Access to the toweris well organized and provides a great view over Tokyo. On a clear day Mt Fuji can be sighted. Many shops and eateries are located in the base of the tower providing the chance to buy souvenirs from the location."

On the lower floors there are a few places to purchase souvenirs, but of course you come to take in the view. The view was very nice. Sometimes on clear days you can see mount Fuji in the distance, but beware, unless the weather is good you may not see it due to sky conditions. There is an elevator all the way up, but getting down can be a bit confusing, as you have to go to the 3rd floor and then walk down the rest of the way. Overall, don't miss this if you can. Bigger than the Eiffel Tower by a few meters, it definitely gives you an idea of how giant Tokyo really is from the top."

Anyway the Tower stands above all this, and approaching to it (it sits on a small hill) is still impressive if made after sunset.Probably it's too expensive to go up to the observatory (go to the Skytree or Mori Tower instead), but the overall \"vintage\" feeling of the souvenirs shops and restaurants inside can bring you back to a 1970-80s Japan. And that's why the Tokyo Tower deserves a visit."

Fuji etc. but it is much less crowded, and no reservations are required, on a clear view has a great view of Tokyo, Haneda Airport, and down to Yokohama. You can walk there from Hamamatsucho Station on the Yamanote Line, it is an uphill walk but not particularly steep. And as an added side attraction the route from the station to the tower skirts, or you can walk through the grounds of Zenchou-ji Temple one of the largest in Tokyo, it is a concrete reproduction as the original was burned in the late unpleasantness between the U.S. and Japan. Never the less it is worth strolling through, the original main gate is the location of one of Kawase Hasui's most famous wood block prints and is worth a photo. My favorite shop for contemporary Japanese Prints, \"The Tolman Collection\" is located a block east and down the alley with Yoshinoya on the corner just to the east of Daimon Gate leading from the train station to the main gate of the temple.One of the world's tackiest gift shops should you be interested is located on the fourth floor. If you want to do something out of the ordinary you can walk down from the top view level to the 3rd or 4th floor, note this is a clear, non-rainy day as the stairs are out in the open. Takes a while but since you are going down it is not particularly strenuous and you are pretty much alone.I do not remember the fee to go up to the top deck but it is fairly reasonable. My time estimate includes walking from the station, and descending on the stairs."

The Tokyo Tower is tightly set amidst a commercial/high-end residential neighborhood, while the Eiffel Tower is set in the Champ de Mars and adjacent to the Seine. Another major difference is the Tower's impact on their host city's skyline. The Eiffel Tower stands above most of the Parisian skyline, while the Tokyo Tower sort of blends into a skyline that's already full of spectacular high-rises.Their similarities are their iconic visual presence, and providing breathtaking views of their respective host cities.All in all, it's a great way to spend 1 or 2 hours on a clear day or night."

I have been to the Eiffel Tower and while this is based on the same design the observation areas are different as is how one travels up. Thankfully it was a clear day and one could see Mt. Fuji off in the distance. The observation area shows what to look for in each direction which was nice. The price to go to the top was also I think cheaper then the Eiffel Tower. Worthy ones time for a visit."

Skytree is the taller of the two and is located adjacent to the Asakusa district; it is also a newer structure. Tokyo tower is older, and smaller, but (the big positive, here) is located quite close to the Odaiba/Tokyo Port area. This means you get a different vantage point from each place. I did not go to Skytree, but I really think the trip up the Tokyo Tower was very worthwhile. I went during the evening and it was a great way to see all of the layers of streets, old and new buildings, apartments and skyscrapers. It is really beautiful at night and a great way to mark the evening in Tokyo. I would recommend visitors go up at least one of these towers while in Tokyo because it is pretty much impossible to grasp the expansiveness of the city from the ground (among the buildings)."

The Tokyo Tower is located in the Shiba-koen district of Minato, Tokyo near the Zojo-ji Temple (which contains the mausoleum of the Tokugawa family). It is also about 3 miles south of the Imperial Palace. I went on a Monday morning in early November and it was a clear day so I could see a lot of Tokyo. I went with a guided tour so we did not have to wait long to go up (just had to wait for a different guided tour).This tower opened in 1958 as a broadcasting tower and was the tallest structure in Tokyo at that time. It looks like the Eiffel tower except it is orange (painted to comply with air traffic safety laws). There are two observation platforms. The main platform is at 150 meters (500 feet) and the smaller special platform is at 250 meters (800 feet). I only had time to go to the main platform which was fine. They said you could possibly see Mt Fuji on a clear day but I am not sure how that is possible since you are not that high. The views from this lower platform were still great as you can see in all directions and get a feel for how huge Tokyo is. The cost is 820 yen for the Main platform and an additional 600 yen if you want to go to the Special platform. Compared to other country\u2019s tourist attractions, those prices are very reasonable.The entrance at the base of the tower is called Foot Town. This is a four story building is located directly under the tower and houses museums, restaurants and shops. You can also buy Tokyo Tower souvenirs at a shop on the main platform.Overall I enjoyed my quick trip to the Tower and recommend it. If the entrance line is not too long it does not take much time to visit this attraction. Tokyo Tower is a must see and iconic Tokyo landmark."

Ultimately it is really the view itself that doesn't deliver, unless you go on a really clear day and can see Mount Fuji. There are the usual gift shops and food kiosks at the base. All in all I would say skip the Tower and walk down to the beautiful and serene Zojoji Temple just a few hundred yards away for a more traditional piece of Tokyo."

With the opening of the much higher Sky Tree, Tokyo Tower is losing popularity, but it is still a great way to see a large art of the city, especially near sunset, when Mt. Fuji is is silhouette and the city starts to light up. Easily accessible from anywhere in the city, it is a nice way to get a feel for Tokyo. But be sure to go on a clear day when the visibility is high. On such a day you can even see Mt. uji looming on the distance."

It offers a 360 degrees view of the city and you can spot all sorts of other famous landmarks housed in the city.

Nonetheless, the place was nicely maintained and the staff was extremely helpful and courteous. As mentioned earlier, it's a good place to start your trip by seeing the Tower and the working your way towards SkyTree. There are these interesting computer monitors that are placed at various areas of the deck that provide information about the buildings you can see and that was good for helping to plan out other places we could visit. There's an aquarium inside the tower (for an extra cost) and all sorts of stores to purchase tower related souvenirs. I do recommend this, especially to first time visitors and I'm sure they will have fun atop the tower."

The food court was limited in its choices, none of which appealed to me. The shopping was either food or plastic souvenir tat.Again I skipped the Aquarium as have done such things many times before.Things I loved. It is an iconic part of the Tokyo Skyline I did not feel I could leave it out. It was easy to get to on the Subway. Its cafe had a lovely view with actual comfy seats which was an issue at the skytree. The staff were friendly and helpful. Everywhere was spotlessly clean and it was a fun way to spend a couple of hours.Plus seeing the \"Eiffel Tower\" was a nice counterpoint to the \"Statue of Liberty\""

There were lots of Japanese people especially in the shopping area (mainly souvenirs) and food court at the base of the tower which made it feel extremely crowded.

The lift ride between the two platforms is an experience in itself. After enjoying the view of Tokyo which is so expansive, rest your feet and enjoy some ice-creams in the cafe situated at the high levels.

It was not overly crowded so getting around was not bad. there were a couple of openings on the floor where you could look at the way to the ground level. It was funny to see the kids and adults warily look down and then quickly back up. There were many shops to buy souvenirs both at the 150 meter level along with the ground level.

That was during christmas time, and we had just gone to take some photos, and found a nice christmas market. This time we went during the day, with the purpose to go up. It looked great as we left the nearby subway station and took some photos. It was easy to navigate to. Tickets to the main observation deck were 820, much more reasonable than the Skytree, and with NO line.No worries about trying to get a view out the window, they were lovely and clean and without ten other people in front of you. It is in a far better location than the Skytree, and its high enough to have a great view, but not so high as you need binoculars to see anything. Just perfect. You can see Odaiba, Shinjuku and Roppongi Hills. We picked out the fuji tv building, the TMGO, Mori Tower, Rainbow Bridge, Takeshimiya Times Square. So many familiar sights. All we saw from Skytree was Sensoji temple and masses and masses of ugly urban sprawl.There is a small cafe, and gift store on this level. You can also pay 600 more yen to go up to the 'special observatory' but I dont think the view would be that much different from there, and we had accomplished the objecting of going up Tokyo Tower.The glass bottom floor areas seemed larger than Skytree, and as it was a lot less busy it was actually possible to take some photos down them etc. Tokyo Tower also has a cute little mascot which is themed in the merchandise.Having done FOUR observation decks in Tokyo, this is my favourite. I would rank this the best (820 yen), the TMGO offices as second (and they are totally free!), Mori tower at Roppongi third (1500 yen) and the Skytree as least favourite (3000 yen..).There is something about finally being at SUCH an iconic and famous landmark, and getting to go up.

Well, I was quite surprised to find out that it's a very different experience.It is comparable in height with Eiffel tower (around 300m), but it was build in late 1950s and it seems to be frozen in that time. The aesthetics is reminiscent of popular american cartoons Jetsons (they started in 1962), including the bring colors, clean and simple lines and overall retro spirit. There were a lot of cosplayers (mostly teenagers dressed as popular Japanese comics characters), which was adding some Japanese flavor.The view was also quite unexpected. The building around a quite low with a lot of cemeteries around, so it didn't feel like you're in the middle of a big city.Just as Eiffel Tower, it has two observation decks, the top one is available for an extra charge, however, I don't think the view from there is dramatically different since there was no tall landmarks around which would look different from the higher level.Overall, there is nothing wrong about going there as a tourist, it's easily accessible, located in a quite green area, the tower itself has an unusual retro feel and the tickets are affordable. However, because of it's location, you don't really get a view of the heart of the city, so I'd say it's a second tier attraction, if you have limited time, check some more interesting places first."

The view definitely becomes better as you go to the upper deck. You have to buy another ticket to reach the special observatory. It gives an amazing view of the Chiba Prefecture with Tokyo Disneyland, Disney Sea, Rainbow Bride and Haneda Airport. If you are lucky you can also get a view of Fuji-san.

It was still great to look out from the observation deck though. Very busy."

We didn't go up to the special observation deck. We stayed at the main deck and the view was good. You will need to pay two different fees to access both decks. It is considered an iconic tower in Tokyo. However, the newest Skytree tower is taller and modern looking. The Tokyo tower is a good place to take pictures of Tokyo on a clear day. There are the usual souvenirs shops inside and outside the tower. It looks nice at dusk when the lights come on. The orange paint gives it a unique appearance.

The tower is easy to get to by train or taxi and there is also ample parking available. There are often sideshows and other exhibits that attract visitors in addition to the tower. The tower is used for broadcasting which doesn't help its aesthetic but it is a site to see, especially when lit. There are two observation decks which are accessed by an elevator for a fee. The fee could be a few hundred yet lower but it is still worth the trip. I highly suggest paying the fee that covers both the lower deck and the upper deck. Be sure to visit on a clear day so that you can view the vastness of Tokyo and see Mt. Fuji as well. The observation deck also has a section of glass floor that allows visitors to see straight down several hundred feet; a favorite of my kids. The lower four floors have souvenir shops and a few restaurants that are of average quality but not expensive at all."

In my opinion it was worth it.The elevator takes you to the first observation level. There, your number will be displayed on overhead screens when it is your turn to take the elevator to the top level. Be aware there are a couple levels of stairs between the two. While waiting, you can enjoy the view on the first level. Both decks have plenty of room to move about freely. On the first deck are two sections of glass floor, which offer nice vertical views to the street below!At the bottom are shops and restaurants.The tower is directly behind the Zozoji Temple.

I didn't bother with it as I was rushing for a dinner reservation. But What a view I must say.."

Personally I find nighttime to be more intriguing, but if you have time to spare, you can stay all day until closing if you like - they will not kick you out otherwise.However, I recommend that you get back down to the ground before they shut off the orange/yellow floodlights at 20:00. They turn on dimmer purple bulbs after that but they are not as pretty, in my opinion.Most sights in Tokyo close before sunset so Tokyo Tower is a great way to cap a day of sightseeing before dinner. It's also easily accessed by subway or bus."

For me, the best time to visit is at night. Aside from it being lit up, it is one of those places you can visit later in the evening, after all the other places you may only visit at daytime. Note that temples, shrines and a lot of other cultural places here closes pretty early, around 4 to 6pm. Also, it can be be pretty cheap. If you will not be entering the viewing deck, then it is free. Just enjoy the view from the outside and take some photos. Then go in and you can have access to the souvenir shops and food court (they got McDonalds, Baskin and Robins, coffee shop and other Japanese food stores).

It has long lines which probably vary every day but it didn't seem like it took forever. Everything is like a normal Japanese attraction, easy to understand if you don't speak Japanese and organised. There are 2 levels and I recommend going on both, not for the views but because not everyone pays to go to the higher level so it is less crowded. I managed to get good camera shooting positions at every angle I wanted but I was alone so was able to move through the crowds very easily. I gave it 4/5 because of where it is, I planned a long day of walking and it was on the way back to the hotel so it was no problem for me, but to get there specifically I'm not sure if it is easy. Still great views and the Christmas decorations and activities on the bottom were amazing."

We came to this tower after a day at the Skytree.... this was nothing like the skytree. Whereas the crowd and atmosphere at the Skytree Tower was bustling, interesting and lively when we arrived at the Tokyo Tower by subway - I saw an orange-lit tower that didn't impress me at all. Non-deterred, a couple of friends and I maneuvered our way through the streets and came through the back way to the tower. While you wait to purchase your tickets to ascend the tower, you can walk through the different floors at the base and see souvenir shops, an old shop selling 80s-type rock memorabilia, a wax museum and trick art... At this point is where I started getting the feeling I was in a horror movie waiting for something bad to happen. The place was practically empty at 7pm on a Friday night...normally one would expect more tourists at a \"major\" attraction such as this. In between the floors there was a lot of wide empty space that made the location look like it was under construction. For instance, we got off on the wax/trick art floor and instead of seeing an immediate attraction I felt I walked into office space under construction. We then turned the corner and got jumped by a Japanese man holding a trick art advertisement trying to drag us in to the counter. Let me tell you... it was creepy. There was no one around but me and 3 other buddies on a large empty floor.The tower itself was small...I've been to several other towers such as the Shanghai tower with lookdown windows and the one at the Tokyo Tower was literally a 1'x1' foot window. Not impressed. There was a radio host on the first observatory deck that no one would allow us to take pictures of so I felt it was more of a ... try hard attraction.Wouldn't recommend anyone to make a stop here unless you had some extra time in your itinerary."

Its surreal to see it, go into it, be on top and look at tokyo from there like I saw in Japanese dramas and shows in my teenage times... But the truth is, once that surreal feeling is over, its a tourist trap with cost at different levels. You pay an entrance fee at the bottom and to go to the top, another fee is incurred. But again, if you do not get to the top for once in your lifetime in tokyo, you can't rest in peace. So first timers, just go and that's it. no more tokyo tower.I don't like it due to the fact that it is enclosed like a aquarium and the double glass layer is kinda stained. It hard to take pictures through the glass with spotlights shining from below. Its takes too long to get down from the top with a long queue... There's better place to view tokyo such as Roppongi hills where you stand on a helipad and over look tokyo tower. But again, I have no regrets getting into this tourist trap for once in my life."

Even the videos that promoted the Tokyo Tower played in every other corner were dated. We went only to the lower viewing deck because it was so cloudy and we didn't see much because of the mist covering the city. It was dim inside, and looked so... tired. Maybe it has to do with the fact that its not as popular anymore compared to the very modern Tokyo Skytree."

When walking in from Kamayicho Station (Metro), the lighted up Tokyo Tower is gorgeous. Best time to go is around 4+ (winter season) - in time to catch the transition from sunset to nightfall for viewers and photographers (the golden hour) alike.As I visited on a Wednesday evening, there is the added pleasure of the Club 333 live music stage (1900 hours and 2015 hours performance) - live music and gorgeous night views, the perfect combination!"

The view is great, although not spectacular if you're not easily impressed by seeing cities at some height.There's a mall at street level, where you can get the usual food and souvenirs. Tickets are sold just outside the main door of the tower. If I recall correctly it was 800 yen to go up the main observation floor.There are two observation floors. If you want to go up all the way, I'm not sure if you can buy the ticket all the way to the top from the ground floor. They definitely sell the second stage ticket at the main observation floor. But buy your second stage ticket before you have a look around the main observation floor, since there is a wait to go up (about 30 minutes, when I was there). So buy ticket, have a look around, get souvenirs, go up second stage is the way to go.Cute souvenirs at the main observation floor. I got stuff that I didn't see at the other shops.Enjoy!"

Essentially it's a tower or transmitter in the very center of Tokyo, which has a visitors forum and offers splendid views of the city during the day and night. I think of both occasions I visited at night, if only for the romance of the city lights it offers. It's very much a focal point of Tokyo as it can be seen from pretty much anywhere in the city if you get enough feet off the ground. It's fallen under the shadow somewhat of the new Sky Tree, but for me the Tokyo Tower has a bit more class about it than that. It steeps of history and despite of it's central location is a fair old trek if you stick to the yamanote line. I would advised accessing it from the number of subways nearby. Anyway, there are two observatories on offer, so you can pay for the lower observatory or pay a little extra and see both. If I'm being honest I didn't really appreciate the difference of the higher observatory, so my recommendation would be to just pay for the lower one as it has all the extra features such as a restaurant and gift shop that the higher one lacks, and the view is pretty much identical. Whether it was worth the entrance fee I'm not sure, but it's certainly one of those iconic places that everyone should experience at some point in their lives"

If you are there for the first time (and probably won't go back because it's quite a long walk from any subway stations), you should pay for the admission to the top viewing room, which will automatically give you access to the main viewing room. It's less crowded on the higher floor. However, if you are on a budget, the main viewing room is fine, too, as the views (perspectives) that you get from the main viewing room already look very nice, and photogenic (if not too crowded.)The top viewing room made me felt uneasy a bit coz it felt shaky to me (like mini earthquakes). My husband, on the other hand, did not find it shaky at all. Sunsets at Tokyo Tower also looked very peaceful -- highly recommended."

We did that and spent the 90 minutes wandering the shopping center that occupies at least the first 4 floors of the the tower complex. There were some really wonderful stores here in addition to a wide array of restaurants. We returned at the appointed time and moved the ticket line in about 30 minutes, though considering how long it was that was an extraordinary pace. There are lots of exhibits to look at while you're waiting in line and people watching was equally entertaining. Unfortunately by the time we got to the front of the ticket line we learned it would be another two hours before we got up and back down; we had to get to the airport and couldn't afford the time. I imagine it would have been great but even our time looking around the mall and enjoying lunch was worth the trip. We'll try again next time we go to Tokyo."

Now we have the Tokyo Sky Tree, it is no longer the pre-eminent Tower in Tokyo, however in the true heart of the city Roppongi area, it is still without peers. A must to visit, better at Night and you can ride the elevator to the top of the tower to take in the panorama.

The crowds were there but getting up was a breeze. I only checked out the main observatory - didn't have time to go up to the special observatory which is much higher up. In all, definitely one of my highlights to Tokyo. On a side note, there's a small retail space at the footprint of the tower but otherwise there isn't nothing much else around."

Definitely amazing views both times. I'd venture to say that early evening might be the best. Day is great for viewing far out and all, and night is okay for seeing lights. More difficult to make a lot more out. Both times were really nice though to see a change in the city.The second time, I went up to the second observation point on the tower (didn't on the first). Higher up, and obviously an additional fee on top of the fee you paid to get to the general observation deck. I imagine for day time the second one is worth it. For night though, I had this weird sensation I felt CLOSER to the ground even though we went higher up in tower. It was obvious we were higher though because we could see the horizon.The second observation deck is much smaller, being up much higher on the ever thinning tower to the top. Not sure if they limit the amount of folks up there, or if there just aren't as many willing to pay the extra fee, but moving around up there wasn't bad. It was a circular area to walk in. And you could feel the swaying of the wind up that high. Bit disorienting at first.The Sky Tree has opened, but I'd HIGHLY recommend visiting this old friend of Tokyo. It's worth the trip and it's fun to visit what has been the face for Tokyo for years. Plus, you get to see a different area of Tokyo from the air."

If you have 6-7 days to spend in Tokyo, then I'd say go ahead, but if you plan on staying for only a few days, then there are other more interesting attractions to pay a visit to, particularly when you have already seen the (real) Eiffel Tower in Paris. Of course, the Tower is more than just a photo opportunity from outside, but you'd better go up there on a clear sunny day, which is kind of rare to happen during the months of June-July.It is expensive, when you add up the fares for the Main Observatory, the Special Observatory, the Wax Museum, the Trick Art Gallery, etc. It'll all add up considerably. Now, once you get up to the Main Observatory, you might be a little disappointed, not just because of fuzzy sceneries for that's how Tokyo's weather is most of the times, but also there are not really many landmarks to observe from, besides identifying the main parts of town that you have visited by foot, such as on the east is Shinjuku, or on the west is Ginza, up north is Ueno, etc.If you really want to go up high to have a bird eye view of the city, then you might want to go to Roppongi Hills and pay visit to the Mori Tower with its Tokyo City View. At least, after a short while up there on the Observatory of either towers, in Roppongi Hills you can spend the rest of your day to walk around this newly developed part of Tokyo, with its elegant shops and boutiques and nice people, while Tokyo Tower seems a little dated.

I have an amazing view of the tower from my apartment and I was really excited to visit it. The tower is really easy to find (unsurprisingly!) and without knowing the way, I was able to walk to it from Roppongi station in about 15 minutes. At the bottom of the tower is a really nice outdoor bar area which would be a pleasant rest stop on a nice day. There is also an amazing crepe shop (Marions crepes) that has a great selection of hot and cold, sweet & savoury crepes for reasonable prices (around 400-500 yen depending on the flavour). There are plenty of places to sit down outside at the bottom of the tower to enjoy a drink or a snack. And as usual for Tokyo, there are plenty of vending machines!Just inside the ground floor of the tower is a great little souvenir shop (Tokio 333) where I was able to stock up on lots of yummy Japanese sweet treats to take home as gifts for my friends. Again, these seemed quite reasonable in price and the selection was pretty good.I paid the 820 yen price to go to the main observatory of the tower but did not stretch to any of the additional extras like the aquarium. The view was ok, but it was quite busy and also very cloudy on the day I visited so overall I was quite disappointed and felt that the 820 yen that I had paid was a bit overpriced. I would therefore recommend trying to go on a clear day to get a good view! Alternatively, visit one of the many free viewing platforms in Tokyo! That way you could enjoy a view of Tokyo that included the Tokyo tower!Just outside the tower there is also a nice little garden park area which you might want to have a little explore of as it provided some nice shade against the hot sun!Overall, I'm glad that I visited the tower (if only for the yummy treats i got at the souvenir shop!) but I regret paying the 820 yen to go up it."

Unfortunally it was a bit cloudy, but nevertheless worth it.

So, avoid going there if you are jetlagged. You will appreciate it more.There is a small giftshop on the 150m level, where you can buy souveneirs. But there are also several stores on the ground floor, so don't waste all your money on the top one.When you decided to go down, they have made a brilliant solution... You can't go all the way down with the elevator, you have to step out on the 4th floor. And there they have a small carneval, they call it themepark I believe.... But the only theme there is \"bring me your money\". A lot of small attractions for the children, as an American guy said \"Oh! this was really tacky!\"Nevertheless, take the stairs one level down and you have a food court kind of thing. Loud, very loud noises and Japanese fast food is available.Next level down is some kind of childrens playground with inflatable walls, like an inflatable jumping castle.When you finally got all the way down to the ground floor you can take the opportunity to go on a shop freenzy at the souveneir shops."

To go to the 250 m observatory you have to take another elevator for which they will give you a token number and you wait for your turn. But it's not a lOng wait and you can take in the views from the 160 m observatory while you wait for your tOken number to come up on the display screen for the elevator"

Reasonably priced and on the day I went there was no line up or crowd - this may be due to the fascination with Tokyo Skytree which has just opened up. There is also a shopping centre at the bottom with souvenir shops, food court and games arcade that would keep kids of most ages interested for a few hours. While Tokyo Tower may be taller than the Eiffel Tower it lacks the beauty and grace of its French counterpart."

Tokyo tower has 2 observatory, one at 150m which is what you get when u buy the tickets from the entrance on ground floor then there is the 250m special observatory where u can buy tickets for another 600yen more to enter it. I do not understand why that was the case and the view from 250m was way better than the 150m one. Other then the pricing strategy, this place had one of the best views of Tokyo. Nice! but probably is going to be surpass somewhat by Tokyo Sky Tree but from exterior perspective, tokyo tower looks much nice than sky tree. So still would recommend it as good photo spot and good viewing of the city"

Just make sure that the sky is clear and the weather is fine or else, the scene will be covered with fog or clouds. There are two levels of the tower that you can choose from: either you'd be on the middle part or on the top of the tower. ---Middle costs JPY820 and the Topmost costs JPY1420. I think the topmost view is great but the middle is fine. You can see the landmarks already and their is a glass floor where you can see the cars below.Imperial Palace is a nice place to stroll around. It has one of the best sceneries of Tokyo especially when there is not too much people and the weather is cool. There are many exits so if you get lost, don't worry too much but it is quite a large park. You can find beautiful trees and cherry blossoms there. Don't miss the moat - where you can see how the palace is separated from the outside through the body of water, for protection during the olden times.No entrance fee.How to get to the TOKYO Tower from SHINJUKU?Ride the TOEI EODO line from Shinjuku Station to DAIMON (LINE 20). After reaching the station, read direction on how to go to TOKYO TOWER exit. You can see the tower as soon as you go out the station, it is around 7-10-min walk. Souvenir shops are abundant. Ticket to the tower are bought outside, you can ask the friendly Japanese staffs.From Tokyo Tower to Imperial Palace:From Akabaneshi or Daimon station ride to AOYAMA-ITCHOME (E24) transfer to the purple or HANZOMON LINE and go to Hanzomon station (Z05). Imperial palace is in OTEMACHI."

But once the sun goes down, the view doesn't look as impressive and there's light glare off the windows.

You have to buy a ticket to get up to the first one, and then you have to buy another ticket when you get up there if you want to go to the second deck. There was like an hour wait to get up to the second deck, plus it was about the same price as to get up to the first deck, so I didn't think it was worth it."

It is designed like the Eiffel Tower, but is a vibrant red that can be seen from many spots in the city. There's a temple near the tower that is also worth a visit. The tower is very clean and efficiently run, staff are very friendly, and there's many shops and food outlets in the tower. There's a small restaurant and bar on the lower observation deck. There are two observation decks and a charge to visit both (you pay an additional charge to the regular ticket to get to the higher deck). I don't remember the exact price, but it was not outrageously expensive (although if you have a large family, it may get cost-prohibitive to go to the top deck). Even though we went on a slightly overcast day, the 360 degree views of Tokyo were fantastic. On clear days, they say you can see Mt. Fuji, although we did not. We watched the sunset from the lower observation deck and it was a wonderful experience. The elevators are very fast and smooth, so you feel safe if that's a concern. Although with the Tokyo SkyTree opening in May, I'm not sure if Tokyo Tower will have quite the pull it does now, but it's still a fun place to visit and it has a very cute gift shop (if you're into that sort of thing)."

Certain fish that are known to be shy and need hiding spaces kept in bare glass tanks and the stories go on.

One thing I didn't get to experience much -- there are some souvenier shops on the first few levels of the tower which would have been interesting to explore.

As with most such attractions, the main attraction is the view, and the view is best enjoyed during the evening transition from day to night.

There are plenty of gift shops and eateries on the ground level of the tower, and during Christmas time there was a cute Christmas light display around the base that you could access for free. There was also a mini beer garden outdoors (mostly just a few picnic tables and a few booths selling drinks). We paid our admission and took the elevator up to the top. It was not too crowded and the views were worth the price of admission though we didn't stay long (we went at night, I imagine both the daytime and nighttime visits have their own appeal).

You will take an elevator to get to the observation deck, but you have to use stares to walk between the two. The cafe wasn't open so I can't was anything about the food, but I went to the gift shop and found it was reasonably priced. The view from this deck is awesome and a great way to see Tokyo. On a clear day you can see Mt. Fuji, but on a raining day you can only see a few miles out. None the less it's still worth doing.Once you leave the observation deck you'll go to the Foot Tower which is the 4-story complex below. It has lots of little shops, things to see, a McDonald's, a Hello Kitty Shop, and bathrooms (Watch Out! Some of the toilets are the \"hole in the ground\" versions).Be sure to bring a camera/video camera for the great view, some comfy shoes, and around $9 (820yen) per Adult, $5 (460yen) per child. You can easily spend 2 hours in the observatory and a few more in Foot Tower. You can reach it by using the subway and a short walk, or taxi."

Once, the tallest free standing structure in the world at around 333 meters, it was built in 1958 to broadcast TV and radio signals. Now, the tower is eclipsed by many skyscrapers in Tokyo. Be aware; there are two fees: one to gain access to the main observation deck around 150 meters up and another to access the special observation deck around 250 meters up. A new tower, Tokyo Sky Tree (around 632 meters tall), is nearing completion in 2012. But Tokyo Tower is impressive, nonetheless and an icon of Japan worth visiting."

It was incredibly crowded and there were lots of drunk people, but it provided for a festive environment. in the tower itself, we saw all of tokyo at night on new year's eve. it was absolutely breathtaking, and i still remember how amazing i felt when i was up there with people from all over the world on one of the most important days of the year. what was best about this experience is - i left my camera in the restroom and thought i lost it, but someone returned it! i was so happy since it was a very expensive camera that i received as a gift from a family member. god, i love japan. all i can recommend is that ladies - make sure you have a phone on you and are with someone, because with how many people there are, you may get felt up/coerced into going somewhere with someone you don't want to."

Upon arriving, we realised that the admission fee was tiered such that you had to pay twice to go all the way up. Main observatory was \u00a5820 and Special Observatory was \u00a5600 more. Unless you want to be able to boast that you've been all the way up there, the main observatory should suffice as you can get nice 360 shots of the area. At every segment around the main observatory, there is a touch screen where you can check out the time lapse view of that segment from day to night. That was really interesting and you will at least get to see how the view is like throughout the day, meaning if you came in the day, you will have a feel of how it looks at night and vice versa. There's also a couple of \"look down windows\" which are essentially holes in the floor but with covered with glass panels to prevent you from falling down. It's a little scary looking down at that height but pretty interesting. Overall worth going at least once."

Not that I find Tokyo an amazing city, but being an architecture fan, I find it imperative to see as many buildings of such a huge city as possible.The Japanese architecture doesn\u2019t attract me that much, but I like to see how the city was planned and how it evolved. You can see the various districts from the Tokyo Tower and it actually offers a very decent panorama of the city.I went a little bit before the sunset expecting to get some nice colours on the city, but as it was December and as there was a lot of smog around, the light wasn\u2019t at its best. Nevertheless, I managed to get a good glimpse of Fuji-san and from pretty much all Tokyo.Please be advised that the queues can be cumbersome, especially if you want to go to the upper deck \u2013 at my time of visit, at least 60 min waiting time. I didn't go to the upper deck, but I was already satisfied with the normal deck.To come down, I recommend that you take the stairs as they make up for good exercise and you can see other details from the city. I believe that the ticket was 1300 Yen, so that makes 13\u20ac, which is an ok price for an expensive city as Tokyo.In summary, do it for a good view of the city and be sure to go some time before the sunset so that you still get a nice light. Then come down when it\u2019s already dark, and you'll be surprised by the beauty of the light that decorates the Tokyo Tower."

We thought it was well worth the extra fee because you get a different perspective of the city. I asked one of the guides which main street I was looking at. To my surprise (even after asking her supervisor and getting out a book of maps) I never got an answer. Take a video of the elevator going up. You can see the tower and sights beyond. There are windows situated in the floor which is a nice touch. Also be sure to pinpoint a spot and watch the sway of the tower.I can\u2019t say anything about the restaurants there but the gift store was a disappointment.There are other ways of obtaining views of Tokyo, some free and some not.

At the observatory level (333meters) you get 360 degree panoramic views of Tokyo city. On this floor level is the souvenir shop, cafe, rental scopes, lookdown windows. On a clear day you even see Mt Fuji. The day I was there I couldn't see it. Great views and signs indicating different areas of the Tokyo region and how far away they are. There is also a level down with restrooms. Taking the lift back down, it stops on level three taking you out into Carnival town, a ride and play area for kids, take the lift again to the second floor where there is a huge range of souvenir shops ( I noticed somewhat cheaper than buying at the observatory souvenir shop) food outlets including McDonalds and other stores with plenty to see.The ground floor at the entry to the lifts for the tower isthe Aquarium Gallery, Tower gallery 3-3-3, Tokyo Tower wax Museum, Noppons Magical Dungeon and Space Wax.The main observatory is open from 9am until 10pm year round.

Normally, I would give this an overall Average rating, but since the views made a good first impression of Tokyo on me (and being a long time fan of Japanese monster movies), I bumped it up one notch.

I would've liked to check out the Zojoji Temple, you can see it just below the Tower from the windows, but it was dark and we were tired from hiking Mt Fuji the day before and didn't want to do the extra walking."

We had a stroll around the deck to take in the panoramic views of the city, which were very impressive, then secured a spot where we could watch the sun set and take some amazing photos. We had no expectations of seeing Mt Fuji so there was no disappointment there - most of the travel guides advise that Mt Fuji is obscured throughout the majority of the year anyway so you have to be quite lucky to catch it.We descended to the floor below the observation deck where a very talented jazz singer/pianist duo were performing, which, against the backdrop of Tokyo at night seemed to suit the occasion perfectly."

It was overcast when we were there so the views weren't great and we had previously been to the top of the Government building in Shinjuku which is free and has similar views. There is a glass floor which is good to look through. We spent quite abit of time looking around the attractions on the way down and had something to eat in an all you can eat chinese which was good value. Overall i would say its worth a visit and worth going up even if its just to say you have been up."

Once you pay (\u00a5800 per person) & get to the first observatory you realize that you just wasted your money. First of all it's crowded (or feels crowded as it is a very small area), filled with screaming children, no airconditioning, hot, smelly, dark ... Instead you can make your way to \"Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\" where they have two observatories (South and North). The rooms are spacious, bright, huge huge huge windows. The view is breath taking!!! And, it is free :)"

Many other reviews say to go to the Metropolitan building for a great view of Tokyo, and I agree, but I've only gone there in the day. Going to Tokyo Tower at night is magical. All of the city is lit up and you can see the ferris wheel at Odaiba light up and give its own show. Its a bit pricey to get in, but if you go at night, there aren't that many people. It can be quite romantic. Definetly a must do, but I recommend going in the evening."

You'll get a better view from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku or from Roppongi Hills, and you'll spend less money and have more options for entertainment in the vicinity."

            "review": "It's ok. We took a tour of the Tokyo Tower with friends. It didn't appear to be overcast but we were not able to see Mt. Fuji. We purchased the Set tickets which included the Wax Museum, Ripley's Believe it or Not, a short anime presentation and a 3-D picture museum as well as the Tokyo Tower. The 3-D museum was really cool but I would pass on Ripley's and the Wax Museum. The wax figurines were not very good if you have ever been to Madame Tussard's in London. Madame Tussard's is definitely better!My advice is to see the Tower and to try the aquarium if you want something else to do while at the Tower. Definitely bring our camera as you get to look from the floor down to the ground via a glass window in the floor."

Though not as majestic as the Eiffel Tower of Paris, it is a Tokyo icon and it offers a bird's eye view of Tokyo. The night view of the tower is better. Lots of souvenirs and food items to buy. Plenty of stalls to choose from. It's cheaper to get the souvenirs at the shops on level one rather than on the top of the tower. And more choices too."

            "review": "It's just not Blackpool. When we arrived in Tokyo we drove over the Rainbow Bridge on our way to the hotel. I remember seeing the tower and thinking \"I've got to go up there\".We went on a Saturday and it was busy, there was a queue outside to be allowed in to join the queue inside. Once you reached the end of the queue everyone was packed politely but firmly into one of the lifts to the first level. Once you get to the first level you can look out and see the city, or you can pay some more and join the queue to go up to the 2nd level. This isn't as fast moving as there is only one small lift but having come this far it seemed a shame not to go as high as possible.I have to admit the views from the second level were pretty spectacular. Tokyo stretches as far as the eye can see in all directions, and the views over the harbor are good. However after about 20 mins of admiring the view you feel it's time to join the queue to go down in the lift back to level 2, and then a further queue and lift to get back out.Both of the levels are enclosed is glass so it's a bit like a greenhouse when the sun shines - and it makes taking a nice photo that bit harder.All things considered it's quite expensive (I'm afraid I can't remember the exact price) and quite an effort to get up, but the views are spectacular. Unless you hear the siren call of the top of the tower very strongly you get almost as good a view from the top of the nearby world trade centre building which you can go up for a fraction of the price in about a tenth of the time."
