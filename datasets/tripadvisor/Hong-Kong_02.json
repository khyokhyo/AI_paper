We found our walk was very slow, but that would depend on who else was in the group. It would have been helpful to be given a list of places you will visit at the beginning of the tour as we felt we were just wondering around."

It was easy to find the tour guide in front of the Clock Tower at the time mentioned. We had an amazing tour experience with a local guide, with a lot of historic information and great way to feel the city. We have tried the local food in an interesting street shop. For sure I recommend!!"

We met at the Clock Tower and walked through Tsim Sha Tsui. He shared the history of the area, from the British colonial times to recent history in such an interesting manner. We walked from the clock tower, to the Avenue of Stars, learned about the history of the Peninsula hotel, walked through a market, and learned about the economic and history of Hong Kong. It was fantastic and highly recommend!"

I think the tour was a great mix of history, current customs and monuments/attractions, and I love that we got to know a very busy neighborhood in Hong Kong, Tsim Sha Tsui. Alla was a great guide, enthusiastic and open about any questions we had and our preferences. If I would recommend one point of improvement, it would be to speak more about the current state of Hong Kong in terms of politics and recent history, as well as what the locals feel about it, as I think this is quite important to help a foreigner understand the city and its people. It will also be great to see you expand and start to have tours in other parts of town!"

Its great that they have started a Hong Kong free walk, its a great introduction to the city, you walk around and get familiar with the busy streets while also seeing some sights and learning some of Hong Kong's history. The walk follows the same pattern as other cities free walk's, but i did like the addition of the folder with photos for us to see, to help with some explanations. Not had that on any other free walk we have done! Nice touch. The group was a varied mixture of old and young, Sheila was quite a speedy walker but as she said, most Hong Kongers do everything fast! Highly recommend this tour, we tipped $100 (\u00a310) which is about our standard for the free walks, although it is \"free\" they are giving up their time to show you their home and paid tours are four times as much. Thank-you Sheila!"

For a new company that started late last year in 2015, it's pretty well organized. It's like the Apple iPhone of tours, where stops are clean, comfortable, and information is presented in an attractive way. It's also a great place to meet friends and other solo travelers that become friends. Tiffany was so sweet, energetic, and great as a tour guide. It is free, but run on tips, but there is no pressure whatsoever. After the first few stops, everyone was starting to melt from the Hong Kong heat and humidity, but Tiffany was still running like an energizer bunny. She revived us by bringing us to a really delicious local fruit juice stand. I really enjoyed her sharing the local knowledge of food stalls and stands with us since it's something that's difficult to research on your own. All in all, a great way to spend a few hours and make some new friends if you're going to walk around anyways."

You find out about a lot of the main attractions and also the history of the city. There's also a chance to try some local food.

If you include this fact in the description in the meetup, that would be fine. Otherwise, I think it is a bit deceptive to spring it up on people."

Would be great if this tour was offered in other areas too as I really enjoyed it. Make sure to tip generously."

Our lovely Tour Guide Alla was very informative and opened our eyes to many things we would never have known or seen if wandering around on our own... She even stopped off to show us how to buy delicious street food or where to go and eat locally... As it got unbearably hot during the day she catered to us poor sufferers of the humidity and helped us by showing us how to travel from point to point using the underground railway system.A great tour with a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable local who loves her city."

Tiffany really knows the area of Kowloon and gave such a positive portrayal of people. We learned a lot about changing attitudes, politics, social status, history, commerce and the feng shui architecture of the skyline skyscrapers. The street food stop was a welcome interlude and we enjoyed the pineapple buns and the mango mochi! The walking pace was fast, but I think if anyone would have required a slower pace, she would have adjusted the tempo. Overall, a great tour for the cost of a generous tip! We had paid $400 for a private 4 hour tour the day before and we actually enjoyed Tiffany more!"

She was friendly, chatty and knows her stuff. It rained on and off and was very hot, but that's HK. We really appreciated the stop for street food and loved her recommendations. My only complaint is that Tiffany walked very fast, which was fine for us, but could be hard for some to keep up and it would be easy to lose her in HK's crowded streets. She also speaks quite softly and could be difficult to hear. Over all, very good and would highly recommend."

It was really helpful to not only see many attractions but also hear of the history and local narrative.

She was very friendly and excited to answer any questions we had in our small 4 person group. During our walk we even stopped by some street stalls for some snacks.

Even though total there were only 3 people - our nice guide lady still made the entire tour (almost 3 hours). It was very informative and also fun, a lot of facts that I was not aware of. Also good lesson in Hong Kong history. And needless to say - we saw a lot which otherwise would not have been possible to find on our own, and especially in such short period of time. Lots of good suggestions, tips how to make Hong Kong experience even better. I would truly recommend this, really a must if you are first time in Hong Kong."

My friend Aisling and I found this free walking tour when searching Google for things to do, once I went onto their facebook, the reviews spoke for themselves. We reserved 2 places for the 11am tour the next day, pleasantly surprised how easy and efficient the process was. We easily found Tiffany and our group. Tiffany was so friendly, welcoming, full of interesting facts and stories and talked of Hong Kong's development and history with great pride and love. There was a great sense of fun and you felt that you could ask any questions. We were shown the most delicious and cheap street food..she recommended the fish balls which were beautiful! I really gained an understanding of this incredible city which I would not have gained with the short amount of time we had without the HK free walk!"

In about 3 hours of walking the streets of Kowloon we heard about the history, saw the key sights and experienced an afternoon soaking in the culture. She pointed out the highlights, introduced us to some safe street food, walked us thru a local food market and answered all our questions in perfect English. Great start to our tour and cruise thru SE Asia."

We managed to see many things in these ~2.5 h, had a fun snack stop and noted many places for further visiting.Just be sure to come 10 min in advance, as TST is a very crowded area and it will be hard to find the group if late."

Would have actually liked a little slower pace and a longer tour, 4 hours instead of 3, just moved a little too fast while trying to talk and listen, would have liked a little more time for more pictures. But still enjoyed it, and of course saw many of the same places Tiffany took us to over the next few days, so were much more comfortable with Kowloon after our tour.I like the concept of a free tour, which as we all know, nothing is free, but the part I like is that you pay at the end based on your experience and what you think the tour was worth to you, instead of paying a high fixed price at the beginning and then maybe being disappointed. And I think your tour guide works harder this way since they have to do a good job for you to earn their living.I highly recommend this!"

It was a chilly and rainy Monday and it turned out that I was the only one to show up for the early (11am) tour, but Sheila (the guide) cheerfully went ahead with the tour with as much enthusiasm as you'd expect for a large crowd on a perfect day. So it was a private tour in my case and I was extremely impressed with both the tour and my guide. We went to many \"hidden\" sights that I'd never have found on my own, and it was very fun and well paced. I was a bit self conscious having a private guide like this, but Sheila carried on like a seasoned pro.

It was great and captured all the essentials of kowloon and the origins of hong kong, leaving you knowing where to go next. She even stopped for us to sample local food which was wonderful. She was always ready to answer questions on anything about life in hong kong, it was educational all around. On this tour we also had Mickey helping her and that added for even more dialogue on life in the city. The tour was on one of the coldest days in recent memory for hong kong but they both persevered and we all had an awesome time Thanks so much. Michael Flatt"

I was the only one that attended, which was probably because the weather was a bit misty and had some occasional showers. However, that was probably to my advantage. As I could ask all the questions I wanted and my guide were fully capable of giving me answers about local cuisine, politics, movie industry, education and other things. She was a lovely guide and took me to see some of the main attractions in Tsim Sha Tsui as well as giving local tips on where and what to eat. I would recommend the tour to anyone."

Did not expect much.I showed up at the Clock Tower and met Tiffany Lam with the green umbrella. She is the guide for that day.There are other participants : one person from Manila and three from Spain.Tiffany is talkative, smart, always smile, and so friendly.Other participants are friendly and nice as well.Feels like I'm in a small group of friends.It was my second visit to Hongkong. Frankly I did not fancy in Hongkong before; too dense, and too urban.However Tiffany has changed my feeling about Hongkong; as she can show me the soul of Hongkong: from historical spots, local cultures, local food, tips, and others knowledges.And there was a roles palying too: as if we actors from a film.I start fall in love this city :)From 2 days visit to Hongkong yesterday, this walking tours is the most delight activity and rewarding as well.I hope Tiffany and her friends can develop other walking tour rutes and make this programme can reach theirs goal, and give them profesioanal benefit as well.Good luck.

It is a lot of walking, but you see a lot of Kowloon. There is historical information, an opportunity to stop and try some street food with advice from your guide, current information of what is fun to do, and more. I recommend this to anyone just getting to Hong Kong or even if you've been for a little while. Oh, and it's free, but leave a good tip because it's certainly worth it!"

I'm very sure their tours will get more traction soon and more people joining them on the walks. Anyways - our tour was great from start till end. Tiffany was lovely and did tell us a lot of interesting stuff about the city, also a bit about Hong Kongers' culture, history and traditions. We have been on several free walking tours before (in Australia and some South American countries) and can say, that his HK tour was amongst the ones we liked the most.

Most importantly not only she is very knowledgeable about the city, but she makes sure that you have the REAL experience of Hong Kong. She will bring you to unusual places, off the beaten track, and tell you all interesting stories on how the local live. You can tell the difference between someone who is doing their job and someone who is passionate about it. Well, she definitely falls in the second category.You will not regret it!!! Fantastic tour."

Background: Two 60ish women visiting Hong Kong for the first time.To Do List: See Hong Kong -- 'Old Hong Kong' from the perspective of a local.We had booked two full-day tours with two different guides. Our Day 1 guide did take us everywhere. However, we felt rushed and exhausted. Day 2: We met a smiling, lovely young woman named Lorena. She asked us what we had seen so far, and what we wanted to see with her. We explained, that we had been exhausted from our first tour, and really wanted a slower pace. We also told her that we wanted to see the bird market as well as someplace green (we had just come from Japan, and the concrete and skyscrapers left us wanting a garden). She definitely listened -- our pace was not rushed. She took us to a gem -- the Nan Lian Gardens. Beautiful, serene, fascinating! We spent quite a while there, at our request. Then on to interesting markets, views of Hong Kong from the tops of tall buildings, and a great lunch at a local restaurant.By the end of the tour we wanted to take Lorena home with us! She's got it all - a terrific personality, the ability to listen, excellent knowledge of Hong Kong. And she followed up with us the day after the tour with suggestions of additional things to do!"

She sent us a ton of information before we left and sent a picture and bio of our guide, Maggie, and gave us a meeting time/place. We got there a few minutes early and Maggie was already there and ready to start our tour. Maggie was born and raised in Hong Kong and spoke English like it was her first language. She taught us so much, took us to some great places that we would have never experienced on our own, and gave us some awesome food adventures! We had specifically requested to have a tour of \"the real Hong Kong\", wanted to get outside of the touristy areas and we wanted to learn about the food and culture - Maggie did not disappoint and it was actually far better than I could have anticipated. It was great to do this early in our trip, because we had so much more knowledge about the culture and knew a few customs and words. We used a few things that we learned when we were interacting with some other locals and they loved it! They can tailor the tour any way you would like - whether you want to stick to the touristy areas or if you want to dive into the culture and sights far off the tourist track. I think that this is a must-do tour in the beginning of your visit to Hong Kong."

We took the private walking tour. I have to say the highlight was the Dim sum, DELICIOUS!!! The story of the building structure of the HSB and China bank building(s) is fascinating. Can't say enough about how educational and interesting this tour is. Well worth the time and cost."

Because it was our first time in Hong Kong, Maggie provided a great overview of the city, and then we started walking. We learned about many sights, the metro system, and worship traditions. As is often the case in the summer, we did have some rain during our tour, but Maggie was a real pro, and knew how to navigate the city so we could still have a completely enjoyable day.I recommend this tour highly as the beginning of your visit in Hong Kong because after a day with Maggie, we felt extremely comfortable navigating other parts of the city on our own. We took several tours on our recent trip to Southeast Asia, and this was by far the best."

You can't go wrong booking this tour, Ski's easy manner and friendly demeanor instantly melts away any \"blind date\" apprehensions you might have. Coming off a two week, four city trip through mainland China with 4 different private guides, I had a fresh perspective on this important issue. Having an engaging guide makes all the difference and hitting it off right away with Ski sealed the deal. Her Big Foot Tour was just the right thing for us, it led us around Hong Kong island with a lighthearted, yet informative walk. The 4 hours rushed by as she miraculously wove us through new and old sights, back streets and busy corners. Unless you have gobs of time to wander the streets, this tour packaged a wonderful array of sights into a compact 4 hours. If you are a first time visitor like me with only one full day to explore Hong Kong; I can't imagine a much better value. Ski effortlessly modified things for our group, even helping rendezvous with my adult son in the middle of the tour. A quick stop here (local tea/coffee), a memorable lunch stop there (authentic local dim sum), and as we finished she hailed a cab to send us up to the peak. Ski \"made our day\" in Hong Kong and contributed to a memorable finish to our big trip.Additional credit goes out to the pre-planning leading up to our big day. Her email responses were always prompt and provided straight forward answers to all that was asked. I had no problems in finding our start point, she provided useful advice on other things we should try to do and her well-written website post on finding the best view of Hong Kong on the peak was spot on ! (Don't bother with the Peak Tower, take her advice and walk to her suggested \"Secret Spot\" ~ now that's a million dollar view)"

We were in Hong Kong for 48 hours and I was looking on Trip Advisor to see how we could see the best of the city in such a short time. I found Ski, contacted her via email and easily set it all up from home. We knew we were going up to Victoria's Peak on our own and she even had great advice on how to do that...she also advised us on buying an octopus card which turned out to be so worthwhile! You buy it at a subway station and can use it for all kinds of transportation...including the tram up the Peak |(bypassing ticket lines) and the Star Ferry which is a must....it made it so easy to get around the city...just scan the card! At the end of our trip , we went back to a subway station and got what we didn't use refunded...for a very small fee....it was great....and we knew about it because of Ski. I had read on Trip Advisor that she tailored the trip to you and we really liked that aspect....so whatever you are interested in, she will gear it to that. We like learning about history and culture and she had so many interesting stories about the city...we learned a lot ! Buildings or places that we never would have really noticed came alive with Ski and places we would have noticed became a more enriched experience with her stories and insights...\u200bfascinating. Our tour was the food tour...OMG...the food was amazing!...and at these little local places that yes, we probably could have found on our own but would have taken us much much longer...and she made it so easy...she knows right where to go...can get a table easily even when it looks full and most importantly knows exactly what to order::).,,...everything she ordered for us was delicious....try the goose!...and I am still dreaming about the egg tarts.,...served warm they just melt in your mouth....I only wish I would have had room for another one! You can even pay for this with your octopus card :)Ski knows Hong Kong and loves it....through her eyes we also fell in love with this extraordinary city. She is a wonderful ambassador and Hong Kong is lucky to have her.We spent three weeks in China with 48 hours in Hong Kong and Ski was definitely a highlight of those memorable three weeks.I'm jealous that you have the chance to explore this amazing city with her.Take her tour and you'll know exactly what we mean :)"

We had lots of laughs especially at my husbands difficulty with even the thought of snake soup. We started off in statue square, I must say before I go on , from the minute I contacted ski I found the whole operation very professional , email arrived on time, I had clear directions and photographs of where to meet. These were invaluable given that we had just arrived in Hong Kong about 12 hours earlier . We were taken on a very informative tour which was lots of fun , the perfect combination. We went to places that we would never had been to if we had not taken this tour. We went to local eateries for French toast hong Kong style and then for some local dim sum. We covered the famous buildings, mid elevations, longest escalator in the world soho and a temple along with all the history associated with these places. I cannot recommend Ski highly enough, I always try to get a walking tour when I visit a new city as they are usually so informative and this did not disappoint. Thanks again Ski for putting up with 2 old idiot is we had a ball!Finally I meant to add that when we were leaving ski gave us lots of tips of where to visit and directions, next tip was taking the taxi up to Victoria peak.

Maggie was extremely knowledgeable, great communicator and helpful. We saw/experienced things that we would not found on our own. We had our 4yr old with us, who was carried much of the walk, but Maggie really made an effort to include her in the experience."

She has an extensive knowledge of Hong Kong history, quaint neighborhoods, and FOODs that we fell in love with. The speciality coffee/tea drink and coconut jam French toast was delightful. And the local dim sum restaurant she took us too was the best experience. She showed us how to order ( a real trick to that) and what to order! The temple experience was also great, as Ski explained so much about what was going on as we went inside. If in Hong Kong, ask for Ski; you cannot go wrong!"

The Metro ride was only 2 stops to begin our tour. We started our tour in a public park. Anyone can point out buildings, Maggie told us about the history, gave us insight about the culture, and did it with humor and expertise. Maggie speaks excellent english and was comfortable answering our questions. She was also attentive to how we were doing on our walk. At one point she offered to take us to a local tea house for a break. What a treat to sit with locals and have a local drink of tea, coffee and milk. Don't be put off by the description, I can't do it justice. Suffice it to say, it was delicious. She ordered the local version of French Toast as well. It was great. We wound our way through local streets, saw a local produce market, fish and meat vendors. One of my favorites was a local herbalist. We watched as \"medicines\" were portioned, ground and prepared for locals. We visited the Man Mao Temple and watched as people lit incense and made offerings for a good and healthy year. The tour ended at a local Dim Sum shop where she ordered a delicious lunch we all shared. This was a great tour, and I would not hesitate to give it 5 Stars. Don't miss it for a real Hong Kong experience"

As others have said we were blown away by such a great 4hrs around Hong Kong and the advice about taking a tram to the peak and the train back down was priceless when you see the queues at the bottom of the hill.We had a four hour tour of the city including statue square, mid level escalator, SoHo, mid levels residential area, Hollywood Road, Man Mo Temple, Cat Street Market and the dried seafood and medicine market. I also had the chance to try some unusual foods such as snake:-)We so enjoyed this tour and Maggies company, its worth every penny and would not hesitate to recommend Big Foot Tours."

We had a four hour tour of the city including statue square, mid level escalator, SoHo, mid levels residential area, Hollywood Road, Man Mo Temple, Cat Street Market and the dried seafood and medicine market. We stopped for lunch along the way and had great, cheap dim sum. Maggie was a great guide with excellent knowledge of Hong Kong. She was good humoured and a pleasure to spend a few hours with. She left us with a map and happily marked out the other sites we wanted to see along with details of the route we followed so we could back track if we wanted to. Her advice about arriving at The Peak terminus at 8.30am was a God send. I found Big Foot's details through Trip Advisor and I'm pleased to say the reviews were very accurate."

My family of three booked a private tour of Hong Kong through Big Foot Tours and it was FANTASTIC!!! First, Ski thank you. Our tour with you was one of the highlights of our time spent in Hong Kong. You really did make us feel like we were walking the streets of Hong Kong with an old friend. Ski took us to great places that we would never have discovered on our own like the first tea-coffee house and winding up many stories to find an awesome busy authentic dim sum restaurant. We covered so much ground in the time spent on the tour. We found that the streets of Hong Kong were not the easiest to navigate on our own, even with a GPS because of all of the walkways above ground level so it was nice being on a tour where we didn't have to waste time trying to find things. Being on the Big Foot Tour with Ski was an extremely efficient way to see the sights and she will customize the tour to include anything you want. It seemed like at every corner Ski was pointing out new and interesting things that would have gone unnoticed if we were wondering around on our own. She really provided us with a local insight to the city. Ski was entertaining, engaging ,knowledgeable plus she had a very comfortable ease that made her fun to spend time with. Even my teenage son says her tour was impressive so if you can keep his attention for hours that is a huge endorsement! Our time on the tour went by so fast. Ski walked us back to our hotel, highlighted on a map all of the sights we saw and then she even gave us directions and helped us plan out what we should see and do for the rest of the day. Awesome!!! I did book our tour months in advance just to make sure I didn't miss out. Emails were all answered super quick and planning and booking were easily done. I would definitely recommend booking a tour with Big Foot Tour. I wish we had more time to do the food tour as well. Next time!"

In the end, she was amazing and a must and I can confidently say, I walked away with a better understanding of Hong Kong.."

We booked this four hour tour with Ski as part of a brief day-and-a-half layover in Hong Kong on our way to New Zealand, and we are so glad that we did. It elevated our visit from an enjoyable but aimless visit to something so much more, and ensured that we experienced a different (more genuine?) Hong Kong away from the beaten tourist track. Ski is a natural at what she does - knowledgeable, funny, engaging, informative, and very easy going - and time just flew by. The sights, sounds, smells, food (so much food!), history, anecdotes, and more, that we were treated to during our tour really enhanced our enjoyment and understanding of Hong Kong.So much has already been said by previous 5-star reviewers about how superlatively excellent these tours are, and we don't feel the need to repeat previous praise other than to say that we agree wholeheartedly. Her tours are deservedly popular and it is advisable to book well in advance. Communication beforehand was clear and swift, and Ski gives you plenty of opportunity to tailor the tour to your own interests, should you wish to do so, as well as providing lots of useful tourist information about Hong Kong before your visit. Easily one of the best tours we have had the pleasure of going on anywhere in the world, and one that we will repeat without hesitation if we visit Hong Kong again. Highly recommended!\u5514\u8a72"

Even before we left for HK, Ski was a big help planning the tour sites, recommending restaurants for us to try. She responded to every email quickly and professionally. For example, when I asked her to recommend a dim sum place she immediately suggested we include dim sum in our tour so she could take us to a place where tourists would never go on their own. When I finally met her, I felt like we were already friends!We did a private walking tour that explored many of the better known sites of HK as well as the hidden gems. Ski is friendly, funny, informative and a complete pleasure to tour around with. She showed us so much and gave us so much interesting information I didn't want the tour to end. At dim sum, we tried a sponge cake dessert that I had never tasted before but immediately loved. Ski offered to send me her recipe for this cake. By the time we returned to our hotel, the recipe had been emailed to me. Now that's impressive! In summary (in case you missed it above) we all LOVED this tour and we loved Ski.

My husband found this tour on Trip Advisor and we decided to do a Private Walking tour because we wanted to do things on our own terms. Ski was our tour guide and met us promptly in our hotel lobby because we were not yet ready to venture out onto the subway system on our own!Ski was very friendly and kind and we immediately left for the subway. She helped us buy our Octopus cards and explained how they worked beyond just the metro (ferry, 7-11, Starbucks, etc.). Our tour took us many miles all over Hong Kong Island. I expected it to be your average walking tour, but Ski really impressed. We learned about history, architecture, feng shui, culinary traditions, religion, education practices and lots of other thing we would have otherwise not have learned without her.Our tour was long. I recommend good walking shoes and an open mind. However, if you book a private tour you can totally customize it however you please. Ski is very flexible. Ours was truly a local tour of Hong Kong.She even followed up with us after the trip with additional recommendations for restaurants and things to do. I cannot recommend this enough."

She took me to one of the best hole in the wall places for a late breakfast, where locals come to get chicken noodle soup, toast, milk tea and egg tarts. Followed by a thorough immersion into the culture and history of Hong Kong island with plenty of stories thrown in. We had Dim Sum for lunch at one of the few local shops that still has push carts going around with food, and had more than enough to eat. After the tour she even gave me a map with very clear directions on what I can do for the rest of the day visiting Kowloon island and Victoria Peak at night, including directions to the secret spot (definitely the highlight of the trip!). Ski was worth every penny as there was no way I could have seen, done, or learned as much about Hong Kong in the short time I had without her."

Reading others reviews, I booked Ski about 3 months in advance of knowing that my group of friends would like an overview of HK and what we should see. Ski was AWESOME. A couple of people had been to Kong Kong before for business but not as tourists. Her directions/instructions were fantastic. I'm pretty thorough (read: pretty anal) so I did my research about the MTR and the ease about getting around HK. To save time and maximize our time with Ski, I opted to meet her the financial district. She sent us the directions with photos of where to meet and what symbols to look for (everything is in English and I shamefully only learned about two words in Cantonese because English was so widely used in Hong Kong). I totally recommend buying the Octopus card upon arrival. I think we spent 150 HKD and we never had to add more money and we used the MTR and ferries quite often (we were only there for a week). But back to the tour, since we didn't have a preference of where to go, I asked for a general overview of Hong Kong.Overall, wonderful - we went to have a bite to eat at Lan Fong Yuen (a place we would probably not venture on our own), walked through the Chinese medicine place (I can't remember what it was called, but very interesting remedies for various maladies), had lunch at a dim sum place, visited one of the oldest temples. I have only hit on the major points, but throughout the tour, she talked about culture and lifestyle of Hong Kong, the people, and some history. Once we were done, she had great recommendations of going to Victoria Peak (but take a taxi since the tram lines would be super long and we weren't missing much on the trams), how to get to other areas of interest (flower market, bird market, lady's market), and also a map that showed us where we went and if we needed to retrace our steps for any reasons. Ski also offered that we could text/email her if we had any further questions!Knowing what I know now, I would have booked for an additional tour on the Kowloon side (I'm assuming that Ski offers that tour!). We ended up walking to various sites on our own, but with someone who has the local knowledge, I know our group would have appreciated her knowledge.Totally recommend - and as others have said, do Ski's tour at the beginning of the trip!"

She looked after us from our meeting at the HSBC building until putting us into a taxi for Victoria Peak four hours later. As well as introducing us to a range of Chinese foods, the dim sum restaurant being the highlight, she provided a flow of relevant information on Hong Kong and its history. Before our tour began she advised us to get Octopus cards for the metro and afterwards she emailed us her recommendations on Chinese restaurants. We loved our visit to Hong Kong and Ski's tour set just the right tone with which to begin it."

She was punctual, very intelligent, easy to talk to and above all very informative and knowledgeable about Hong Kong and Chinese culture (even the 100 day old eggs). The advantage of this tour was Ski took us into places to eat and drink, that neither my wife or I as westerners would have ever ventured into, the experience was truly magical. I would strongly suggest any travellers to Hong Kong to take a Big Foot tour. Once the tour was over the assistance did not stop there and she suggested things for us to do over the remaining 3 days. From our first contact with Ski back in May 15, the information provided was brilliant and some of the information provided about the MRT and Octopus card was invaluable. Thank you Ski, best regards Colin & Nikki"

While going on our walk with Ski we were taken to places we would have never come past on our own. Throughout the walk we felt as if were with a friend, getting to know their city. Ski is very knowledgeable of Hong Kong's culture and history. It is because of this true knowledge that it is so easy for her to show and tell Hong Kong with great conversation (instead of rattling off facts as some other tour may do). With her help we were able to experience restaurants that we would have missed and get real experiences with delicious food! Ski also gave us tips for future sightseeing and entertainment. I highly recommend this tour. It will allow you to see places beyond what's on the Top Lists and guidebooks. Ski is your ticket to a piece of the real Hong Kong :)"

I found it to be interesting and insightful, but my companions were hoping for a tour that explained more food history than political. Again, that's just preference. The food places he brought us to I thought were wonderful, as was the ability to see so many different parts of the city on foot. We ate everything from congee to BBQ pork, authentic pork knuckle soups (not for the faint of heart) and he tried repeatedly to find us an open egg tart place. Since they were all closed, he recommended one in the market for the next day which was THE BEST EGG TART IN THE WORLD!Anyways all in all great experience. Just want to note that you get a lot of history, and personal reflections, along with the food tours. I would say it is actually more history and current state of affairs information than it is food (but you still eat a lot and are very full).

I also appreciate that Joe was not only able to accommodate our particular interests but he was also able to stay with his own agenda to educate us about daily life in Hong Kong. I wish we had \"Joe Clark\" on the rest of our trip."

Joe was an excellent guide, any question we asked Joe he would give us a real understanding of all the issues facing Hong Kong over the coming years.Hong Kong has become even busier so experiencing the new transportation methods and working out how people live in those highrise buildings was very interesting. The markets and the food on the streets is Hong Kong and Joe urged us to try places that we wouldn't have done without his knowledge, which was a really enjoyable experience.I would highly recommend Big Foot Tours - a really great way to start a visit to Hong Kong."

On the tour we followed a well trodden path but to our surprise we discovered the fascinating history of central and western district along with some great food and drinks we have forever overlooked. I would highly recommend this tour to HK incumbents and tourists alike.

After much googling of reviews and walking tour companies we could not find one more highly recommended than Big Foot Tours. The communication with Ski to set up our tour was excellent - he and Joe (our guide) ensured that we had everything we needed to start our tour! We selected a Private tour which was very reasonably priced. Payment was easily done and was very secure. Communication was excellent - all our questions were answered before we even asked them and we got some great tips on how to set ourselves up for our days in Hong Kong.On the day of the tour we met our guide Joe at Chater Gardens at Central. It was an easy place to meet and we luckily scored a gorgeous warm day! Joe found us easily and was really pleasant and friendly! Being our age it was fantastic to talk to someone who had similar interests and Joe really did a fantastic job of personalising the tour to what we were interested in. The time just flew by and we loved seeing some local eating spots and how real locals live, trying some local food (try the tea and toast!!), and seeing things from a different point of view! Joe had a great historical knowledge, a charming accent (having lived in the UK), and was really engaging and interesting to chat to! When our tour concluded Joe kindly went through the map with us of where we had gone, pointed out some great things we could do (which we did over the next few days!) and helped us find the bus to get to the Peak so we could continue our sightseeing. We really can't recommend Big Foot enough. If you want to experience the REAL Hong Kong with lovely interesting people then Big Foot is the way to go. We have recommended to our family and friends and hope to come back and see a different side of things another time! Thanks Big Foot and Joe!."

Fresh off the plane, Joe met us in our hotel lobby and immediately had us aquatinted with the area and the MTR system. Joe was a fantastic guide - he used our interests to tailor a tour that suited us perfectly. While we had both been to Hong Kong before, the tour gave us insights into the people and culture that we would have never known ourselves. Joe also showed us many hidden gems, pointing out areas that we otherwise would have walked straight past. Taking the tour at the beginning of our stay, Joe also provided us with some recommendations for things to do and places to visit/eat at for the remainder of our trip. We also found ourselves returning to the areas we visited with Joe as we'd enjoyed them on the tour. I'd highly recommend the tour to anyone visiting Hong Kong, as not only does it enable you to make the most out of your stay, you'll also learn a lot from a friendly and knowledgeable guide."

From the moment we met Ski it was obvious this was going to be a success. We started with an introduction to Feng sui as demonstrated by some of the downtown bank architecture, and as we walked and explored different areas, more of the superstitions and beliefs of the Chinese people were explained. This included a trip to a temple where we learned about attitudes to ancestors and fortune telling. We tried a 50/50 coffee/tea mix drink and sampled Dim Sum. Probably should not have eaten such a substantial breakfast so we could eat more. We enjoyed seeing the preserved foods and hearing about their use in Chinese medicine. Loved seeing the wet markets (I wish we could get our meat and fish that fresh) and declined the preserved eggs. Perhaps my palate is not as adventurous as I thought. We road on the longest escalator, walked through different neighborhoods, saw a school and learned about the education system and tutoring. The four hours passed very quickly and it was amazing to see where we had been on a map afterwards. Ski provided useful suggestions and maps for things to do while in Hong Kong and was extremely helpful.I would recommend anyone to arrange a tour with Ski. It is an excellent introduction to Kong Kong and she will customize the tour to one's interests as be as specific or eclectic as desired."

Joe listened to us and really delivered with our 4 hours together just flying. We were surprised as our tour was coming to an end as to how far we had walked and the number of food stops we had made. To save time walking back to Central Joe accompanied us on a double decker tram and then we only had a short walk to catch the Star Ferry back to Kowloon. We had an awesome time and can't wait to visit HK again and do another Big Foot tour."

This was my second tour with Joe, but the first for my sister, who used to live in HK 30+ years ago, when she was a Wren in the Royal Navy. I'd asked for a tour which might emphasise to big sis how much the place has changed, since those days of empire. Joe and Ski pointed out that I might be re-hearing the same stuff, but I wasn't at all concerned, as a) my memory is shot, and b) there was so much more to learn from my first trip about 2 years ago.Since then, of course, there have been the demonstrations, and as we asked, Joe wasn't shy in expressing his views. Anyway, the tour was a mighty success for my sister, and for me.I can't recommend it more highly. Joe's antecedents, (half Hong Kong and half UK) gives him an excellent foot in both camps, and to hear him switch from regular English when talking to us, and then to Cantonese when talking to restaurant owners etc, was a joy to behold. His is a wonderful talent, a gift, and I hope he uses it wisely in the future. I know there are ex-pats doing walking tours, but this is entirely different, and so much the better for it. Just the two of us - really personal and private. Really good stuff.Next time, Joe, my wife and I will do a food tour with you...."

I was not sure if I wanted to do the tour because I have a 4 year old boy - and those that have kids understand my concern. I asked her if she had anything that would peak his interest such as dragons, traditions for the New Year holiday or any interesting historical landmarks. She put together a sample itinerary of what would best suit our needs. I was still hesitant on some of her suggestions yet she assured me that it would be enjoyable - and she was right!Our tour guide was Joe and he met us at our hotel in the Mongkok area (highly suggested if you are into all the markets). We then took the subway all the way to Central and he was very engaging from the very start. He didn't bore us with facts - he told us about his daily life in Hong Kong and his concerns. He also showed us the parts of the city which were significant to the historical aspect of Hong Kong.We walked down a high-end street sort of like Beverly Hills and then turned off into a side street - you would have never found this on your own. It was like another world hidden within the majestic Hong Kong. It was a very crowded market with food stalls, vegetables, meat and fish and people getting ready for the Chinese New Year. We saw turnips being peeled and he told us turnips were a symbol of luck and that we would be eating some later. We stopped off at a small restaurant for traditional Hong Kong meal of rice congee and pork and my son had a random lesson in Chinese from a man sharing a table with us. After eating, we walked some more and visited the mid-level escalators and then visited Joe's old school. I appreciated this part because he was being very interactive with my son and even took him to a typical Hong Kong playground. My son was interested in all of Joe's stories and Joe did not seem annoyed or irritated at the amount of questions! We also visited the Man Mo Temple and this history was intriguing and we bought some incense. My son also paid his respects in the temple and Joe told him about all the hanging red papers and wishes to ancestors. After the temple, we walked to a restaurant to have typical Dim Sum. The food and service was great because Joe could communicate for us and get us every dish we desired from dumplings to pork.Even after the tour, Joe gave us a map and pointed us in the right direction for other places to explore. We had only signed up for a half day tour and it was well worth it. His direction led us to the Cat Street Market where a Chinese Man decided to spend 40 minutes teaching my son how to write Chinese Characters for the New Year Signs!Do this tour. You will get much more out of Hong Kong even if you believe you have done all your research. It is best to see it from the eye of a Local and find the hidden gems! Thanks so much Joe and we hope you are able to visit Texas one day - don't hesitate to contact us!"

I would definitely recommend going more of the local route- forget the Peak (see it, but on your own) - Joe takes you on an authentic adventure through back roads and less visited parts of the city. He lets you truly experience Hong Kong from the markets (I even got to try a cough drop at the medicine market) to the local restaurants (try the goose and the toast it was so yummy!) while giving you a history lesson at every turn. Big Foot Tours was so helpful and super flexible in making this a trip to remember. You can give guidelines of what you do and do not want to see, and leave the rest up to Joe and you will not be disappointed. Ever since I got back to the states, I haven't stopped raving about the adventure with Joe and am already planning my next trip for more ecploring. Joe gave me a map at the end of the tour with all the places we stopped at, which was a perfect souvenir! Joe even gave me pointers for the next leg of my trip to Cambodia.

Joe will draw out the route on your city map you can revisit some of the spots or and he'll mark other suggestions so you have an easy time finding them."

We have been to Hong Kong several times on stop overs but this time I felt I really got to see and experience a small bit of the real thing. We were travelling with our teenage sons so decided a food tour might be a way to keep their interest whilst learning something about the city. Joe was absolutely fabulous and managed to engage the boys. He combined history, culture and food to give us a better understanding of what it is like to live in the city. We tried lots of things we would never have tried on our own and the four hours past too quickly. Ski was also fantastic with the arrangements and the instructions she sent before hand were spot on. Thank you both for a great experience!"

When I contacted Big Foot Tour for a guide to take us for a walking tour, Ski was extremely prompt and informative when dealing with queries via email. With her detailed instructions, my husband and I had no problems meeting up with Joe, our guide, at the MTR station. We started at 3.30pm and in the next four hours, had a fantastic trip through parts of Central HK and west of it, chock-full of information and details. For example, we never noticed until Joe pointed it out, that there were so many branches of a particular jewellery chain on ONE street alone, to cater for the stream of wealthy mainland Chinese coming into HK. We were shown an area of low-rise buildings which was surrounded by expensive high-rise condominiums but which is apparently shunned by the developers because of a plague that had raged through the area and left many dead decades ago. Just by walking, we were shown the glitzy touristy part of HK, the brilliantly planned Mid-Level escalators, where the expensive high rise residences are, and also visited the places where the man in the street lived and ate. Food in HK is glorious and in the course of walking, we also grabbed some local milk tea, herbal tea and snacks to sustain us. Joe is a storehouse of information and we had an insightful conversation with him on what the Occupy movement was about. His little nuggets of this and that was what made the trip memorable for us. And to finish off the tour (it was dinner time by then) he led us to a little restaurant called Yat Lok for roast goose rice and when we ate, we were in seventh heaven. The Big Foot team ought to be congratulated for doing their job so well. Highly recommended."

During our first half-day tour, we visited central (including the now-removed protest site), the mid levels and Soho. Joe showed us so much that we wouldn't have otherwise seen, while explaining Hong Kong's history and local customs. We learned so much and had such an enjoyable time, that after our tour I immediately e-mailed Ski to see if we could book with Joe again.For our second half-day, Joe showed us several locations in Kowloon. There is no way that we would have gone to several of the places (like the wet market and a tofu restaurant) un-escorted by a local, so it was great having Joe show us around.In addition to the tours, Joe gave us lots of recommendations for restaurants, shopping and other places to see. He also provided maps showing us where we had gone during the tours. I would also like to mention that after our second tour, I e-mailed Joe asking about a shop location. He quickly replied with the location, shop name and a Google map. Awesome!!Thank you to Joe and Ski for such a wonderful time in Hong Kong!"

Joe offered us the opportunity to look around one of the protest sites which we were interested in. After this we moved on through central visiting a food market and stopped for tea and toast. We explored the mid level escalators and a temple before a dim sum break. After lunch we visited some dried medicine shops to give us an understanding of how people in Hong Kong live. We ended with a a tram ride back to Central. Throughout the tour Joe answered our many questions and volunteered lots of information. He is very engaging and you feel like you are being shown around the city by one of your mates. If you do one tour in Hong Kong make sure it is this one, it will really help to get to know the city and plan the rest of your trip. Would certainly book another if we are back in Hong Kong."

This walking tour is great for seeing another side of Hong Kong away from the malls and the crush of the Nathan Road area. For those who have not been to Hong Kong before it would also give you more confidence to visit these areas by yourself. I would certainly love to revisit the great dim sum restaurant we went to for lunch! Ski was a very good guide, giving us lots of information about the different areas we went to, Chinese and more distinctly Hong Kong life and culture. She answered our questions and was very easy to converse with. If we go back to Hong Kong I would certainly book a tour of another area with Big Foot."

We visited some local street food shops for 'morning tea' & lunch.

We enjoyed a half day tour in Hong Kong on day 2 of a 4 day visit to this fantastic city.The communication with Big Foot Tours was very easy to determine which tour was best for us. We book a half day group walking tour approx 10am til 3pm. Jo was our tour guide.Jo was a very pleasant young man who knows Hong Kong inside out. He understood the history and the culture and made every effort to get this across to all the guests in an engaging way.On our visit, the recent protest site was still in place- so many of the roads were closed. Jo knew all about the issues facing many of the young protesters and we spent the 1st hour learning about his experiences of the protest as we walked through the protest site itself. His passion for Hong Kong was clear and it was very interesting to hear his thoughts about this complex issue.After we visited the site the planned tour got under way & Jo took us to see many sights on Hong Kong- both old & new. The walk was based around the Island - not Kowloon etc. As a group we experienced the Hong Kong way of life - visiting the tea shops and other street food areas. The walk was not too demanding - but we are a fit couple. I would guess that anyone who is able to walk a few miles on foot would be able to cope with the low demands of the walk. Jo always made sure we were engaged & was happy to answer any questions- as well as make sure we were all ok with water/restrooms etc.After we had completed the tour Jo gave us some more ideas of where to visit on our trip. Overall I fully recommend the walking tour, great value for money & a great way to get your bearings for future days/visits. When we go to Hong Kong again & we will - I hope Big Foot will still be around to show us more sights."

Our Brief to them was to walk the back streets and learn about the Hong Kong Chinese food tastes and traditions. This was our first visit to Hong Kong. We had arrived the night before ( end of September 2014) so this was a good introduction to Hong Kong and helped us make the most of the rest of our stay before heading north.Together we walked from Central westward on Hong Kong Island. All easy going. Joe knows his food. He also structured the walk to follow from breakfast through lunch to dessert. We shared so that we could try a wider range of food and not over eat. The congee, goose, teas and tarts were just a part of it, we skipped dinner that night. It was about four hours with Joe, from 3:00 pm. We walked many kilometres, enjoying a fun, educational experience, saw great spaces and places while we smelt and tasted our way through the old streets.We were told Big Foot will tailor your walking tour to your interests.Wear sensible shoes!This young enterprise anticipates and communicates very well.

He took us to all of the right places and fulfilled both of my parents and my wishes.I Highly recommend big foot tour and especially Joe ,he is sharp ,interesting and his English is super good which is very important."

We wanted to experience some of the \"real\" HK. Headed up the Mid Levels Escalator, brunch at Lan Fong Yuen, backstreets, laneways, various markets, local school, temple, gardens, local Dim Sum restaurant for lunch - Brilliant! Would never have found it ourselves - or be able to order. Flexible route depending on what you're interested in. Loads of local/colonial history. Wanted to end tour at Star Ferry for trip across harbour - not a problem. Easy to organise online. Great value. Ski is very friendly, enthusiastic guide. Would do it again if opportunity arises. Thank you!"

            "review": "An absolute must do when in Hong Kong!. I read so many good things about Big Foot Tours and decided that this was something that we, a family of 5 with three children aged 6 to 11, had to do when we were in Hong Kong for three days in October. And I am extremely happy that we did this the first full day we had because with the help of our guide, Joe, we were able to plan a trip where we experienced Hong Kong behind all the luxury shopping - the food, the culture and surprises such as a little beach on Lamma Island. We did a 4 hour tour with Joe, and I really don't think that what I write here will do our tour justice because it was just so fantastic and one of the VERY BEST tours I have been on. The meeting point was so easy to get to and our guide, Joe was punctual, accommodating, so patient with our two boys and even got our rather quiet daughter having a bit of a chat and he was able to direct the history and stories of Hong Kong to my husband and I as well as to the kids even trying to show our youngest the lions he so wanted to see; he also didn't mind when our 6 year old went to hold his hand as we crossed the road - a testament to his patience. We learnt so much about Hong Kong from its humble beginnings as a fishing village to this teaming metropolis it is now. Joe also gave us an insight into Taoism and showed us a beautiful temple in which multiple religions worshipped and prayed as well as taking us to two wonderful places to eat, now of which we revisited as the Hong Kong \"Tea and Toast\" was just too delicious not to have again. At the end of our walk, which came way to quickly, Joe was prepared with maps to show us just how far we'd walked and then, as mentioned before, also gave us some other maps and directions to spending a day at Lamma Island, which was also fantastic. We all were so very happy with this tour and would recommend it to anybody and everyone! When we travel back to Hong Kong, we will definitely be talking to Big Foot Walking Tours and organising another one, it was worth every cent! A very BIG THANK YOU to Joe and to Ski for this wonderful time spent in Hong Kong."

He was very knowledgeable and gave us great insight into the history of Hon Kong and how it came to be what it is today. He took us through the central city and through the old/original markets. We visited 3 traditional eateries and these were amazing. We really enjoyed Joe's commentary and his contemporary perspective of the city. A perfect way to spend a stopover and an appreciation of Hong Kong and its people."

He was incredibly knowledgeable and took us all over the city...we felt like we didn't miss anything.

My husband likes the day to have a definite beginning AND end - a plan...On a recent (children free) break in Hong Kong I pondered how to keep both of us content. Enter Big Foot Walking Tours. As mentioned in other reviews; this company is absolutely fabulous. Ski Yeo was efficient and professional from the first point of contact. I mentioned some thoughts on were we might like to go for our four hour private tour - she took care of the rest. We arranged to meet in our Hotel Foyer; she had my husband interested and following along as soon as we set off. Ski is skilled at adapting the pace according to the client - by osmosis she detected if more time was needed at one point rather than another. Time flew by - I have to say this is definitely the BEST day tour I have ever booked. I will return with my kids next time. Do yourself a holiday favour - even if you think you know Hong Kong book Big Foot Tours - you will get a behind the scenes look at one of the worlds most fascinating city's. I will not give away our itinerary - just a taste - we ate, discussed history, found unique laneways, met locals and shopped. Highly recommended!"

Our guide Joe began with some interesting general historic background to set the scene. Then we were off through alley ways and up escalators to all kinds of fascinating places. A humorous and lively commentary gave us all a true insight into the lives and routines of the many people populating the Island. We stopped regularly to sample exotic cuisine, such as you might otherwise overlook -or even perhaps avoid. All questions were answered with great enthusiasm, and a real in-depth knowledge such as only a true 'native' would know. The East-West fusion is more pervasive than you may realise -helps so much to have it pointed out. The tour made so much more of this great city accessible to us, -food, drink, shopping and local customs and habits. Chinese medicine shops, markets, gardens, weird food stalls, we did it all and more. The 'Five Flower Tea' was something special, that you may never otherwise try. We were so impressed and delighted, we booked a tour of Kowloon on the spot. Kowloon is very much the other side of town, the most populated place on earth, and equally fascinating on another level entirely. More great food and drink...Another truly memorable experience. On both occasions, at the end of the walk, maps of our journey were supplied to us for future reference. We would have done more tours, but ran short of time. Thanks so much to Joe and the Big Feet."

Our family of 4 (kids aged 10 and 13) took a walking tour with Joe on the date of our arrival in Hong Kong. Unfortunately it was basically pouring rain for most of our tour - but we still had a great time. Joe took us around the Central district, including some great stops for food. He was able to manage the tour in spite of the weather, and was very accommodating and engaging with our kids. The time flew by, which was incredible considering the conditions, and we all came away with much more knowledge of Hong Kong that we had prior to the tour. Joe's background and \"insider's\" perspective were very interesting, and he was able to compare Hong Kong to Taiwan - where we had just spent 10 days with family. Ski was also very easy to work with for scheduling - everything went very smoothly. I would highly recommend Big Foot Tours when you visit Hong Kong - it's a great way to really see the city."

Ski was very helpful with suggestions about HK in general, also really friendly and prompt in replying. We chose a 4 hr tour and covered a lot of distance and such interesting places. We did not feel too rushed or too slow at all, Ski made it so the pace was just perfect for our group, stopping when we wanted to take photos, have a drink, or find a loo, as it was a very hot and humid day. Ski's knowledge about HK history, culture, politics, economy, religion, transport, shopping etc etc was amazing. She answered all our questions and encouraged us to email in the future if we think of something else to ask. She had photos in her back pack to help us \"see\" some aspects of HK life that are not accessible to tourists. There were no communication issues as Ski speaks perfect English and Cantonese as well, so she could order some of the local favourite foods for us to try in little local meal places which are out of the main tourist areas. Wonderful ! What a great tour. Well worth the money. Thank you Ski, we loved meeting you and learning from you. Jenni, Don, Jill and Dennis."

Joe met us promptly at 10am in Central as agreed, and we began our trip through Central, mid-level, and Sheung Wan. Joe is a very engaging guy, very knowledgable about Hong Kong's history and what the future potentially holds for Hong Kong. These tours are tailored to an individual's interests and requirements, something that Joe made clear from the beginning of the tour. As food was high on our agenda, Joe made sure that this topic was included throughout the four hours we spent with him. We stopped at a Dim Sum restaurant at lunchtime, packed to the ceiling with locals (always a good sign). Joe asked our preferences, suggested a couple that we would never have tried, and ordered on our behalf. I had a couple of dishes I had not tasted in years, and I was in heaven (turnip cake and small ribs in black bean sauce). The dishes Joe suggested were very tasty too! We peeked into shops selling some very strange products, saw sights that we would have walked past normally, and came away from the tour appreciating Hong Kong a lot more from the experience. If you do one thing while in Hong Kong, do this tour!! Do it early on your visit and it will create a great foundation for the rest of your stay."

She took us to some establishments we would never have found on our own to try local delicacies. We got a great overview of daily life in the city too. We also learned a lot about the history and architecture of the city. We are a very well traveled group and have a lot of experience with private walking tours, and we were impressed indeed. I know that Ski can cater to a variety of Interests and emphasize various aspects of the city, depending on her clients' interests. You will not go wrong seeing this amazing city with BigFoot."

This was by far not our first trip to H.K, so we wanted something with a more local feeling.We could not have chosen better for this is a small business that offers a very personal touch to exactly what you are after or mention to them you may be interested in. we left the option as to 'what to do' totally in their hands. You will eat and drink but this is not a foodie tour just a good honest local feel to central area of HK. If you need a toilet stop just mention for they know the area so well.So not disappointed booking for we ended up revisiting several locations shown to us, using what was shown as a bearings for where else to go that we wanted. After this tour felt very safe walking or taking 'ding 'ding and tram from Admiralty to Western district and from the Peak to the ferry.It is a walking tour but not a hard one and will be at your own pace. Remember that HK is not flat though.It was such fun and the information and background history was passed in a way that made everything so vibrant and it came alive - HK is certainly alive and to be shown it with passion was more than we expected.Do not normally do tours but this really impressed"

The tour was the very best thing I did the entire week I was in Hong Kong. Ski is so knowledgeable about the city, and took us to places off the beaten path. She is the only person who talked about the architecture, the history of the area, the folklore, politics, and traditions, the food, and how the Hong Kong people live. The tour was fascinating, and Ski was delightful. Without that tour, I would have been left with the impression of Hong Kong as a big, bustling city with no soul, but Ski showed us the soul of the city and people. I highly recommend this trip, but suggest you have good walking shoes!"

We learned so much about the history, culture, politics, food, and got to see a lot of the city. Joe was able to answer all of our questions, and encouraged us to try some foods that we would not have tried on our own. It definitely felt like walking around Hong Kong with a friend that knows all the great places to take visitors. Throughout the tour he got to know us a little more and picked up on things we liked and would incorporate that into the tour - he also took us to an amazing dim sum place that we never would have found on our own. When the tour came to an end, Joe had some maps for us and drew out some routes and recommendations for other places to see in the city and it totally set us up for some adventures for the remainder of our stay, we made it to almost all of his recommendations and had a blast! He also mapped out everywhere we had been on our tour in case we wanted to go back to anything. Looking back I don't know how we would have been able to do so much during our short stay without Joe's help.Be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes, and don't hesitate to mention when you want to stop somewhere for water, take a photo, grab some food, etc."

Having booked a random spare of the moment to trip to Hong Kong without knowing anything about the place, decided it would be best to research a walking tour. The number 1 recommended tour on Trip Advisor was Big Foot. There is a reason they are number 1. They are BRILLIANT! Ski was only given 24 hours notice to organise a tour for my mum and I in a short amount of time, she was beyond efficient and helpful. An absolute pleasure to deal with and so so so professional! Then there was the walking tour.. This is when Joe steps in and rescues our Hong Kong experience by showing us just how much more there is to HK than high end shopping. Can honestly say that he made the trip for us! Was truly a pleasure to be in his company with his passion for HK and not to mention his knowledge. An absolute gentleman and extremely worldly. Fell in love with Soho, and got a real taste for the real HK. Have so much more respect and understanding now for the local ways of life. Was an extremely humbling experience. The goose was incredible Joe, and thanks for letting me shop along the way! Legend. My advice: you would be crazy not to book this walking tour!! Book it as early as you can on your trip, as it changes the way you look at HK!"

She created a tour content that was interesting,well diversified and well balanced in regards to many aspects of the city. She gave us great information about the people, its values, its way of life, history, food, feng shui, georgraphical aspects of Hong Kong but also made us experience fun discoveries through it. We feel she gave us a great introduction to the city and it made us fall in love with Hong Kong. We took this tour upon arrival in Hong Kong and we think it was great timing as it opened our eyes to this fabulous city right from the start. Ski has a great personality: she is dynamic, patient, intelligent, efficient and shares her contagious love and interesting perspective of her adopted city (she is from Singapore).

Joe took us off the beaten track to explore Chinese medicine shops, funeral shops, shrines, street markets and the mid levels. We sampled some great local food and took time out in the Hollywood Road reflexology park. Joe is very knowledgable on Hong Kong society, history, food, politics and real estate. The boys talked sport and loved seeing Joe's old primary school and the urban playground where he spent his childhood. We covered a lot of ground in four hours - the boys (nine and 13) had no trouble keeping up but did sleep very well that night! We highly recommend this tour whether you are new to Hong Kong or think you know the country well - I am sure you will discover something you didn't know before."

We travel a lot, and I would say that Joe's tour was probably the best city tour we have ever been on. Joe is from Hong Kong and studied at a university in the UK. He worked for several years in Beijing. Joe took us all over Hong Kong including his childhood neighborhood for a behind the scenes look at culture, local foods, and history. Joe's experience in both Hong Kong and the PRC adds a lot to the tour as he can explain the similarities and differences between the two. Joe pointed out many things that we would have simply walked past. We enjoyed sharing \"congee\" (breakfast soup) and Dim Sum with Joe while he explained the food and how it is eaten. Had we known how great the half-day would be, we would have booked a longer tour with Joe. Fantastic time while learning so much about Hong Kong and China."

I had been able to let them know my interests and the tour was made to measure for me. He met me at my hotel at 15:30 and the walking tour ran for 4 hours. We started off on the MRT for a trip from Kowloon to HK Island. Had a short history of HK and an insight into it's latest happenings ( being that central had a sit in with the pro-democracy group) I was able to ask as many question as I liked as I am interested in politics and Joe was well informed of both sides views. we then set off to view the city from a local view point. We stopped at a small stall to have a milk tea (a specialty drink and very popular with Hongkongers) Then on to a bakery to taste some egg tarts, they were so good warm and sweet. Visited next the Man Mo temple where Joe explained about the belief system in HK, there are many religions represented on the island. Next was a haunted area, or so thought by the Chinese. It was an area where there had been the plague with many deaths during past centuries. He then took me to a reflexology garden I love this type of stuff so had to have a go trying to walk on the stones in my sock feet, it was amazing such a great feeling, loved it. On to an area where there were many Chinese herbal medicine shops and Ghost shops where they sell replica's of every day things that the departed may need in the next life, so interesting. I then tried some herbal tea for health. It was then time for dinner and Joe took me to a very small Chinese restaurant for the best BBQ pork I have ever tasted. A tram trip took us to Central to catch the MTR back to Kowloon and my final destination the Temple Street Night Market. This was where Joe and I parted company after a most enjoyable and informative tour. I was given a map of all the places I had visited and some recommendations for the rest of my stay which proved very useful. This is a tour company I highly recommend and I would use them again they were very reasonably priced."

Booking the tour was easy and Joe was very responsive. On the day of the tour, we met at the agreed upon spot and Joe showed up right on time. Our group consisted of 4 people, husband and I plus our 2 friends who have never been to HK before. Joe did a good job introducing HK through the eyes of the average HK resident. Nothing was off topic, he answered all of our inquiries from religion to politics, to of course, food. He proved to be knowledgable across various subjects, and was a champ in dealing with 4 new yorker's never ending sarcastic remarks. Honestly, the 4 hours flew by.Bottom Line: No matter who you are, what interests you have of HK or is looking to get out of the tour, even if you don't yet know what that may even be, you are in good hands with Joe. Easy going, extremely flexible, great attitude, and hard working. Thanks Joe for a great time. (I'll be impressing some folks here in Chinatown, NYC by cleaning the dim sum bowls!)"

            "review": "Absolutely worth it! A GREAT way to start your visit. Everything about our experience with Big Foot Tours was great. Reservations were easy and email responses were prompt. But the best part without a doubt is the tour.Joe met us at the lobby of our hotel. He was animated, knowledgeable, enthusiastic and very attentive to our interests and needs. We covered a lot of ground and had a chance to try some local snacks (Hong Kong tea with milk, BBQ pork). Growing up in the area, Joe was able to pass on to us a wonderful appreciation for the neighborhoods and character of Hong Kong. I would 100% recommend this to anyone interested in learning about and experiencing this city."

            "review": "Best part of our Hong Kong visit!. We LOVED our tour with Joe. In our four hours together, we learned more than we expected about the history and culture of Hong Kong. Joe is a brilliant and delightful guide who tailored the walk to our specific interests. We saw the old and the new, we shopped for antiques and sampled local food at the market, and at the end of the tour, Joe gave us a map detaling our walk. We were amazed by how much ground we'd covered in one afternoon! It was as if we took the most fun graduate course ever in Hong Kong past and present. There's no better way to enjoy Hong Kong than to book a tour with Big Foot! Jo-sun! (Thank you!)"

Initial emails with Ski were very prompt and the tour itself was great, Joe is a great guide and really gives you a feel for Hong Kong - we visited in April as part of a cruise of Asia and so glad we found Big Foot Tours in Hong Kong. Joe is very flexible and will cater to your interests. If you've not researched your trip or decided what you want to see, let Joe just show you around and suggest some places. We went to some really interesting places, tasted some local food (delicious) and the time just flew by as we chatted with Joe. We have been on many walking tours but this is up there with the best. Thanks Joe for a great day!"

            "review": "Simply put.... THE BEST!!!!!. My apologies to Joe and Ski for the delay in posting, but Big Foot Tours is in a league of their own. To say I'm a detail orientated person would be an understatement so when I travel I typically have every minute of our trip planned out knowing which sites we're going to, in what order, the transportation between sites, etc. Having said that, I STRONGLY recommend booking with Big Foot Tours (for at least 2 days if you can), showing up and letting Joe run the show. Yes, he'll show you some of the fantastic sites HK has to offer, but learning about the culture and history through the lives of every day Hong Kongers is the highlight and something everyone should experience. Joe's energy, knowledge, love for life and sharing HK with tourists is infectious and he's the type of guy you'd open your home to if he ever traveled to your home country. Big Foot Tours helped us absolutely fall in love with Hong Kong and we plan on being back in the next few tours and will book Big Foot Tours once again to explore the new territories and get to know HK that much better. Thank you Ski and Joe, you two are amazing!"

She takes pride in her company, knows her mission and shares her charm & wit with you as if she's known you forever. That is one of the best things about her! I highly recommend Big Foot Tours. We booked last minute so were only able to spend one day with Big Foot Tours and it was everything and more that we had hoped for. I suggest you book with BFT for 2 or 3 days and throw in a couple of evening tours. Wish we could have. Thanks Ski!!!!"

After monitoring of all the possible reviews about this city ? island? Country ? at that time it wasn\u2019t clear. But a plan \" What to see in the first place \" was made . Move around the city on our own from one attractions to another was not interesting for me and not because of laziness , I just wanted not to see the city but discover it. Well, how is it possible for 3 days and with a guide-book ?\u00a0\u00a0Quite unexpectedly, I monitored reviews of attractions in Hong Kong , came across BIGFOOTTOUR. Tripadvisers wrote about the discoveries they have made from the following city tours. I was really scare to start conversation in English but did it! And the next day I received a welcoming letter from Hong Kong with questions about our wishes, our interests and time of the meeting. Just the next day all the details have been agreed and the tour was booked ! Ski sent detailed instructions on how to get to the venue on the subway , and even a picture of our guide Joe. Pride of the planned journey filled me , but also I felt fear if my husband will like this idea. The idea of a walking tour on non-tourist places in an unfamiliar non-European city , booked on an unknown site , paid through an unknown for him PayPal.. he looked skeptical. Anyway , breaking jetleg and husbands attempts to avoid tour itself and also subway, we got to the venue. Joe turned out pretty young Hong Kong sitizen , who spoke on the magnificent British English. Route , which he suggested we could never do independently ! It was incredibly exciting! Travelers are not deceived , indeed, details of of modern Hong Kong life , cuisine, traditions, religion , that he told us were amazing and unlike anything! Several years ago I spent 3 months in Tokyo and 3 months in Seoul , I still know almost nothing about these cities only personal observations , and here 4 hours of observation and knowledge incorporated and resulted in the lovely feeling of the town! Husband, was testing Joe for strength, asking tricky questions on the history of the city and have always received satisfactory answers with dates and percentages ))) I had a feeling that we came to our friend and now carefully exploring the city and its tradition with him . I will not reveal the secrets of the tour, so it would be more interesting for you, I can only say that it was great! We walked a huge part of Hong Kong , had lunch at real!! ( Not a tourist ) restaurant with the most delicious Dim Sum in my life, ride on all types of transport and received by Joe essential recommendations for our next day in Honkong. Next time , I hope, will explore new territories in Hong Kong together . Many thanks to Joe, now looking at our photos from Hong Kong, I sitting on the other end of the world I know you're somewhere there and wish you all the best!"

We have had 3 days in HK and we did the peak tram, and hop on bus stuff and self navigated a bit , but if you want to get under the skin of the city a little you need a local guide. Joe was excellent and we took more from the 4 hrs with him than anything else we did. At 1600 hkd for the tour I felt it was good value and you should definitely do this, simply wandering around with a guide book is not the same....believe me I did that too.We learnt about the past , present , what it's like to live and work here etc."

He was equally versed discussing the philosophy of Taoism and playing with the shop cats with the kids. His tour was terrific and combined the must see parts of the local HK scene with the personal aspects that he brought to his neighborhood and his childhood haunts. We also love to \"meet the locals\" on all of our travels and we believe that Joe set the bar higher in this category. He is clearly a local kid through and through and knew all of the shopkeepers and the best angles to take with each. He was very honest about the good and the bad that he sees in HK today and presented a compelling memory for all of us. Thank you Joe!"

On my return to Hong Kong with my 15yr old son I just had to do it again because I knew my son would thoroughly enjoy meeting Joe and all he had to show him. It was the highlight again for our week in Hong Kong. I cannot recommend this company and this young man, Joe, highly enough. You will see a totally different side to Hong Kong and the stories are just wonderful. The places he took us to on Hong Kong island were extremely interesting. Joe is a wonderful guide, but also an impressive young man. My son thought he was brilliant and talked about the tour for days afterwards. It was definitely the highlight for him. Joe is extremely flexible and will show you whatever you want. If you are unsure what to see then he is a wealth of knowledge and will decide for you, where to take you. An absolute must for anybody wanting to see the real Hong Kong."

I took a 4-hour tour with Big Foot Tour on my first day arriving in Hong Kong for a work trip, and couldn't have been more pleased--all of these good reviews are well deserved! I found this tour to be the perfect thing to do at the start of my short trip, as the rest of my time in HK was colored by the tips and stories that I learned from my tour guide, Joe. Joe helped me by an Octopus card that I used for transportation the rest of my time there, took me on the metro and the tram, taught me about history and how one can commute by escalator, introduced me to black sesame dessert soup and five-flower tea and warm egg tarts, and showed me a neighborhood little park with a reflexology area that I visited most mornings for the rest of my trip. He took time after the tour to draw on a map all the places we had been and gave me other recommendations of places to try. Joe truly showed me the city through the eyes of a local, and packed so much into four hours that I actually feel like I was in Hong Kong longer than I was. I would recommend this tour company to anyone, and especially anyone who is only in HK for a short time like I was, and wants to make the most of it. Thanks Joe and Ski--it was truly a pleasure!"

Ski is an amazing guide and the reviews on Tripadvisor speaks for her tours (she is the owner, by the way and gets booked out way too fast, so ask for her early as we wished we had her for the whole trip!) and her efforts to make sure my group of 5 is well taken care of in every aspect. In fact, i was quite cynical at first to find a tour that has so many good reviews but now i know why and i agree with all the awesome reviews posted for them wholeheartedlyOnce you do a big foot tour, you won't do other tours or find other tours as awesome!

We started by meeting her in Hong Kong (we were staying in Kowloon), following directions she had emailed us, using the subway system. Perfect instructions. We spent the day walking Hong Kong and then Kowloon at a leisurely pace, stopping frequently for a snack at one of the many shops. Lunch was in a dim sung restaurant. A really local place. My wife and I are in our early 70's and though we were tired after six hours of walking, Ski kept it at a pace that was comfortable. I would highly recommend this tour; we saw many off the beaten path sites. It wa a fabulous day."

Joe gave us a true inside look at local life in Hong Kong. We ate street food and had a traditional dim sum lunch, visited several really interesting areas of the city including some from Joe's own childhood and learned much about the fascinating history of this culture along the way. Joe kept our whole family (ages 12-49) entertained with stories, fun facts and answers to some of our really silly questions. We went back to many of the places Joe showed us and to others he suggested - all were great (though not the same without our new \"friend\"). Joe was so good that we tried to hire him again the following day to visit the New Territories but he was already booked. Make sure you arrange for one of these tours before you arrive - he and Ski are in great demand and we can certainly understand why!"

Joe, because of his own travels, has not only a locals understanding of Hong Kong (having grown up there) but also a travelers view, having spent time abroad in England. As a result, his tour provides a very up close and in-person view of the real Hong Knog, but delivered in a way that is easy to understand for a first time visitor. His explanations -- both verbal and physical - of the city made for a wonderful experience for our family of four (including a teen age girl and pre-teen son). We got to see the way locals really shop in markets, the way the eat (amazing dim sum!!!), and the way they live. Even ex-pat residents were asking us for his information, as we got to see parts of Hong Kong they never exeprience. Five stars from some experienced travelers!!!"

The 4 hours went so quick and we covered various areas in the central and sheung wan districts. Joe conducted the tour very professionally and included food and drinks stops along with offering us tips for the rest of our stay. We would definitely recommend this tour is done at the start of your stay. The whole experience was just so enjoyable and fascinating it is certainly one of the best ways to explore Hong Kong. It certainly gave us the confidence to explore wider areas of Hong Kong. At the end of the tour Joe gave us a map and recapped on what we had done and seen. This information proved to be very useful for the rest of our stay. Thank you Joe, we will remember our time with you on this tour."

I can't say enough great things about both Ski as a guide as well as the tour itself and the company overall - the professionalism of the booking process, customer service, etc. really stood out to me. This is a best-in-class operation and you can tell that a lot of effort and pride goes into the business and the way in which they interact with their customers. I gave Ski some pretty general ideas of what we wanted to see and do and she arranged an entire afternoon itinerary totally customized for us! She also went above and beyond after our tour and followed up by sending us additional links and information about topics we had been interested in for the remainder of our time in HK.Ski showed us sides to the city that we would never have found ourselves so we were able to see HK in a whole new light - and this tour really made our trip. We got to experience the \"real\" HK as the locals do - not just sightseeing. Having Ski's insight the entire way added an entirely new dimension to our experience as visitors to this amazing city!Yes, it won't cost you much to wander around on your own with a guidebook but spending the time with Ski and Big Foot is worth every penny, I promise! Ski is a wealth of knowledge about the history and culture of HK and is also just such a delight to spend an afternoon with. By the end of the day we felt that we had made a friend! Of our whole time in HK this was by far our favorite activity. Hope you enjoy it too!"

He brought us out of the bustling part of the city through food markets, soho & mid level escalators, even a through a park that had a reflexology section, we tried some congee & milk tea which was very nice. We were able to learn a lot about the history of HK, traditions & superstitions. We would not have experienced any of this had we not gone on the tour. The pace of the tour is really good aswell, we walked along at our own pace never felt under pressure or pushed for time. At the end of the tour Joe gave us a map of HK drawing out the route we had taken and marked all the places we had visited on the tour along with some shopping centres & other points of interest which we found really helpful throughout the rest of our trip. We couldn't believe how much we had covered in the 4 hours.Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Big Foot Tour to you all, just book it you won't be disappointed!!Thanks again Joe & Ski, we had a great time & I would certainly book another tour with you guys :)"

If you are thinking about booking then DO IT! The booking was easy and quick. JOE is awesome. He not only told us about the history of Hong Kong and the transitions but also about the food, the architecture, the people, the culture and everything in between. We were only able to spend 4 hours with Joe but totally worth every minute. We covered a lot of the city and saw so many things without Joe you would walk on by. I love the milk tea, the food vendors, the soup shop, the escalator, the fish guy(hearts & bladders) and my favorite of all the little custards! (Warm from the oven and SOOO good, I could have eaten 50). Joe was even kind enough to spend time with us asking what else we were doing in the city so he could help with recommendations. We went to the dim sum restaurant he recommended-Awesome. He also recommended a place to buy Jade -another good find. The map he made for us also helped us go back to some things we wanted to revisit. Also don't be afraid of the MTR from a country girl from Colorado if I can do it anyone can, Joe helped with that too. I can't say enough good things about Joe and Ski for this awesome experience! If I ever return to Hong Kong I will book this tour in a heart beat!"

It was great as many of us agree here on Trip Advisor and so when I was visiting Hong Kong & Macau again for a short holiday with a friend and we decided to go on a Food Tour this time again with Big Foot Tour. This time Joe showed us around Sham Shui Po food markets where we sampled the street delicacies of the REAL Hong Kong. Joe is not only very knowledgeable about Hong Kong and its culture but also very patient to absorb the guests (us) own little questions & stories about culture. The tour progressed totally at our own pace and we never felt tired or rushed during the entire trip(this is very helpful). There were some street food which is considered extremely exotic in the western world which we got to sample and enjoyed it thoroughly. Every stop for a food sample has been researched well and was fit in with the time you start and stop your tour. The tour started in the morning so we started with a classic Cantonese breakfast and moved on until lunch. At no time were we forced /coerced into eating any /all of the (lovely) food. So there was no stress at all. We then moved on to Mong Kok for some street food closer towards lunch time and after the trip was over, we conveniently shopped around the markets in the afternoon. At the end of the trip Joe encouraged us to explore some more areas of interest on our own if we wished. We liked this part also (even though we wished we had continued for the rest of the day with Joe) as we have noticed that Big Foot Tour always encourage guests to find out more about Hong Kong on their own. Thanks to Joe and Ski for arranging this trip. I would highly recommend this tour for first timers and also returning guests who have been to Hong Kong before. Try Big Foot Tour once and you will become their fan. A great memorable tour is guaranteed."

We are in our fifties, and Joe is youthful, but the age gap in no way inhibited our interaction. Joe was polite, helpful, funny, and simply a genuinely nice person. We have employed tour guides in a number of countries, including some highly credentialed ones (university professors, for example), and none have been more knowledgeable, nor enjoyable, than Joe.

We selected Big Foot because of the outstanding reviews on TripAdvisor and because we wanted a tour for just the two of us. I did contact several other firms that offered tours but none of them came close to Big Foot either in cost or in providing what we wanted to do (and not what they thought we should do). The booking process was really simple and straightforward. Ski was very prompt in answering my questions and included all our preferences in the itinerary that she planned for us.The four-hour walking tour that Ski took us on was excellent in all respects! Not strenuous in any way as it was more of a wander through the streets of old Hong Kong. It provided an excellent level of detail and included several things that we would never have done on our own. Make sure you try the iced 50/50 and a piece of French toast with coconut jam - highly recommended!! If Starbuck's sold this drink they would make an even bigger fortune.We have been home now for several days but our enthusiasm for Big Foot Tours, and Ski in particular, has not diminished one iota. I can only reiterate what all the reviews of Big Foot Tours say - excellent, best ever, great, etc, etc. I can honestly say that there was nothing either of us did not enjoy; even the mundane necessities such as clean toilets were planned into the tour.Ski is the founder of Big Foot Tours and her enthusiasm for her job was very refreshing to see. Her profession is an accountant but she hates being in an office so decided to start Big Foot Tours - the very first of its kind in Hong Kong. She is extremely personable and excellent company. Overall we had an outstanding tour that will remain a cherished memory for ever. I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this tour in the strongest possible terms."

I am in no way a history buff, nor do I care about architecture but the way Joe speaks makes everything interesting. We had been in Hong Kong for a couple of days and had walked around the markets and buildings. After being educated by Joe, we now went back to these areas with new eyes. We knew exactly what we were looking at. Joe brought us to medicinal shops and explained everything. He even took us to a medicinal tea spot and I had some tea for a headache. Joe is an expert because he grew up here. He showed us the famous Graham Street Wet Market and explained to us how his grandma would pick out fish, why the hearts are still beating, what to look for when purchasing meat, etc. Joe explained the history and evolution of the streets in a way which was so fascinating. Joe took his time with us and we never felt rushed. In fact our tour went a little over and he was so gracious with his time. Another highlight was the local dim sum joint Joe took us too. The only sad part is when I tried to book again for the following day, they were booked up for the following 3 days! From what I understand, this operation is just Ski and Joe. I am planning on going back to Hong Kong and I will be booking them again. Thank you Ski and Joe!!!! This was honestly the best tour I have ever been on. Looking forward to having another."

Talk about happy accidents - the tour was incredible and helped us see Hong Kong in a new, fuller way for the rest of our visit. Ski taught us not only about the history and food of HK - the tour we thought we were getting - but also about the social elements of the society in a way that helped us gain a better understanding of Hong Kong and the people who live there. (Who knew you can sue someone in HK for ruining their feng shui?) The rest of our trip was so much more satisfying and rewarding - and it was all because of what we learned on Ski's tour. Ski even introduced us to kaya - a coconut spread popular in SE Asia - and then emailed us later to tell us where we could find some to take home! We were in SE Asia for 17 days, and I'm not sure we were happier with anything we did in that time than we were with our Big Foot Tour in HK. A great value and a great experience."

Thanks to our guide Ski we had the chance to experience local food in small businesses and we got some really interesting information about history and present time. We also received very helpful information on going around in the city in the email exchange before our arrival. Thanks very much for this. This tour was a real blast and we decided on the same day to do another tour in Kowloon but unfortunately Ski was not able to make it because of an already busy schedule.. which speaks for itself. We really want to say thank your for the time spent with us and we certainly would do this again."

We took Big Foot Tour on our first day in Hong Kong and was the best introduction we could ever have!Joe was our guide and after a brief talk about our main interests, he took us (me and 2 teenagers) through the most amazing walk around HK!Culture, religion, history, interesting facts about HK and food, Joe covered so many topics that the hours flew and seemed minutes! He showed us the streets markets, we tried fruits, delicious tea, and many of Joe\u2019s picks, while walking and talking through HK streets. We saw the impresive stairs system people uses every day to go to work, how they live and even the reduced spaces every office occupies. We visited a playground were we tryed reflexology, and observed the people just hanging out after work.When at the end we saw the map and realized how many blocks we had walked we were shocked! So many different neighborhoods and every one with their special and unique characteristicsIt was amazing to see HK through Joe\u2019s eyes, it was awakening for us!"

Joe showed us so much more. It started with a review of feng shui in the architecture of the big buildings - then moved through the background behind the Brits and the Chinese - then covered everything from breakfast foods to his childhood playground to the reason big buildings don't exist in one area. As I said, it was awesome! The best thing we did in Hing Kong! Thanks Joe!"

Wanting to experience Hong Kong, my buddy and I arrived on an early morning flight from Jakarta after an extended scuba holiday in Eastern Indonesia. We chose Big Foot Tours based on TripAdvisor reviews and thoroughly delighted with this first-day orientation. As it was just two of us we were able to cover a lot of ground, perhaps 4 km total including walking and use of an iconic double-decker street trolley, through several districts including the financial center, the street market, Soho, Cat Street, past local food markets and more.Our personal guide, Joe, was outstanding. Humorous, knowledgeable, insightful and attentive to our interests. He also directed us to local food providers for sampling traditional dishes and, at the end of out tour, recommended applicable areas for the shopping we wanted to do during our stay including camera, jade and art purveyors.We couldn't have been happier with Joe and our guided tour, pleased that his instructions for our initial meeting place were clear and uncomplicated. I highly recommend this tour service to anyone! Thanks, Joe."

It allowed us to explore Hong Kong in a very in-depth and personal way.  Our guide was Joe. He asks you ahead of time if you\u2019re into historical and cultural information so as not to impose with stuff you\u2019re not into (We were, and he had a wealth of info). He took us to awesome local spots that you wouldn't otherwise be able to look up and read about. Everything seemed to be in perfect moderation. For instance, the tour lasted roughly 4 hours. Visually, it felt like we've been exploring all day but our legs weren't tired at all. Nor did we feel uncomfortably full even though we had a lot to eat, including but limited to: Congi, BBQ meats, fish balls, ball shaped waffles, turtle jelly, iced coffee, poppy dessert (forgot the name), egg tart, five flower tea and more. Each of those was at a different place! Upon request, he even found a spot with snake soup, which wasn't seasonal at the time.Joe was super nice and accommodating. He spent some time with us after the tour and gave us more suggestions for our remaining days and outlined them on a map. Lastly, It was our favorite city from the trip in large part because of this tour. I highly recommend this group and Joe in particular.Some info for comparison - We were 26 and 27 on our honeymoon and we live in a big city in the US (but recommend it for anyone)."

Both guides are terrific and without any hesitation both worthy of top 5-star ratings! (more stars if it was even possible!). But if we have to choose, myself and my wife preferred Ski's style more.Joe has a highly infectious energy and shared a lot on his life growing up in Hong Kong. Cool stuff, we learnt from him and it set out modd upbeat for the rest of the trip!Ski has an ability to preempt what we wanted and the tour went seamlessly well centring all around us. More than just sharing, she engages and we felt naturally comfortable opening up to her. A great listener she is and we bonded very well, ended up feeling like she is our daughter. Extremely humble lady (with amazing accmoplishments in her life that she didn't even mentioned if not for us asking), definitely an interesting charcter to know.This is an absolutely brillant tour from booking to exceptional local knlowledge to wonderful guides.

This is an incredibly slick operation, from the time of booking it became apparent that Ski had recorded all the details of my previous tour and was able to advise what to see next. She recalled from a brief conversation on our first tour the details of my allergies and had briefed Joe on them before he met me! I was amazed and very impressed.Joe is a gifted guide, he has an exceptional knowledge of the history, culture, lifestyle and perspective of the Hong Kong people, and is skilled at sharing this fascinating place with his guests.5 stars.

He knew all the locals and gave us a very good idea of what is like to live and grow up in Hong Kong.

The food tour proved to be just the ticket as Joe took us to many places we'd not been to before and talked with us about Hong Kong past, present and future. Joe is happy to talk about anything Hong Kong (not just food related) and was easy to relate to as he'd been to university in Sheffield. We recommended the tour to friends and family still in Hong Kong and would definitely recommend it for any one else going to Hong Kong."

Having never been to HK before, this looked like a good way to start and it certainly was - Ski met us at our hotel all as planned (in fact a few minutes early) and then took us to the local MTR station - set us up with Octopus cards (we were staying for two weeks, so these are pretty well essential and save carrying too much cash and collecting all that loose change as you normally do). We caught the MTR to Central and commenced the tour proper which included many sights of new and old Hong Kong and an expert commentary along the way. We had a Dim Sum lunch at a \"real\" Chinese style restaurant - forget the white napkins etc., but you need an open mind about this - not the cleanest establishment, but the food was great and the price even better.We saw lots of interesting places and people on the tour and had absolutely no complaints at all. You do need to let Ski know your preferences and she is very clear on this at the time of booking. There is also a lot of walking - so be prepared - no silly shoes and remember your water bottle.As a family of four, this tour represented excellent value and we thoroughly recommend it for anyone visiting HK and wishing to see perhaps a different side of the city.As a footnote - Ski also gave us a number of tips - do's and don'ts in HK which helped too including a referral to a local tailor (Moda Republic - covered under a separate TA review) - all greatly received.Thanks Ski for our perfect introduction to Hong Kong."

We went through the Mid Levels & the Escalator System, Man Ho Temple, the Cat Street Market and more. It was tough, cuz we had been to Hong Kong before. And my husband had been many times in previous years. What we enjoy most while traveling is learning the true culture & customs of the people, a little history, the food of local eateries, the local markets. And that is exactly where Joe took us. He is a smart guy with a wide range of knowledge of HK history, food, culture; speaks the best English - having been born & raised in Hong Kong and educated in Great Britain; and has a passion for food. I could wax praises forever. The true test result is my husband (the guy who doesn't do tours) loved it!"

At each stop (Hong Kong, Dubai, Istanbul, Rome, Dublin and others) we wanted to line up alternative tours of cities. The first of these tours was Big Foot Tour's Hong Kong Private Walking Tour. Ski, the manager (and I think one of the owners) set us up with Joe. He met us at our hotel. He was well educated, polite, engaging, and wanting to mold the tour to our interests. Our interests were political history and tea. He centered the tour on Hong Kong Island and took us from the heart of the financial/political areas to the working class streets, into the multi generational tea shops in about 4 hours. His range of topics were from architecture and city planning, the history of how the British took root on the island, the relationship between mainland China and Hong Kong, the rituals with teas, life of working class families, current wealth discrepancies, and more. He engaged our 14 year old at every turn--not always an easy thing to do. There was no administrative hic-ups--payment was accepted and easy. Joe provided us a map of the places we went so that we could return the next day if we wished--and we did. Big Foot Tours' was the standard by which we judged all other tours during that three week trip which just ended yesterday. We did a similar tour in Istanbul with Circle Istanbul. However, payment was a hassle, there was no map at the end of the tour of the places we had gone. Although the tour guide was knowledgable and helpful, he sometimes seemed to get tired and out of focus. At the end of that tour there was a dinner as part of the fee paid by our family and another couple. Drinks, if any, were to be paid out of pocket by the us. We decided to split a bottle of red wine, asked about the price, discussed the price, and ordered the bottle. After the bottle's contents were consumed, we found that the prices was six times hire than what was discussed. Hopefully this was simply an error by everyone, we did feel that our tour guide should have looked out for our benefit since he was the translator. This would not have happened with Joe at Big Foot Tour. Our family recommends Big Foot Tour. It is a great way to understand Hong Kong. Chace"

I did the usual homework to establish BigFoot is run by just Ski and Joe and is therefore not a large impersonal corporate tour company only interested in collecting tourist dollars. We looked to book this tour too early during 2013, but we had constant communication from Ski advising when a tour for early January would be bookable and she re contacted us via email just as soon as available. She even sent us a picture of herself so we could indentify her in the hotel lobby.The payment process was easy via Paypal. Ski met us promptly at our hotel, she was everything that all other reviews portrayed, friendly, knowledgeable, speaking and understanding very clear and concise English. We learned so many interesting facts about HK, information not possible to pick up on without her.

She was informative, patient, helpful, and very sweet when dealing with our group! She showed us a great mix of can't miss sights as well as local hot spots including a delicious dim sum meal that we will remember forever. I cannot recommend Ski highly enough!"

Joe our guide led us around the hidden streets we otherwise would have missed and took us to some great places to sample things like snake soup, bbq pork, egg tarts and fantastic dim sum, those pork buns were to die for. It was so interesting to be able to learn about the history and culture of the city from someone who is from there and it felt more like walking around the city with a friend rather than a guide. The experience was extra special as It was a private tour and we didn't have to wait for a big group before moving to the next location. We would say that if you are looking for a tour whilst visiting Hong Kong, make sure you book with Big Foot Tours, you really wont be disappointed."

As we have already done that, we wanted to learn more about hong kong in a different perspective and also learn the local culture.My brother searched on TripAdvisor for tours we could take and Big Foot Tour was #1 on search. Our tour guide was Joe. He really did a good job explaining history of Hong Kong to us and the meaning of the buildings, i.e the hsbc headquarter building , the Lippo building and the butcher's knife. It was really amusing as he told us the story and history of the buildings as well as the British council building. Next he brought us to the more traditional side of Hong Kong. The wet market. He showed us how the locals bought fish and meet and how they looked for the fish with the beating heart. We learned so much and it is really different to how we do our meat shopping back home. We then moved on to the western side of Hong Kong. It was a great experience. It really is amazing how ghosts and superstitions can affect the people and business in that one road.He was really professional when telling us the folk stories with his own wit and humour. My daughter said it was really an eye opener for her as she has always thought Hong Kong as a commercial city with tall skyscrapers and bright lights. But now, Hong Kong to her is a beautiful country with beautiful history and culture. 4 hours passed by really quickly. Joe was good enough to give us a map on what we could do the next day. We'd like to thank Joe for guiding us with passion and helping us understand Hong Kong in a better perspective."

We first spotted the Big foot walking tours on trip advisor and they came highly recommended.We were in the city a couple of days prior to going on the walking tour and we got a good feel for Hong Kong and what it had to offer. Prior to meeting up with Joe i felt we had seen a lot but we were both wrong. Joe was a fantastic guide he was very friendly and full of knowledge. We were interested in the history of Hong Kong and we were also interested in hot spots for food and a general look around. From start to finish the tour was amazing from the history of Hong Kong and how it was developed. To eating stinky tofu, bbq pork which was amazing and eating far too many egg tarts and being introduced to snake soup which was very tasty thought it would be a shame not to try it!Joe was very helpful in marking a route plan of where we had been and what we had seen on the tour which made it easier to explore further the next day. Also Joe gave us a business card and said whilst we were in HK if we had any questions do not hesitate to call him which i though was very genuine and professional.I couldn't recommend the tour enough if any of my family or friends were planning on going to Hong Kong in the future i wouldn't hesitate to promote the tour highly.10 out of 10!!"

I can go on and on and on! What a great experience that totally changed my perception of having a \"tour\"! all tours should be done this way! if you are looking for a great time and orientation to see the real Hong Kong and feel like you are hanging out with a friend, go for Ski's Big Foot Tour! Once you experience it yourself, you will know what they mean. I left my itinerary entirely in their hands after telling them my general interests and I was blown away by what was planned. I also like how there was no compulsory \"shopping\" stops that i often experience in other tours. Thanks Ski! It's amazing to be led by the founder of Big Foot and I will always highly recommend you to anyone!"

We had both been to HK twice before and once for a week, so we had done all of the classic tourist attractions and wanted something different. Reading reviews on TripAdvisor led me to Big Foot Tours. I contacted them with my request. It worked out perfectly. Joe met us at our hotel and took us by subway to the Sham Shui Po district where we spent most of our time. It is described as where the local people eat, live and shop. We learned so much from Joe. As others have said, he is knowledgeable, easy to understand and such an enthusiastic person, you can't help but be caught up in his feelings for his City. We toured a factory converted to an art center, a public housing project, the Pak Tai temple, various shopping streets dedicated to particular items, like fabric and ribbons. A highlight was the Pei Ho wet market where we had lunch in the communal food hall. Throughout, Joe gave us cultural, historical and social information that we would never have gotten walking along on our own. He also left us with information about what to do for the rest of our day before returning to the hotel to collapse. It was money well spent and I don't hesitate to recommend Joe to anyone. We are both women in our 60's and he was very careful to walk at our pace and keep track of us crossing the streets! And to address our interests and questions. Information that he provided also informed our trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, so it was doubly helpful.Next time, I want to take one of his food tours!"

Not only did it help us appreciate the city as we enjoyed the rest of our visit, it was a welcome respite from all the shiny shopping centres, restaurants and retail bling. My husband and I booked from Australia and were taken around by Joe on the afternoon of our first day. I would really recommend doing the tour earlier in your visit as it gives you great background about the city if you are not already familiar with it. Memorable aspects include Joe's explanation of HK history and colonial era, the feng shui of the HSBC centre and the bullet holes in the bronze lion status out the front from the time of the Japanese occupationn. We visited the back streets of Central and Joe explained the wet markets and trading stalls. We also spent time in Man Mo Temple and Joe was also able to explain the significance of the deities, incense coils and fortune sticks. All this would have been a mystery to us without his explanations. A perfect finish was a meal of roast goose, char siu and rice; and a silky custard tart. Joe then recommended we finish our trip on a Ding Ding tram back to our hotel and told us how to get on/pay/get off. Joe also left us with a map of other sights to see in our remaining time which we carried with us and referred to for the rest of the week. I would highly recommend the tour - it may seem a little pricey for just two people but we certainly thought it worthwhile!!!"

My fiance and I only had a short amount of time in Hong Kong between job interviews in the area, and we are so happy we spent that time with Joe of Big Foot Tours, getting to know more about Hong Kong -- albeit a small portion, given that the city is relatively massive -- than we would have otherwise. I've spent a lot of time \"getting to know\" cities on my own, wandering aimlessly and discovering a lot of questions that are difficult to answer without a local's knowledge. While that's also a fun way to explore, I may now be a convert to the private walking tour. I feel like I have a glimpse into the soul of the city now, and some insights into its many dichotomies (British/Chinese, historical/modern, superstitious/scientific, etc., etc.) that, again, only a local could provide. Dealing with Ski to book the tour was pleasant and easy, and Joe himself was exceedingly professional but also lots of fun. I did a lot of shopping around, and Big Foot definitely offers the best prices. After taking the tour, I have a hard time believing they don't also offer the best experience -- a rare combination."

We are in our late 60s and mid-70s, in pretty good physical shape, so we enjoyed the pace of the walking tour though Hong Kong's busy streets, from the Statue Square area through the mid-level escalators and the old part of Hong Kong. Joe's perspectives were wonderful, especially his way of relating the architecture and culture with Feng Shui and superstition combining with the most modern and technologically superb buildings.

She scheduled Joe for our tour. Due to business dealings, we were late, informed Ski and she told us not to worry that Joe will work with us and he did. Once we met Joe, he asked us which tour we would be interested and thus we completely changed what we were originally going to do because Joe's recommendation was much more interesting. We had an amazing time - he is smart, patient, extremely knowledgeable and certainly professional. He told us about and showed us places that we would have never learned on our own. It was fascinating and well worth spending the afternoon with him. Regardless if you have never been to Hong Kong, been once or many times, taking a Big Foot Tour is an excellent way to spend 4 hours."

Joe, young and enthusiastic provided this in spades. He kept the whole family engaged and interested with stories of life in Hong Kong past and present. As we wound our way through the streets of Central on Hong Kong Island we listened to tales of dragons, made impromptu visits to small temples and learn't how to choose the freshest fish on the fishmongers stall. Lunch was a shared table with construction workers in one of the wet markets where we enjoyed one of our tastiest meals in Hong Kong. My husband rates our four hours with Joe as the highlight of our holiday. Joe left us well equiped with information and maps to continue our exploration of this facinating city."

Joe was an absolutely fantastic guide - he is so knowledgeable and passionate about his city and its history that its was positively infectious! None of us (me, husband, 20 yo daughter) had ever been to Hong Kong before. For some reason, I thought we would just wander about and get a feel for the city on our own and so had not booked any tours in advance. We actually found that Hong Kong is not the easiest place to get to know in that way - perhaps because its so vertical? I finally contacted Big Foot based on good Trip Advisor reviews and fortunately they were able to accommodate us. We saw a LOT of the city on the tour, including areas we probably would not have come across on our own. We also had a lot of yummy street food and an interesting visit to a Chinese medicine shop. I just wish we had done it earlier in the trip so that we could have taken more advantage of what we learned and the other activities Joe recommended. This tour really exceeded our expectations and I highly recommend it!"

Popped across from Kowloon to HK Island and toured from Central to the west - picking out more of the Chinese part of Hong Kong. Hugely interesting as Ski always had either a great historic story or interesting fact along the way. We saw some great sights from old china town to parks, a man doing Tai Chi in a children's playground, longest escalator in the world, interesting food items, markets etc etc.The tour flew by as Ski always kept it interesting - also gave us some excellent tips for the rest of our stay.Couldn't recommend this tour highly enough - for newbies or for those that want to venture a little more off the beaten track.Thanks Ski - we had great HK mini adventure :-)"

It was a perfect way to start our explorations of Hong Kong. We met Joe at the suggested meeting place and the tour started pretty much from that moment. It was obvious, from the first few minutes, that he was going to be a great guide - very friendly, knowledgable, passionate, articulate and funny. The walking tour was pretty fast paced (which we loved), we saw a great deal of the city, tried some delicious (and some not so delicious) authentic/exotic foods and enjoyed every minute of it. Joe gave us a great summary of Hong Kong's history and culture, as well as leaving us with heaps of suggestions on what else to see and do whilst there. I would recommend this tour to anyone going to Hong Kong, even if they have visited before. We learnt things that we would never have if we had not gone on the tour. Thanks Joe! :-)"

We made our arrangements 2-3 weeks (to my best memory) before we arrived and had no problem getting the dates and times we wanted. Everything from making our reservations, making payments, and figuring out where to meet was done online by email. All my emails were answered within 24 hours by Ski who answered most questions we had even ones not relating to the tour. We did two 4 hour day tours on the first 2 days of the 5 days we were in Hong Kong. We did Hong Kong Island tour and New Territories tour. On the day of the first tour, we used public transportation to our meeting point which was super simple due to the instructions and maps provided to us online by Ski; they were also willing to meet us at our hotel but advised us it may take up valuable touring time so we opted to meet where they asked us to. We promptly spotted Joe and knew what he looked like before hand since they also emailed a photo of who was guiding us. We were on our way after quick introductions and confirmations on what our interest were. To sum up everything, Joe was an awesome, energetic, and personable guide and we could not ask for more. We are from the States and had very little knowledge of Hong Kong,their relationship with Mainland China, and other various important aspects such a feng shui so we learned so much in the two tours. We also got to sample the local cuisine which was delicious. The private tours are definitely worth money spent and our guide definitely deserved a good gratuity even though he absolutely does not expect one."

We had a tour with Joe on the first full day of our holiday and I definitely think that this is the way to do it.

Joe took us for a meal in s fantastic roast meat caf\u00e9 which we would never have dared to go in by ourselves - a very local place with no frills - but the best meat ever!He also took us and showed us the \"cut label\" shops where you can buy designer clothing for a fraction of the price - I'm not sure I should thank him for this though as we went back the next day and it cost us a fortune :) !!!At the end of the tour he spent some time with us just recommending other things that we would like to see - this was really useful.From our point of view it was the perfect way to start our trip and he gave us confidence to try some other things for ourselves.Joe is young and lively and has bags of energy - I would recommend him as a guide to anyone travelling with teenagers or younger children - our girls loved him."

I always try and book a personal tour when visiting a new place and have done quite a few in the past - this was the best by far.We booked the private food walking tour which lasted 4 hours and was the perfect introduction to Hong Kong's culture.Joe made the whole thing exciting and interesting, taking us to places that we never would have seen without the big foot tour and explaining things that only a local person would know. Being a fluent English-speaker but growing up in Hong Kong meant he really could answer any question. We didn't want to spend our limited time in Hong Kong walking around museums and this was a great way to find out about the city. The highlight for us was the food - we were able to try all of the local delicacies; things we never would have been able to order by ourselves. I have a severe shellfish allergy which makes ordering unknown dishes a little dangerous, so having someone to explain and translate was perfect.The tour took us across all sorts of different areas and districts so by the end of it we felt we'd had a great overview of the \"real\" Hong Kong, not just the places easily accessed by tourists.At the end of the tour Joe illustrated maps showing everything we had done during the tour (I couldn't believe how much he fit into 4 hours) and giving great recommendations for the rest of our stay. The whole thing was first class and great value. I'd recommend booking a tour for the start of your trip as the recommendations for the rest of the stay are just as valuable as the tour itself."

My guide was Joe and he was great. I had an afternoon tour which was tailored around my interests, all of which was pre planned with Big Foot. Joe was very enthusiastic about his country and knowledgeable. It was nice to see a young person with such knowledge. We really maxed out the time, covering a wide area but never once did I feel hurried. Joe also found the time at the end of the tour to draw out another itinerary for me to follow on my own, during my short stay in Hong Kong and it was spot on. They were also available via e-mail to ask questions, whilst in Hong Kong. All in all it was well worth the money. I did the tour on my first day in Hong Kong and it really set me up for tackling all the places I wanted to see, some of which were off the beaten track! If you are looking for a tour guide with genuinely nice people, relaxed, personal and suited to you, I highly recommend Big Foot."

Even though we were not very good at history he made it interesting and memorable (if only school history was that interesting). Great insight into everyday life, dine with the locals,discover the back streets & markets. Worth every cent. I suggest you dont do too much walking the day before & save your energy for the walking tour. Made it easier for us to get a feel for the layout of HK & get around on our own. Joe answered all our questions and gave us extra info on what to do and see during the rest of our stay."

My wife and I frequently hire tour guides when we travel, and Joe was one of the best we've ever had. Let me highlight 3 things in particular that we appreciated: (1) Fluent English: Joe is a native English speaker, which made it very easy to go beyond tourist English. It sounds simple but it's hard to talk about nuanced topics (culture, politics, etc.) without that. (2) He adds his own perspective. There were things we asked specifically to do, but honestly the highlights of the tour were the elements that Joe suggested (for instance, the wet market). Great tour guides show you things you didn't even know you wanted to see. (3) We left feeling smarter. Rather than just show us a series of statues and museums and landmarks, Joe helped us understand what it was like to live and work in Hong Kong. As one simple example among many: We wanted to see the Bird Market. It's a neat place and one that you could easily explore and admire on your own. But without Joe, we wouldn't have benefited from the extra color he shared, for instance, the unspoken competition among elderly men who take birds as pets, nurturing and training them ... taking them on walks and letting their cages sway as they walk in hopes of 'exercising' the birds (by building their strength and balance), and bringing them to the market to place their cages next to other birds who sing beautifully in hopes that their tunes will be contagious, etc., etc. You'd never get that kind of context without a guide like Joe."

However, due to the mountainous terrain of hong kong, i elected to seek a walking tour for my introduction. Trip advisor once again came through. A very easy, and accommodating reservation process introduced me to the Big Foot Tour. This was a wonderful way to discover the intricate areas of hong kong. Joe was a great historian, and very well versed in the geography of hong kong. My family especially enjoyed visiting all of the various neighborhoods, and engaging in the local cultured. the taste testing of various cuisines was awesome, and our visit to remote areas in the northern territories was excellent. We saw many sights that would have been missed if it wasnt for JOE and the big foot tour. Cant wait to return and sample other excursions..........just avoid united airlines for any trip to the far east. Our flights were horrific........."

If you are new to Hong Kong as we were, there's no better way to explore the city to get your bearings, especially since you can chat to the team beforehand and let them know your interests. Using a walking tour guide helps you to understand what you're seeing, if that makes sense, since you're constantly informed about the culture and history. Fascinating stuff, that we've continually referenced since when speaking to our friends about our trip. I would advise early bookings with the team as they seem to be fully booked about 2-3 days ahead, and a trip with them is the best way to START a visit to HK, as they can give you hints and tips to employ on the rest of your stay."

Our visit through Hong Kong was over 5 days and the best day by far was our tour with Bigfoot. We met Joe at Central and walked, talked, and ate for the next few hours. Joe was great with his culinary knowledge of both the main streets and back streets of Hong Kong. What we did not expect was to get a wonderful historical and cultural tour within the food tour. Joe knows his city, but more importantly he loves his city and you'll end up loving it as well. We felt after a few short hours of walking and eating that we finally \"got\" Hong Kong. The next couple days we walked around as locals, in our eyes at least, fully enjoying all the city had to offer with no timidness or hesitation. Might I add that my wife was pregnant at the time, so this was no small event to make us feel so comfortable in HK. Whether you are into Dim Sum, noodles, tea, diner fare, or even the unusual Bigfoot is absolutely worth it. They will tailor your tour for you and you will leave the hours with months of knowledge you can only get walking the locals path. Highly highly recommended."

He tailored it to the areas we were interested in (Central, Soho, Mid-levels etc) and had so much information to share about all the places we visited. The tour was with me, my sister and our Mum and Joe made sure we were all happy and comfortable right throughout the tour. He is very personable and friendly and by the end of the tour he felt like a close friend instead of our tour guide! I definitely recommend the private tour, because Joe can tailor this to the things you're interested in and you can hear more from him directly.We had a fantastic time on this tour and were exposed to lots of interesting shops, parks, buildings and information we would never have found or known without Joe.We picked a couple of spots to revisit by ourselves and found it easy to navigate back there thanks to Joe's directions. At the end of the tour he provided us with a map and pulled out key spots and restaurants for us to go to.Brilliant tour, if I go back to Hong Kong I'll be booking another Big Foot Tour to show me around a different section of the city.Thanks to both Joe & Ski."

We had asked for our tour to center on history, everyday life and culture with a stop for dim sum. The insights into the culture were fascinating and explained so much. We were so glad that we did this first thing upon our arrival. Having had the walking tour, we felt very comfortable exploring on our own throughout the rest of our stay. Because I have a very bad knee, I was concerned about so much walking. However, Joe was attentive to this and I was able to last the entire 4 hours!!! And we covered quite a lot of ground! My husband was surprised (as I!). Additionally, Joe was very flexible, offering us options throughout the tour in case we were more interested in something than another. If you have any doubts, dismiss them now. Ironically, when we reviewed the 'list' of things that we wanted to see/do in HK on our third day, we had done most of them on day 1 through our tour! Lastly, Joe speaks perfect English, is quite engaging, and we never felt as if he was bored (having done this for some time.)

We never could have seen as much as we did, nor learned as much about the culture and history of Hong Kong on our own. On the day that we had our tour the ferry to Hong Kong island was free. She didn't know why but was kind enough to research it and email us with the reason when we arrived home. We were taken to a non-tourist restaurant for a dumpling lunch and she negotiated the acquisition of the kind of dumplings we wanted. We saw both the streets with the high priced stores as well as the narrow back streets with the older authentic shops. She also took us up the long escalator to the level required for us to see the synagogue which is well disguised so we would never been able to find it on our own.

However because of Big Foots excellent rating on trip advisor i took the plunge only to experience some difficulty in finding a time when we were free and Big Foot had capacity. In consequence in was quite late in our stay that we took this tour, it would have been even better had we been able to arrange it early in our stay. Therefore my first piece of advice is book early. Joe was our tour guide. In theory this was a food tour. We walked around the Central area of Hong Kong Island for over 4 hours grazing in little restaurants and cafes that frankly i wouldn't have had the guts or the language skills to visit without Joe. There were 4 in our party, this is the maximum number Big Foot accept and given the teeming nature of the streets we covered I consider the limit sensible. Joe is half English, half Hong Kong Chinese, his understanding of both cultures and his enthusiasm gave an insight on day to day life in Hong Kong that I found fascinating. We ate and or drank at 7 different establishments and turned down an opportunity at an eighth. The food was varied and in some cases excellent but above all else it was interesting. However the tour covered much more than just food. We discussed amongst other subjects architecture, Feng shui, politics, Taoism, Buddhism, how to buy a chicken, ghost towns, ghost goods, property prices, the suburbs of Sheffield, cursing your enemies, Chinese medicine, Michelin star restaurants and the difference between Far Eastern and European standards and a whole lot more. This was a fabulous tour because of the intelligence and enthusiasm of Joe. If food isn't your thing i am certain that a tour will be tailored to cover what you are interested in. Joe had previously done a tour covering sites used as film sets in Hong Kong. In summary this tour is worth every penny but a word of warning, walking outdoors for 4 hours 90%+ humidity is not for the faint hearted. You will need a shower when you finish."

After meeting Ski, she explained the MTR and transport systems, helped us purchase our Octopus cards before we took the MTR to Central. We began with some historic buildings followed by some Feng Shui features of some modern structures.Then we spent a fascinating time walking through narrow back streets with a variety of Chinese shops, markets, local eating places and other items of interest. We tasted egg tarts from Chris Pattens favourite shop and as we walked Ski told us a lot about the way of life for the people of Hong Kong . At the end of our tour Ski highlighted some interesting places for us to visit on Kowloon and as we were keen to visit the Peak, Ski gave us tips on the local bus route which saved much queuing for the tram and provided some spectacular views. Later we came down on the Tram.Ski was a wonderful, friendly, happy young lady who was very knowledgeable, easy to get on with and clearly passionate about her work. Ski is someone whom we will always remember and we wish her good fortune with her excellent Big Foot Tours.Thank you so much Ski"

Perfect way to get to see the \"real\" Hong Kong - completely tailored to your interests, speed and time of day. Joe is keen to share his knowledge with you. It's just like having a really good friend show you around his home town. Next time I am in Hong Kong I will definitely use his services again. Attentive, knowledgeable and interesting. Thank you."

If, like our group, the answers to exotic questions like this one would add a lot to your tour of Hong Kong then Ski is the person to go with. Everything you could ask for plus one of the the more interesting food experiences we had during our Asia tour. Extensive knowledge of the city, attentiveness to our needs, incredibly interesting experiences in both 'local' and 'tourist' Hong Kong - well, you've read it all in other reviews so I'll keep this one short. Our experience mirrors the others so just go and do it. Great value."

My wife and I, and our two friends travellig with us, had the most wonderful experience from the moment Ski met us at our hotel to the time she left us seated at a restaurant after four hours of walking and learning. Ski could not have been more attentive to our needs. With her extensive knowledge of Hong Kong, its history and culture, plus her wonderful personality and sense of humour she provided us with a great understanding of the city we had come to see and experience. Ski made sure that all four members of the party were accommodated from our physical capability to the range of individual interests. The tour was not expensive and was certainly value for money. We only wished that we had more time in Hong Kong to take advantage of the other tours that Bigfoot offers. I can't speak too highly of Ski and the Bigfoot tour. What an absolute delight Ski was."

We booked Joe for a 4 hour Hong Kong Island Tour on one day and a 4 hour New Territories tour the following day. Both tours were outstanding. Joe is passionate about Hong Kong and the New Territories, well versed in the history and culture, and knows just where to go to meet client interests. An extra benefit for us was gaining familiarity with the Hong Kong subway system. We were able to go other sites on our own with full confidence. We highly recommend Big Foot Tour. On our month-long Asian trip we met 11 different tour guides. Most of them were quite good, but Joe stood out as the very best. Thank you again, Joe! Hi from Margaret and Jay"

With limited time in Hong Kong, and with a small group of experienced travelers with different interests, we were struggling to find something to do together (and I having lived there before as well). Thanks to Ski and her outstanding knowledge and organization, this walking tour Hong Kong made everyone extremely happy. We covered so many different areas in such a short time, from a local breakfast in a back restaurant that you would never find on your own, to one of the few remaining cart-served Dim-Sum where we were the only Westerners in the place, this was a tour we will remember for a very long timer. Ski's knowledge was broad as it was deep - from architecture and it's relation to Feng Shui (we had a couple of architects in the group who loved her descriptions of some of the major buildings in Hong Kong), to the food (we ALL loved the food), to the art galleries, to the traditional Chinese medicine stores, to the tour of the Central Escalator, to lunch - seen and done all within 4 hours! Highly recommend this this to both new and returning visitors to Hong Kong!"

He met up with us at our designated meeting point on time and promptly guided us through places that we would not have found on our own. Along the way, he gave us enthusiastic and informative explanation, allowing us to have a taste of what life is really like in Hong Kong. Joe is very accommodating - he tailored the trip according to our interests, making sure we experience everything we wanted to. His passion for his country's history, culture, feng shui and architecture is very infectious. We learned a lot from him in those few hours. He also provided us with plenty of tips on what restaurants to try, places not to be missed and how to get there. So, try to plan for this tour on the first day of your trip as it's a great way of getting yourself familiar with the city. We couldn't say enough good things about Joe and Big Foot Tour. He went above and beyond, spending extra time with us and making sure we are headed the right way for our next destination. Highly recommended and wouldn't hesitate to go on another tour with Joe!

Aside from all of the wonderful things that have been mentioned here, our tour was the beginning of our understanding of the relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China. We loved walking around, seeing the old and the new Hong Kong, but more than all of that, we loved our experience with Ski and our discussion about the politics, driving etc. I would recommend her tour to anyone and she is sensitive to the needs of the travelers. My husband was using a cane and she was able to adapt the route to accommodate him. We wish her the best in her business and hope that she can find others who share her enthusiasm and energy.

Joe is young, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, personable and honest. He also has exceptional English skills, which cannot be overrated, especially once you've experienced other guides in Asia. Joe met us promptly at our arranged meeting place and then walked us through old Hong Kong in areas where he grew up. He showed us places that we would not likely have seen any other way and experienced what everyday life is really like. He has a full appreciation and knowledge of the history of Hong Kong and a keen interest in the future of this territory when it reverts to Chinese rule. Our initial contact with Big Foot was with Ski Yeo and she is particularly well organized and set us up with Joe, determined a logical meeting place and even sent us a picture of Joe so we could recognize him at the meeting place. We cannot possibly over rate this tour and these two exceptional people.Daune and DennisEdmonton, Alberta , Canada"

He took us to places that we would never have seen and he was a friendly young man who has traveled, is educated and we felt like old friends by the end of the day as we were enjoying a beer and he was giving us a map of things that we had seen and of things not to miss. He had great knowledge of city history, architect styles and he gave us great tips on restaurants, city life, etc. This is a great way to get familiar with the city on your first day.

It was my first trip to Hong Kong, and I really wanted to get acquainted with the city and hear about it's history, culture, food and insights that I wouldn't necessarily be able to find out about on my own. I had come across Big Foot Tours on the web, and the reviews were fantastic, so I decided to book a 4 hour private tour. Joe met me on time and with a big, welcoming smile at out pre-determined meeting spot. Joe guided me through the winding city streets in a knowledgeable and insightful way. I saw and learned more in the 4 hours with Joe then I could have on my own over the entire trip. Most importantly, Joe took me to sights and restaurants that I could have never found on my own (i.e. the wet market). He really gave me a taste of HK beyond what the average tourist experiences.

We booked a private walking tour for the 2nd day of a 2 week spring break holiday in Hong Kong - the two of us plus our daughter (15) and son (12). The meet up with Joe in Central went just as planned - and, almost immediately, torrential rain started and remained, to greater and lesser degree, through the walk. The makings of a poor experience? No, it was really great. Both kids absolutely loved the tour (as did we) and were perfectly happy to keep going through the rain just to hear what Joe had to say about this complex and interesting city. Joe's enthusiasm is infectious and he kept us informed and entertained at the same time - providing information of interest to each of us and all of us in equal measure. Joe related his experiences as a boy growing up in Hong Kong and shared his knowledge of its history as well as day to day living as now experienced by people here. In the days that followed, we often thought back to things he told us. I highly recommend this tour to anyone."

She emailed a map and good explanation of how to get from our hotel at Kowloon to our meeting point outside Central Station. We have already recommended Big Foot Walking Tour to several people. As we were doing the walk Ski noticed I was taking photos of mailboxes (as this is what Noel manufacturers back in Australia). Next thing we knew, Ski took us to a shop that sold \"mailbox memorabilia!\" I mentioned I was looking for some Jasmine tea to take home for my daugher, next thing we were in a tea shop! Ski asked if we were getting hungary......next thing, we're in restaurant for a yum cha luncheon......in a restaurant that we wouldn't have known existed....it was a fabulous experience mixing with the locals and eating authentic Chinese food.

This was our second time in Hong Kong and on our first visit, we were astounded by the culinary landscape of this great city, where you can have wonderful food fitting every budget, every taste and every culture. So for our second visit, we really wanted to explore Hong Kong from a culinary point of view and with the help of someone local. Which is where Big Foot Tour comes in - we contacted Ski and she helped us arrange a culinary inspired tour of the city, guided by Joe.This wasn't our first food tour - we've done them in other cities, and I'm convinced it's one of the best ways to get to know a place and the people who live there, for real, and to the core. After all, there only are a few daily activities each culture, each time period, each person, needs to do every day: eat, sleep and go to the bathroom. Of those three, the second and last would be difficult to translate into a guided tour format. Difficult but interesting....Anyway - we met Joe on the second day of our trip to Hong Kong; he met us at our hotel lobby at The Icon hotel, making things very easy for us and whisked us away to HK Island, on a culinary adventure.We visited a small restaurant frequented only by locals to have a tasty breakfast congee with hundred year old egg and fried bread, a hole-in-the-wall place selling milky tea, an old-fashioned sugar cane processor where we drank pure sugar cane juice, a small mystery shop with wooden cages full of snakes where we had snake soup (it DID taste like chicken!), a traditional dim sum restaurant where you (or in our case, Joe) had to chase the dinner ladies with their carts and fight off fellow diners for the last basket of a particularly yummy type of dim sum and a bakery for egg tart.As we are not big eaters, we visited but did not eat anything, at some other places Joe brought us to, like a wet market and a pair of rivaling noodle shops.Most of all, Joe shared wonderful stories about his city and his life in Hong Kong, taught us about its history, its problems and its opportunities, its people. We had a wonderful time, and would recommend Joe and Big Foot Tours (here's a thought - why not found a subsidiary called Big Food Tours ;-).Only issue is that we didn't have time during the tour to stop for lunch ...Kidding! I most strongly recommend Big Foot Tours, both Joe and Ski, for anyone wanting to get to know Hong Kong intimately and through the eyes of the people who live there."

What a great intro to Hong Kong! She picked us up at our hotel in the Pacific Center, took us on a comfortable walk toward the Central area, mid-levels and SOHO, and back to Atlantic. She expertly explained history and architecture in excellent English. For lunch she took us to one of the few remaining authentic dim sum restaurants in Chinatown where we enjoyed a fun lunch, local style. She fully explained the superb public transport system and showed us how to get an Octopus card for our remaining 5 days. Ski knows HK, has a sweet and engaging personality, and really seems to enjoy being with her customers. Outstanding young lady!!"

We had such a great time in 4 hrs exploring the central district, eating nice local food, egg tart, milk tea and even tram ride. Advise you guys to book earlier and plan this tour at the beginning of your holiday. I'll do that with Big Foot again when I return to HK. I'm sure Ski and her guys will do well."

He is very knowledgable about the city in which he grew up and loves to share his knowledge with others. The night before our tour he was informed that I wanted to purchase an American mahjong set. He had no idea what this was, but did his research that evening and the next day was able to take us to a little shop where I was able to purchase a lovely set of tiles for a great price. He truly customizes the tour just for you. We enjoyed being taken off the beaten path and into the neighborhoods where he grew up. Having a guide for just the two of us, was wonderful. I wish we were able to do the tour with Joe on our first day in Hong Kong, not our last. They were booked for the time we initially wanted. We would have returned to some of places we visited or maybe even done another tour. The tour was definitely the highlight of our trip/cruise to Asia. Thank you, Joe!"

Her knowledge of the Chinese culture and Hong Kong in general is fantastic. Ski took us through the main business area, then to where the real people work and live in the back streets, where we got a real insight of how the locals live and work. We visited temples, markets etc and found the tour excellent on our first day in Hong Kong. Ski also suggested other locations that we visit on our stay here which was great.

And we topped off the evening with my first ever ride on the tram ;-)While initially intended as a 'food tour', he accomodated us and took us down trips on memory lane, as well as eye opening cutural insights and of course, to local eats!It is worth noting Joe is not exactly fluent in Cantonese, so you may sometimes lack the leverage, but yet I sensed his acute familiarity with the locals which made him no less effective as a guide.I strongly recommend Joe to both first timers and regulars to HK!

Traveled with a friend who had never been to Hong Kong. I actually contacted another food tour first but after 3 weeks they never responded. When I contacted Big Foot Tour Ski responded the next day. We settled on a date and time and that was it. Note the other tour contacted me after 5 weeks and I told them \"they must be having a laugh\". Ski asked a few questions prior to the tour about the group that was coming, how adventures we were, had we ever been to Hong Kong and so on. I was impressed by this as the other 10 or so tours I have been on in Asia have never asked these questions. Ski arrived at the lobby of the hotel early, we arrived with hangovers from the night before! It was easy to see after 5 min that Ski was going to be someone who was easy to get along with as she took our hangovers with a good sense of humour and was quickly suggesting a filling breakfast and some Hong Kong cures :) It must have been a tuff gig to do a tour with someone who had been to Hong Kong many times and another who had never been but Ski balanced it out to perfection. She showed my friend the 101 of Hong Kong and still managed to teach me a few things along the way. I don't give glowing reviews very often but would definitely recommend this tour. It's in my top 2 food tours I have done in Asia so far and I do them every where I go in Asia. Without embarrassing her Ski is actually a Uni graduate who gave away a successful carrer to follow a passion, hence the big foot tour. She spent 2 years traveling Hong Kong to create the tour and it will show. She speaks good English and is very easy to talk to. Make sure you ask her how she got the nickname Ski !!! When the tour was over Ski refused to take any tip. That was kind of in embarrassing in the middle of central lol. My next stop was Singapore and Ski went home and wrote a practical food, drinking and entertainment guide to Singapore in a email for me. Ski went above and beyond on the tour and I will definitely be back."

We were not disappointed. I hesitated on securing a booking until a couple days prior and almost missed out. To preface this review, my husband and I are from Los Angeles, early 30's, active and like to see things off the beaten path. Major sites are nice but we can get to them ourselves. We don't enjoy museums, endless historical facts and tourist traps. Ski Y. was our tour guide. She arrived promptly at our hotel and off we went. First off, Ski Y. is originally from Singapore and moved to Hong Kong a couple years ago. In her exploration of Hong Kong and it's many different neighborhoods, she's accumulated a lot of knowledge and insight someone whose lived there their whole lives may not. She is young, energetic, very personable and walks fast just like me. She asked what we were interested in and quickly drew up an itinerary that could be changed to our liking. We started off in Central where she showed us different buildings and local sites. We never lingered too long and she always offered to take pictures of us. We visited the moving escalators, umbrella man and a local dim sum restaurant where we almost saw a fight! Pretty entertaining. We also saw street markets and off the beaten path sites. I won't name all of them but they were each interested in their own way. Conversation between all of us was very natural and enjoyable. We covered so much ground that we had a whole hour left so she was kind enough to show us Sham Sui Po. This is where you want to go shopping! Prices are lower and less tourists. Ski also made restaurant recommendations of which we used the day after. Thanks! My husband doesn't enjoy walking as much as I do but he didn't mind this day because he was having such a good time.I can't say anything negative about our experience. In fact, throughout our three week honeymoon in Asia (Shanghai, Vietnam, Phuket, and Bangkok) it became even more evident what a great guide she is. I hired someone in each city we went to and it was NOT the same, not even close. Don't hesistate to book this tour- you won't be disappointed."

As others have mentioned, it felt like we were being taken around by a family friend. Great mix of history, culture, architecture and food. Joe's intimate knowledge of HK along with an understanding of the Western way of life made him able to present the information in a really relevant and accessible way. In addition, we had 3 school aged kids with us and he was able to engage with all of them. We stopped off for snacks and lunch and were given a great introduction into the Hong Kong culture of food and eating. A real highlight and thoroughly recommended."

I had already been to Hong Kong several times but it was the first time for my husband. Since my last trip was already 5 years ago, I wanted to organize something special for my husband.Ski was extremely pleasant during the booking process and made it incredibly simple. I felt already in good hands from the very start and after first e-mail correspondence. She even sent a picture of Joe so that we would not miss him since we met in Central! how great is that!And Joe is an astonishing accumulation of knowledge and such a nice guy! he managed to give us all this interesting informations about Hong Kong packed into such wonderful stories that are so easy to remember now for us. and we never really felt like having booked a \"guide\". it felt more like a friend was walking Hong Kong with us. since we didn't have a clue what we actually wanted to see he lead the way and we walked Central and Sheung wan. a shame the 4hours were over so quickly. Joe gave us many more tips for the rest of our stay but we did not manage to do them. thank you so much Joe for making this trip such a wonderful and personal experience! and should we came back soon we will definetely look up you other tips with you!"

We learned so much about the neighborhood that our hotel was in that we would never have known just walking around on our own. It was the right mix of food, culture, history. Wish I would've booked a second day of tours to check out another neighborhood in the same way. Really can't say much more other than I was thoroughly pleased! Thanks again, Joe!"

My fianc\u00e9 and I had a tour with Ski just after Christmas, being a bit daunted about how best to experience Hong Kong in our 36 hour stopover on the way back from Australia. It turned out to be the best thing we did on the whole holiday! Ski contacted us after booking to find out our interests, and didn't bat an eyelid at a last-minute request to sample some of Hong Kong's more unusual dishes. Ski met us at our hotel and took us to lots of interesting places - tucked away caf\u00e9s, temples, HQs of global banks and many more - and told us fascinating facts and stories as we went along. I really couldn't recommend the experience enough as a way to experience Hong Kong. We went to lots of places that we would never have found on our own, and learnt a lot along the way. Ski really knows her stuff and will make sure you have a great time, by tailoring the tour to what you're most interested in seeing. If we ever go back (which I hope we will), we'll be signing up again!"

I had read reviews of the Big foot Walking Tours and thought it sounded more like what i wanted for a first time visitor. I felt reassured by the Pay Pal invoicing. i elected to book 4 hours with Ski and Joe... it was amazing. Ski responded promptly to emails. invoiced promptly and sent the receipt immediately. I was in the hotel lobby at 3:30 and up came a young man. Hi Elizabeth... I'm Joe... and off we went for an amazing four hour tour . we were on and off subways, in and out of markets, and seeing Kowloon from a local perspective. Our daughter loved it and she says it was the best part of our whole trip. Wear good walking shoes, carry a water bottle, have cash for the subways and food... I just gave the cash to Joe and he did all the ticket purchasing. It was fabulous. i can't give enough praise to Joe for the tour that he gave us. He is chock a block full of history and stories about life in Hong Kong. I wholeheartedly agree with our daughter... the tour with Joe was the highlight of our trip and I will be booking with Joe and Ski again. so if you are reading my comments... my advice... book early... book now! you won't have any regrets!

Instructions on where to meet Joe were really clear, and she also helped me sort out a couple of other things to do while we were there which certainly made life easier.Joe took our tour and was fantastic. I lived in HK before, whereas it was my girlfriends first time in the city. Joe took into account my (limited) knowledge as well as what Fi was interested in, and took us on a 4 hour tour that covered everything we wanted and more. His passion and knowledge of the city, its different areas and vast history was really impressive and made for a really interesting tour that we enjoyed from start to finish. To cover and exchange thoughts and opinions on architecture, history, religion, politics, food made for a really interesting and enjoyable 4 hours that flew by.I really cannot recommend Big Foot tours highly enough.

We had a great time and it was awesome to be there as a tourist. I've been to Hong Kong for business, but never had the time to really explore the food culture like this.Let me preface by saying we are well traveled and almost never do a \"tour\" as we like to explore the hidden gems of the local culture. BUT, my hubby hooked us up with Big Foot Tour while we were in Hong Kong and it was the best 4 hours I've ever spent there. First of all, Joe (our private walking guide) was amazing! He met us at our hotel and off we went. He's attentive, considerate, and passionate about his culture. (My mother in law was under the weather and he seeked out some good healthy tea for her.) Tip: don't fill up on food before you do this tour! You'll be sorry . . . He will ask you how adventurous you are at the start. My hubby is the foodie in the group and will try anything so Joe accommodated him as well as taking pleasing the rest of us with dishes like dim sum, BBQ pork, congee, fish balls, milk teas and more. All were so delicious! My hubby really enjoyed the snake soup (tastes like mushroom soup) and the whole experience - it was so interesting and something I never would've done with hubby alone. En route to our food stops, Joe took us to a temple, giving us a brief history lesson; plus, he taught us about ghost money, pawn shops, chinese caskets and really anything you are curious about - which was great. (He suggested we get the Octopus card too and that was very convenient!) Anyway - it was a great day and Joe was amazing. My motherinlaw and her beau really enjoyed it and said it was the \"highlight of the entire trip\". Which is a real compliment! :) Next time we are in HK, we'll definitely do this again . . ."

Best decision ever!\u00a0I organised & booked it all via email with Ski, who was wonderful and managed to fit us in on our last day with Joe as our guide. Due to our limited time she give us great advice as to which tour to do. We choose to do the 4 hour Hong Kong island tour. Ski said Joe could meet us at our hotel or\u00a0at Central MTR. We would recommend meeting at Central as it gives more time to touring and with Ski's directions is easy to get too. Joe was waiting for us when we got there & from the get go you realise why Big Foot Tours receives such great reviews! Joe was simply wonderful! \u00a0Friendly, funny, informative & engaging. His enthusiasm & passion for his city was infectious & the 4 hours simply flew by. He asked us what we were interested in & tailored our time around our interests. I can say with certainty that we would not have found or even tried to explore some of the places Joe showed us. It was simply amazing to see & experience the everyday Hong Kong. Joe's explications & knowledge made it come to life in a way we could not have done on our own. \u00a0From the street markets in the lanes to the temples and wet markets, Cat street & Mid Level escalators & the residential areas.... It was a great overall experience. A huge thank you to Joe for enhancing our Hong Kong trip in so many ways, great local food & more importantly \u00a0showing me those dress shops in Soho!!!

Ski was especially helpful in communicating my questions and needs while shopping for gifts and satisfying my curiosity about foods and unusual items we saw in markets. We saw and experinced so much more than we would have even dared without her, we are already talking about a return trip to Hong Kong and doing another tour with Ski."

My wife and I said what we wanted to see, Ski suggested a few things and a plan was formed.Upon meeting Ski, we found an intelligent, funny, well informed young lady who brought an enthusiasm for Hong Kong that was infectious. She seemed to know everything about the local history, architecture, bars, restaurants, food markets, bakeries, cafes, antique dealers and and other local characters which made up a very thorough 4 hour tour, while wishing we could keep going. That being said, we were pretty happy we finished in Lan Kwai Fong!! Our legs were a bit sore and the bars were very inviting!We will do another tour on our next trip, for there is so much more to see.I thoroughly recommend Ski to show you all of it."

From our first contacts via e-mail through our post-tour communication, it was obvious that Joe and Ski are very passionate about sharing Hong Kong and ensuring that they provide travelers with a unique and unforgettable experience. Based on e-mails prior to our originally scheduled tour, Ski was concerned there might be overlap with sites we had already seen. She recommended a tour of the New Territories instead, and we were very pleased that we followed her recommendation. We visited sites that were definitely off the beaten path but very much worth seeing. Joe was a great tour guide and definitely went the extra mile in providing detailed maps and further recommendations for our remaining stay. We sincerely appreciated his knowledge, enthusiasm and very positive energy and thoroughly enjoyed our tour. Many thanks to both Joe and Ski for their time, consideration and wonderful assistance in helping us with a very authentic experience!"

Great Comms from Ski. We had to change the day as I miscalculated which day we would arrive. Again no problem with the late change. We arrived at the meeting time, but aftr 20 minutes, Jo, our guide had not turned up. We contacted Ski, who, not knowing why Jo was not there, volunteered to come and meet us as a replacement. When Ski arrived, she explained Jo had been involved in a Road Traffic Accident and was en route to the hospital. Ski stepped in as guide, and we had a fantastic 4 hour tour of the \"hidden Hong kong\". I wont go into detail of some of the places we visited, as the surprises offered by Ski added to our trip. We would never have seen, eaten or experienced things which we did with Ski's expert knowledge. After the trip, Ski showed us how to use the MTR and advised us of where to go for some other experiences. When we arrived back at our hotel some hours later, there was a note in our hotel room from Jo appologising for not turning up and in his opinion letting us down. Not only that, but he had sent us some Hing Kong cake as a further apology. I would recommend this tour to anyone who is visiting Hong Kong. Ski are Jo work extremely hard.Hopefully Jo is back at work nowThanks AgainDarren, Linda, Ian and Hilary (Yorkshire, UK)"

Joe is a bright, friendly and engaging young man who grew up in Hong Kong but has also spent some time studying in the UK.We had a fantastic 4 hours with Joe covering many of the areas around Central that we may not have visited on our own. We learnt about everyday life and the traditions and beliefs of the local people and exchanged views on all sorts of things including how Hong Kong has changed over the last 20 years. We visited markets, a temple, the escalators and a great Dim Sun restaurant. The biggest compliment we can pay Joe is that our tour felt just like walking around with one of your best friends. We really enjoyed his company and he was ever attentive to make sure we were covering what we wanted. At the end he made sure that we were on the right bus for our plans for the rest of the day (the Peak). Thank you Joe and Ski - we'd highly recommend Big Foot to anyone wanting to find out about the \"real\" Hong Kong."

It is a \"travel must\" if you want to understand the City! Ski provides us with a walk that provided a contrast of the City including business areas, government, markets, residential, religious and cultural sites. My suggestion is that she ask if the pace is okay. I found the tour pace to be a little slow and it would have been great if she had a relationship with one of the markets that allowed for a more in depth look at the foods etc. rather than just walking by. Ski also gave us detailed directions to our next site and she also sent a link containing Chinese music for that we were looking for."

She could have easily upsell us to a longer tour duration just to cover everything, as it was clear that we were willing to pay for more tours. But she did not. Her advice was also spot on. After the orientation, we had no problem going around elsewhere in Hong Kong. Recommend this totally.We like her a lot.Trust her,go for it!"

            "review": "What a great afternoon/ evening. Recently on our trip to Hong Kong, based on previously read reviews on tripadvisor, we were fortunate to have oganized a walking tour with Ski- Big Foot Tour. What a great decision that turned out to be! The process of organizing our tour with Sk leading up to our tour was easy. She was interested to know f there was anything in particular we would like the tour geared towards seeing and bearing in mind my request to not walk up many big hills but prefer to go down she tailored the 4 hrs around our interests and requests. it was such a pleasure to meet Ski, she clearly has such a passion for what she does. So informative and enthusiastic. Ski showed us around many little laneways, little food venues( with some eating and drinking time- (My husband trying the custard tarts, and me trying an unusual cold coffee/tea mix concoction- it actually was't too bad ) we saw things that we would never have found or known existed. Ski walked at a pace to suit us and was happy to pick up the pace or rest whenever required. She is so easy to spend 4hrs with and found the tme had flown even though Ski felt we had probably covered 20kms during that time (although our feet knew it !!!!) A couple of suggestions.. don't leave it to make a booking until the last minute as we found Ski was very booked up even 3 wks prior to our trip. We did a 3.30- 7.30pm time walk and thought that was a great time as missed a lot of the heat and also got to see areas lit up with the night lights and the restaurants, bars etc were starting to come alive. Ski ended our tour pointing us in the direction of a little local restaurant that was cheap as chips and very authentic( we were the only non locals in there and it was packed). I have only wonderful things to say about Ski -Big Foot Tours - no wonder she is No. 1 on Tripadvisor !!"

I had heard about Ski and Big Foot tours while doing research for the trip. We met Ski promptly at the K exit/entrance of the MTR and we began the tour right away. Ski was extremely informative about both the culture and history of Hong Kong. She was able to answer many travel related questions we had. Like where to put more money on our oyster cards, and how to best travel around the Kowloon side. Her tour included many out of the way spots that we would have never seen without having Ski along. We were able to sample Dim Sum, and try the local milk tea which was delicious. The 4 hours with Ski went by much too quickly. I plan to use Ski on my next trip to Hong Kong and would highly recommend her to anyone planning on visiting Hong Kong. Thanks again Ski. Marie and I had a great time!Louis"

            "review": "Best Money Spent in Hong Kong. This review is well past due. I actually thought I had already wrote it, sorry Ski.  My wife 10 year old daughter and I used Ski on our very last night in Hong Kong in early June.  We wanted to make sure we really got a feel for Hong Kong, past all the touristy hyped places. Ski fully succeeded in this. The whole time Ski was showing us around she was also tweaking the tour destinations to match what she was learning about where we have already been and what we wanted to see. She took us places we would not have gone on our own or even known about. Many travelers want that locals experience on trips, but do not know how to get it. Ski can accommodate this. One of the things we had wanted to try was Turtle Jelly Soup. However, where to go for this we would have no idea. I'm sure I could have found some random place selling it, but who knows if it is a place you would want to try something like this. Ski brought us to a tiny shop in this small bldg with other retail shops. The whole shop probably had 4 tables in it. We would never had known about a place like this.  Since Ski knew we really like trying different foods she brought us to at least 4 different places to try local food. She knew my wife was looking for a small piece of Jade, so she brought us to some shops and street vendors that might have what she wanted.While walking through old China town, she would explain to us all the food items we were seeing in the in the shops. Most of which I would not have a clue what is was.It was just an over all great experience and am extremely glad we did it.Thanks Ski"

I really feel like I know HKG now after only a day. When I first arrived I was totally lost and to be honest scared, by the time Ski left me I was able to manouver around, take buses and walk through the city and find my way back to my hotel. She is an amazing tour guide, and I think this is because she loves both her job and the city. I am a very shy person but Ski had me talking the whole way! She also helped me to get an octopus card and a sim card when I mentioned I needed them. I don't think there is a question you could ask that she wouldn't know the answer to. My only regret is that I was only able to book her for one day...I miss her already, it felt much more like walking around with a friend rather than a guide.

Ski showed us a side of Hong kong that we would never have experienced on our own. She took us away from the beaten track, down little lanes and back alleys and all the time making each place become alive with her great local knowledge and history of Hong Kong. We could only manage to book her for four hours but those hours gave us a hint of what the area had to offer and enticed us to explore for ourselves. If you are looking for something a little different by way of a guided tour then I would highly recommend Ski."

Ski met us at statue square.... really nice and full of information. We had a great afternoon. At the end of the tour she droped us (and helped us get a table) at a good restaurant.

Vague desire of \"extraordinary experiences\" coupled with complete lack of preparation, and half-@ssed research makes me that annoying type of tourist who has expectations, but no clear idea what he wants. But that makes my experience with Big Foot Tour even more outstanding. I stayed in Hong Kong for 2,5 days on my way to Saigon. I've spent my first day feeling lost among millions of people in Kowloon, trying to make sense of this place on my own. I did my best, but felt that this is really not enough. So I emailed Ski without any real hope of actually pulling this off, since it was just one day in advance. I got a response soon, the payment was arranged via PayPal (extremely convenient).  The actual tour was brilliant! Ski surely knows the city very well, she does a great job in revealing many faces of Hong Kong: amazing culture mixed with colonial past mixed with uncertainties of \"one country, two systems\" future. Probably, the one thing that I liked the most was that insight into the daily life of people in Hong Kong, which Ski was always ready to provide. Ski loves the city, knows the city, and enjoys helping tourists like me explore the city. What more could I ask for?"

I visit Hong Kong quite frequently, but not so my friends who had flown in the night before. Ski was prompt in replying to my emails and had some helpful suggestions as to where we might go for our walking tour. In the event, only two friends were able to come with me, and one had some limits to her mobility. We met Ski who was like a bright breathe of fresh air on a hot, humid Hong Kong morning. Ski paced the tour to accommodate everyone's needs, stopping as required, but still making sure that she provided us with plenty of information. Even though I have been to Hong Kong often, I learnt many new and interesting facts from Ski. She certainly opened my eyes to things I have overlooked in the past. Ski took us to a very traditional dim sum restaurant for lunch, which was awesome and different to the experiences I have had at other dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong. Ski Yeo is the consummate professional guide who has a bright, engaging personality, a great sense of humor and the flexibility to adapt to the requirements of her clients. I would recommend her tours to anyone no matter what their age, stage or mobility."

Yes she does indeed, I mean how nasty is this?? ski would only let me have ONE of the best pork buns i've ever had.... although I did limited myself to one of the still warm egg tarts( how I did this I still dont know) , and then later on in the tour she wouldn't let me leave until i had finished my turtle shell jelly. Which by the way has a flavour not unlike a very strong black tea.But all jokes aside, Ski does one of the best tours that I've ever had the luck to be on. It's not so much a tour as you a local friend going on a wander and exploring a new place that you havent been to before or maybe you have and you are seeing it through different eyes.For me it was my first time in Hong Kong and having someone help me get my bearings and give me how to get around hints was awesome. Seeing the little side markets that pop up out of nowhere and then then thrive... every allyway a different one. The stand where umbrellas are repaired (unfortunitly closed for the day when we got there) was remarkable in this day and age when every thing is thrown away. Ski was even able to show me where to go for the Take Out Comedy venue as I was going there a couple of nights later and was worried about finding it. Ski also gave me directions on where to take photos from the peak..which turned out to be one of the best locations. How do I know this?? Well locals where there taking shots and an Austrian advertising team turned up to do shots there as well for part of an ad campaign being run in Europe. Stay away from the Galleria.Only disappointing thing of the tour was because of the time of year (summer) I wasnt able to try the snake soup, as i had tried snake in vietnam only a few day earlier and wanted to compare to 2, so next time i'll just have to make sure i go back in the colder months and maybe Ski will be kind enough to let me try some. But overall I was taken to some wonderful places and took some great photos of every day life in HK and all done with a wonderful and talented guide in Ski.As a last note if I hear of anyone heading that way will be definatly putting thenm in touch with Big Foot Tours."

I can honestly say I've never had so much fun in the rain since college. Ski filled the afternoon with an inside look at life and the culture of Hong Kong. I met ladies who job it is to curse those who have wronged you, got a glimpse of the Hong Kong above street level, learned about Tao China's chief religion, learned about the gentleman who rasied 9 children repairing umbrellas, and saw various interesting market places. The best way to describe the afternoon was that it was like going to visit a friend and having them show you around where they live!

It was hard work in the humidity, but we got a good education of the area (Tao temple, colonial buildings etc), leaving the numerous shopping malls to on side.Ski also gave us good information regarding use of transport, what number of bus to use etc and what other sights to see around the area.Ski's knowledge is definitely first class, and her enthusiasm for her job (never stopped smiling) is credit to her (she is originally from Singapore), so if you are looking for a tour tailered to your reguirements, go no further than Big Foot. The recent Trip Advsior reviews also reflect our own thoughts and feelings."

As mentioned before we completed the four hour tour which IMO was not long enough for me. I could have easily done the eight hour tour. We started off in the Central district (the business district) where we covered off the different types of buildings, the feng shui that went into their planning and architecture etc. We then moved further up into the ity towards the escalator, the SOHO district etc followed by a visit to a local Taoist Temple. Along the way Ski would pause and explain the different little aspects of each building, the people, their lifestyle, the markets etc, so she was quite good. We then moved on back down towards the water where we stopped for lunch and then back up through Hollywood Road and down again towards Central.We finished that in about 3 hours so we caught the MTR over to Mong Kok and toured through the markets and malls and then sat down for some delicious turtle jelly (said to be good for a cough from which i suffered, and you know what? it worked!).Look, Ski was fantastic, she's very thorough in her explanations, very clear, her English is excellent and she genuinely is a lovely person.

We sampled Hong Kong tea/coffee at a tiny little cafe, and at a bakery the \"best\" egg tarts. My husband even sat on a little stool, all 6'4\" of him and relished the black turtle shell jelly with gusto, which I could not even attempt.She was really informative on various historical and interesting tidbits, both folklore and real, as we wandered around in the late afternoon.Ski was very sympathetic of my very sore feet, and suggested little stops from time to time.We meandered through the oldest area in the back streets to the dried seafood and herbmedicine streets, as she pointed out the interesting items on offer and the reasons that they are used and how to cook them.We stopped at a lovely little tea shop and browsed through the myriad types of tea.We would have liked to spend more time with Ski, as we saw more and covered more ground with her than we had previously. We saw umbrellas restored on a very very steep street, wet food markets. It was not so much a tourist tour, but one of genuine discovery of how the residents in Hong Kong live, and some of the disused buildings of a bygone era.If we go back, we will definitely want more. Fantastic. Thank you so much Ski, we will treasure those memories for a long time."

As our first trip to Hong Kong, it was the perfect introduction to the city, its culture, history and attractions. Ski adapted the tour to our needs. I.e. she helped us find a special knife gift for our son, to visit a church for me and to sample unique foods for my husband. My husband was concerned that four hours would be too much walking for his bad hip and knees. But the pace was just right, with frequent stops, and he time flew by quickly. I wish we had more time in Hong Kong. It is a great city. When we return, we will certainly book another tour with Big Foot Tours. Ski is the perfect city host. I highly recommend that you book a tour... Quickly!"

We spent a very happy day walking around all the nooks and crannies of the island and the Chilin Nunnery. We learnt a lot about both the history as well as modern day life and culture of Hong Kong. It was just like being taken round the home town of an old friend. We were introduced to the art of a dim sum lunch, the frenetic market streets, Chinese medicine, Chinese symbolism in architecture and art, religion and beliefs, the retail and commercial extravaganza that is HK, British influence, everyday life and living conditions, death and after-life beliefs, Chinese herbs and cooking, education - the list goes on and then to the oasis of tranquility of the gardens and nunnery and a philosophical chat about contrasts between mainland, HK and Singaporean Chinese culture and politics. All done at a pace that didn't exhaust and which really gave us a good feeling for the place in such a short time. Good luck Ski in all your endeavours. We'd love to come back and tour and talk with you again. We have no hesitation in encouraging others to take the tour."

She did not frog march us around but yet showed us some delightful elements of Hong Kong which we would certainly have missed had we just used a guide book. Her depth of knowledge on every topic we raised was amazing. Having gone out of her way & time, she took us to the Star ferry terminal to catch the ferry to Kowloon whilst listing several other sights worth seeing on our remaining days in Hong KongWe can thoroughly recommend her services"

So when I decided to try the walking tour with Big Foot Tour, I thought I might have to see some of the same tourist places again. But Ski surprised me completely when we walked through the streets of Hong Kong Island. She had info on every street, every kind of business, every ride that we took on the tram, metro, escalators! I was so engrossed in the in-depth information about the real Hong Kong, that we walked by almost all the tourist spots(which I had seen in my previous trips) without even noticing. I strongly recommended this tour for first time visitors and even for those who wish to discover Hong Kong all over again in subsequent trips. The beauty of this walking tour is that, besides the invaluable info, Ski also lets you decide the pace and speed of the tour as per your requirement. The comfort level of the tour is the deal-breaker. It is unmatched and therefore it is no wonder that Big Foot Tour is ranked as the number 1 attraction in Hong Kong."

Before that, we had a lot of email correspondences going on and Ski was very patient in answering all of our questions. My parents are old and they walk slow and they don't like to talk much because they know very little English. Still, Ski made the effort to chat with them and made them laugh and at the same time made sure that my wife and I are included in the conversation. We had a pram for our daughter and Ski helped us to get around Hong Kong which is DEFINITELY not friendly for prams at all and at times, she even had to help carry the pram up the stairs (feel bad given that ski is such a small and petite girl). She did all of these without a complaint. Everywhere we go, Ski will check with all of us to see if we are ok with it or if we are too tired to walk then she finds us a rest place, all entirely at our own leisure pace. I would highly recommend this tour because this is a level of services that I have not seen in a long time. And from where i come from, this is definitely a service i am thoroughly impressed with."

The tour started in a late Friday afternoon while the sun peeked thru the cloudy innards of Hong Kong's hustle & bustle. We wanted to see what Hong Kong was really about without having the \"Frommer's/Lonely Planet Travel book carrying tourist\" look that eagerly waited to get pick-pocketed. Ski came with a sweet smile, innate gusto, and pimp sneakers. I already knew this was gonna be a great walking tour just from that. Ski brilliantly guided us to Hong Kong's own Chinatown, clustering HK seafood markets, Buddhist temples, & inclining street arts & architecture in all walks of Hong Kong life. Ski gave us enough to engulf Hong Kong. We even ended up eating at a deliciously quaint Won Ton restaurant, grabbing a Tsing' beer in Lan Kwai Fung, & picturesque boat ferry to Kowloon for the magical night lights of Hong Kong. This is how we started our Hong Kong adventure and it was perfectly executed."

This is my first time doing a private tour and I find it to be really worth the money. I have learnt that there is no point rushing around Hong Kong trying to squeeze in 100 sights.

This gave us the confidence to go all over the island on our own later. Her commentary was interesting and useful and very responsive to us. Not the monologue you can sometimes get. She was very flexible in selecting what we would do in our 6 hour tour and we saw a lot. More than we expected. Having her at hand to explain things that happened to be going on around us, like the grave sweeping holiday and the domestics picnics on their day off, added a lot of depth to what we would have taken away on our own. In retrospect our old feet would have been fine with a 4 hour tour rather than the 6 but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

We found her to be very likeable and a nice person to be around, with good knowledge, and was a great way to become familiar with trams and star ferry etc. Definitely a lot better than a bus tour, in the ability to use public transport and for personalisation.If I was travelling alone, I would have rated this higher, but I was travelling with two kids, and so different. While they really enjoyed some things we saw, and especially loved the temple visit, and liked Ski a lot (and wanted to see her again), they were frequently asking when it would be over, and found the time dragged (in contrast to our later private tours in which they didn't want it over after 12 hours). Touring with kids is very different, and I am very sure I would rate higher if touring alone as Ski does have very good knowledge and a lovely personality.We also had not corresponded apart from basic arrangements before the tour, which I think would've helped to make the time a bit smoother, so definitely worth communicating your interests prior.I would certainly recommend a tour with Ski over a bus tour if travelling with a group of adults, it is a great way to get a feel for the city and for its transport, and pleasant way to spent time, and to see and do things you may not otherwise."

We figured we could see all the tourist spots on our own during the remainderof our visit. Ski met us at our hotel and, after a brief confirmation of what we wanted to do, we headed off to take the ferry over to Hong Kong. She led us through side streets, to a temple, Chinatown, parks, antique shops and even lunch at an authentic dim sum restaurant. Along the way she knowledgabley answered our questions and gave us much history and cultural information. When we mentioned it, she took us to a local tailor to get measured up for a suit and shirts. She insisted we try bubble tea at her favorite shop. We then ferried back to Kowloon where we continued our tour at the waterfront and then began a visit to the \"dark\"side. Further along we braved a couple of blocks of the flower market which was jam packed with everyone buying their flowers for Chinese New Year. The bird market was our final stop in a very enjoyable day. Ski gave us advice for the rest of our time in Hong Kong and, when she found out our trip included her hometown of Singapore, she took the time to email us her favorite restaurants and things to do. Big Foot tours went beyond our expectations, and Ski,the owner, is a gem. She followed up with us after our return home to ensure we received our suit, and when there was a delay in shipping, she personally went to the shop to check out the problem. We got a great feel for the real Hong Kong and only wish our stay could have been a little longer."

We learned so many new things about HK, the food, the culture, public transport, the transfer from the British, Feng Shui, the temples etc etc. all delivered with a great sense of humour.Lunch was also very special ....but I will leave that up to Ski to show you !We have absolutely no hesitation in recommending one of Ski's tours."

If I can give one advice, I will say don't think too much about it. leave it to the guide to plan for you, especially good if it is your first day in Hong kong. You will have a clear idea of what to do and how to go around for the next few days. Go for it!"

I did a 4 hours tour, because the guide, ski, does a wonderful job of orientating you around the city, teach you to use the public transport, share with you insider info about the city and then give recommendations for the rest of the trip. It's the most efficient way to get to know Hong Kong, especially if you are on a business trip or here for only a short moment. It will also be very easy to go around on your own after the tour."

She's clearly not in this business for the money, but with just a strong passion to keep sharing and hosting strangers from all over the world. You can't fake such feelings. I appreciate her tour service, because you know she is not trying to rip you off. She can easily command a higher price (just take a look at other private tour listing who charged way way way more, for reasons that I am not comprehending and how people are still going for it), but when I asked her about her pricing and how she does not accept tips at all, she says she's aware of the market, but she just want to keep it as fair as possible. She mentioned something to the extent that it's not about squeezing people out of their cash, just because they can well-afford it, but to offer something of true value. You also see her website that she remains humble. She doesn't brag or try to advertise by her achievements in tripadvisor. How many can do that? To be very honest, I would say that she is a lousy business woman, but a very good tour guide and friend to have. Hong Kong is very clearly a strong capitalist country, so it's refreshing to find someone like her to show you a local side of Hong Kong , as well as the gentler side of human kind.Go for it, Ski. It is my honour to know you and thank you so much for showing me around."

Ski, our guide was waiting for us as arranged and spoke perfect English. She asked a few questions and quickly summed up what we were interested in seeing and off we went. Our tour lasted four hours and in that time we saw more of Hong Kong than we would have on our own in the whole 3 days. Neither of us are particularly good walkers (O.K. on the flat) she took us up on escalators into areas you don't see from the ground, into local coffee shops (no tourists), down alleys, through markets and finally left us at the Harbour. She gave us ideas of how to spend the next two days and explained how to get around on the underground. Even took us to the best store to buy new i phones. I was especially impressed that she devoted the whole time exclusively to us. Her mobile was switched off ! Thoroughly recommend. Money well spent."

Having limited time in Hong Kong (2 days), I didn't want to have to waste time searching for points of interest and getting lost along the way. Having Ski take us was such a time saver and it made it so much more enjoyable. We met Ski , on day 2 in HK, in our Hotel in Kowloon and went across the harbor to Hong Kong Island to explore Central. What everyone has said about her is true! So courteous, patient and very attentive to our needs! I didn't know what to expect weather wise and my 2 girls , 9 and 11 yrs old, were complaining how hot they were- the day was sunny and humid and they were using jeans --and this was the beginning of the walking tour. Ski took us for a pit stop at H&M to get a change of clothes for them. 2 pairs of shorts later, we continued on : ) We rode the famous escalator, ate HK comfort food, visited a temple, ate more food, shopped for trinkets...We were enjoyed everything we were seeing that we did not realize how far we traveled...15 km! I think that is a testament to how good the tour was! Anyway, I totally recommend booking with Ski and Big Foot Tour!"

There were 4 of us, including my 10 and 18 year old sons. Ski has such a warm and friendly personality and is easy to understand. Her English is perfect so we were all able to learn so much from her. At first, my wife and kids thought that I was crazy for booking an 8 hour walking tour. When the tour ended, all were happy on how great the tour was and surprised on how fast the time went by. My youngest, who is so hard to please, loved everything. as well as our tour guide. Ski made sure that he was never bored and was also attentive to the rest of us. We went on the worlds longest escalator, had great BBQ pork for lunch, shopped at Western Market, the Ding Ding bus, walked around Stanley Market and the pier, finished the tour with the Ferry ride back to Kowloon. We had been to the Peak before so asked to skip it. Ski really knows Hong Kong and is so willing to share her knowledge with you. The tour went so smooth and was well thought out, catering to all the things that we had discussed beforehand. For sure we would recommend Ski and Big Foot Tours to anyone. Thanks again Ski for turning us on to some great things to do and places to see in Hong Kong. Hopefully we will see you in Khao Yai. :)"

Ski is an energetic, outgoing, friendly and courteous guide who speaks perfect English and knows Hong Kong intimately.We asked for a 4-hour tour focussing on food specifically, because we wanted some help finding and ordering things that would otherwise be inaccessible to monolingual Western tourists. Ski took us to places that looked totally nondescript from the street, or that you couldn't even see from the street, and which weren't in any guidebook but which served up all manner of culinary delight. From the routine (the yummiest roast pork ever) to the out there (snake soup and turtle jelly).I can't believe how much ground we covered in 4 hours, and how many places we visited. And at the end of it Ski escorted us to our next destination before leaving us.The fee (HKD1100 for 4 hours) is very reasonable for the service offered."

She could tell straight away what was interesting to us and tailored the trip around us. We saw amazing temples on the Island and what we think must be the only park on the whole of Hong Kong, with an acupressure walking garden made of stones to relieve our feet after all the hill climbing. She took us across to Kowloon to see the food markets and other street markets like the bird market and the flower market. We ate some things that we would never have known to try on our own - snake soup, turtle jelly and some dim sum where we were the only non-locals. It was a great experience. I am also sure that for people who didn't to eat snake soup or see the fish and eels being decapitated at the markets, Ski would be able to come up with an itinerary that suited. She knows HK backwards and could find a walking tour that suited anyone. She gave us a great tip for the end of the day - a bar on the top floor of a hotel on the Kowloon side with amazing views of the Island at sunset.Overall, this was a great experience and an excellent way to get the most out of a short stop in HK.

This was our eighth trip to Hong Kong so we had seen all the tourists attractions and wanted to focus on local foods in the markets. Ski gave us four hours our first day and a broad education of what people eat as we toured various outdoor food markets, went to night markets to see food prepared on the street and were introduced to some food specialties we had not eaten before. The day was so successful we retained Ski' servicesfor our last day in the city. Ski is a delightful, resourceful young woman. We ended our visit feeling we had a very special friend in Hong Kong and that she greatly enhanced our visit."

So, wasn't expecting too much of Ski's tour of Hong Kong however, I was pleasantly surprised. Before the tour Ski asked us a few questions about or likes and what we had already seen. After these few questions we set off. Ski not only created a perfect tour for us, but opened up Hong Kong. Her knowledge of the city is extremely impresive. We were able to visit restaurants that we would not be able to find (or order from). Anyone going to Hong Kong should book this tour!!!"

We recently went to Hong Kong for the first time and arranged a tour with Ski for the first full day of our holiday. Unfortunately Cathay Pacific had other ideas and due to technical issues with the plane our flight was cancelled and re-scheduled for more than 24 hours later. Ski was wonderful - despite being very busy she managed to fit us in for the same tour but a day later. We saw so many things we would never have found or understood if we had just wandered around on our own. We can honestly say that Ski helped to make our time Hong Kong truly amazing.

Many of us may want a guide who is knowledgable and bond like a friend. To me, on top of that, my main concern with going on tours is that I don't want to go around standing out as a group of westerners and end up getting high price for everything that I want to buy. True, we can bargain down the prices, but I rather have a more realistic starting price to begin with and save the extra time for other sights and scenes. This tour solves my problems for me. Great English, earnest attitude and it helps so much to have someone local going around with me. There is a natural ease when it comes to shopping, ordering food and even making sense of what the local people are saying. To be honest, it is also good that she does not look like a westerner. Most shop owners would think that she is my local friend and immediately give a lower price the moment we talk among ourselves. How fun is that? a pity that this tour company does not extend the service beyond Hong Kong. Now i am touring beijing and hoping to find a tour with a standard as high as what this tour company offers. wish me luck!!"

Ski helps us through, negotiating, getting us through the crowd and more importantly, calming us down and bringing our mood back to the tour highlights. I wonder if she was a psychologist (or something) by training. On top of this, I noticed my wife was asking her so many questions that at certain point, I swear I was going crazy (only married couples will understand this haha). But she took the time to talk to my wife, and at the same time, made sure I was included in the conversation. When I walked off to take some photos on my own and then came back to them, she didn't leave it to my wife to repeat the sights to me, but told me everything personally.  I give her credits for her knowledge on Hong Kong, her patience, and for being able to wear that smile throughout the tour. All thumbs up from my family and me!"

After the tour, we agree that the other reviews are really accurate - friendly, flexible, prompt, etc. Perhaps one understatement is that this is a rare tour guide with a good heart. You can feel it and you know that she is not trying to push for anything to go along her way or being extremely PR just because she probably has an incentive to please. Instead, you feel her sincerity in making friends and in really wanting to show you around the city - even though she does this on a daily basis. In fact, shortly after our 6-hours tour during the Christmas period, we bumped into her giving another tour to another guests. She still has that smile on her face and looks really excited about the city, even though she had been working the whole day during the festive week! Impressive! To me, it's evident. You wouldn't be able to do this unless you have passion for what you are doing (ok, and for walking). For the record, my body was aching (excuse my poor physical capability) after just a 6 hour tour with her, in a good way of course!Go for this tour and I assure you this lady is bound to make a difference to your trip!

We booked a tour with Big Foot Tours. This was my first time going to Hong Kong and my first time booking a tour with a personal guide. Ski helped to make our vacation very memorable. She showed us places that we would have never ventured out to on our own. She got along great with our kids and was very patient with answering our questions. My daughter wrote down every word that Ski said. When we returned home she created a PowerPoint based on the history that Ski shared and the places that she showed us and presented it to her history class. She made an A on it. If you are weighing the option of booking with Ski and Big Foot Tours, don't waste anymore time. Do it now. You will not regret it. You will cherish the memories that you will encounter for the rest of your life."

From our first contact in the morning, the tour itself and follow up Ski was super professional, prompt and extremely helpful. Ski provided a fascinating HK tour with great insights into the local lifestyle and odds and ends of every-day life. I like watching people closely and was very impressed by the hillside escalator (changing direction at 10:00am), the buzz of activities and the people on the market, the different vehicles on the street, the tradition that people alive can send gifts to dead people by burning faithful copies. I saw things that I know for sure I wouldn't see by myself or in a big tour group. Besides looking at tiny things the tour was peppered with historical and city information facts. Ski has an easy going and humorous personality with red sport shoes (normal size). At the end of the tour I was under the impression to know Ski already for years. I will definitely recommend Ski to my friends intending a visit to Hong Kong and I wish her great success in the future."

She won't inundate you with boring historical facts. Instead, she injects these, at appropriate times during your conversations throughout your tour. She tailors the tour to your interests, and she does adjustments throughout the day, as the tour progresses in case you change your mind about certain places and things. She will show you Hong Kong through the eyes of a local. Time with Ski is like taking in the sounds, sights, smells and feel of Hong Kong with a good friend.

Ski was friendly, had a great deal of knowledge and knew exactly what we wanted to see. We were interested in seeing the temples that the real Hong Kong people went to and to get within the skin of Hong Kong. Ski took us to places that we would never have found on our own and had it spot on. We visited a place that sold turtle jelly (delicious and made from turtle shell) and she arranged for my husband to have a tea that would help his cough which was interesting as I tasted it and him and I had two different takes on the flavour! We went for Dim Sum at one of the two last remaining places that still use a trolley. I can never resist a challenge so when we visited a snake shop I had to try the snake soup which again was delicious and yes tastes of chicken. Ski took us finally to 10000 Buddha's which was one of the best things for us in Hong Kong an absolutely amazing place. We went over our time with her and offered to pay for the additional hour, which she declined so we donated it to a temple at a later date.I dont feel I have done Ski justice in this review as she was just so wonderful in every way and I would definitely book another tour with her when we come back to Hong Kong. I suppose what I am trying to say is book Ski whether it is for a short time or the longer time you will not be disappointed, this is one young lady who deserves to continue with her success and neither my husband or I can rate her high enough."

Ski makes the tour interesting because unlike attending history lessons (just joking, no offence to all teachers), she is somehow able to let you know about Hong Kong in a very conversational manner, filled with her own interpretation and humour. clearly she cares and is attentive to details  our only regret is that we did not book her longer, because we thought we would be able to manage Hong Kong on our own. I mean technically speaking, we can, as it was a simple destination for us because we have been here before, and so have many of our friends who gave us their recommendations of shops and eateries to go. But the guide makes a difference. Ski's opinion adds a new dimension to Hong Kong and I will highly recommend her tour to anyone who is touring Hong Kong.Got to reiterate, her availability runs out fast (literally within a day mind you) so book her fast!"

Ski showed up early to the meeting point, knew exactly where she was going at all times, answered all my questions (the ones she didn't know the answer to were emailed to me after the tour), provided a good background of information for the trip, and moved at whatever pace I wanted. She is also a good photographer! Even though I know she does this tour often, she didn't lose ambition or enthusiasm. What a great way to explore a new city. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a walk!"

            "review": "What more is there to say - simply the best private tour!. Before booking a tour, I visited TripAdvisor to learn about the tours that Hong Kong offers. Maybe it's my work habits, I just had to do a rational comparison before committing to any tour. I zoomed into the top 2 on the list and it became clear very quickly that I should pick Big Foot Tour. Reasons being:1) Price - it's reasonable and way cheaper , even though it is number 1 on TripAdvisor! (Why does the other company charge so much more to begin with?)2) Quality - at that point, I couldn't judge except from taking a leap of faith in the great reviews posted as well as her email correspondences with me : prompt and helpful.Moreover, I noticed that there are a few common reviews between the two of them. Apparently there are people who went for both of their tours and her reviews are clearly better.After the tour, I feel even more strongly that I had made the right choice.1) Price - you get what you pay for...in fact, i think you get more than what you pay for! Probably work has gotten me very cynical so I was expecting some surcharges here and there (especially since her price is way lower than the other company). But surprisingly (and I'm not complaining), there is no hidden cost. She doesn't expect you to pay for her share of meals, transport and neither does she wants a tip! She would always politely refuse. There's no awkwardness at the end of the tour ( you know how sometimes service people tend to linger around hoping for tips...).2) Quality - the reviews thus far have been right. Flexible, fun, no commercial 'factory outlets' to go, speaks good english, know her stuff. I don't know what more to expect from a private guide. It's comfortable touring with her because there isn't a pressure or a divide. It's like hanging out with a friend who happens to live in Hong Kong.Conclusion: if you are looking for a reliable guide with reasonable pricing, I will highly recommend Ski from Big Foot Tour."

Areas we saw included taking the metro to Central; the Mid Level Escalator; Soho; Hollywood Road; Man Mo Temple; Cat Street Market; Lin Heung Tea House (for Lunch); Old Chinatown (Sheung Wan); Victoria Peak and the Star Ferry. 2 of the highlights of the day were the view from the top (Victoria Peak) - simply breathtaking - along with lunch at the Lin Heung Tea House. We walked in to a dynamic, bustling restaurant where as best we could tell we were the only 'westerners' - a truly authentic Asian experience of Dim Sum. One of the women at our table didn't speak English but was willing to share her pot of tea with us! At another stop, our adventurous friends even tried snake, which apparently tastes alot like chicken.Throughout the day, Ski did a great job of informing us all about the culture and everyday goings-on of life in Hong Kong. She knew not only the streets and the areas well, but also had interesting things to say about the areas. The markets are also fascinating to experience, again to appreciate the truly diverse items that make up the Hong Kong and Asian diet.All in all we would highly recommend Ski for a unique and highly enjoyable experiencing of Hong Kong!"

An impromptu stop for snake soup was incorporated for my husband (really does taste like turkey). The amiable owner gave us the added delight of pulling out a live snake so that we could forever capture this memorable stop. Ski covered both the British Colonial and Chinese perspectives in an easy going and fun way.

My wife and four year old daughter wanted to experience a trip around Hong Kong and learn more about the region, find some good places to eat and bargains to be had. Big Foot allows you to completely customise your tour. Just let them know what sort of things you want to do and they put it together for you within whatever time you have. The website was really helpful and we got a response quickly from the team confirming our requirements and providing an outline plan for our approval. Our guide was prompt and friendly. Our often shy daughter warmed to her quickly and was sorry to see her go atthe end of the day. We confirmed everything before we took off and was really confident in the guide looking after us. It was really up to us how much we did in the end and fast we were going to go. The travel times on the MTR were filled with interesting facts and stories about history of where we were going and the way people live and work around Hong Kong. We set our own place and our guide was able to help us answer any questions we had, offered additional information and sought out solutions to any problems or questions we had. She was also happy to wait while we looked a certain shops, went to a tailors she recommended and gave us a great experience of the markets and the food of Hong Kong.For the tours, have a look around web sites for what you may be interested in from cultural sites, to special shops or tailors you may want to visit. Think about what sort of thing you want to eat and how long you want to go for. We did six hours and was about right to see enough of the place. The day is not rushed so you can stop and rest as you need.The walking was not too arduous at all. Our four year old is a pretty good walker and only wanted to be carried a little through the day. The MTR is used to get around as well, it is worth getting everyone an 'Octupus Card' prior to the tour with about HK$100 on it to cover your rides around the area. A small backpack with hats, sunscreen, water and some snacks are a good idea. You are rarely far from a place with a bathroom. While Hong Kong has a series of hills but the Big Foot is well planned to reduce this to a minimum. If you have small kids who are not that keen with walking a light-weight stroller is a good idea, but needs to pack down quickly to get on the MTR and carry up steps in some places.I would highly recommend a Big Foot Tour and was a real highlight of our holiday."

We have loved all of our guides so to stand out as the best amongst a really special group is something indeed. But Ski was the most wonderful, warm, knowledgeable guide we have had. I can't tell you how much she added to our trip to Hong Kong. We had two 6 hour days with her and honestly, we wish we had booked more! The first day was the overview of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon that others have talked about but my favorite day was yesterday when we went to the 10,000 Buddhas Monastery, the Chi Lin Nunnery, the Ladies market and a cafe known to locals as having the quintessential Hong Kong food. We were traveling with our two children and they were both truly sad to say goodbye to Ski, as were my husband and I. I know people say you can do Hong Kong on your own, because the public transportation is so good and the signs are in English but I guarantee you will see more, and more importantly you will see a more authentic version of Hong Kong with Ski. We are a family of foodies so I asked her if we could try certain foods I had read about, so she made sure we got to try every single thing on our list. She was friendly, approachable and so full of fascinating facts about the city and Chinese culture. She also helped us plan the days we would have on our own. One last thing that speaks volumes about Ski. As we were saying goodbye our first day, my 9yo son asks the meaning of some of the zodiacs. I told him that he could ask that again tomorrow as it was getting late. That night the bell boy knocks on our door with a package of information on all the zodiac signs that Ski had dropped off to the hotel, plus a color map of the area we had planned to visit on our own the next day. Amazing. But the word is out - book early as she is filling up quickly!!"

I\u2019ve been to Hong Kong so many times that I\u2019ve lost count, and because it has many similarities to where I\u2019m from, my visits were mainly to work, to dine, and to shop. However, since retiring from work, I\u2019ve been keen on deeper exploration during my travels around the world. Hong Kong presented a challenge in this regard, as I wanted to see it from a fresh perspective.After doing some research, I decided to focus on Lantau, which is the largest island in Hong Kong, and the sixth largest in China. Although it is only 35-kilometres from the heart of the metropolis that is Hong Kong, and although it is where modern facilities like the International Airport and Disneyland are located, its greenery makes a sufficiently refreshing change to the concrete-jungle environment that I am so used to in this city. I focused my exploration of Lantau on the Ngong Ping 360 cable-car ride, with its enjoyable vistas of the surrounding mountainous terrain and dense forestry, the International Airport, and the 34-metre high statue of Buddha; the colourful and interesting Po Lin Monastery; and the rustic and quaint Tai O fishing village. These three destinations did give the new take on Hong Kong that I was seeking. For those of you planning on these destinations, I would recommend wearing comfortable walking gear, as the monastery and fishing village are best explored on foot. Also, at the fishing village, you may want to pass on taking a boat ride to sight white dolphins in the Zhujiang River Estuary, as they are elusive, and you may not get your money\u2019s worth.In addition, I would recommend paying extra to ride the \u201cCrystal Cabin\u201d class of cable-car as its glass flooring is interesting, as well as paying extra to buy the \u201cJourney of Enlightenment\u201d package as it gets you onto the priority queue that is much faster than the regular queue, as the latter can take up to more than a hour on a bad day.By the way, according to netizens, visitors should be careful with the shopping, as many vendors are tourist traps. Nevertheless, if you are a shopping addict, the Citygate mall of brand-name factory outlets is located right on top of the Chung Tung subway station, which is the entry point to the Ngong Ping 360 cable-car ride, and you may want to spend some extra time here.Other attractions which I did not cover include the Tung Chung Fort, a remnant reflective of this island\u2019s deep history as a Southern Song Dynasty refuge, a Portuguese and British trading settlement, and as a resistance hideout from the Japanese during World War II; and the 70-kilometre Lantau Trail with its hilly terrain, parks, and beaches. Also, photography buffs may also wish to stop at the Lantau Link Visitor Centre for the pretty night-time views of this 3.5-kilometre series of two bridges and one viaduct.Last but not least, I wish to thank Ms Ski Yeo of Big Foot Tour for bringing me around Lantau. Her command of the English language is excellent; she listens to and understands my preferences as an Asian tourist, as well as a photography buff; she was able to ply me with a wealth of information that allowed me to better appreciate the sights I was viewing, but knew when not to interrupt when I was occupied with taking a photo; and she helped me lower the cost of this trip by using public transportation wherever practical."

We now all agree that all the reviews about Ski and Big Foot Tours were right and we are just so glad we spent half a day with Ski on Hong Kong Island in fact we had such a good time the 4 hours turned into 6 .Ski met us at our Hotel in Kowloon and asked if there were any specific things we wished to see or as we explained we just wanted to get an overview of Hong Kong so it was off to the Bus firstly getting a Octopus Card which Ski explained we could use on all public transport saving the need to continually be looking for change,these cards can also be topped up during your stay and any credit can be refunded at the Airport, Bus to ferry from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island we walked around China Town and had many of the traditions explained to us including the \"snake shop\" and the \"funeral shop\" then Ski took us to the oldest Dim Sum restaurant in Hong Kong for a bite to eat she made suggestions on food and of course had to do all the ordering as this is not a place for westerners normally,then walked around the Chinese markets onto the travelator thru Soho and a Pink Elephant beer at the Globe,and thru all the little laneways ,all the time Ski was telling us all the about the area ,it's history and many other little snippets of information that made it so interesting. Time did not seem to worry Ski at all she was more than happy to linger at various places take our photo and laugh along with our odd joke or two. Onto the bus to the peak via the local area and there were some very interesting sights on the way looking over Happy Valley race course and all the high rise apartments buildings as we wound our way up to the peak much better than the \"tourist route\".we then caught the tram back down and Ski escorted us to the ferry to, sadly for us,say goodbye.Ski's English is really good, she is extremely friendly and knowledgable and so willing to be flexible and accomodating to your wishes. We had a great time and learnt so much about Hong Kong and would recommend any person going to Honk Kong to get in touch with Ski at Big Foot and book at least a half day tour on your first day. You will then know and have the confidence to travel on public transport, and have a very good overall view and knowledge of Hong Kong so you can go back into some of the areas for dinner or drinks at night.We wish Ski all the best and are sure she will be very successful"

We went to old Chinatown areas, markets (temple street, jade, ladies), Soho, Kowloon, Nan Lian Garden, parks, 1881 Heritage, Hollowood Road, Cat Street, Man Ho Temple, St John's Cathedral and a few more.She was a pleasure to deal with from the start in our email correspondence where we finalized my tour agenda until the end of the tour and afterward too, sent me an email on certain things I wanted to know more about! She speaks fluent English and her intelligence and dedication to her tours comes across clearly from her in depth knowledge and research of everything Hong Kong. She did her prep work prior to starting her business and if there's anything she doesn't know, she will find out and tell you. There was no a single question i asked her which she didn't know the answer to. Well prepared and equipped, she knows the area, the culture, the food, everything and takes her job seriously towards a WIN WIN experience for both her reputation and your experience. There were times when I was tired and wanted to rest but she was active all through & infact wanted to show me more places that we agreed on if so I could see as much as possible & imagine at no extra cost. Infact, she barely looked at her watch to signal the end of a tour - only in the middle to manage her time and itinerary.What I loved most about her tours is that there was no hidden costs and she clearly came across as a person not doing this for the money (hard to explain until you meet her). She stated a price, we settled it on paypal and that was it. She ensured my costs were minimal by guiding me on local transport, taking me to eat at great joints yet which didn't cost an arm and a leg, paid for her own meals. tickets etc. and infact treated me to my first meal (dinner) in Hong Kong which touched me. Infact, even at the markets when she knew i didn't have change and she did, she insisted on paying for my purchases (as we had bargained and she didn't want the street vendors not returning the difference) and I paid her the lumpsum amount. Seriously, who does that?! She gave me great advice like using what I would pay back home as a base rate for the markets, walking away from insistent vendors, tips on getting around, water, etc.I would recommend taking a longer tour with her as you need to consider travel time to and fro in addition to seeing what you want to, wear comfortable clothing and shoes, and carry water. Anything else you need, Ski will guide you to. She is AMAZING and the most value for money out there with a strong work ethic & I wish her all the very best in her tours.My only wish is that she did Macau tours as well!!!"

Ski Yeo and Big Foot ToursI\u2019d like to say at the outset that ALL the previous reviews about Ski and Big Foot Tours are spot on!!!Originally from Singapore, Ski moved to HK to grow her business and how lucky for the rest of us looking for a guide that is unparalleled in all aspects.My mom and I were travelling to Vietnam and Cambodia early this past October. She thought that I might like to see HK and because we were going to be in that part of the world we might as well stop over for a quick 48 hours. She was given Ski\u2019s name by a friend who lives in Hong Kong, who had highly recommended her. We made arrangements to have Ski accompany us for 4 hours in the afternoon on the first day and then again 4 hours in the morning the second day. She met us at our hotel in Kowloon, and then we were off on the MTR. Ski made sure we stopped to purchase the cash cards for the Metro and bus system so that we did not have to always be bothered with looking for HK dollars and/or change (and by the way she informed us that if we did not use up the entire amount on the card that we could stop at the desk at the airport and they would happily refund our money, which they did no problem in HK dollars.) We had told Ski we were not interested in the usual \u201ctourist traps\u201d but wanted to see any of the markets/restaurants/sights that only the locals would visit and that is exactly where she took us: outdoor food markets, department store and a local restaurant. She was happy to go over the allotted time, and we happily said no thanks as we were exhausted! Second day out, again picked us up from our hotel and this time we headed to the Peak on the Star Ferry. My mom thought it might be nice for us to take the tram up, but Ski advised against this as the queue is about 2 hours long and that would be a waste of our short time with Ski and she was right. Once on HK Island we headed for the #15 bus and took that up to the top\u2026perfect way to see the neighborhoods and just how narrow the roads are with all the great twists and turns as you are looking down on Victoria harbor and real estate below the bus route! Ski suggested a walk on the paved path at the top that affords lovely views again of the harbor and Kowloon. Had a brief stop a the Haagen Dazs shop for an ice cream before we all took the bus back down and she dropped us off at Star Ferry terminal to head back to Kowloon and the end to a lovely 2 days with Ski.Ski speaks perfect English, is very friendly , quite accommodating and thoughtful. She was very concerned about my mom always checking with her as to whether or not she was tired or needed a break..an unexpected change in plans was absolutely fine with her. At the end of our time with Ski she provided us with a very user friendly map of HK, a bag of face masks for Ho Chi Minh city and a fan all of which were much appreciated. My advice is to: book early, by-pass all other local guides and go directly to Big Foot Tours and expect a great time with a truly perfect guide..you will not be disappointed!!"

As I was staying on Hong Kong Island and was seeing much of it with the friend I was visiting, I asked Ski to show me another part of Hong Kong to get a deeper understanding of life there. She decided to show me around Kowloon, north of HK Island, with a very different feel to it. We met at Mong Kok MTR station and did a walking tour around the area for four hours. She asked me if there was anything specific I wanted to visit. I didn't know anything about Kowloon and so she showed me the highlights. We visited the Yuen Po Street Bird Garden, walked through the vast food and flower markets, had my fortune told at Wong Tai Sin Temple and finished up at the famous Ladies Market. I am really pleased I found Ski because otherwise I would have missed out on the other life in Hong Kong, away from the sky scrapers, ex-pat culture and the hundreds of other tourists. If you are happy walking for a few hours whilst finding out more about Hong Kong then I would highly recommend this tour. At the end, if you fancy it, Ski will take you for a well-deserved traditional chinese snack/meal - the only real Chinese food I ate on my visit, I am sad to say!!tourists."

But that is what Hong Kong is all about. Ski guided us to the jade market where my friend bought gifts for her daughter and I found special gifts for family as well. We saw the most beautiful gardens right in the middle of the city. The nunnery was off limits, but that's ok. And to the peak at night for a spectacular view of the city lights.You need good comfy walking shoes, a light rain jacket, and plenty of energy! A camera of course and a sense of humor and adventure. And Ski's email address,"

Before going to Hong Kong, we e-mailed back and forth about what my mom and I wanted see and experience through the tour. She was able to come up with the perfect, personalized itinerary that included our interests in shopping and experiencing Hong Kong culture(ie: getting a close up look on how they handle their live produce at the markets). The tour was well executed and Ski was very thoughtful and asked if we needed a break from all the walking whenever we looked tired. She was also very knowledgeable about Hong Kong and was able to answer all my questions about their history, government system and pop culture. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to her impressions/reactions about Hong Kong culture from her point of view as a Singaporean and contrasting them with my own views as an Korean-American. Overall I had a great time with Ski! She was fun and made the 8 hour tour only seem like 4 hours. I would highly recommend her as a guide!"

Having just 1 day and 1 night in HK en route to NZ, I couldn't have picked a better guide. Ski Yeo provided a tailor-made personalised guide which gave me the best introduction to HK. We spent the first few hours in the evening in the Kowloon markets and snacked our way through the entire walk. The next morning was a visit to Hong Kong Island. Quite a contrast from Kowloon. Walking through the CBD to the old chinatown provided a new-to-old nostalgic contrast. Dim Sim in one of the few remaining push-trolley restaurants was a highlight. All in all, the best first impressions of Hong Kong."

I joined the group walking tour for HK (central area) on a rainy day. So we had a wet start. What I think is really good about Ski was that she tried to gauge what people wanted to get out of the walking tour and try to tailor the program accordingly. She kept on checking that everyone was fine along the way. She managed to keep me interested and also provided me with information about HK that I did not know before. So yes, if you are in HK, I think the walking tour organised by Big Foot Tour is a very good way to spend your time there. I think she does private tours as well."

I think that's the beauty of booking a private tour, you have the freedom to go and try something completely new. The highlight was trying bubble tea, an unusual beverage containing tapioca pearls and the roasted pork - fabulous!Try Big Foot Tours, you won't be disappointed."

We decided to book a tour with a local from a site we found online. We were not sure what to expect but it turned out to be the best thing we did! My husband got sick as we first arrived in Hong Kong so the day of our tour Ski (our FAB tour guide) was flexible enough to reschedule with us until the following day in hopes ofmy hubby feeling better. Regrettably, he was still sick the next day but I got to entertain myself with Ski for the afternoon. It was a 4 hour walking tour (we started at 10:30am) which was perfect since I wanted to try some local cuisine for lunch. Ski picked me up at our hotel and inquired about what my interests were. I was mostly interested in shopping where the young, hip locals shopped and trying some local cuisine. Ski took me to the street markets first where I was able to pick up some unique souvenirs for friends and family and take some cool pictures of the busseling market. Ski is very knowlegable of the history of Hong Kong as well as where to go and what do to based on your likes and dislikes. She was very pleasant, spoke perfect English and was a delight to hang out with. She even took me to a famous (and her favorite) noodle bar to get my hubby a hot cup of noodles for his cold! She was truly awesome and my time in Hong Kong wouldn't have been the same without her! Thank you Ski - looking forward to showing you around Miami when you decide to venture West!"

It's highly tailored to give you a personal insight into the various naunces/intricacies of the cuisine in the different areas of Hong Kong as well as immersing you in the culture at a pace and time that suits you.I would highly recommend this tour to anyone interested in food for it combines not only the food aspect/culture of the area but it takes you to places where the average tourist doesn't go exposing authentic undiscovered gems that will stay with you for a long time."

Witty, interesting, informative and most importantly of all, she managed to keep my parents in their 50s extremely happy for a full 8 hours!! (I'm seriously contemplating learning a tip or 2 from her...) My parents came to visit and I signed them up for an 8 hour tour with Big Foot Tour and thank god i did that. The guide (Ski) was very patient, especially since my parents walk at a slow pace and erm.. not easy to please. I know my dad loves history but my mum would rather spend time shopping (the standard conflict of interest you know) and I wondered if Ski will know how to handle in case they start going into their usual 'loving' banter. Nonetheless, all these doubts were erased immediately when i joined them midway and was greeted by my smiling parents who seemed more impressed with Ski than the skyscrapers in hong kong. A feat definitely and kudos to her.We were shown an interesting side of Hong Kong that i never knew existed even though i had been working here for years. Asked her for really local eateries and she showed me this place that was so near to my office I never knew existed! You will never believe that it is a place for eatery to begin with! Even my local colleagues didn't know about it. She clearly knows her way around Hong Kong. Ok, maybe that's her job, but if so, she does it really well!She certainly has a way with elderly and on top of that, she speaks great English and all of us had no issue communicating with her right from the start. In addition, she was able to maintain an extremely good balance of all our interests (history for my dad, shopping for my mum and food for me!). Am sure if my parents were to write a review for her, it will definitely be more raving than mine.Keep up the good job Ski and a total of 6 thumbs up! P.S. for my parents as well =)"

We visit a old walled village and ate at some rundown-looking place where the food was really good! I had the impression that it was all concrete buildings, all about modern shopping and eating. so it was definitely a sight worth catching and all the walking.  overall, i like the private tour. it was very customized and she was very considerate towards our needs in her planning. I actually asked if she had the time to bring us around the next day, but too bad, she mentioned she was already fully-booked but generously gave me some tips on where to head. i'll find her again if I ever tour Hong Kong again."

To be honest, i have been on other private tours in cities like NY, taiwan etc but none came across as sincere and affable as her. Felt more like a friend leading me around versus the typical tourist kind style. In short: friendly, knowledgable and considerate, even when the weather was really bad (heavy rain).

It poured (the weather gods somehow missed the forecast for the rain to have tapered into tolerable showers) the entire time, but we hardly noticed. Olivia soldiered on and we were more than happy to follow. She walked us down streets in which we were the only tourists in sight, and was warmly greeted by passersby and the shop owners we visited. The clear affection of the vendors and neighbors for Olivia allowed them to greet all of us as though we were simply an extension of her family. We learned things we'd never had learned on our own, visited streets and vendors we'd never have found on our own, and sampled authentic Kowloon-fare we'd have never even have heard of had it not been for this tour and its fabulous guide.

Great stories and authentic experiences you would just never get unless you were with a local. It was an evening well spent and the two guides with full of enthusiasm and knowledge. English was fantastic and we used headsets that projected what the guide was saying into our ear pieces. It meant the guide wasn't yelling at us all the time and we were able wander close to the guide or move away to look at something else that he was explaining. I would recommend this tour to all those that are interested in getting a bit of the history of Hong Kong. :) "

The hustle, the bustle, the trading and the seedy stories. So many HK movies have the gangster scene somewhere in Kowloon; teeming with life, love and lust. I was very pleased that I decided to invest in a tour guide, actually I hate that term, more like a wolf pack leader, Olivia, who fearlessly led a small group of fellow tourists (and two locals!) into, and through, a set of experiences I would never have known about, or had the courage to try without her. More than just the language skills, which are essential, it was clear that Olivia really cared about, and had a deep affinity for her Hong Kong, and her Kowloon (I did the Kowloon Night Tour). From making a gaggle of middle aged women almost cry with my terrible rendition of American Pie, to hearing that the Year of the Monkey was going to be a great one for me from a wizened fortune teller, to the two or three hot steaming bowls of (somewhat scary) Hong Kong delicacies !!! It was a night, and experience that will live on forever, in every single Hong Kong movie I watch from now until I cant keep my eyes open any longer.Bravo Olivia, thank you for making my Hong Kong journey so memorable and special."

Both times I learnt quite a few new things about the city that I live in. Hong Kong is a curious mix of things old, new, Eastern and Western, and Walk In does a great job in putting them together. Will definitely join another tour with them (there are different tours on offer, some aimed at tourists with little or no prior background to Hong Kong, and some focusing on the history of a particular locality - it's good to check the descriptions to know which tour you are signing up for). Advisable to bring a good pair of walking shoes, as quite a bit of walking is involved. (Dora, my guide for both of the trips did a good job in reminding participants what to bring over email)."

It explains the history and architecture of the area as well as the culture of the people who live there. It takes you to places you would never find on your own. One example is the Singing Parlor, a unique form of Hong Kong style karaoke. Great fun! Another example, a street lined with different types of fortuneteller booths. Also, a unique look at the Temple Street Market. All in all, a unique and fun way to spend an evening in Hong Kong."

And so during my search, I stumbled upon Walk in and their unique night tours.Piece of warning: I only recommend these tours to archi lovers, history buffs, and expats who are SERIOUS about learning about Hong Kong's history. The commentary during tours is so in-depth; unlike anything I've ever experienced in the many tours I've joined throughout the years. That being said, Walk in Tours is NOT \"go go go!\" like many other companies, with whom you try to see as much as you can in as little time as possible.So! With that out of the way ;) I took part of the Hungry Ghost Festival and Good Evening Kowloon. They were both extremely unique night tours, with a good mix of expats and locals joining in. The use of mic and headphones is brilliant, so you get to hear what the guide is saying the matter were in the crowd you're at.Kowloon tour was all about the dirty little secrets and gritty background of Hong Kong, which was absolutely fascinating and very unlikely to be a part of! We learned about the history of old buildings and very dangerous neighborhoods; fascinating to see the safe, thriving areas they find themselves in today. We even learned about the local Mafia and how it operated back in the day - quite cool! At the end of the night, we got to eat a very historic restaurant and sample several Chinese dishes. For the Hungry Ghost Festival, I learned even more about Hong Kong's dark past, specifically related to death. From how many immigrants died and the locals had a hard time handling the bodies to rich people having to deal with the \"lost souls\" of bodies which could never be sent back home to mainland China. Yes dark, but fascinating. All this background info really helps you understand the nature of the festival itself, which culminated with the burning of several offerings for said souls. Really, it's a piece of Hong Kong the barely any tourist gets to see.I must admit, I'm not used to such verbose tours. Yet, I learned so much about Hong Kong and its very soul that I could not give Walk In any less than 5 stars. Isn't this the very reason we book tours instead of exploring independently anyway?! Thank you Paul, for the many pieces of Hong Kong you gifted me. You are brilliantly knowledgeable!"

I was particularly impressed by the Chiuchow drama for ghosts- they even have electronic subtitles! The second half of the tour was about Tai Hang, where we had the pleasure to go through the winding streets and learnt about some exciting incidents that happened in Tai Hang.

Last week I joined their Hungry Ghost Festival tour in Causeway Bay. As a local and a half-buddhist, I must say although I am aware of the Yu Lan Festival I never bothered to learn about its traditions, rituals or stories behinds the big sheds that get set up throughout the city during the Lunar month of July. After the tour not only did Paul (the tour guide) answer all my questions he also told me tales I didn't know existed about the area and the festival itself. I can't stress enough how important these walking tours are to a city like Hong Kong where most people are just too focused on making money and forget how interestingly cool their own city is. It is a placed filled with rich cultural traditions and hidden gems. The walking tour totally helped me reignite my love for my hometown. So before you think you are a local and you know everything about the city already, spare some time to join one of the tours organised by this group of passionate HongKong-ers -- I promise you won't regret it!"

As a local, we have long heard of these haunted tales in our neighborhood but we never knew why it happened how it happened.

It was truly a worthwhile evening for my friend and me, even both of us are locals! The tour is not as demanding as other walking tours I had in other countries, as the walk covered just a few streets yet the content was very fruitful. Our guide Paul, who grew up in Yau Ma Tei, is knowledgable and fun. He shared not only the interesting stories and histories of the district, but also his own experience. One most unforgettable spot must be the singing parlour. Time seems to have frozen in the 70s, from the retro decor to the atmosphere. Paul said people either love it or hate it. I am definitely the former.Another thing I like about the tour would be the secret photo spot. I took amazing photos there. I am not going to spoil the fun and post the photo here as I am pretty sure most of my local friends would not know such a hidden gem in our city! I recommend this tour to all of my friends, both locals and foreigners. If you only have a few days in Hong Kong, this tour is not going to be missed!"

Recently, many locals whom have been living here are feeling uneasy as this place and culture are undergoing such drastic change. In order to understand the moment and orient myself better, I have a strong desire to learn about the past and joined this walk in Wanchai, which turned out was very good to serve me this purpose. Thru story shared from a passionate guide, the distant (but still relevant) history unfolded as we wandered in the oldest (but also renewed) parts of the district. We could connect ourselves with the greater part of history here: the beginning of the colony, context and dynamics in the district, juxtaposition of the rapid changes in the distant past and what is happening in the district right now\u2026 I was simply stunned by the myraid of stories, conflicts and tour de forces of places and people in these 175 years (especially when we\u2019re in the midst of another new era of geo-political change). To be frank, during the walk, I was shocked as I myself has personally witnessed the changes: I had taken a similar walk in less than 10 years before, but I\u2019d say its like 30% of the landscape already changed in the district\u2026With the great preparations by Walk-in HK, rich details relevant to our understanding were demostrated and highlighted to let us understanding better. I have a feeling that its like going for a travel to some OTHER countries as I reckon I knew so little about this place before.When I have time, I\u2019ll definitely join more of the walks by Walk-in HK as I kinda feel that I have missed so many stories of this place even though I\u2019ve been living here since I was born."

We were totally surprised by the enthusiasm, the depth of the knowledge and the variety of stories that our guide, Haider, shared with us. Little things like what his 90 year old grand mother called a particular place on Queens Road East, his folder of researched pictures/maps showing the history of the places, and also his own expertise in architecture research added many layers of context as well as just facts. He also shared his personal passion for the people and history of HK - one got the feeling of being shown round by a friend rather than a \"guide\".

The team were super nice and answer any question you wanted to ask. not only that but a few days after the walk, the team also sent me an email with more of my questions answered, which was great. I will be doing more in the future and i will highly recommend these to friends also.Well worth the time and the money."

The walks they organized in both Yau Ma Tei and North Point (1967 Riots walk) in Oct and Nov respectively, were definitely beyond my expectations. The former was led by Paul Chan, who is passionate and knowledgeable. He started the tour by leading us to the Red Brick House, historic theater, fruit market etc, and eventually stopped near temple street. During the journey, he was able to tell lots of juicy stories plus showing us a bunch of old photos and videos, which was really entertaining. As for the 1967 Riots walk, it was guided by both Paul and Professor Ray Yep from City University of HK. Personally, I am not too familiar with the topic, but obviously I felt they had an in-depth study on it and they relived many of the most dramatic moments of summer 1967 at those key sites in North Point along the way. In a nutshell, I guess the walk in Hong Kong tours may not be the cheapest offer in town, but every penny I spent is valuable and I really look forward to joining their other tours in the future!"

Each of the tours was loosely built around a theme fit for the neighbourhood, thereby enabling you to dig deeper behind the stereotypes. With tour guides with genuine passion for their chosen theme and the neighbourhood, you are guaranteed to hear insider stories and be shown hidden gems that you otherwise would have been unlikely to notice. Booking and paying for a tour through their website is easy, the service reliable, and the instructions for meeting up etc clear. The tours suit people with various levels of fitness although the Hong Kong weather and hilly streets and steps can claim their toll!

I have a particular interest in the HK film industry and they took me on a cool walk around sites where famous (and not so famous) films have been shot - really bringing the city to life. Paul and Keith, our guides, were incredibly enthusiastic and really knowledgeable about the city and about film making. Hong Kong has wonderful food and towering skyscrapers, which should definitely be experienced, but these walking tours are a great way to get under the skin of the city!"

I particularly enjoyed hearing about the history of the Red Brick Building and Yau Ma Tei Theatre as I find myself wandering the streets of the city I call home and knowing little of where things are and how they came to be. The fruit market at night was beautifully moody.An interesting mix of sights and stories told by a highly knowledgable and enthusiastic guide. Thank you Paul and Walk in for a fun night!"

If you have a curious exploratory streak in you (or not) then joining the Walk In Hong Kong team on the Urban Myths tour around Wanchai is a must. Our erudite & engaging guide, Haider took us around the vicinity, pointing out either the history , legend or urban myth of a particular spot. From the time of the Portuguese, to the Japanese in WWII to later British colonial rulers, Wanchai is seeped in history. Heavily bombed during the war, the resilient district continues to flourish. We discovered places that we had not known existed, there are temples that now mean more than just a place of worship, walls that are remnants of a different past, the history behind the architecture of certain buildings and how all this has shaped modern Wanchai. Perosnally I believe that you have never fully lived and understood a city, until and unless you have breathed and imbibed its culture and physicality through knowledge, exploration and discovery. And this is what this tour does. Haider our guide is very keen to share his well researched knowledge through careful study and personal experiences. If in doubt, always ask him questions, which he answers to the best of his knowledge.There is more to Hong Kong than just skyscrapers, amazing cuisine and tourist attractions. Scratching the surface is just not enough, one needs to dig deep. Tours are tailor-made to suit individual needs. This tour was not strenuous and all other details on what to wear and what to bring is very clear on the tour company's website.I would highly recommend the tour to locals and visitors."

The guide, Chung Wah, brought us to some lesser visited areas like Kwun Tong, Pok Fu Lam and Kennedy Town. There we attended the annual fire dragon dances during the Mid-Autumn Festival, found interesting vintage shops hidden in abandoned factory buildings (we even visited a collector's storeroom and saw tons of pre-WW2 collections of different types!), and tasted some authentically Hong Kong dim sum and drinks.

It was quite a challenge for an amateur like me as we had only about 10-15 minutes to sketch.

We were shown all the hidden gems Sheung Wan, off the beaten track and told lots of stories as we went along. However they're not just telling you history, but relating the past to what you see today, and focusing on the recurrent social themes that emerge and re-emerge decades later. All our clients were gobsmacked when they were shown what our Sheung Wan office used to look like 100 years ago, and learnt about the relationship between the Bubonic plague and Blake garden in HK. Most importantly, we recieved overwhelmingly positive feedback from our clients saying how much more they know about this neighbourhood, and they also think it was very creative of us to organise an engaging and infromative cultural activity with them. This is a farcry from the usual corporate and sterile cocktail gatherings. Everyone was genuinley interested, engaged in the tour and helped us build even deeper relationships with our clients. It also has good PR effects showing that we care for and promote local heritage. I would recommend them to anyone thinking of corporate awaydays or clients events."

Hong Kong is more than just shopping and eating. It plays a very unique role in modern history. The tours are all well researched and the guide will take you back in time to understand the city's history and culture. They connect the dots from seemingly irrelevant incidents and paint a vivid picture of why Hong Kong becomes what it's like today. Highly recommended if you are visiting Hong Kong."

They were all outstanding. The Yau Ma Tei district is in central Kowloon and visits streets, shops and markets and ended with tea in a strange art deco caf\u00e9. The tour of Tai O was very different: it is at the far end of Lantau Island and takes about 1.5 hours in all to get there but is extremely interesting and worthwhile. A small fishing village with an extensive history. A lot of walking was involved to temples, houses on water and other points of great interest. The group tour was City Scents which takes place in central Hong Kong and visits places with different smells and scents.. Each tour was about 3 - 4 hours (Tai O a bit longer with travelling). We had three different guides and they were all outstanding: really knowledgeable about the places we visited, and also friendly and flexible, so we could also decide what we wanted to do. An interesting feature of each tour was the historical aspect as each guide brought an Ipad with photos of some of the things we saw taken a long time ago, so one could see the changes. The Hong Kong we saw on these tours was completely different from the glass and skyscraper environment of most hotels (which is also a beautiful part of Hong Kong), and so we got a very diverse view of life and society in the place.If you are spending any time in Hong Kong, this is the thing to do. When we visit next, we'll be doing some of their other tours. Really unmissable."

Her childhood stories were already fascinating enough. We visited the open-air markets, the historical housing estates and tried some awesome street food there (It's hygienic, so no worries). The markets were hustling and bustling and we were told that there would be an ocean of shoppers and visitors alike on Sundays. We went on a Saturday afternoon so it was still manageable.

The first tour we went on was around Hong Kong Cemetery and gave a very interesting perspective on a part of the city and its history that I've often wondered about. We go through Happy Valley every day so it was great to get an insight into its origins.More recently we went on the Da Jiu walk in Yuen Long. Even though they had only decided last minute to add this to the schedule, our guide was well informed and kept us all engaged for over 2 and a half hours. The walk through Yuen Long Old Market gave us a glimpse of what HK was like before all the high-rises. Hopefully the government will learn before it's too late that people are really interested in Hong Kong's heritage and start conserving some of the few historically significant areas before it's too late.We'll definitely be signing up for more walks to continue learning about what we already know is a brilliant city!"

Being from Hong Kong, I myself never knew the stories or great families behind our tumultuous colonial heritage. It was certainly a wonderful 3 hours well-spent wandering through Happy Valley in an intimate ~10 person private group, they had a wealth of anecdotes to share for every gravestone, with a rich dossier of photos and reproductions of historical documents and maps to illustrate their every point of interest. For those who like to roam, they thoughtfully prepared wireless earphones so you could listen to live narrative while on-the-move.My tour guides were diverse, passionate individuals who seamlessly cover native-level English, Cantonese and Mandarin. They grew up in Hong Kong, returnees from working as highly educated professionals abroad, and so recognize every nook and crevice, taking you from the most in-the-know cha chaan tengs in tiny neighborhoods to chatting in dialect with the lifelong seafood traders in shophouses. They will certainly provide you with the deepest access to local interactions, with a treasure trove of personal anecdotes on their own family traditions and growing up in Hong Kong across generations, in the way average English-speakers only tours simply cannot offer. Who could possibly know Hong Kong best? I would strongly recommend 'Walk In Hong Kong' for this precise reason; as a discerning traveler, you should never accept any degree of compromise.In terms of length, these tours are perfect for travelers passing through on a stopover or anyone with a free morning or afternoon, as each itinerary is about 3 hours long. This is a true gem - unmissable, for both leisure / business travelers and locals alike.I cannot wait to explore their lovingly curated area and thematic tours selection: 'Death and Life', 'City Scents', 'Old Shops', 'Urban Myths', '1967 Riots', 'Art Galleries', 'Architecture', 'Indie Music', 'Nature'. It's time for me to re-discover my home city and fall in love with Hong Kong all over again."

The walk covered the areas of North Point and Quarry Bay on Hong Kong Island and we visited a number of historical landmarks of this important yet violent chapter of Hong Kong history, which quite a number of local people still think it's a taboo to talk about. The docent is a professor and I was so impressed by his vivid narration and unbiased presentation of facts. The walk was simply like an outdoor lecture. The only drawback was it was so noisy on King's Road and there were certain places we could hardly hear what the docent said. But once we went more uphill to a residential area (the spot where two kids were killed by explosives in 1967) it was quiet enough and we were able to make a quick pit stop to refresh ourselves. Overall it's an inspiring walk and I look forward to joining some other tours in the future."

The guide is a local art enthusiast, who brought us to 5-6 different galleries, showcasing different types of arts. She was patient & enthusiastic in her explanations. She even showed our group some public graffiti art, which most would probably overlook. Definitely time well spent on a Saturday afternoon!"

This tour was not only very interesting to hear about the heritage and cultures of the people of Wan Chai, but also to see some parts of the area we didn't know about previously. It was called Haunted Heritage tour, which is not so much a \"Ghosts\" stories tour, more a potted history of the atrocities committed by the Japanese during their occupation, which was interesting. Taking our 9yr old on the tour, with hind-site, perhaps wasn't the most appropriate thing, obviously the lockheart road area has a certain reputation that it gained from being close to the port with lots of sailors, which is not a subject that is easily or comfortably discussed with such a young innocent boy, but Maria did an excellent job of conveying her message without to much graphic detail.

My tour guide for each of the tours was Maria - a warm and motherly lady who was very helpful and was a walking encyclopedia for interesting facts about Hong Kong.The Hong Kong 101 tour was very informative. Although I had walked past some of the buildings and neighbourhoods we were taken to on the tour before, the experience was much more enjoyable with Maria explaining some of the history and interesting facts about them. Maria also took us on tram and ferry rides. It was my first time on both the tram and ferry and having Maria explain how it worked took the hassle out of figuring it out how it worked by myself.The dessert tour was a wonderful experience. We sampled 10 different desserts and Maria as usual had interesting stories about the desserts and the shops selling the desserts. The selection of desserts was a good balance between the more common desserts i.e. egg tart and less common ones i.e. chiu chow bean soup and yam pudding. My favourite desserts were a mango cheong fun and a bun filled with the runny yolk of a duck egg. The Wanchai tour, as Maria explained was a more a cultural tour rather than an out and out haunted tour. Nevertheless, some of the places she took us to did give me the chills. If you bring a camera, you get can some spooky pictures.The Liuda tours are very good value for money and cater to a wide range of interests - whether you want to sample Hong Kong desserts, get a feel for the area or scare yourself silly.

I lived in Hong Kong during the mid-90s, and finished high school in the city, but my understanding of the territory's history really changed after joining Liuda's tour of North Point.With clarity and insight, our guide Raymond discussed the events of the 1967 riots. It was a solid overview, from the riots' historical roots (migration from China; squalid living conditions; colonial policies; lax labor laws) to the factors that sparked the unrest (global youth movements during the Cold War; the creeping threat of invasion by Beijing; rising Leftist agitation in the schools and factories). From there, Raymond explained how it shifted from a valid labor rights movement to an anarchic terror campaign with a civilian body count.All of this is solidly grounded in location-based storytelling, including visits to the site of a deadly blast and the apartment building that was once ground zero for Maoist organizing circa '67. The walk is suitable for all fitness levels and includes some memorable sights, like the Yik Cheong housing estate in Quarry Bay.My only gripe is a slight mix-up about the meeting point at North Point MTR station. However, this misunderstanding was quickly cleared up, before it could delay the tour. A very satisfying experience overall!"

The price is cheaper than what my hotel concierge has told me. I had almost 3 hours tour while the website said 2.5 hours. we have taken star ferry, tramways, central escalators, and visited statue square, central pier, hk monetary museum, oasis buidling, hollywood road and man man temple. It was a very photogenic tour and i really wish i could have brought my camera with me. Definitely value for money - but maybe a bit tiring after walking for 3 hours. mharder for me because i have other business matters to attend to... if you attend this tour i woudl suggest to have lighter plans for the evening. but again, highly recommend!"

Maria the tour guide was extremely informative and had a lot of stories to tell about the history of the region and we did find the walking tour a very nice way to get to know the history and culture of the city but as walking tours go this one was not exceptional and as haunted tours go this was merely average. In a bit more detail - I am an avid traveller and have a special love for walking tours. I find they are a great way to get to know a city and understand its culture. A haunted tour similarly needs to explore the dark past of a city and Maria did share a lot of stories to that effect, however, she was either having a bad day or dint believe in the stories her narration was informative but not entertaining. The overt use of photographs was distracting from the mystic nature a haunted tour could have. If I could make a suggestion, I'd recommend that Maria or the team attend either the London Grim Reaper tour or Edinburgh Witchery tour if they can to get a perspective on how entertaining such a tour could be.I have no affiliation with any of the mentioned tours and merely suggest them because I enjoyed them."

We covered a lot of ground in 3 hours but it never felt like we were rushing. The itinerary has obviously been well thought out and some of the highlights for me were the ride on the star ferry, the visit to the 55th floor of the IFC building, the ride on the mid-level escalator and the quick stop to buy an egg-tart and some delicious sugar cane juice. Maria was a fantastic guide and had a lot of knowledge and passion for HK, without going into too many facts and figures. She was always making sure myself and the other tour participant were OK, that she wasn't going too quickly, and offered to take pictures for me. Both the starting and finishing locations were within easy reach of MTR stations and there's opportunities to use a bathroom and buy water during the tour."

She is from Mainland China, I think, and she adds a unique perspective on censorship and art on the Mainland side, versus on the more liberal HK side. Art galleries we visited are pretty eclectic too -- from calligraphy art to Chinese avant-garde art to European photography. We could have gone into them ourselves of course, but our guide's firsthand knowledge of both artists and gallery owners really add extra dimensions to our visit."

I have say the speaker was really knowledgeable and skilful, she was able to elevate the historical archive into something interesting and fun to listen! One of the fascinating thing on the way is that, the block we walked through was quite different from the Hong Kong we usually came across: many old-school shops and many local aged people.

I was curious to enter, but didn't feel like I could, not being a regular or even occasional collector of art. So to stumble across this walking tour which demystified the Hong Kong art gallery ecosystem and took me into many of the galleries I had only walked past was a god-send! You get exactly what they describe in the tour information! Tour guide Longyi was an awesome host, sharing her passion and knowledge of modern art and contemporary artists, and providing insight into how the gallery system works in Hong Kong. We visited 6 or so galleries, each featuring different styles of work and artists from around the world. If you're an art lover, would like to step into these galleries without hesitation, and to get a taste of the Hong Kong art scene, then don't go past the Soho Gallery Tour. It's worth it!"

The tour is quite long so perhaps there could have been the occasional opportunity to sit down (especially as my friend has a bad back). The highlights for me were the Star Street area and the red brick house. We booked through Klook.com and it was a really quick and easy process. Thank you again Maria for a great (and alternative) evening."

The pace is good with no rush. We can stop take photos and enjoy paintings when we want to. I like the part about art history. Also find the background stories about how the art dealing world work interesting. The interaction between art lovers, painters, dealers and auction houses are fascinating. We even met one artist today with his paintings which is another bonus point! A good way to explore Soho area off the tourist traps. If you are curious about art then book it!"

The tour last two hours and provides a lt of context and understanding of why certain buildings exist and why certain landmarks or features are where they are.

There is no doubt that this tour can provide the visitors a great chance to learn about the artists, the art galleries, and how the industry works.

Maria was knowledgeable and funny and sometimes tried to draw herself into the characters of her ghost stories, which was definitely fun to watch and enjoy.

Her local know-how and expertise takes you to all the hotspots a tourist might not find on their own. She describes the food with such infectious passion and clearly takes pride in the rich history and traditions that surround every dish we ate, you can't help but get swept up in the culinary journey. From mouthwatering goose, desserts with a Hong Kong twist and even the daringly unique Snake Soup (don't worry, it actually doesn't taste like you'd fear!) there is definitely something for everyone to enjoy. For me personally, seeing the hard working market salesmen and women as they prepare and present their treasures of brightly coloured fruits and bounties of seafood was just as heartwarming as the meals you get to enjoy. Knowing that our visit adds to the longevity of the small business in a tough market ruled by big corporations makes our meals that much sweeter.

This trip was $110 CAD/person which can by a whole lot of honk kong food if you are on your own...as we had dim sum the previous night and it was under $310 HK for 4 people but we understand there is a cost associated with time spent. The other note is that in one of the markets there is a bit of a graphic scene with some of the meat so ppl with week stomachs or vegans may want to be aware. Overall I would still recommend this tour, especially for first timers who want to find some good restaurants to try again during their stay :)"

Not only did we get to taste authentic local food, but we also learned a lot about Hong Kong culture. Jacky really made an effort to share knowledge he has of every place we went to, and stories behind the dishes we were eating. Our co-tourists were also fun to be with. I highly recommend joining an Eating Adventures food tour when visiting Hong Kong. They also offer food tours in China.Thank you to Wai, Jacky, and everyone in Eating Adventures for a wonderful time in HK!"

Pre information was very good, my husband is coeliac and they changed some of the tastings to accommodate the fact that he couldn't eat gluten - sending us a list in advance of the food we'd be having which was very reassuring. We ate loads of food along the way, and visited lots of stalls in an open air market. Out guide Jacky was brilliant, explaining lots of the different foods as well as conversation ranging from politics, lifestyle, sport and cooking. We had a great time and would definitely recommend this to others."

This walking tour was in a relatively confined area and most of the time was spent tasting delicious dishes and learning about the food culture of the Hong Kong Chinese. Our guide Yan was brilliant!

The process of emailing and booking was super quick and easy. The team behind the scenes was really responsive. Christine was our guide for the day she w was really awesome. She has a really global eye for the world and knows and shared a lot about what Hong Kong is like for the people who live there. The tour I took started from Mong Kok The food spots were really interesting the day I went unfortunately the snake soup. shop wasn't open for a holiday. The tour went on and they made up for the lack of the snake soup.It was a fun afternoon. Pretty easy on the walking and it's clear that the guide and the company planned a good outing to expose people to what kinds of things Hong Kong has to offer in a way tha t makes it accessible to foreigner. I definitely reccomend trying to get a tour with these guys if my experience is in any way representative, it will be a good memory."

In addition to the food tastings described on the website, we were given an insight into not just the food of Hong Kong but wider cultural aspects, by our excellent guide Yan. We were warmly greeted at the meeting point (easy to find) by Yan and set off immediately to our first tasting restaurant for crispy goose! Along the way Yan stopped at a number of different shops and stalls, enthusiastically describing the styles of food prepared and sold and also the background of the typical owners and customers. This was repeated as we moved between the eating points including the wet markets and live poultry shops. We were warmly greeted at each stop by the owners and Yan's engagement with them and others along the way created a really authentic atmosphere which extended far beyond the food. As we ate she was happy to discuss broader aspects of Hong Kong/Chinese culture which only added to the experience. We sampled all of the food described on the website which was all freshly prepared with the dim sum, egg tarts and snake soup (yes, really!) all particularly good. That said, there was no obligation to eat anything and a degree of flexibility in the choice. Overall, a great experience with an engaging and knowledgeable guide. Highly recommended!"

Yan was the guide for our group and she was wonderful. She was very knowledgable, friendly, and easy going. You definitely will not leave hungry after this tour- we had everything from soups to roast goose to dim sum to sweets. Every restaurant we went to Yan explained to us why this restaurant was chosen rather than others serving similar items- usually due to traditional cooking techniques or recipes.

The instructions to get there were clear and simple. We then began a true adventure for foodies. First were egg pancakes (actually look like egg carton, but taste terrific!). Then we tried mango/coconut dumplings followed by marinated goose and brisket. The next stops were shanghai dumplings (look like gyoza) and then dim sum. Our last (sixth!) stop was for dessert dumplings, my favorite being sesame seed in a ginger broth. Each of these stops was in local \"restaurants\", nothing fancy, lots of people waiting in line for this great food. Some of the sitting areas were outside, with shared tables with locals. We truly felt like we were in one of Anthony Bourdain's TV program. We visited live markets and heard a lot about the history of the area. Yan, our guide was fantastic. She was vibrant, motivated, and a true native proud of telling us about all that is great about Hong Kong. The tour lasts 3 1/2 hours and you need to bring a good appetite. Highly recommend this.

It was led by Yan, a bubbly and knowledgeable guide. There were 8 of us on the tour. We walked around the nooks and corners of Mong Kok, feasting not only on the food but also on the sights of wet markets and local daily activities surrounding the street vendors and small shops. To whet our taste buds, we had roast goose, egg tarts, Chinese pastry, soya bean curd, fish balls, amazing dim sum; and for adventure -- snake soup. For a Chinese from Singapore ( another food paradise) , I am glad that I enjoyed the tour.

He introduced himself, gave us a bottle of water and off we went. I suppose our first surprise was we were the only 2 on the tour which we felt was a little disappointing as sharing the experience as you go with others is normally good fun. Still, others may be happy with the exclusivity I suppose. I won't go into the detail of what we ate other than to say is a mixture of long established 'restaurants' and street food. Its also true to say that not all of the food was to our taste but surely that's the point of these tours, ie trying stuff which will be alien to your taste buds!

Grace took us around to an exciting part of the city in Kowloon and explained the cultural habits of shopping in the street market to the different varieties of local cuisine.We were able to try many of the local street food and cafe cuisines with the help of a real Hong Konger. This is something that I wouldn't have been able to do on my own.The tour was well organised and we stayed on track of our time of 3 hours. If you like to experiment and try local food, you won't be disappointed."

The tour guide was very knowledgeable and took the group to specialty restaurants such as the famous shop which sold only waffles, michelin starred dim sum and peking duck and roast pork. The tour was extensive and a relaxing way to be guided through the maze of fresh food markets. Highly recommend it. I wouldn't have been able to find these places on my own."

This tour did exactly that, and more! We started the tour off wandering through the vibrant wet markets of Mongkok and learned about traditional Chinese medicine and what all the weird and wonderful ingredients are used for.There were multiple stops throughout the 3.5 hour tour and all were equally as interesting. We got to sample freshly baked Cantonese sweets including egg tarts and deep-fried red bean pastries, slurped down a bowl of congee as well as snake soup! We gobbled up streets snacks, tried a silky smooth bowl of tofu pudding and finished the evening off with amazing Dim Sum!Our local tour guide was great and the tour is definitely value for money. The tour also caters for diet restrictions and you aren't pressured to try anything you're not keen on."

After meeting our hosts we were handed a grab bag of helpful items for a food tour - wet naps, plastic gloves, and plenty of space for leftovers. This was a food tour first for me and a great idea. We sampled several great dishes throughout the day and the hosts were happy to explain and let us try what peaked our interest outside of what was on the stops. Favourites were a shop specializing in goose and getting educated in dim sum.What made the tour really great was the insight behind what makes Hong Kong dishes so great. We toured a couple local markets and even took a ride on the historic Hong Kong Island tram line. All in all a great day. Make sure you come hungry!For more on my day with Eating Adventures including lots of pics see here - http://www.thislifeintrips.com/hong-kong-eating-adventures-review/"

We booked the tour online just the day before and booking was handled quickly and efficiently. My husband and I were the only ones on the tour which was a bonus as that gave us the opportunity to ask lots of questions about things we were interested in. The guides were happy to answer all our questions and to give us a picture of some of the aspects of their lives in Hong Kong. We liked finding foods in the markets that were a little unusual. The foods tasted were generally delicious and our favourites were the Lo Soi Goose and the prawn dumplings."

            "review": "Great for those who want to eat like a local. We did the 4 hour food tour at the end of last month. Our guide was very informative about the local foods in the market - things we had never seen before. There were 6 or 7 'food stops' on the agenda, where we were given food to sample. Some things we were familiar with (dim sum) but others had never tasted (tofu dessert). We had eaten before we left which was a bit of a mistake - as we just weren't hungry- and just couldn't eat much. We were more interested in learning about the local foods than eating anyway. Our guide wasn't a Chef but did know her stuff about the local foods. It poured with rain the whole time which was a bit of a drag - but we still carried on. I think the guide would have happily cut it short but we wanted to see all the food stops on the agenda. It was great to be able to tall to a local about all sorts of things - not necessarily food related - while we were wandering along. We are serious foodies and operate our own food tours in New Zealand, so we are quite harsh critics - so I did think it was quite expensive compared to our NZ tours, for what you get. However we were still pleased we did the tour, and did learn a lot. It was easy communicating with the organiser and efficiently organised. We did 4 food tours in China and this ranked second. Would recommend it."

I set up a 8 hour tour and I got quick detailed response from Mandy. I confirmed the appointment the day before and we agreed on meeting at our hotel. Since we were staying in the Mongkok district our adventure started the moment we stepped out our door. Mandy was quickly began taking us to the open markets that are in Mongkok. We were in the hustle and bustle of the markets seeing the everyday life of the people of Hong Kong. It was fascinating seeing all the new and exotic foods that we don't see in the States. Mandy was excellent in answering all our questions. Our next destination was the Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple. Mandy wanted us to use the subway and explained the benefits of the Octopus card. Once we arrived at the Temple, she was very knowledgable on the history and importance of it. Next we hopped on a bus (using the Octopus card) and headed to Tai Po district. Here we saw the beauty of Hong Kong. The vast green parks and bodies of water the surround Hong Kong. Here we ate at a local restaurant that specialized in wonton soup. This place was delicious and the staff was very nice. Next we went to a quiet fishing village in Tai po that was so calming and interesting. She would talk to the locals and they allowed to visit for a while as she would translate our conversation. Next we got on a boat ride that took us to the fish farms and witnessed what many local do on their down time. They were hanging out fishing and having a good time. There are many photo opportunities throughout the entire trip. Finally, as the day was winding down, we headed to an indoor food market. There we began looking for what we wanted to eat for dinner. I chose a fresh grouper and then took it to one of the many kitchens on the top floor and they prepared it to my liking. The experience of eating the freshest food and seeing families eating and having a great time was awesome. I highly recommend booking a trip with Mandy, it was the highlight of our trip."

The time was well planned, and we managed to have drinks and food along the way. Her explanations at the Wang Tai Sin temple were much appreciated, and the lunch at a local 'cafe' was the one of our favourite meals. At no time did we feel rushed, and we were amazed at how much we covered.In addition to the tour Mandy had planned for us, she provided us with a whole host of information about Hong Kong's history, places to eat for the rest of our stay and recommended attractions to visit. She emailed directions and suggestions for additional visits once the tour had ended. Mandy gave us the confidence to try dim sum with the locals which was one of our highlights.I would recommend a tour with Mandy at the beginning of your visit, as it will enhance and add to the remainder of your stay.Thank you so much."

I emphasized that I would prefer to visit a neighborhood of Hong Kong rather see a lot of things.Mandy met me at my hotel at 8:30 and she brought me to a neighborhood restaurant for a typical Hong Kong breakfast of eggs, macaroni and ham soup, and a piece of French toast. I would never have know to venture into a place like this on my own, nor would I have understood the history of why they exist.Since I am an adventurous eater she brought me to a snake restaurant where I had snake soup and a green wine made from snake bile. Again, this is a place I would never have found on my own.Mandy is intelligent, charming, and vibrant. I never felt that I was on a tour. I felt that I was seeing Hong Kong with a friend who loved her city and was excited to share it with me. She even gave me recommendations of where to eat in the evening and other sites that I should visit before leaving Hong Kong.I cannot recommend this tour too highly.

There were very few tourists and it was extremely beautiful and the gardens were an oasis of serenity which is a great short term escape from the hustle of most of Hong Kong. Apple was a perfect tour guide for us. She is a lovely, warm person with a sharp mind and fun sense of humor. She anticipated what we needed in terms of depth of information, transport and even when we needed to stop for a break. She is engaging, knowledgeable and is happy to share her views on the city and culture. We learned so much more travelling with Apple than we would have on our own or in a large group tour. It also was fantastic to have Apple order lunch items at a restaurant where there wasn't another Westerner in sight. Everything she selected was delicious - our best meal in Hong Kong and easily the lowest cost. Apple also provided recommendations for the rest of our trip, including ideas for Macau. We loved our day with Apple and recommend this company for anyone who is looking for a customized tour experience. They will make the tour fit what you want and will travel at a pace that suits you. I have had some health issues and Apple took this into account in her planning and on the day of the tour. She genuinely cared about my special requirements and was very considerate and patient. If you want a high energy tour, I'm sure you'll get it. If you want a more moderate pace as we did, they will deliver that. Their goal is for the customer to be happy and with Apple, it showed during every minute of the tour. We highly recommend Hong Kong Getaway Private Tours and will go on another tour with them when next in Hong Kong."

We are accomplished travelers of the world and this was our first time in Hong Kong. We booked Mandy for 5 hours on our first day. She previously had asked questions to determine what kinds of things interested us and catered the tour accordingly. The day we chose was unusually foggy, so she adjusted some plans as to not waste our time looking for views (and mapped out our remaining days to include them after the weather cleared up!) and as the day went on she asked questions and asked our opinions on each thing we saw to even further personalize our experience.I can not stress enough how starting your vacation with a tour from her will help you out. We missed nothing and saw things we didn't even plan on or imagine possible in 3 days. She sends out not only a recap of your time with her, but her personal guides and tips for many other attractions both big and popular and little known. From things like seeing how public housing life is for locals, to first class Michelin Star restaurants. Small dumpling and noodle houses to local craft beer. How to do Lantau Island in 6 hours including all the sights, to finding chilled pig intestine and snake bile wine.One of the best things was learning the MTR train system right away. we were so comfortable with it that we didn't take cabs and saved a ton!Thank you, Mandy.

I can't wait for my next visit so I can check out Sai Kung and Lantau Island to see the Big Buddha if I've got time. When I have that opportunity, you already know who I will call to help me learn a little bit more about this beautiful and mysterious city-state. Apple was so thoughtful and ran over time by almost 1 1/2 hours.. AND on top of that, she helped me find a calligrapher to get my parents a beautiful, original gift for their 30th anniversary. When she was leading my young daughter Marilyn and I around the city, she was so good with her and Mar can be very fussy, especially after a long day. She held her hand on the MTR (aka Hong Kong's subway) and even carried her up the stairs when we were leaving the metro system. Apple was so knowledgeable about her city and was able to answer every question we had except when my daughter was extra stubborn about getting the exact number of gallons of water in the Victoria Harbor as we were riding on the Star Ferry from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island. Around dinner time, we went to a wet market where Apple had found a small, authentic restaurant where she ordered us the perfect meal. Even after just a few hours, it felt like Apple was someone my daughter and I had known for a number of years and truly cared about how we experienced Hong Kong. If I had to grade her on a scale of 1 to 10, she gets a 12!

I had 90 hours in country and knew to get the most out of my time, a private tour operator would be the most beneficial. Mandy went above and beyond all expectations, I cannot thank her enough for the hospitality, follow-up emails (recommending best route to Tian Tan Buddha) and knowledge she shared with me. I booked an 8 hour private tour with Mandy on day 1 of my visit to HKG. From the initial email, the tour was tailored around what was important to me; seeing one or two tourist attractions from the local perspective, and getting off the beaten path. I sent Mandy my \"wish list\" of places to visit, and in about three days and half a dozen email exchanges she had put me at ease that I would see the essential HKG as I asked. Mandy was flexible on meeting at my hotel lobby, and immediately I felt at ease as she asked how my travel day was, where I was from and what type of activities I enjoyed on vacation. Did I mention she's a former flight attendant and her sister currently is for a major Asian carrier? She knows how to break the ice (especially if a solo traveler), and talking with her is like meeting an old friend.I won't list every detail of our tour, but the highlights for me included the hike along Lugard Road Morning Trail (great photo opportunities of HKG and the harbor), local wonton lunch with her and Apple (her sister), tea and mooncake while visiting their home (incredibly generous offer), hiring Mrs Cheng's fishing boat and Tai Po's wet market....and yes, chicken feet. MTR, tram, ding-ding, bus, and boat, we covered a lot of ground and none of it would have been possible on my own. Visiting her home and seeing how Hong Kongers live, truly something I will never forget. Trust in Mandy's plan of action when you tell her your style of traveling, she will make it happen without hesitation.Highly recommend you carry small bills while traveling during tour to pay for misc. items such as cab fares and hiring Mrs Cheng. Mandy helped me find legitimate / functional chopsticks at a local market stall, not the tourist version. We ran over in time w/ transit back to the hotel, and Mandy kept a smile and her friendly demeanor throughout. She encouraged me to text w/ family because of the time difference during the tour, and she was willing to discuss anything and everything about HKG culture.You will not regret booking a tour with Mandy and Apple.

Apple was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, thoughtful, and professional in her tour. She will tailor the tour basically to any of your requirements. She is capable of doing food, culture, and tourist attractions. I asked for help with the MTR, getting a SIM card, and some sightseeing around the city. Apple was absolutely perfect and helped me so much. I saved a great deal of time with help with the MTR and the SIM card, and I am extremely grateful for doing that. What took Apple about 15 minutes would have taken me hours. Therefore the savings and time was well worth it. She also took us to a small restaurant which I never would have been able to even order from, and we had a really excellent snack. I have done tours all over the world, and this was one of my all-time favorites. Bravo, Apple."

We booked three days of tours and went to Hong Kong island, Kowloon, and Lan tau Island. Mandy and Apple were our tour guides - they were excellent and we couldn't be more pleased. They are knowledgeable, flexible, reliable, nice and just so much fun to be with. We could not have seen or learned sooooo much about Hong Kong without them - we had such a great and memorable time. The next time we are in Hong Kong, we will definitely contact them again. Thanks to Mandy and Apple we had a great first experience in Hong Kong. We look forward to another trip there to try more of their suggested restaurants."

My husband and I have been to HK a few times in the past, but this is the first time we took a local guided tour, with my American foster parents who were visiting Asia. The half day tour was a refreshing experience! Mandy took us to see the other side of HK-- the old public housing of locals, the gardens, the religions and temples--- sights and experiences which we would never had walking around the malls and Hong Kong's highly commercialized tourist spots. We absolutely loved it! The tour was customized to our requirements and pace, the guide was highly insightful re: Hong Kong life (being a local herself) and personal (not to mention, personable). I highly highly recommend this tour for individuals and small groups who want to see Hongkong from the lens of a local."

This time we wanted to visit areas of Hong Kong that most tourists never see. Mandy suggested her Tai Po tour.About an hour after we reached Tai Po the heavy rains began. Mandy adjusted and suggested that we visit a local home. We spent the next hour having tea with the residents of the home and thoroughly enjoying ourselves. Then on to the wet market for both visual and eating experiences that were new to us. After touring the Tai Po area on foot we made our way back to Central by bus with Mandy giving us detailed instructions on how to use public transportation.That evening We received 5 emails from Mandy suggesting other activities that she thought we might enjoy, along with detailed instructions on how to access each activity by public transportation, what to see/do and what to skip.In our opinion, best guide ever."

We had a nice tour seeing a temple set in a wonderful Chinese garden \"Nan Lian garden\". Then we went to see Hk skylines and in our way we saw some iconic buildings and hotels.We took a ferry to reach HK island. The weather wasn't perfect to go to Victoria peak. So we had another good and free alternative to view Hk. By that time we were hungry, so she took us to a good vegetarian restaurant. Then we ended the tour by visiting a local market which the kids enjoyed a lot.At the end of the tour, Mandy promised to send \"pocket guide\" emails about different places and she did.In brief, it was a nice tour with an expert local guide who has a good since of humor and cares about her client.Thanks Mandy :)"

But the only way to have the experience is booking a half or full day with HK getaway tours. I spent two days with Mandy and wish I could have had two more. Our first day we spent on every mode of transportation HK has to offer to see everything from the peak to the local city wet market and everything in between. I had traveled alone three days before my partner to acclimate to the time change and experience HK myself. Mandy provided a tour that made me fall in love with this incredibly fast paced modern city. I learned about the banking system, architecture, history and culture from Mandy's comprehensive knowledge and passion. I became quickly comfortable with the layout of the city. The second day we spent doing her hidden tour - leaving central and feeling like I literally became part of her family. We visited a local floating village and other outskirts of Hong Kong sights. I could not have asked for anything better. My third day on my own was incredibly fulfilling as well, because Mandy emailed me a comprehensive way to see other sights we had not yet visited. She goes truly above and beyond everything any other guide I've ever hired. I fell in love with Hong Kong. I usually and realistically think I won't return to many of the places I travel to due to the endless places to visit, but Mandy made me look forward to visiting HK again soon! You may find the tour costly, but it's worth every penny. Thank you!!!"

Yes, my hubby has already reviewed this tour (AZTOAD) and he summed it up rather nicely but I have my own stuff to add. Now my husband goes to Hong Kong often for business but this was the first time our 8 year old daughter and I got to join him. Now we wanted a cultural experience for her in Hong Kong, not just shopping, so my husband found The Hong Kong Getaway and I am so happy he did! We took our tour on the first full day of our 17 day trip to Asia and met Mandy in Tai Po we took a brief walk and she showed us how and where people actually live, the process in getting a home and the insanely expensive cost of living. We then went to Sam Mun Tsai Fish Village, which was beautifully simple and rustic. We were warmly welcomed by the locals and we had their version of french toast and lemon tea... my daughter is now addicted to lemon tea and its a staple in our home. We took a brief tour on a fishing boat and then I had a very bad fall, to be honest if it wasn't for Mandy saving me this could have been a trip ending fall. I don't remember much of it but do recall Mandy springing into action to provide medical attention and a new pair of shorts(yes, I ruined my super cute outfit). She was very calm at a moment when my daughter and husband were very upset, there is nothing scarier than being really hurt in a country you don't know, she made everything better! We continued our tour with a bike ride, a wet market, a street market, and an amazing late lunch. Now, for me being a mom the best part of this tour was how Mandy interacted with my daughter. I am very used to keeping my daughter engaged, and helping her understand whatever tour we are on. Emma is 8, and very curious, and Mandy answered all of her questions and kept her engaged and interested in what was going on. Mandy even tried with all of her might to get Emma to eat shrimp, sorry Mandy, she still won't eat them! LOL I know this is the longest review I have ever written and there is still so much more I could write about how wonderful she is! In my opinion, don't plan your own tour itinerary, in your email let her know your interests and let her plan it for you. Thats what we did and we are so happy we did! So thank you Mandy for being a good person, great with first aid and wonderful with children. Emma already wants to take another tour, and next time I will be wearing anti-slip shoes!"

No money was needed to hold the reservation, just a virtual handshake. From that moment, I knew this would be different. Our group included my wife and 8 year old daughter. It was their first ever trip to Asia and i wanted it to be special. After some correspondence we decided on Mandy's Tai Po secret tour. I wanted to see how people really lived in Hong Kong, not just the area around the harbour. I put my complete trust in Mandy and was really rewarded.I was able to meet her at the mtr station to maximize our time in the new territories.We started out by going to the building she grew up in. She explained the process for buying a home, showed the size, gave some examples of how the community functions, and took us to the top floor. After, we stopped by her favorite wonton shop below for a great snack which cost about 3 USD for all of us to share.We then went to a fishing village where she showed us a fading lifestyle of local fisherman which is strong with community relationships. Mandy has a great way with people and will often approach them to have them show what they are doing. Again a stop for a snack of local favorites, French toast and lemon tea. We left with lemon tea now being standard fare in our home. We then had a local fisherman give us a tour of the fishing bay and even their boat house. There was a small extra cost but well worth it. Getting off was a bit of an adventure as my wife slipped and hurt her knee and foot. Mandy revealed that she had been a flight attendant and jumped into action getting bandages and even buying her new shorts from a local vendor.We carried on renting a 4 person bike which Mandy helped me peddle across a dam with my wife and daughter as passengers in the back. She talked about the history of the dam that was used to create a freshwater lake where there had been salt water before.We then took a cool little 16 passenger bus to a local market where they had levels of sea food, meat, vegetables, and restaurant where you could have them cook sea food from the first floor. we stopped for a final quick taste of duck, goose, and a beer.Mandy followed up with some great detailed ideas for our next day. I really felt like she was still with us.I really respect Mandy and her sister Apple for taking the leap and starting their own business. While we had a great time with Mandy on a personal level, it's clear they take this very seriously with excellent communication and creating an adventure outside of any tour book or site.The photos show some of the spirit Mandy has. When we wanted to take our monster face photo, she didn't hesitate and jumped right in. My daughter asks if we will see her again. I hope we do.Two tips. 1. Do it on your first day. The info you get will help you tremendously in your days after.2. Book early. I was lucky that i did it two weeks ahead, but she refused 5 others after my booking for the same day."

We were given a fantastic tour of \"old\" Hong Kong. Got to dine in a traditional Chinese tea house and saw a great street market where my daughter actually tried durian. That alone was worth the price of admission. Apple was very accommodating. Made stops for water and washrooms. When it got to be too hot, we found an air conditioned mall in which to cool down. Cannot recommend this tour enough. Only regret is that I booked it so late that we didn't have the tour earlier. If you're going to be in Hong Kong, this is most definitely worthwhile.

When Apple heard we were visiting the city for the first time she changed plans and took us on a city tour starting with the metro and the Peak... a lot more in between finishing off at the Wet markets and a secret elevator tour. Our teenagers really loved these special places. We also had a classic HK dim sum lunch in between. 6 hours went by really quickly and we continued after that on our own according to Apple's advice with the Star Ferry to the Kowloon side where we found some serious shopping.Apple was really good at steering us forward in a good pace and it was a very good decision to do the city tour! I would like to warmly recommend Apple and Mandy for any visitors to Hong Kong."

When no one showed up at our designated meeting time, I called Mandy who thought we had cancelled our tour. Turns out someone with a similar name called the day before to cancel their tour and she cancelled our tour instead. Mandy was extremely apologetic and told us she would make time for us later in the day and give us a complimentary tour. Mistakes happen but it is how you handle them is what makes your business and this could not have been handled more professionally by Mandy. We ventured out on our own that day and then met Mandy late afternoon back at our hotel.She gave us a wonderful several hour tour of the Kowloon, Mongok area including the many markets in this area. It would have been a challenge to find the markets on our own. Mandy has a great personality and knowledge of her city. To end our tour, she took extra time and brought us to the Eyebar and was able to secure an outside table with amazing views of the harbor. We enjoyed a drink with Mandy and then stayed longer on our own to watch the Symphony of Lights from this great vantage point.Mandy even followed up with several emails with instructions for other sight seeing we had talked to her about during the tour. I would not hesitate to recommend Mandy. Thank you for a wonderful tour and handling our situation with such professionalism and excellent customer service."

With just one day to check out the city, we asked if Mandy would be able to arrange an extensive tour to hit the highlights. We decided on a six hour tour, given we were going to a nice restaurant for dinner, and wanted time to go back to our hotel to prepare. Mandy was incredibly accommodating, showing up early in the morning, to begin a great day of touring. Unfortunately, the day started off cloudy, so we began with some indoor sightseeing, and historical and cultural landmarks. She offered personal insight and background information throughout the day, and certainly was able to point out all the best local street food! Given our unusual request to see as much as possible, she was incredibly flexible as as well as knowledgeable even for those spots that she doesn't traditionally stop at on her tours. Luckily the sky opened up and we were able to stop by at a local beach and she directed us on how to get to Victoria peak. My husband and I both agreed that taking the tour was a wonderful addition to our honeymoon, and we would do it again in a heart beat!

This proved to be a great decision.Mandy was able to have an opening on the day we wanted to tour, so we looked forward to a pleasant time, but the weather didn't want to cooperate. Mandy arrived right on time just as the skies opened up and huge amounts of rain came down. We discussed our options, however at the time the outdoors looked miserable. We waited araound awhile, things didn't get better. She was very understanding and we decided to cancel for the day, without complaint or charges. We all were disappointed with the weather as she headed home. On the way back she stopped and emailed some options for us to do on our own or possibly another day.An hour or more later the rain lightened, then started again to taunt us about our lost opportunity. But all was not lost. I emailed Mandy about rescheduling and found out she had stopped for lunch and was not so far away. The rain now seemed to be ending. Great, we decided to resume our plans for the same day.We had a somewhat shortened tour, but never less Mandy guided us to some wonderful sights and experiences. The skies cleared, the sun shone, and Mandy took care of us in her special, talented way.

After exchanging some emails with Mandy about what I'd like to see and my goals for the tour, we met at my hotel in Causeway Bay, had some coffee and discussed our day. We had to adjust a little bit due to the weather, which was too cloudy for Victoria Peak unfortunately (the clouds were so low that we would not have been able to see anything from the peak). Nevertheless, Mandy had the day planned seamlessly and we ventured out. We started with some street food a short bus ride to nearby markets and shopping as well as exploring the area in general. We went to observation levels at a couple of buildings with incredible views of Hong Kong, we had a great lunch at one of her favorite local restaurants. We took the Star Ferry across the bay to Kowloon and went to Avenue of the Stars and the Bruce Lee statue. She familiarized me with the MTR, which couldn't be easier to navigate. In fact, getting to know public transport was actually one of my major goals. I booked my tour with Mandy early on in my visit and I wanted to be able to hit the ground running on subsequent days. Nan Lian Garden and Chi Lin Nunnery were beautiful and Mandy was sweet, kind, professional, knowledgeable, with great insight and a pleasant nature. I was a bit jet-lagged near the end of the tour, but Mandy kept us going and was patient with me as my energy was waning. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Mandy and she met all of my goals and expectations. We ended the day at Eye Bar, which is a rooftop bar in Kowloon and had a couple of drinks with an incredible view of Hong Kong island. I left my day in her hands and she was wonderful. I even took her recommendation and tried the Mango Mama :) After our time together, I felt very comfortable venturing out on my own for the remainder of my stay in Hong Kong and ended up checking off my complete list of sites, areas, restaurants, etc. In addition, Mandy's pocket guides for Soho, LKF and The Big Buddha served me well and saved me time! I can truly say that I loved my trip to Hong Kong! Thanks Mandy!"

As part of our 7night stay in HK we booked commercial tours to see major tourist sites over the first 4 days. When we asked members of our hotel staff if they knew of any private tours operating it was suggested we look at the Hong Kong Getaway site. WOW 5 Star rating. The response from Apple to our email enquiries was swift and informative. As fit mature aged retirees, we were looking for a 'less touristy' tour of approximately 4hours that included the walking required to view some older areas, partake in dining at a street eatery and walking through a night market.Apple's personality, passion and knowledge of her Hong Kong and delight that we wanted to see non touristy things just added to our sense of doing something special and we really appreciated her company.So, we visited one of the early public housing estates, walking around with Apple explaining the history of the 60yo estate was very interesting and enlightened us on a part of Hong Kong we had no knowledge. There was nothing awkward or confronting about walking through, maybe a little bit sad, so if anyone wants to see some 'old' to compare with the new, include an 'old' walk in your tour request.Having Apple guiding us on and off the MTR was great. We just enjoyed going with the flow and followed Apple's directions. With my wife and Apple arm in arm, it felt like we were being shown around by one of our daughters.Visiting the local dry and wet markets in Sham Shui Po was a bit of an eye opener but it was great to see different critters.Apple's choice for our local alfresco dinner was excellent. The chatter and vibes from those already dining was great to be a part of, the owner was a bit of a character and the menu was huge. Based on our wishes, Apple's choices from the menu were way better than we would have chosen and obviously we loved it. The crispy deep fried pigeon was a ....what the....oh wow how good is that....kind of dish. :)Walking from the original local Temple St through the packed throng, bright lights and market stalls tourist part of the night markets was a fun way to finish our night out. We felt sad saying goodbye to Apple back at our hotel, we had thoroughly enjoyed the whole evening and it was obvious Apple had too. So relaxed was she walking with us, that our 4hour tour ended up being 4.45hours.For anyone like us who is looking to experience Hong Kong a bit differently, we recommend checking with Apple and Mandy because we are confident they will program a tour to suit your wishes.Thank you Apple, you really were great company.Kind Regards,Colin & Gloria M."

We had a limited window of time in Hong Kong - 3 days - and we wanted to make sure we saw EVERYTHING! Booking a tour with Mandy was the best idea because she could guide us on our tour without us having to figure out how to get to the places, or getting lost and wasting our time. Mandy showed up at our hotel in the morning and we proceeded to explore the sites. She took into consideration our input as to what we were interested in and catered the tour to our specifications. Our first stop was at the MTR to get an Octopus card. Hong Kong has one of the best public transportation systems in the world and it is extremely affordable. Once we had our Octopus card we were able to go to all the sites by train and walking. Unfortunately for us, it rained the whole time the 3 days we were in Hong Kong so there were certain sites that we couldn't go to like Victoria's Peak. The great thing about Mandy was that she knew an alternative place that we could go and see the same great view as the Peak. She also took pictures of us and with us plus took us to a great restaurant for lunch. She had great insight as to what areas to stay away from, where to go shopping, and followed up by email on suggestions for the rest of our stay. On a rainy day we went to: Nan Lian Garden, Chi Lin Nunnery, Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple, Mid-Levels escalator and walkway system, Victoria Harbour and Central Plaza 46th floor for the view. After Hong Kong we took private tours in Chiang Mai and Beijing and I can positively say that Mandy and Hong Kong Getaway Tour was above and beyond the best experience we had during our trip!"

The ability to dial down a full city tour to a few hours, walking, is as advertised quite a getaway! I wanted an overview of current and historical Hong Kong, a view into the dynamics between East/West, China/Taiwan/USA; a peek into daily life of Hong Kongers. I researched tours and narrowed to a few. Mandy responded quickly to my inquiry.I hesitated slightly when Mandy suggested a 6 hour tour but the many positive reviews convinced me. I was delighted to find the time was filled with fun crowds, city-life, night markets, beautiful scenery, tasty food and some light exercise. Particularly interesting were our discussions around the public housing estates and a fun hike up the Garden Hill in Kowloon. I will always remember the views overlooking the city and harbor as the sun set and light switched from day to night. Our day:- Star Ferry Across the Victoria Harbour- MTR to Shek Kip Mei- Visit one of the oldest public housing estate, light hike up the Garden Hill- Visit the Sham Shui Po Street Market- Mtr to Yau Ma Tei, and dinner in the Temple Street night marketA useful benefit was learning to use the Octopus card and the MTR. I believe this is one of the world's best transit systems, I used it instead of taxis for the rest of this stay and on my return a week later.Ka Yan (Mandy's sister) was a wonderful host and guide. Enthusiastic about her home city, she was open to any question on any topic. I stumped her on only one question, \"who was the architect for the beautiful bridges (Ting-Kau and Stonecutters)?\" In thoughtful host fashion, Ka Yan made sure I was enjoying the pace, the sights and was well fed and watered. A very satisfying day, I highly recommend The Hong Kong Getaway!"

There were four of us in our party, and as two of us already had a little experience of Hong Kong we asked our guide, Mandy, to take us on a four hour tour in Kowloon to some places outside the \u201ctop-ten\u201d.She met us at our hotel in Causeway Bay and we started our tour with her by taking a bus across to Diamond Hill in Kowloon. During the journey, she chatted to us about our interests, and gave us an introduction to what we were going to see. The first place she took us to at Diamond Hill was the Chin Lin Nunnery, which is a Buddhist Temple, and the Nan Lian Garden. The peace and tranquillity here was a most welcome contrast to the bustle around Causeway Bay. At all times, Mandy was giving us just the right amount of interesting information about what we were seeing; enough, but leaving us time to take it all in.After Chin Lin and Nan Lian, we upped the tempo a bit by taking the MTR to the Wong Tai Sing Temple, whose claim is \u201cto make every wish come true upon request\u201d. This Temple is home to three religions (Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism), enabling many people to express their wishes, Again Mandy\u2019s explanations were most interesting and amusing, especially concerning the methods by which people were expressing their various wishes, sometimes in what seemed a quite earnest manner.After this, Mandy checked with us what we would like to see next and we chose the Flower Market and adjacent Bird Garden, which are located near Prince Edward. These were both very interesting and enjoyable to see, and illustrated different aspects of life in Hong Kong.And the end of our tour, Mandy led us back to our hotel in Causeway Bay, giving useful travel tips (especially about the MTR) and suggestions of places we might like to go for the remainder of our holiday.In summary, we had a most enjoyable tour given by an excellent guide.

She took me to parts of Hong Kong that few outsiders ever see. It was like going backstage at the theater. Mandy took me to a fascinating and very busy Taoist temple and a very serene Buddhist garden and nunnery. She was able to explain some of the beliefs and practices of those faiths in a way that made the experience much more meaningful. She took me to visit some public housing estates so that I could see where and how very many Hong Kong residents live. We also went to some awesome local markets. She took me to eat in some English-free local food venues that I would have been too intimidated to visit on my own. It was so great to let her order for me and eat some very unique local food. After the tour she sent me an email with some suggestions on what I might want to do with my remaining time in the city. They were very good suggestions. It's obvious that Mandy loves her job and her city. She was very informative and kind. And she was also just a lot of fun to spend a day with. If I get a chance, I'll tour with Mandy again. "

Along with some of the more known tourist attractions, Kayan exposed me to a side of Hong Kong that I would have never ventured to on my own.Outside of the sites, there was never a sense that Kayan was my tour guide and I was a tourist. She was very personable and the conversation throughout the day felt as if we were old friends. She is a very intelligent and articulate young lady whom clearly has a passion for what she does and a deep love and knowledge of Hong Kong.I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting Hong Kong and I will definitely tour with Kayan when I return."

She is extremely knowledgeable about the history of the city where she grew up as well as current events. Her attentiveness to ensuring the 6 hour tour was what I wanted to see and do was noticeable and appreciated throughout the whole day. Highlights included a walkway on Victoria's Peak without the crush of tourists, a walk through the Central district with descriptions of the buildings and what they each mean, a stop at a historical Christian church, a delicious dim sum lunch where I was the only foreigner in the bustling restaurant, a Taoist temple and park visit, a walk through a flower market followed by a bird market, visits to numerous street markets and wet markets to see how locals shop and eat, a quick stop at a local bakery to taste local pastries, and general guidance and information throughout the whole day as we rode the train to various sections of the city. I highly recommend this tour and hope that you get to experience the joy and warmth of Mandy as she introduces you to the wonders of Hong Kong. You will not regret this experience!"

We gave her the most minimal information ahead of time and Mandy put together a full itinerary. The best thing about the day though was that after about an hour we were totally changing what we were going to see based on the conversation we were having. We ended up way off the beaten path seeing parts of Hong Kong we never thought we'd see but it was fascinating. Mandy knew exactly where to go and was knowledgeable enough about most everything Hong Kong related to explain in detail the way people were living. It was truly an eye opening experience and one of the highlights of our trip.As an aside if you go with Mandy (and I highly recommend you do) have her drop you at Mr Wong's restaurant after the tour. What a treat! You serve yourself beer (all you can drink) and as far as we can tell food just keeps arriving at the table......all for 60HKD per person. The food is great and the value is second to none. Thanks to Mandy for an excellent tour."

Having never been to Hong Kong we were not exactly sure what we wanted to see and do, but Mandy assured us our tour would be flexible and personalized to our needs. How true this was. We were blown away.It was amazing how much we covered and learned in our 6 hour tour. All of our senses were excited. We saw, tasted, touched, smelled, and heard things that were special, gratifying, unique and thought provoking. Even our imagination was revved up. The tour also left us with great confidence and new skills to better understand the Hong Kong landscape and be able to use local transportation to continue our visit there. Of course we did feel somewhat lost without the guidance we received during the tour and that made us again realize how special this tour service is.Mostly we imagine being able to return to Hong Kong and tour and fun times in other areas with The Hong Kong Getaway. The name is so appropriate as we were able to getaway from our normal lives and experience a different part of the world and even therein experience and see things that many of the locals probably never were aware of.Our guide was fabulous. She was smart, attentive, knowledgeable and very passionate about her city. The content and pacing of our tour was skilfully handled to maximize our time and experiences. Her passion rubbed off on us and now Hong Kong is one of our favorite cities. Thanks Apple and Mandy.

We recently went to Hong Kong for our New Year's vacation and thought we'd get a tour guide to make sure we saw as much as we could during the time we had there. We got online and chose Mandy with The Hong Kong Getaway. This was the best decision ever!We travel quite a bit and are accustomed to finding our way around ourselves so were on the fence about getting a guide. The first day we met Mandy in the afternoon and we stayed around the Kowloon and Hong Kong island area. She took us to the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade then we took the Star Ferry to Hong Kong island. We went to Crystal Jade for lunch in Wanchai and the Shanghai dumplings were so very good. Mandy taught us how to eat them so the juice didn't escape and we got the pleasure of eating them the right way. This was an afternoon tour so after we walked around the island a bit we took a taxi to Victoria Peak and walked on a trail to a beautiful view of the city. Mandy did not take us to the spot where the rest of the tourists went, it was way too packed! She took us to a spot where only the locals know about. Much better! On day 2, we traveled to Tai Po and were shown where many Hong Kong people live in the Kwong Fuk Estates. We then visited a fishing village and went on a boat ride with a fishing lady, Mrs. Cheng, and visited her fish farm. We visited Tai Mei Tuk which is a large area with outdoor BBQs and many families were there BBQing lunch. We were so shocked that they were offering us tastes of their food to welcome us to Hong Kong. We were so honored that they shared their meals with us. We went to the market in Tai Po where we bought some shrimp and went upstairs where one of the restaurants cooked it for us. Then, we did a little shopping in the market nearby. We ended the day back in Hong Kong island as we wanted to see the longest escalator.By having Mandy with us, we were able to get to the touristy sights and also visit areas that tourists would never find. We had so much fun with her and she checked in frequently to see if we were enjoying ourselves or if we needed to alter the itinerary. Very intuitive!My suggestion to you is to book Mandy right away so you can enjoy your trip. You won't be disappointed."

With so many districts, interesting places to eat/drink, and such diverse culture, having a versatile and flexible guide is critical, and we got so much more than we bargained for. Mandy was waiting for us in our hotel, ahead of schedule for our morning tour. She had crafted an itinerary based on our pre-trip preferences, and adjusted to focus on our interests as the tour progressed. By the end of the day tour, it felt as though we were walking around with a knowledgeable friend instead of a guide. We would've been lost without her. Later in the day, we received several e-mail with focused suggestions for the rest of our trip. I definitely recommend The Hong Kong Getaway for travelers of any age. Whether you're interested in culture, local food or architecture, they will have you covered."

We visited a fishing village, an apartment complex and a shopping area for local residents. All places that give you a much better idea of how an everyday person lives. Our lunch in the little tiny fishing village was amazing. Mandy has established relationships with many locals, and as a result, was able to get nine of us into a little restaurant for lunch with the cook making special dishes for us. Without Mandy, I don't even know if I have found this restaurant. Just wonderful. I would highly recommend!! Mandy also gave us excellent ideas for things to do the next day, even though we were not going to be going with her. You can tell that she loves her job and loves her city.

I can't tell you how exciting it had been for me to have learnt and discovered the country through the eyes of two local girls who were SO well-equipped and competent as tour guides (who are also such beautiful souls). Mandy and Apple not only took me through some history lessons; they spoke of politics and gave such eloquent perspectives about life that had me too impressed with my overall experience with them. Their patriotism is infectious. I did MANY cool things during my 5-day trip. I've seen, tasted, heard & danced a whole lot more than timeout could ever recommend.

But after reading all the nice reviews I decided to give it a try and follow a local.What a fortune!Wow, from our first meeting I did not even think I was on a tour, but on the road with a friend, loving the job she is doing. Thank you Ka Yan for taking me to your hometown. I was amazed of the changing surroundings, leaving the rush of Kowloon, after the short ride with doubledecker as well as Minibus to Taipo. On the bus, I got recommendations for the next attractions I could visit (which I did actually). Arriving at Sam Mun Tsai New Village I tried the Wonton, Beef Tendon / Brisket with dry noodles in a local restaurant, where I could not even read the menu. Experiencing the old fischer villager we took a boat ride by a \"Hakka\" lady and saw the Tsz Shan Monastery as well as a floating fish village and boat house of the Hakka lady. The Hakka coupled explained how they were raising their fish and made living on their floating refugium. Climbing from the boat on a dam we were overlooking the Plover Cove Reservoir. Although I felt like singing in the rain, we were lucky to keep dry. Back in Taipo town center we visited the wet market, and also the local food court to have some fishballs and doughed mango (KaYan - I forgot the name of it!). Trying to play hide and seek with the locals on a busy market saturday. Ever been to Hongkong public housing? My first time as well - at Kwong Fuk Estate. Reflecting the mood of this grey building it started to rain heaviliy (typhoon warning 3). But that did not stop Ka Yan to explain how life is like in Taipo and Hongkong, which made my tour a invaluable occasion.If tripadvisor allowed for 10 points, my Getaway friends would get an eleven. Thank you very much and I cannot wait to see you again for my next private tour,\u8d5b\u5df4\u65af\u5766 (Sebastian)"

One to give an overview on Hongkong Island and Kowloon and a combined biking/boat tour to Tai Po and around Plover Cove including Sam Mun Tsai village. Mandy checked upfront what my points of interest were an perfectly tailored the tours accordingly. Right from the beginning I had very much the impression that Mandy really loves her city and what she is doing. She knows a lot of details and background on architecture, culture and history. Being a native local, she also knows a lot of stories about Hongkong\u2019s daily live including the best places for street food. The second tour was completely different and showed a side of Hongkong which not everybody would expect. The tour included Tai Po town, a boat tour an Plover Cove and a fishermen village. Very interesting, very beautiful. If you have time and budget for more than one tour, I really recommend to do a nature/landscape in addition to Central/Wan Chai/Kowloon to get a more complete picture. Having travelled quite a bit in Asia, I know there sometimes are issues understanding the \u201clocal English\u201d. Not here, perfect also for me, not being a native English speaker.

My friend booked the tour based on her TripAdvisor searching, so I can't take any credit for that. Mandy met us in the lobby at our hotel at 7 pm as promised and took us on a full and exciting 4 hour adventure throughout Hong Kong! She was enthusiastic and very friendly from start to finish. We started by walking along the Hong Kong harbor area and our first food stop was to get an egg tart, which is one of the dishes that the city is known for. She gave us ample time to get the city view from the harbor and took all of the photos that we wanted. She then led us to the Star Ferry to take across the harbor to the Hong Kong island side (we were staying on the Kowloon side). From there, we headed up to \"the peak\" shopping mall area in a taxi given that the line for the tram was very long. She took us to the \"touristy\" viewpoint of the harbor, and then on a walk to her favorite viewpoint, which was definitely better! Our second food stop was at a street food cart to get \"siu mai\" (fish dumplings), which I absolutely loved. Since I enjoyed them so much, she recommended that I look out for curry fish balls during the rest of my stay in Hong Kong, and I was certainly not disappointed when I found them in Macau the following day! We stopped to grab some dinner at a place called Mak's Noodle, where she directed me to the wonton and beef brisket noodles. Again, an excellent choice! She then took us down the peak on the tram, which was very steep, and to Lan Kwai Fong (the \"party\" area) of the city before directing us back to our hotel. From start to finish, Mandy was friendly, professional and enthusiastic, which we absolutely loved. She also followed up the tour with an email containing other suggestions of things that we could do. Compared to a more \"standard\" tour of a city, I prefer this version 100%.

Wonderful views and so unexpected!We explored the town, very interesting market (wish we had the variety in the UK, especially the seafood) and the local housing. We were so involved in looking at everything that we ran out of battery power in two phones and one camera. So no group shot with Mandy. Our tour ran over by two hours but there was no extra charge.Would love to go back and try a hike or bike ride one day.

She was more of a friend who knows the area than a tour guide and all of our group related to her well (from 19 yo son to Grandma).Mandy, upon research we found UK customs won't allow any meat products through, dried, canned or otherwise, so no Yunnan ham for me.

My boyfriend and I had an absolutely amazing experience with Mandy and throughly enjoyed seeing HongKong through the eyes of a local. Mandy is so friendly and engaging, that It felt like we were spending the day with a friend! She is very passionate about sharing her culture and shared so many interesting, and \"edu-taining\" tidbits with us. Mandy is well versed in the history of HK so you will learn a lot on the tour. Just be mindful that time goes by very quickly! I would highly recommend this tour, especially if you're interested in getting off the beaten path. You can customize your package, but I would leave it to Mandy. You'll be happy that you did."

Our first experience was in a dim sum restaurant that the locals use. We would never have ventured in as in didn't even look like a restaurant from the outside. Mandy then explained to us the rituals that surrounded the dim sum meal. The food was delicious.loved it.Then Mandy took us exploring her wonderful city.

She picked me up at the hotel and made sure I got back in time for my flight, and was very informative about the historical aspects and culture of HK.

We were able to see how the locals live, talk about the day-to-day life in Hong-Kong and really see a totally different side of HK. Mandy also organized a short boat ride on the spot to see the local fisheries.What was amazing was how beautiful and green the landscape outside the city was.We thoroughly regretted that we had not called Mandy right at the beginning as she really knows the place well and we felt that she could have shown us a better angle of what we had already seen thus far.We would recommend without any hesitation, if you want a tour with a personalized touch."

I had no plans whatsoever coming into Hong Kong. I did not realize how wonderful and beautiful Hong Kong is. My tour included a small nature walk to Mandy\u2019s secret spot, gazing down onto the extravagant and brilliant creation of the city. You are able to see the contrast of nature versus man-made skyscrapers. This short walk gives a better view of the city below without having to deal with all the touristy crowds. A much preferred private tour. Not only was the view spectacular but also Mandy keep dishing out very knowledgeable history. I won't say much on this, as Mandy will sure tell you.After this we took the ferry across. Once again seeing the amazing city now from the waterfront. Mandy is always switched on; though I kept forgetting I was on a tour. She has an upfront bubbly personality but very subtlety teaching you about Hong Kong. We finished off our tour with a nice dinner as good friends. She is the best tour guide I've ever come across; you don't realize you're on a tour because she becomes a friend showing you around town.Mandy is a sweet young women, with a strong desire for her passion and love of Hong Kong. I would definitely hire her again to take me on another tour to see others parts of Hong Kong. You should too, you won't regret it."

She was warm, pleasant, easy to talk to and has a great big wonderful smile, undoubtedly to match her big heart.Immediately she started giving me some of the history of Hong Kong as we walked from the MTR station through Nathan Street. We didn\u2019t stay there long because she wanted to take me to see both the highlights of the city as well as some of the local hang outs, allowing me to experience the \u201creal\u201d Hong Kong.I won\u2019t go into the details of my day as she will create a tour that is specifically customized for your interests.

We have a six-year old daughter and Mandy customized our tour with her in mind - we avoided the long queues at The Peak. While at The Peak, she took us to a trail that are known to locals but not to tourists. We explored the city using local transport. Our daughter loved the double decker bus ride to Stanley Market and Repulse Beach. Mandy was knowledgeable, friendly, polite and made the whole tour fun and interesting for all of us. I very much appreciated that after the tour was long finished, Mandy sent us a follow-up e-mail recommending other places for us to see and eat.

I'd seen nice hotels and restaurants and some of the touristy things, but I wanted to understand more of how someone living in Hong Kong lives day to day.This is exactly what she showed me. We went to her hometown and saw apartment complexes where most average income people lived and the shopping available to them. We ate at one of the local places(no walls other than clear plastic hanging down.. drains cut through the cement floor, etc) where another couple joined us at our table(as it is normal to share tables when space isn't available elsewhere). She also took me to a fishing village so that I could see how people there lived. Again we ate at a place that was apparently a restaurant.... although if I had been alone I would have thought that I had walked into someone's home and asked them to cook for me.There was no English spoken or written in the fishing village. So, it was great to have Mandy along. If she had left me I'm not sure how I would have gotten back to my hotel.After this she took me to a larger mall that was still a local mall in her hometown to help me shop for gifts for my nieces and nephews. She was very patient and helpful while I shopped. She also rode the bus back with me after our tour was over so that she knew I was in an area I felt comfortable in before she left.Mandy is an extraordinary person. She's extremely friendly and knowledgeable about both the tourist areas of Hong Kong and the \"off the beaten trail\" areas of the city. On my next trip I may have her take me hiking to some of the beaches she told me about. I highly recommend calling Mandy to get a great tour of Hong Kong while you are visiting. Her English is excellent as well, so if you need an intelligent translator she would be a wonderful choice."

Mandy responded promptly, and made a restaurant recommendation that we thoroughly enjoyed.The day of the tour we met Apple (Mandy's sister) and had a blast.

Mandy was first to call us back within an hour and provided a detailed itinerary of options for us to choose from and said she could tailor the next day's tour to us. We booked our time (10am-2pm). Mandy's sister Apple ended up being our tour guide (they work as a team). She met us at our hotel and asked if the itinerary still worked for us. Having never visited HK, we really didn't know where to go, but wanted to see areas off the beaten path. First up, Repulse Bay via public mini bus. Never would have ventured on to one of these, but super efficient like everything in HK. RB was stunning. Gorgeous ride there, then a wonderful stroll on the beach to a picturesque Oceanside temple. Next to Stanley Bay, also very pretty and a little less built up than RB. Starving so treated Apple to lunch then hit the market stalls for a bit. Then it was back to the city. Apple accompanied us back to our hotel, but made sure we wee familiar with the ferry, and the MTR before we arrived home so we could get around on our own the next day. Our 4 hours ended up being 5.5, but she only charged us for 5.In conversation she mentioned that the HK White Party was the next night and said she thought her sister Mandy might be able to get tickets for us. YES was our answer! She was able to get them from a friend and Apple even hand delivered them to us at the hotel just 2 hours after she had dropped us off! The White Party was a little on the young side for us, but what the heck, we pulled out our inner 20 something's and let our hair down. An incredible night, an incredible visit to HK and memories forever with the help of two very friendly and genuine sisters. If Trip Advisor had the ability to rate them with ten stars they would get an eleven. Cannot recommend them highly enough. Plan 5-6 hours for the complete royal treatment. Very affordable for the experience.Thanks ladies! Look me up when you are in Boston!"

She also got us our Octopus cards and showed us how to get around town with them. Among the hightlights, we saw Repulse Bay (highly recommend!), Stanley Market, Star Ferry as well as some locals only bus rides (that you could use the Octopus card on!) where she pointed out neighborhoods and points of interest. We also went for a great lunch and toured on the double decker too as it was quite a hot day and this was a relaxing and cool break between sights! She was very flexible and totally catered to what we wanted to see. We even went over our time and she walked us all the way back to the hotel which wasn't necessary but very much appreciated. It was a fantastic day and we felt that after touring with Apple we were much more comfortable getting around the city and knowing where to go. She gave us great ideas as well as restaurant info and even was able to get us tickets to a sold out event that her sister was working!

Our actual tour was with Apple - she was a fantastic guide. We had a full-day, custom itinerary (Apple even organized a nice surprise visit to a cat caf\u00e9, which my girlfriend loved!). Apple met us at our hotel (she was right on time), and immediately made us feel welcome. Apple asked my girlfriend whether she spoke Mandarin and when she found out they both spoke Cantonese, conducted our tour in both English and Cantonese!Apple provided us with Octopus cards for the Hong Kong Metro and bus system (which we reimbursed her for - only $300 HK dollars for both, and they lasted most of our 5-day trip in HK).Apple led us to the nearest metro station and to the ferry to Lamma Island, our first stop, and pointed out sights along the way. We got to see two villages on Lamma Island, and had a nice light hike and stopped at a beautiful little beach and got our feet in the water. We had frozen pineapple at the top of one of the peaks on Lamma Island, and had a wonderfully refreshing beer at one of the waterfront restaurants on the village at the other end of the island. Got beautiful pictures of the Aberdeen side of HK from a great lookout spot on Lamma Island near the windmill.Apple took us to the ferry back to HK, and led us to Central District, filling us in on landmarks as we went. We took the Peak Tram up to Victoria Peak for a stunning view of the nightly HK skyscraper lightshow.Afterwards, Apple led us back (via another scenic route down another side of Victoria Peak) to the Central-Mid-Levels escalator via historic and bustling Queen's Road Central, pointing out more sites along the way. We had a delicious Cantonese dinner, and Apple directed us back to our hotel. We were a little sad to leave her! Apple was truly the best tour guide we've ever had. Can't recommend enough."

Mandy is a natural tour guide - super friendly & bubbly, accommodates any requests/requirements asked of her, and has an overall positive and enthusiastic attitude when leading a tour. Furthermore, of the tour guides I could find here on TripAdvisor, she was probably the only true local, \"born & bred\". She took me and my elderly parents (in their 70s) to see the Repulse Bay & Stanley, and finished with a skyscraper tour in Wan Chai. They were all wonderful parts of Hong Kong that we would've never known to check out without her guidance. It was a laid back tour that both me and my parents enjoyed immensely. She even found for us the nicest, cleanest bathrooms for each location we visited. Only an insider knows this valuable information. I will definitely use her again the next time I'm in town. I recommend her 100% without any reservations. THANKS MANDY!"

Mandy was friendly and informative and took me places that I simply would not have seen if she hadn't showed them to me. Some delicious food starting with a Dim Sum breakfast and highlighted by a well earned beer at Big Wave Bay after our Dragon's Back hike! A great day; thank you Mandy.

Indeed, my friend and I had visited Hong Kong before and we wanna see something different about the city. Therefore, we decided to join Apple's local tour. It was such a great experience that even before the tour, Apple showed her great hospitality by her of arranging us the accommodation and airport transfer (we were a bit troublesome since we keep changing our schedule). But Apple was very professional and friendly throughout the arrangement. The tour itself was excellent, Apple has excellent knowledge about her hometown and was able to tell us many interesting history and facts about the places we have been to. We basically love all the food Apple chose for us and she was great at finding inexpensive foods with exceptional taste. Apple was very caring and really treated us like friends from afar and we really appreciated it. We really enjoyed Apple's tour and therefore, I would definitely recommend a tour with Apple when you come to Hong Kong."

At each location we sampled food of traditional Hong Kong origin. Between each restaurant Yammi answered our questions on our location, the food, local customs etc, she was more than happy to comment etc. On the tour we visited the local market which was interesting but nothing special as we had visited it on our own the day before. Overall, the tour is a little overpriced for the actual experience I was rather hoping that we would have seen a bit more of 'behind the scenes' in the restaurants we ate at but generally it was a good interesting experience, could have been better."

I was lucky enough to have Yammie as my guide both days. She took us into kitchens and shops so we'd have a better understanding of the culture. She had pictures on her tablet to provide a better understanding of certain things. The Sham Shui Po tour is in \"old Hong Kong\" where few tourists go and had more exotic foods compared to the Central and Sheung Wan tour. I enjoyed both tours equally. Prior to the tour the company sends emails with specific directions to the meeting locations. During the tour, a brochure is given with the names and locations of the restaurants toured along with what you ate at each restaurant. The brochure also provides you with suggested restaurants that were not toured. Lastly, it contains a few fun translations for words such as \"delicious \" and \"thank you\". I would recommend these two tours to anyone. I hope Yammie is your guide because she is great!"

From first meeting the group through to helping us all work out how to travel back to our hotels, Yammy made the tour a real treat. Even though it's a foodie tour, it's about more than the food. We learned about the area, the culture, and some simple phrases like Jo Sun (good morning) and Ho Sik (delicious). But of course, the food is the main event and that was also excellent. There was a good variety in the 6 tastings, both savory snd sweet. When you book, you can indicate any food allergies / intolerance, and the guide will find alternatives .Be warned, it's a lot of food - even spread over 3.5 hours. So skip breakfast and you probably won't need to eat again until dinner."

The food was amazing, the stories our tour guide (Yammy) shared about the businesses and about Hong Kong made it that much more interesting, we walked long enough that we were ready to eat more ;) but not so long that we were exhausted. Yammy took care of everything - provided plenty of water for us along the way, brought napkins for us to use at the local stands, etc. She thought of everything, Our SIL (who has lived in Hong Kong for a year) joined us on the tour and she was amazed at how much she learned about her neighborhood. Everything we tried was delicious - my husband said when he dies he hopes it is in a bowl of the roasted pork. Ha!"

Our guide was Yammy, a friendly and knowledgeable Hong Kong native. She expertly shepherded our group of about a dozen through Hong Kong's crazy streets. She was also very accommodating with my dietary restrictions and got me substitutes. I really liked the printed handout with the restaurants we visited and some further restaurant recommendations, which made it easier to revisit the restaurants later. I highly recommend this tour!"

We visited six establishments and it is hard to pick a favourite as they were all great, not just because of the authentic and fresh food but the knowledge that Yammy was able to provide at every stop. Wontons, bbq pork, dim sum and egg tarts were fantastic but even the story and different tastes from a very old Chinese confections shop were unique and interesting!"

The focus on small multi generation food businesses was a unique look at great food in Hong Kong. Small family businesses that one might not expect to deliver such great quality and taste experiences. Our guide Silvana was first class. During our almost four hour tour we learned how urban development was eroding places such as the Graham Street market and the dai pai dong (street stalls). Sad to see such fine examples of old Hong Kong disappearing.In addition we learned much about the history of Hong Kong and in particular the families that operate these wonderful eateries.As native Torontonians we grew up very familiar with Chinese food because of Toronto's very large Chinese community. In fact Chinese is the third most spoken language in Canada after English and French. The wontons and barbeque pork were probably the best we have ever tasted. The dim sum and the bakery were at the top of the list of the best we have enjoyed. A great, totally new experience was the preserved fruit shop that is not to be missed.Our next visit to Hong Kong will include the Kowloon tour."

Pineapple buns, Milk tea, tofu dessert, rice noodles, etc. Carrie was a terrific tour guide, not only taking us to restaurants, but several local shops, and explaining the economic, living conditions, and daily life of Sham Shui Po residents. In fact, this may have been my favorite part of the tour.So much food too. I'm glad I learned Cantonese for \"full belly\"!"

We had the best Wontons I've ever eaten and got to see a behind-the-scenes look at the kitchens in one establishment, which has ovens large enough to cook an entire pig in two hours!Yammy, our guide, not only introduced us to each of the restaurants in turn, but also gave us a wonderful flavour of what it was like to live in Hong Kong. She was even game enough to buy one of our party a thousand year old egg from a market vendor when he expressed an interest in trying one. She absolutely could not have been more helpful or obliging, not to mention knowledgeable about local culture and history.As an introduction to what can be the intimidating world of Hong Kong cuisine, this tour is an absolute must.

            "review": "Good but could be better. I will echo some of the comments of a previous reviewer; IceKeeg was actually in my group of 11 hosted by Lillan this past Monday. I was solo visiting Hong Kong and booked a private tour with another operator for 8 hours, and booked the Central & Sheung Wan Foodie Tour the following day. Whenever visiting a new city, domestic or internationally, I believe food and bike tours are the best way to feel the pulse of a city, learn its cultural diversity and eat like the locals. First and foremost, Lilian was a great guide and her positive personality was infectious during the tour. She conveyed the significance of each dish to Hong Kongers, and she provided brief history tidbits for the duration.The room for improvement I see is sharing Lilian's warm and inviting personality with other guides, and capping the tour size at 8. I admit, I was 20-25 minutes early to the meet spot where I inadvertently ran into another guide as she prepped her two person tour. Instead of any basic pleasantries, I was met with a snarky \"well you're early,\" and a clear don't associate or speak to me or my guests. I get it, I'm not on your tour group but you also have us meet inside the lobby of a busy building. I was attempting to say hello and get some basic info, not ride the coattails of your tour. I did not get her name, nor did I care at that point as my outlook for my tour was already soured. A group of 11 at the majority of Hong Kong eateries is not going to fit in one corner, often splitting at minimal two or three tables. Part of the foodie experience is to socialize with fellow travelers and the guide, this missed the mark. When you're missing half the demo / experience in the kitchens because the group is too large to accommodate, it's time to downsize the groups. Navigating the alleyways and some streets, Lilian was more shepherd than guide with stragglers. Overall a good tour, but I don't necessarily believe this would be a repeat tour."

Lillian was energetic, fun and kept our group of 12 moving smartly through the streets in between stops. She was pleasant, fluent in English and funny as she explained the food we were tasting, the history surrounding the restaurants and the cuisine as well as the architecture of the old district.Here are the high points:-we visited very local , small places which we would not have entered without a guide. We are well seasoned and adventurous travelers who do not need to be led around by the nose. However, in Hong Kong it was a pleasure to be led along this very well planned and all inclusive food tour. Clean, safe and local food gave us a taste of old Hong Kong.-guide was stellar. I had left my camera at the meeting point but did not realize it until after we had all been seated at first restaurant. Lillian ran back to the meeting point and found my camera which she promptly returned to me! She saved the day!!!! -comprehensive menu with plenty of time to digest each tasting as you walk to the next venue. I would not eat a hearty breakfast as you will get a lot of food!!!!!!!!!!!-I enjoyed meeting others from other countries. We were 3 of only a few Americans. There was one woman alone who was enjoying the day while her husband worked. Don't feel shy if you are by yourself. This tour attracts a friendly and adventurous crowd and you will have a good time!-directions to the meeting point is excellent. Allow time to arrive by MTR. You are basically arriving and meeting in a lobby of an office building.I will be back in Hong Kong and I will definitely try another tour.Price tag is high but you get a wonderful experience..and hey, you're in Hong Kong....splurge a little!!!!!!!!!!!Thanks Lillian for a great tour....see you again soon!!!!"

You learn history, you will likely see parts of the city that you otherwise wouldn't have, and all the while, you are eating delicious food and getting to understand it - which should be helpful for the rest of your trip! The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that this is a fairly typical large group operation - there were almost a dozen of us, and while our guide, Lilian, expertly herded us about, you do lose the personal touch we've been lucky to find in some other food tour operations. But again, Lilian was great - funny, energetic, and kept the pace going perfectly. The food was, without exception, fantastic. A little handout is provided with additional recommendations, and these served us well on our trip. This should definitely be part of your HK experience!"

This food tour was great because it takes you to hole in the wall places that you would never stumble into on your own since they don't have English menus and are full of locals. You definitely get a sense of \"real Hong Kong\" and not the touristy BS in other parts of the city.Though the best part of this tour without a doubt was our amazing tourguide Carrie. She was incredibly knowledgeable about the food and the area, taught us a ton of super interesting facts about Hong Kong and always had insightful answers to our questions. I cannot say enough good things about her - my girlfriend and I have taken food tours all over the world and Carrie was by far our best tour guide ever.

No real \"adventurous\" eating, all of the food was rated \"PG-13\". we had a stop for Snake soup, as an option, we took the option and were delighted with how good it was. Plenty of walking to do so do as they say, wear comfy shoes, and bring an umbrella you can expect a downpour at any time (in September at least).

Before the next stop, a city walk that stopped at markets, shops, and the Man Mo temple provided a well needed break from eating as well as hitting many tourist spots we planned to do the next day anyway! Fresh sugar cane juice and a preserved fruit stop were a well needed refreshment before another generous portion of food followed, this time with dim sum followed by a fresh egg tart dessert. All of the food stops were fresh, homemade, and unique to Hong Kong, unlike similar food I had in China and elsewhere. I would definitely sign up for another tour my next time in Hong kong.

I want to mention that I myself am a vegetarian, while my husband isn't. We were told this would not be a problem, and appropriate accommodations were made, for which I'm grateful. We went to 5 different restaurants (one was closed due to a holiday), all of which are family run operations. We learned about the way the different foods we tasted are prepared around the city, and what made them special at the specific place we visited. We travelled by foot from one place to the next, which allowed for some great learning and sightseeing along the way. The food tour was a great way to get a bearing for the city, and enjoy foods you may not be able to order yourself if you don't speak the local language. Highly recommend to anyone who likes to eat and learn!"

We took my brother on a tour of Sham Shui Po for his birthday and as a way of introducing him to an area in Hong Kong he might not have otherwise seen. Our guide, Yammy, was absolutely superb. She gauged our interest, found fantastic places to introduce us to everything from pork cheek to pineapple buns, but also added some history into the mix. I would highly recommend this tour so not least to get off Hong Kong Island and see a different side to life in the SAR."

Carrie was our enthusiastic tour guide, spoke perfect English, and was very knowledgeable about HK history, culture and local way of life. Our food explorations was varied, from sweets to savories. Every stop on the tour included foods that were made onsite, which added to the authenticity of the experience. One of the highlights was a decades old homemade noodle restaurant where the original owner made the noodles just a few doors away from his shop. I would have never have known to stop into these restaurants; but with Carrie's introduction and handy takeaway map, I know where to go when I'm craving pineapple buns, soft tofu or shrimp noodles.The trip was very well organized, and everywhere we went, we had reserved seating. HK Foodie Tours also seemed to have a good relationship with the owners, as we were never rushed or made to feel unwelcome. This was especially impressive given that several of the locations had waiting lines of hungry locals.I would highly recommend HK Foodie Tours for those who want to experience Hong Kong the way locals do."

More than the food, we enjoyed quite a complete cultural tour of the Sham Shui Po district including some of its history and lives of the people living and working there. The wet markets and medicinal shops were great (although potentially a bit smelly/confronting) and certainly not places we would've looked at on our own.I think doing this tour early on in your HK trip is well worth it; so you have a better idea of looking for food that may be out of the regular touristy areas and often cheaper and just as tasty!"

We did the Central/Sheung Wan recently with Yammy and regret that we didn't do it sooner. We've had a lot of the dishes elsewhere that either were not prepared as well as the ones on the our or there are massive crowds to get in. We chose the Central/Sheung Wan tour because we live nearby and wanted to find some new spots to eat. This tour showed us some less known gems to which we will definitely return.We started with delicious shrimp wonton noodles. The shrimp were large and the rice wrapper was soft but held together nicely. The next stop was a roast meat restaurant. The roast barbecue pork was tender with a crispy skin and a slightly sweet barbecue sauce. It was delicious.Next we drank sugar cane juice and then we sampled dried fruits. They were not my favorites but I enjoyed seeing the little shops and learning about the medicinal properties of the fruits. After a stroll along Cat Street, we wound up the tour with some of the best dim sum we've had in Hong Kong. Two low price dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong have each been awarded a Michelin Star. We have eaten at both and prefer the one on the foodie tour to either of them and not having to wait to get in was a bonus. Warm egg tarts were a perfect way to top off the tour.Our tour guide, Yammy, was delightful. She is very upbeat and provided lots of information about customs and history and even pointed out a tiny hole-in-the-wall barber shop that I've probably passed a hundred times without noticing. We really enjoyed this tour a lot and will return to most of the stops on the tour. The only down side I can name is that it is a little pricey, given that the places where we ate were very inexpensive."

            "review": "Tai Po Market tour--adventure leads to dire consequences for me. During my last visit to Hong Kong 17 months ago, I took this group's other 2 tours (Central-Sheung Wan and Sham Shui Po) and had a great time. I believe this tour was added in the fall of last year. It's perhaps the most adventurous tour because it's the furthest away from Central and also because of the food offerings. For instance, on the other tours, you walk by snake shops offering snake soup, but on this tour it is an actual tasting stop. This tour is also more costly, perhaps because of the food offered, the portions were quite generous, and the tour length a bit longer.Alas, the combination of the foods offered and my physical makeup did not mix well for me that day. I ended up with severe gastrointestinal upset that severely marred the rest of my Hong Kong trip, even resulting in an overnight hospital stay for dehydration and low blood pressure upon my return to the USA. To be clear, I do not fault the tour or food preparation, but in the end, my gastronomic plans for this trip (including plans to revisit the wonton noodle, roast meat, dim sum, egg tart and pineapple bun shops from the other tours) were shot to heck.Tai Po Market is in the New Territories north of Kowloon. If taking the very efficient but sometimes congested MTR subway system from Central, allow about one hour travel time. I used 3 different lines, ending on the above-ground East Rail Line which was once part of the historic Kowloon Canton Railroad (these trains even have a First Class car with regular upholstered seats). At the Tai Po Market stop, I met our guide, Elise, who got her start with the Tasting Tour group via Fiona, my Sham Shui Po tour guide last year. There was only one other person on our tour. Even here in the New Territories, this area is still quite urban and bustling, a mix of old and new, not unlike Sham Shui Po in Kowloon. Like the other tours, this tour not only includes the tasting stops, but brief stops for discussion of the area's history. Also, we had a bit time at the Railroad Museum, located in the old Tai Po Market station, and at a temple (named Man Mo like the one in Sheung Wan). As usual the Tasting Tour group focuses on vendors that are family-run, long-standing, definitely not part of a chain or conglomerate, and hygienic.First stop--rice rolls. These are a quite ubiquitous dish, but are special here because of hand-made, in-house technique and unique fillings--pork liver and dried scallop in our case. While I admired the exquisite texture an quality of the rice roll itself, I was not a big fan of either filling. The only liver I really like is foie gras or a pate, and the dried scallop reminded me of the potent dried shrimp I have disliked since childhood. Had these rolls been filled with the more traditional fillings like BBQ pork (char siu)--which you can certainly order here, they would have been fabulousSecond stop--roasted goose with rice noodles. My favourite stop, and a very large portion. I've traditionally had roast goose or duck with rice and a plum sauce on the side, but here the goose was served over rice spaghetti in a broth with vegetables and a cherry dipping sauce. Delicious, although quite fatty in a good way. Third stop--house-made candies. This was a stall in a wet market along the street, run by a couple originally from Macau. All their cookies and candies are made in-house. Our gift package included candies made from peanut, pumpkin seed and ginger. Samples of other treats were freely offered. We were somewhat pressured to purchase additional goods, which I did so willingly.Fourth stop--snake soup. A tiny place, uncrowded now because snake soup is traditionally a winter dish. The sign out front had a cobra and turtle on it. Indeed, some of the snakes used are venomous cobras--all are imported from Indonesia. Other snake shops keep snakes in open cages; here they were housed in wooden drawers where they cannot see their kin being eaten by humans. We were given both the snake soup--thick with shredded snake (tastes like chicken), mushrooms and other fungi/herbs--plus snake broth--a bit medicinal in taste but not unlikable. Snake wines were on the shelves. The proprietor showed us all the snake bones used to make the broth--who knew snakes had so many bones? Worth a try--better than the rattlesnake posole I had once in Arizona.Fifth stop--a trio of dishes served in an indoor cooked-food centre, not unlike a Singaporean hawker centre. This family apparently started their business as a dai pai dong (outdoor eatery), but later moved here to a more comfortable and hygienic place for all. Since there so few of us, it was like a banquet. We started with deep-fried cuttlefish (like squid) balls-clearly very fresh. I would have preferred a smaller ball size. Next came a steamed whole mullet fish with black bean sauce. Also very fresh and simple, clean. Last was steamed glutinous rice (aka sticky rice) with fresh crab. This would have been my favourite dish had the rice not included the dreaded dried shrimp that has haunted me since childhood--it is often used to flavour glutinous rice, unfortunately for me. We had a lot of leftovers, which the other participant took home since she lived locally. We were also given the option of having a beer with our meal, a first for a Foodie Tour. We opted for coconut water, made fresh of course.Sixth and last stop--warm tofu dessert. This was a street stall with a lot of takeaway business, since there very few places to sit. On the Sham Shui Po tour, there was a tofu stop, but I think it was cold, served with a ginger syrup. Here, the tofu is warm, served with an almond milk topping (we were given the option of black sesame, brown sugar or ginger as well). Good, very plentiful. The entire tour took about 4 hours. There were restroom stops along the way, but I would find myself needing 2 of these stops in the MTR stations on the way back to Central. I spent much of the remainder of the trip trying to recover in my hotel room, thankfully a luxurious Harbour-view room at the Mandarin Oriental. I had most wanted to revisit the pineapple bun place from the Sham Shui Po tour--I can still taste and feel their cloud-like deliciousness--but that became out of the question. It was also a shame that I could not fully enjoy the lavish breakfast buffets offered daily at the Mandarin's famous Clipper Lounge, included in my room rate. I had to make do with toast, clear broth and plain congee. Some hints: wear comfortable shoes, of course, and bring an umbrella or whatever additional clothing you may need depending on the weather. Water, a packet of tissues and wet wipes are offered by the guide, but bring more of any of these if you need them. And of course be willing to try different things!"

The tour was very informative and showed me a different part of Hong Kong (a very non-touristy section) that has tons of character.

We'd been in HK for a couple of days doing the obligatory tours to the Peak and riding the Star Ferry back and forth to Kowloon with side trips for shopping. This tour started near the base of the worlds longest under cover escalator and wound it way through the surrounding area. I have to say our hostess Yammy was lovely, we'd arrived 15 minutes early and so we wandered about a little either side of \"The L Place\" meeting point and then returned and she arrived right on time. She greeted us and all of the other 9 members of the tour and the managed to remember the names of every one, not an easy trick when your dealing with people from at least 6 different countries. So off we went and into the first of six different spots on the tour. We traversed a set of stairs to the basement of a Dim Sum shop and dined on locally made Shrimp Dumplings and broth, which were delightful. Yammy is an effervescent individual and mixed with commentary is a lesson on Cantonese language to help us with our adventure. The food on the tour is fresh, made on site and all of it healthy. If this is your first trip to HK then I suggest that you take this tour with Yammy, she knows the area and the people, the two old blokes in the Sugar Cane shop look like uncles, and probably are but they as they were happy to chat with the group and were up for a laugh. The food was great, the pastry from Hei Lee's was almost as much a highlight as the roast Pork at the Dragon Restaurant. A must do!!!"

Plenty of food, Hong Kong history and laughs!"

Food was the perfect vehicle to get to know more about the people, culture and architecture and the unfolding history of this fascinating city. The tour was well-paced, leading us through a route of constant variety over the afternoon, including wet markets and the kitchens of some establishments. Lilian was very well-informed and clearly at home with the material and the vendors we met along the way. As well as tasting freshly and expertly prepared specialities we gleaned insights about the role of edibles in Chinese medicine and beauty regimes! And the evolution of the food industry. Fabulous. Highly recommended."

I knew it would be more adventurous than Sheung Wan but that's exactly what I was looking for. And I wasn't disappointed! It was lovely to discover Tai Po - a hidden gem that I'd never visited properly. Loved all the food stops EXCEPT for one - the snake soup. That was a first and I'm glad I tried it, but it's not on the repeat list. Highly recommend this tour to HK residents like me who want to rediscover new bits of the Territory or to travelers that want to go out of their way to have a 100% authentic Hong Kong experience."

Because the food served is all street food, the price was exorbitant. What we didn't know was that the tours in the different neighborhoods signify different levels of adventurous-ness about food: the one in Central is pretty mainstream, ours was in the middle, and the other option has the most extreme/unusual food choices. That being said, I only really loved two of the six food places we went. It was fun to go into the button/ribbon shops and kitchen supply shops, and it was fun to see the kitchen of some of the restaurants she took us to. Overall, we didn't like it while we did it, but we were glad we did it."

The train ride from our hotel in Sheung Wan to Tai Po Market is about an hour long and involves a few train line changes. The MTR system is so easy to follow and HK Foodie provided excellent instructions to find our way to the start point. I was a little worried about the Tai Po Market tour for 2 reasons - (1) it seemed expensive at about $150AUD pp and (2) because I thought it might be a bit TOO adventurous for me. I love food, but I'm not a huge fan of seafood and even the thought of snake soup made me a little queasy. The other two tours were booked during our stay (and I knew my husband would LOVE it) so I booked us in. I didn't need to worry - all of the food we ate was absolutely delicious (yes, even the snake soup) and I enjoyed every bite. The portions were also very generous, so if you don't particularly like something you taste, you can be sure you won't be left hungry! Silvana is very knowledgeable about the area and has lots of passion for her job. She was happy to answer all of the questions we had (about the food or about things we had seen around Hong Kong during our travels so far) and she did a fantastic job of ensuring that our group of around 10 mingled with one another during the tour. 10 out of 10. Definitely worth the money and the train ride out there."

She worked hard to make sure everyone in the group felt included and enjoyed themselves. This tour is perfect for first-timers to Hong Kong, you will try many traditional foods but nothing too exotic (like snake soup!). They can also cater very well for vegetarians and will try to provide you with good alternatives to the meat tastings.

We visited several spots that had a very local feel and absolutely everything was delicious. Cliff, whose family is from the region, had a lot of insight into the city's culture as shown through eating habits, and in between tastings he pointed out various items sold by street vendors, identified what they were and explained their significance.

The tour was professional and we met a lovely mix of people, American, German and British. The small group of 8 aloud us personal attention and Yammy was very thorough and informative. She went beyond the normal food tour and showed us other things as well. Her English was very good and she has a great sense of humour. The venues were great and ready for us upon arrival with no waiting. A wonderful introduction for culture and food. Highly recommended!"

Each tasting was perfect, well spaced and the tour overall was well-timed to avoid peak periods and make opening times. We tasted pineapple buns, rice rolls, biscuits, roast pork, tofu dessert and shrimp egg noddles. Fiona explained each dish, showed us videos and gave us a fantastic insight into life in HK. Thanks so much!"

Yammy was a fantastic guide, engaging with everyone in our group at a pace that neither felt lazy nor rushed. Do yourself a favor and book this tour.

What new adventure could we find? our foodie tour with Yammy to Sham Shui Po was the perfect solution. Even though I had issued this neighborhood countless times Yammy discovered the very best food on each category. We had no idea that rice rolls could be so yummy!!! In addition to the most delicious food we were delighted to learn so much more about the neighborhood history and markets. In the days after our tour we would try some of the same foods in different neighborhoods and they were never nearly as delicious as on the HK Foody tour."

As others have said, the food experience is greatly enhanced by the social and cultural history provided by the guides.The food on the Central tour would largely be familiar to those with previous experience of authentic Chinese food and dim sum, but it was fascinating to see these small businesses surviving among the high-rises of Central. Silvana's commentary was excellent and she also took us to the Man Mo Temple and pointed out some very local sights that we certainly would have missed on our own.The Sham Shui Po tour was in a neighbourhood that is still pretty local and \"authentic\" and the food was more unusual as well. Again, the commentary was excellent and Fiona is an extremely outgoing and enthusiastic guide. The tours aren't inexpensive but they offer an experience that goes beyond the food tasting itself. Highly recommended!"

Yammy was our guide and led our group of Americans and Australians up and down through Sheung Wan and a wide variety of food experiences. She also wove in LOTS of Chinese and Hong Kong life and culture that didn't have anything to do with food. Her English was good and she knew enough about westerners to know what we were thinking and what questions to address. We had 3 people who were dealing with leg problems and needed to go a little slow. She did a good job of going a short distance and then stopping to eat or talk about something. On top of all that the foods were very good and there was more than we could eat comfortably. We went to great places we would never have found or gone into on our own. We got to see behind the scenes in some of them so we found out what it takes to make things like roast meat Hong Kong style. I might do this tour again when I'm back in Hong Kong. Another thing - a lot of of the traditional places are vanishing with the building boom in Hong Kong, so go soon before they all turn into hip restaurants and high rises. By the way, this is not a weird food tour, it's normal good food."

We learned not only about the culinary side but also various traditions and historical background and what it's like to live in HK today. The food tastings were excellent. I remember still the amazing char siu! Tender and perfectly bbq'ed. The only disappointment was the dim sum restaurant, whose offerings were unremarkable. The tour ended with some of the best egg tarts I've ever had.I had such a good time on that tour, that I signed up for another one - the Sham Sui Po. This one was led by Fiona and once again was a blast! This neighborhood in Kowloon is quite distinct from Central, and that itself was worthwhile to experience. The tour started out on an entertaining note with Fiona telling us about the etiquette and operation of the subway washrooms! At the first restaurant I was stunned to see what looked like the largest pineapple bun in creation :). What was even more surprising was how good it was. We have them in my home town but nothing like this. My second favorite restaurant stop was the tofu dessert with sweet ginger sauce, but all six stops were worthwhile.I'm definitely taking the third tour (Tai Po) the next time I visit!Tips: 1. remember to bring your walking shoes. This is a multi-hour excursion.2. bring an open mind - you will see foodstuffs that may be new to you. If you don't want to eat something, don't, but you'll get the most out of the tour if you take just a little bite of everything.3. bring a camera because there's lots of photo ops4. they supply you with a bottle of water which was very thoughtful and a dining guide that lists the itinerary for future reference.5. remember to tip your guide.

They say they there is no minimum tour size and there were only three of us on this one which made it even more personal. Thus is billed as the more adventurous tour , although only the snake soup might fall into this category. An excellent way of sampling the small family eating places that are increasingly being priced out of the central districts and also getting past any language barrier.......and for a railway nut,an unexpected bonus of including the small railway museum - even smaller on this occasion as it was part closed for refurbishment. Four hours passed quickly .Highly recommended."

Given that it wa smy first time in Asia, I especially appreciated the additional insight and context they provided along with the information about the food itself - it allowed us to learn more about Hong Kong, the culture, the New Territories, customs, history, etc. etc. And the food! We are from San Francisco and have access to excellent Chinese food at home, including a penchant for fresh/local/seasonal fare...this tour highlighted exactly those things. The restaurants and shops we visited were all family-owned, and in many cases we met the owners and their families, and got to see how the food was prepared. We tried winter-specific specialties (snake soup!) and Silvana and Elise pointed out all of the New Year-specific foods and customs. Who knew how much we would like black sesame soup, or how different a homemade sour plum sauce would taste from packets? We're now back at home, trying to seek out the types of homemade delicacies we had in Tai Po Market! Truly wonderful from start to finish. Highly recommended."

Better than waiting with a mob in line for the Victoria Peak tram, better than hitting the Japanese department stores on Causeway Bay, walking the streets in Sham Shui Po with a knowledgeable and friendly guide was great fun! We liked eating in restaurants that we would never have entered on our own and eating food we never would have ordered by ourselves. Sure, some of the food was not to our liking, but a lot of it was and it was great fun experiencing something new. These Foodie tours let you feel, even if in a small way, that you're experiencing the real Hong Kong. Highly recommended!"

Our morning tour with Fiona was probably the high point of our week in Hong Kong--certainly the most interesting thing we did. It was really more of a cultural introduction to Chinese life than strictly focused on food. Not fancy or luxurious but completely authentic. She took us to 6 different local family owned restaurants--some would call them dives--to sample typical local favorites done the traditional way. Between restaurants we walked around local markets and shops and talked about Chinese life and families--everything from Mah Jong parlors and pawn shops to a knife shop run by a 94 year old and his family and the used electronics \"men's market\", \"saving face\" traditions, and people living in cages. We saw herb and dried fish shops, shops specializing in kitchen utensils, home made noodles and snake soup. This s not intended to be a high end gourmet experience--but it's a fascinating and often funny introduction to local life and culture. Fiona is a very impressive young woman---a graduate student in literature who has studied in the U.S. and speaks perfect English."

Tai Po Market is about a 45-minute train ride ride from central, and the area felt much more like mainland China than anywhere else we had been in Hong Kong. We made 6 stops combined with a walking tour of the street market. The food choices were excellent, ranging from rice rolls and roasted goose to snake soup and fried squid balls. We definitely expanded our food horizons! Our guides (Silvana and Elise) were excellent; providing good local knowledge along with moving us efficiently from one restaurant to another. Absolutely one of the highlights of our trip."

I, on the other hand, was not too excited as I am a vegetarian. We decided to try the Hong Kong Foodie Tasting Tour. We had a great time! Our tour guide was Yammy. She was very knowledgeable regarding the local cuisine as well as other interesting details about Hong Kong. There were 12 people on our tour. At each location, the dishes were ready for us. Yammy did a great job accommodating my vegetarian preferences. We tasted foods at six different locations throughout the Central area: a wonton noodle shop, a roast meat restaurant, a sugar cane shop, a preserved fruits shop, a Chinese dim sum restaurant and a bakery shop. Everyone enjoyed the foods, as well as the details Yammy provided in regards to the preparation, history and cultural significance. This tour is so much more than just the food. We visited a local temple, saw a unique barber shop, and so much more. By the end of the tour, I felt as though Yammy was an old friend. I would highly recommend this tour while vacationing in Hong Kong."

After 2 weeks of eating fabulous food in Italy we were disheartened and overwrought after our first dinner of a 4 day HK stopover on way back to Oz. HK Foodie Tour and their delightful guide Ed to the rescue! A very enjoyable, educational and most importantly delicious 3.5 hours spent with Ed on the Central /Sheung Wan tour. Had raised an eyebrow over cost but value received more than worth$ paid. Local knowledge/stories, cultural background and insights, insider info on restaurants and dishes sampled all added up to terrific and filling experience! The HK food scene can be mind boggling, expensive and plain hard work without some inside track but Ed changed our frowns to beaming grins. On top of the fun and lessons about some typical dishes many of the restaurants chosen were long standing family owned establishments. So a nice historical touch came along with our food, beyond the education we received as we walked throughout the neighborhoods. Ed provided entertaining running commentary as we went and as we dined, always happily answering any question or request thrown at him. Highly recommend this tour to all HK newcomers and anyone else who enjoys eating genuine local cuisine as its meant to be. Even if you've been to HK before you'll have a fun filling culinary adventure and bet you see/learn a few new things as well ! Thank you Ed! Who knew a mere egg tart could be so life changing?!!"

The tour was about 3.5 hours and we went to 6 different restaurants/shops. Along the way we strolled through the Graham Street Market and Cat Street. The food was really delicious but the best part was learning about how the neighborhoods are changing and how gentrification/urban renewal is affecting those that own shops, restaurants and sell their goods at the street markets. I feel I got a really amazing introduction to Hong Kong and a glimpse into how things are changing for the locals. The wonton soup at the first stop may have been my favorite. Highly recommended!"

Walking through the lanes of SSP old style HK, the street hawkers, the amazing smelling food.. Can't help but want to try it all out.

Our guide Yammy was wonderful and so informative and lovely with us and our 3 teenage sons! The tour is extremely efficient and well structured with just the right amount of food and time between courses. Food in each venue was wonderful and ready immediately. The focus is more on tradition and food that is prepared fresh and mostly onsite.

Sylvana was an outstanding and helpful guide. I would also like to point out how much I appreciate the sign up - it makes it easy to separate who has what food allergy or restriction.

He not only introduced us to traditional foods of the area but provided us with a great history lesson of the area, also pointing out architecture, sites and additional restaurants to visit. This is a walking tour so be prepared to log some miles, but you take lots of breaks and sit down at the restaurants so there is plenty of time to rest. One caveat...there are a lot of hills and stairs,steps, etc in Hong Kong in the central area where we toured. If you have some mobility restrictions, you might want to chose one of their other tours. (they have foodie tours in other areas of Hong Kong with fewer steps and flatter terrain) We enjoyed every minute of the tour and even went back the next day to sample a little more of the food. They provide you with a great map, pictures and the appropriate names of the food so if nothing else...just point to the picture. I would highly recommend Hong Kong Foodie if you want a fun, personal tour (group sizes are kept small) of Central Hong Kong. We learned so much from Cliff and enjoyed all of his stories."

Firstly, the preliminary information provided on the tour outline, directions to the meeting place etc. were extremely well written and easily followed. Everyone was there on time and we set off on our food walk around Sheung Wan and Central. What I had not appreciated was that the establishments chosen were all very old family owned businesses, generally in heritage buildings, and providing classic Hong Kong dishes popular with the local inhabitants. A broad range of menus were covered; wonton soup, roast pork (yum yum)and dim sum. We also visited a specialty Chinese sweet shop and tasted a range of dried fruit and the very interesting stop at the one remaining sugar cane juice shop.Lillian really makes this tour very special. She has a great knowledge of the food scene in HK and was able to provide us with many useful tips for the remainder of our stay. She is charming and warm and has a great sense of humor.

This tour would be a good thing to do at the start of your visit as you get some information about the food and culture and you have a local (the guide) you can ask questions you might have. The tour was quite long, maybe longer than necessary. Sometimes it felt like we were just walking around the block to fill the time. That being said, I enjoyed walking around, also to let the food sink between the meals. Thumbs up for getting us on a tour on a short notice (the day before) and for affordable prices. One area that could be improved was the facts the guide told us about this and that at several 'stops'. The guide could have chosen far more interesting subjects, for instance more about China, Hong Kongs history etc. Her rehearsed 'facts' were very local and not that interesting, like 'here it used to be a pawnshop, but it's not anymore. Ok, lets move on to the next stop'. Maybe we could have spent longer time at each stop, just talking and getting to know each other better. Any ways, we don't regret doing this tour and it was probably the best thing we did in Hong Kong."

Very local and we had the best roast pork ever at one of the stops. We had our three year old with us and she was extremely helpful in helping us with the stroller etc that made it easy for us to truly enjoy the tour. If you are visiting HK for the first time this tour is a must do as you get to learn about its famous foods and walk around the main streets and learn its history."

It was our first visit to Hong Kong and this type of tour is a must for any visitor.. Besides the great choices of restaurants, the tour is paced so that you learn a lot about the history and customs of the people along the way. Yammy was fun and educational and we thoroughly enjoyed the tour. It was difficult to choose our favorite stop: between the wonton noodle soup, and the roast pork(with the tour of the kitchen) and the Dim Sum, It was a great day and highly recommended!"

Although Hong Kong isn't foreign to me and I've done some research on my own on great places to eat, this tour further helped to add a few more places into my must-eat places for my future Hong Kong trips. Loved every single stops that we made, but I still found the portions a bit too large for the wonton noodles (first stop) and roasted meat (second stop). Discovered a gem of a place at the preserved fruit shop. Even dim sum was excellent, which doesn't lose out to Tim Ho Wan's Sham Sui Po outlet that has 1 Michelin Star (I even went back to the dim sum place the very next day for brekkie!)!!!Along the tour, history of the places that we walked along were shared, which added perspectives to the whole tour. Am looking forward to the other 2 tours they offer and will take them up when my schedule permits in my future Hong Kong trips."

The Tai Po tour is the most adventurous we've done, we actually ate snake and the chef got a live snake out of the back for us to see. It's an area I wouldn't have been able to visit in my own and although I've been to tonnes of Chinese restaurants I've never had things like the black sesame soup. I think the Central tour is good for first timers in HK, Sham Shu Po for those who want a bit more off the beaten track and Tai Po possibly for residents or those who really want to eat a snack! The tour guides are always great and the information they give is spot on!"

Lillian took us to 6 delightful eating experiences that found us struggling for more space in our tummies for the delicious offerings that were presented to us. To think that this was the only rewarding part of our time with Lillian would be to do her a great injustice. Firstly, after introducing herself to us, she asked each of the 12 of us to introduce ourselves to the Group. From then on, Lillian addressed each of us by name - her memory was phenomenal. That was not all that was amazing though as, for the next 3.5 hours, Lillian introduced us to the history of the regions we visited revealing an amazing knowledge and the true skill of a great story teller. Both Lillian and the Tour were outstanding and I would happily recommend this adventure to anyone interested in great food and the lesser known history of the old Hong Kong."

Our guide was Fiona.Our guide was fun, easy to understand, very knowledgable, always energetic, and quickly developed a good rapport with the rest of the group.Before the start of the tour, our guide gave us a map with descriptions of the food on order, water and wipes. We arrived at 9:00. There was a briefing for about 10 minutes, and then the tour began. It ended at 12:40. You may want to bring your own water. Most of the places we visited had existed for several decades, and had been operated throughout generations of the same family. The food is thus considered part of HK history.Throughout the tour, in between stops, we were regaled with an oral history of HK and the area. As well as the present conditions. We learned about why the pawnshops are the way they are, the cages for rent, we stopped at a knife maker's shop. We learned how to stand beside the table of people eating to pressure them to finish, as is supposedly the HK way.We also learned that bumping into people is as easy as eating rice.Shopping is discouraged to keep the group moving, but there is time for reasonable purchases the don't take much thinking (cellphone cases, adaptors, mooncakes). This might depend on your group though.This tour is great value for money. The missing star is because I'm a Filipino, and we chose the Sham Sui Po tour in part because of the schedule (foodie tour first thing in the morning, and on an empty stomach!), but also because they were offering more \"traditional\" HK fare. However, a lot of the food was easily accessible in our China Town. Maybe that's not fair, but regardless, we were looking for something more exotic, that we couldn't get elsewhere.The food was absolutely fantastic however, despite the above.1st Stop Pineapple Bun and Milk Tea - You get the buns fresh from the oven. Those who know what this means know that this means heaven. I loved the milk tea, but my companions (from Canada, Australia, and there were two Americans) seemed not to enjoy it too much, as it wasn't as sweet as what's normally available commercially. You can add sugar though.This place is supposedly closed for I think a month for renovation, so up to October.2nd Stop Rice Rolls. My favourite. The sauce is the essence.3rd Stop Soybean milk. There is a cold drink and warm soup option.4rd Stop Braised Goose. Duck and Goose No rice, sadly.5th Stop Walnut Cookies. Sadly, this was just bought from a store. It was yummy, but we were full at this point. Not what we were expecting.6th Stop Egg Noodles w/ Shrimp Roe. This was the favourite of the rest of my tour group, and my second favourite. Fantastic! We arrived )as calculated, allegedly) right at 12:30, as the restaurant opened, and it was full in 5 minutes. Real local fare.Anyway, it's worth it. We wanted to do just one tourist-y thing in HK and shop the rest of the time, and we were not disappointed.P.S. Good shopping around the area too. You can find really local stuff, not just the ladies market stuff manufactured for tourists (although you'll find this there too). I'll try to upload pictures later, if TA will allow me to."

The food was exquisite - and served in local joints that I normally wouldn't wander into... especially those with various meats (and their heads) hanging in the windows. A wonderful way to get to know the real Hong Kong. Thank you!"

Travelling to HK often, I have taken all of their previous tours and loved them, am also familiar with asian cuisine, so was really excited about a more unique tour of HK and experiencing different dishes. Visited six eateries:- Not a lover of rice rolls, but the ones we tried were DELICIOUS. Suggest everyone order different rolls and share as you experience more - we had liver, pork and scallops!- Visited a roast goose restaurant: most succulent duck ever. Particularly loved the plum sauce!- Loved the Chinese sweet store! The owners were really friendly and accommodating and couldn't get enough of their nut mixtures. Also saw how they made other candies (ginger sweets) which was great.- The snake store was a unique experience and would highly recommend it! Up to you if you want to taste or not (I ate the soup and it was tasty!)- Really enjoyed going to the dai pai dong above the local vegetable/meat markets. Loved the atmosphere, felt like I really was doing/eating what a local would. Lots of seafood here, and delicous, too! Crab was goooooood!- Ended tour at a dessert place and had some almond 'soup'. Not so much of a dessert person, but surprisingly yummy. Make sure you don't eat too much before starting the tour - you'll be full by the end of it!Places visited:One of the reason why I LOVE going one these tour is you also learn about the local area, not just experience the delicious food! I particularly loved exploring Tai Po, an area I'd never been to before and it didn't disappoint. (Will return to explore further!)Visited a railway museum along the way which was quite interesting. The architecture was really pretty and a very pleasant quiet place away from the hustle and bustle of Tai Po. Walking through Tai Po Market was amazing, too! I adore visiting markets, and I loved all the different stalls (seem to have more variety) Tai Po offered. Nestled in between it all, there was a beautiful little temple we visited - incense, drums, statues - fantastic.Silvana was a fantastic tour guide, very knowledgeable and friendly. Great group, too, one couple in particular were hilarious and we have stayed in touch!Highly recommend HK Foodie Tai Po tour to friends looking for a more unique culinary/cultural experience - definitely no pork buns or custard tarts on this tour!"

Part of the appeal is not knowing where you are going in advance, so I son't give too much away, but suffice it to say that we sampled many different types of local food. The tour sticks to local, family owned businesses that do not necessarily cater to tourists, this was clearly evident by the menus not being written in any other language other than Chinese. As could be expected, with a different set of tastes, our group of 4 did not like ALL of the food choices, but we all liked MOST of the choices :)Our guide Cliff was very knowledgeable, and mixed in a fair share of history and general local culture as we wandered through Hong Kong."

Our tour guide was Fiona - a very energetic lady who was keen and genuinely eager to share with us cultural tidbits about Sham Shui Po and Hong Kong.They give you a leaflet at the start of the tour showing the places that will be visited on the tour and what will be tasted at the different venues. The leaflet also has the addresses of other recommended eateries so you can visit them and the places visited during the tour in your own time if you so wish. I went back to the bakery where we tasted some cookies as I wanted to try the wife cake which was excellent.We went to six different eateries. The most popular dishes among the group I was in was the roast goose and tofu pudding. The tofu pudding was soft and the ginger syrup which you could pour on top was simply divine - it had just the right blend of sweetness and fire to it.It was a bit pricey for street food but the added value of the tour was well worth the price in my opinion - you get to eat at traditional eateries without the staff hurrying you on and without having to deal with any communication problems as a result of not speaking any Cantonese, you get to meet new people, you get to visit other areas of interest in Sham Shui Po which aren't food-related (we went to a beads store and a knife shop)."

What I looked forward to was not just the tasty local food I'm going to try, but this new tour is going to take me to New Territories! That's very exciting!MTR is so convenient that there's no trouble just to follow the system map and got myself to Tai Po station. The station wasn't that huge neither and I spotted my tour guide before I was even out of the gate.During the tour I got to try handmade steam rice rolls with different fillings (BBQ pork being my favorite), juicy roast goose (definitely going back!), handmade Chinese candies (tried ginger candy, pumpkin seeds & my favorite peanuts candy!), snake soup (very exotic but it really just taste like chicken and the soup actually taste quite good), fresh local seafood and Chinese desserts.Such an exciting new tour to show me more special local food, and also it's nice to have a friendly tour guide to show me a different area of HK (always wonder what's there in New Territories).

The quality of the food was outstanding, and being quite hungry to start with is a bonus! This was followed by a tour of the wet market, a try of (tooth rottingly sweet) sugar cane juice and dried and preserved fruits. The walk through the back street between the two districts was fascinating and built up the appetite for the last restaurant visit, dim sum. The crispy pork buns were something to behold and eat. The final piece de resistance were the most delicious custard tarts fresh out of the oven. One word of advice for newbies, you will probably want to spend the morning doing something around Hong Kong..... If you are away from the metro station beware, travel takes much longer then you realise, and you will not want to be late for this afternoon treat."

I want to try the afternoon tour next!"

Not only was she knowledgeable about the food and establishments we visited, she also has a great understanding on Hong Kong as a city, as well as the cultural backgrounds of all who live there. The food was all delicious and the portions were big, considering we visited 6 different places. The tour was set at a good pace and we never felt rushed nor pressured to buy anything further from each place. I wish I could have followed our footsteps to taste all the food a second time!"

As a family of four with 2 daughters aged 13yrs & 11yrs we thought it would be a good family thing to do and all of us left the tour feeling it was one of the best things we did in Hong Kong because it was something we all enjoyed. We all chose something to do in Hong Kong and my 11yr old found this tour online and chose it as her 'thing to do' and she got a pat on the back for that. I recommend doing the tour at the beginning of the trip (we did it day 2 of a 7 day trip)as you will probably want to go back to some of the eateries. We went back to the restaurant serving BBQ pork and rice and also went back for the egg tarts which we loved but we all love custard and shortbread so we were all craving them! Don't eat too much before the tour you will be full at the end and it was very hot (28 degrees) so take a backpack with extra water and some moist towelettes or antibacterial gel for your hands.Lillian was our tour guide and she was very informative and had a lovely personality, she was fantastic. We had some travel bloggers on our tour and they seemed to enjoy the tour, it's a great thing to do to introduce you to Hong Kong and taste some of the local food!OTHER THINGS TO DO IN HONG KONG..... take the #260 bus to Stanley Markets and make sure you sit at the top of the double decker bus, the coastal drive is fantastic and a little hair raising! The shopping is o.k at Stanley it's the surroundings that are the highlight and the grocery store there is great to hunt down different local foods and try some durian! (not a fan lol)Do a day trip to Macau 1 hour on the turbo jet each way and make sure you see the House of Dancing Water it's expensive but so worth it a highlight of our trip approx. $600 NZD for our family but would go again in a heartbeat, it's like cirque du soleil on crack! Don't leave without seeing it!!!! The Venetian is also amazing, having been to Vegas this is bigger than Vegas with 3 gondola canals and the shopping is also good at the Venetian. We had a crazy gondola ride with an Italian guy, he had locals following him (groupies) he was funny and entertaining wish I could list his name he had us all laughing and was a fantastic singer singing frozen 'let it go' for our daughters. Have fun in Hong Kong."

Many of the reviews covered the venues and the tour itself, all of which I agree with so I won't repeat these apart from: the wonton restaurant, recommended by Michelin, made the best wonton I have ever eaten! Large dumplings, full of prawn and well seasoned with sesame oil - magnificent! Sylvana, Hong Kong born, managed to keep us interested for over 4 hours and was full of information, answering the many questions posed to her, she created a good atmosphere and had the 8 or so tourists chatting to each other as we ate food and shared experiences.What I will do however is to compare this foodie tour with another I did - the markets tour of Kowloon (Bird, flower, Temple St and fish markets). OK, both were different in objectives but the central theme must have been to inform, entertain and educate. The foodie tour excelled whereas the markets tour was a stroll along the streets by a German resident who knew her stuff but simply did not have the passion or depth of knowledge to make it matter. I am not even sure why I paid to walk along the street and markets, which I could have done myself, with the aid of a map and a little guide book. On reflection, I made an error.if you are visiting Kowloon and HKG and want to do some walking tours - I recommend you do the 2 Foodie tours covering the 2 areas and not bother with the market tour - you can do that yourself and I am sure the food tour will cover the districts far better than my experience on the market tour."

            "review": "Good way to taste local life. Took the tour the last week of April 2015. I enjoyed most the food on the tour, most notably, the braised goose, the noodles with the shrimp egg powder, milk tea, the warm and soft tofu dessert, and the rice rolls. I did not like the cookies. In my opinion, they were dry and not very unique. The guides were knowledgeable about the local life, as well as the history of the area. They even discussed some contemporary issues between Hong Kongers and mainland Chinese people, but just a little bit as these issues are sensitive topics. We toured through the working class Sham Shui Po neighborhood on the red subway line--Kowloon side of HK. Personally, this is a great tour for travellers who are not accustomed to crowded Asian metropolises. I have been living on mainland China for the past the two years, so some of the information about the Sham Shui Po local markets and sights was a bit redundant for me because there are similarities to mainland Chinese markets. On the other hand, it was a great break from mainland China as Hong Kong is much cleaner and the quality of food is much higher than what I've had in major mainland Chinese cities. Whenever I eat something on the mainland I hear a nagging voice in my head saying \"Are you sure you want to eat this? Eat at your own risk!\" There seems to be a lack of food quality assurance and food quality regulation in China. Hong Kong feels different and I did not feel that I was taking a huge health risk when eating the food. Of course, this is entirely subjective and everyone could have a different perception. I recommend this tour because the guides will take you to local eateries that could otherwise be intimidating if you're a first-timer, especially for someone who does not speak Cantonese. Take the tour, it's worth it."

This food tasting and cultural walking tour was about 4 hours, stopping at 6 tasting locations. Our guide, Fiona was friendly, knowledgable and helpful. It was very interesting to explore the older style of Hong Kong by knowing some history of the neighbourhoods and learning some fun facts about Hong Kong's cuisine, we liked going behind the scene of a Hong Kong style Cafe to check out how to make the delicious milk tea! Totally awesome and not to mention the mouth watering Food! They were all the best Chinese food we had ever tried! Also, we were provided with a brochure of food tasting and Restaurants/shops Guide, together attached with a map and some useful Cantonese Phrases, all were nice touches. Two thumbs up!

There are two sides of Hong Kong. the modern and the traditional old culture.For me, you can see modern things anywhere, Shanghai, Beijing (also visited on this vacation), North America-any city. What is really interesting for a foreigner is the traditional old culture! This is a disappearing thing everywhere. I loved seeing the traditional Hong Kong, the kind that sets it apart from any other place in the world. The crowded streets with bustling merchants, the streetside stalls, the herbal stores with amazing things like dried lizards (an eye opener) was expertly narrated by our guide, Fiona, who was friendly and knowledgable. So this was a cultural journey with amazing tasting of local foods that I would not have otherwise been able to discover. At first I was afraid I would be served ingredients I would find revolting, but in the end, everything was delicious and more than palatable. We had special baked foods, special milk tea, duck, hand made noodles etc. The most interesting was pork hock and it was delicious. We did pass by a snake restaurant but snake soup was not part of the tasting tour. Don't eat breakfast, as you want to be hungry for all the food you will try. For the 4 hours I felt like I was a local and really lived the experience. Did I mention the glimpses into the kitchens arranged by the guide so we can see how the food we ate was prepared? Excellent. Be warned, to see this side of Hong Kong, which is not the most modern and pampered side of life, you will walk through crowded, sweaty, noisy streets, but IMHO, unless you have done something like this, and eaten some of these unique and traditional foods, and have had such expert local guidance, you will have missed what Hong Kong is all about. Fiona was great and was able to advise other restaurants to try more traditional cuisine in case your are staying in Hong Kong for a bit longer. Highly recommended."

Silvana and Ed were excellent, the tour was excellent, and after we were done, I wished we had time to sign up for their second tour! The Central tour was very well organized and paced. When you meet they hand you a map with a list of the places you're going and what you're going to eat at each place. The map also shows several other recommended restaurants (including recommended dishes at those places) not on the tour, as well as a few useful phrases. Our first stop was a noodle shop. We got a lot of information about the food and the restaurant, but there was also a greater discussion of local history and culture above and beyond that, which pleasantly surprised us. The next stop was at a roast meat specialist for char siu and rice. We learned about the eight types of roast meats and how to tell the difference between goose and duck. We also got a tour of the kitchen/roasting/drying room. Next we walked by the street stalls on Stanley and learned how there are only about 30 stalls left since they stopped issuing permits in 1980s. We also walked through the local wet market and learned how the market area is being demolished and redeveloped, with all proprietors being moved into a new city building as they prepare to knock down the surrounding buildings. We walked through old and gentrified neighborhoods and truly got a sense of how the city is changing--something we didn't appreciate as much while roaming the streets on our own. Next up, a preserved fruit shop, followed by dim sum at Dim Sum Squared. We finished with warm egg tarts, fresh out of the oven. It was truly an excellent tour, which was not just about the food, but offered a much richer experience of the city as a whole, by meeting local mom and pop proprietors, learning more about local dishes, seeing some of the kitchens and cooks in action, and observing gentrification first hand. We are not tour people, and typically like to do our own research and exploring (especially when it comes to food), but this tour convinced us of the value of a tour, and we're now thinking about taking foodie tours in other cities. It really added so much to our trip. At $90/each (including food at six stops), it was absolutely worth it, and if we're ever in Hong Kong again, we'd take this tour again in a heartbeat."

The history on the different areas of Hong Hong was very interesting and not something you will find in guide books. The family run restaurants were all welcoming with delicious food. Our favorite were the shrimp wontons, dim sum, and egg tarts. We returned to two the next day with others in our group. This is a great afternoon activity while visiting HK! I would recommend not eating before though because I would have been completely full if I'd finished the first meal!"

            "review": "Food + History + Culture = Totally Worthwhile. This company offers 2 tours, which I took on consecutive days. Both tours have 6 official food- tasting stops, but both also have numerous other stops for local history, culture, and neighbourhood flavour. Both last about 3 1/2 hours. At the start, both give you a printed guide/map not only of the official stops, but of other restaurants/shops of interest in the area. Also you are given bottled water and a packet of tissues (as you may know, Hong Kong eateries are stingy with their napkins). Both feature food-tasting stops at places you probably wouldn't have noticed or tried yourself (the signage and/or menus are mostly only in Chinese). Local, mostly family-owned and operated places, often by multiple generations. Or the business itself may have a long history, or the building may be historic. Many places make their own offerings on-site and via old-fashioned, labourious methods. Food is the main thing, but you learn so much more--totally worthwhile.CENTRAL & SHEUNG WAN FOODIE TOUROffered 4 times per week, 12 people max, 2:15 pm start (to avoid the lunch crowds). Our guides were Sylvana (she's on their website) and Ed, both excellent, both natives. Central is the business and financial centre of Hong Kong island, lots of recognizable high-rise office buildings. Sheung Wan is the rapidly gentrifying area west of Central--\"hot\" new restaurants, businesses and housing are quickly suffocating the old-style eateries, businesses, wet markets and traditional housing. More than once on this tour, we were told \"take pictures now, this may be gone next time you're in Hong Kong\", or \"every week we see someplace new opening on this tour\". Our tour had some Americans, an Aussie, and a South African/Canadian.For me, the food-tasting stops offered many tastings familiar to me, but they were among the best I have tasted. The 6 stops were:1) Wonton noodle shop. Located in a basement, outside sign in Chinese only, menu has English. Family-run and passed down for 3 generations, began as a dai pai dong (a classic open-air food stall still seen all over the city, kind of like an immovable food truck with covered seating). They make their own wontons, fishballs, broth, etc. We had noodles and wonton in broth .The shrimp wontons were HUGE, golf ball-sized, with almost whole fresh shrimp. 2) Roast meat restaurant. Narrow space, popular for take-away. Chinese/English signage, Chinese menu only. Roast meats of all kinds, hanging in the window. We had barbecue pork rice--delish. We were taken into the kitchen to see the large vertical roasting ovens. I would return here another day for take-away.3) Sugar cane juice. An old business in an old colonial-style building, Chinese-only sign. Right in front a man was placing stalks of sugar cane through a machine over and over, slowly breaking it down. The juice was different, but tasty. The place also sells turtle shell jelly.4) Preserved fruit shop. Here we were served a lovely kumquat/lemon tea and given a box of preserved fruits of various types, some of which I remembered from my youth.5) Dim sum. Family-run. Sign and menu in both Chinese and English. Here we were served dim sum classics, among the freshest and best I've had.--shrimp dumplings, pork/shrimp dumplings, deep fried spring rolls, and crispy BBQ pork buns (baos). For me, the baos were a revelation! We're all familiar with the classic steamed white baos, and I'v had many a delish baked bao in the States, but the dough on these baos was totally new for me--chewy with a slight crunch and sweetness not unlike Hong Kong's famous pineapple bun (served on the other tour)--I think it's both baked and fried. And since I would have baos similar to these twice more at other places (Tim Ho Wan, Lung King Heen), I consider this a veritable paradigm shift in the way baked baos are made in Hong Kong!. I must now research to see if such baos exist in Los Angeles! I would return here on my own another day. Go after the lunch crowd. You are given a menu and pencil to place your order; there are photos or each item on the tables. The baos here were the cheapest of the 3 places I tried.6) Bakery/pastry shop. Chinese/English signage. For take-away, no dining area--we were eating on the narrow sidewalk and street. We were served a classic egg tart, but this too was new and revelatory for me because the tart had a shortcrust pastry, as in shortbread-like, as in butter, butter, butter! Egg tarts I've had before, in the US and here, must have had shortening or lard crusts, including some place we went to on my first visit here, guided by an English publication's recommendation, where we ate the tarts on the street as buses full of locals laughed at us. This was the best and biggest egg tart I've had.Non-tasting stops included some dai pai dongs under the Mid-Level escalators (which the government is threatening to close for sanitation reasons), Graham St. wet market, also slated for redevelopment (massive construction already encroaches one side), a dried seafood shop, a Dr. Sun Yat-Sen shout-out, Man Mo Temple, Cat St. (which has 2 other names), a snake shop (for soup).I had walked many of these streets before (this was my 5th Hong Kong visit), but I learned so much and discovered new places to return to in the future on this tour. Hopefully, they'll still be there next time. As an aside, I would find out later that Sylvana is an Eilte-level Yelper. She kind of dissed a new restaurant in Central the International New York Times raved about (and was also mentioned in Travel & Leisure magazine) that I was planning to try. I ended up not going, not because of her diss, but because I was too mellow after a great spa treatment to leave my hotel. Maybe next time, if it's still there.SHAM SHUI PO FOODIE TOUROffered 3 times a week, 8 people max, 9:15 am start. Our guide was the excellent Fiona. Sham Shui Po is on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong, somewhat north of the Tsim Sha Tsui harbourfront. It seems like kind of a working-class neighbourhood, with older walk-up residential buildings (complete with laundry hanging out of many a window), busy street markets filled more with locals than tourists, no modern skyscrapers like in Central. Much more local colour and flavour. The tour began in the MTR station, which Fiona told us all have restrooms--you have to ask an employee to guide you. Everyone but me on our tour was Aussie. Before the tour started, I did a restroom stop at a nearby McDonald's, where they served some quasi-Asian dishes and red bean pies, as well as apple pies.These food stops offered a few tastings that were new to me. The 6 stops were:1) Hong Kong-stlye cafe. No English anywhere. Here we had milk tea and pineapple buns. The milk tea was strong but good. The pineapple buns were outstanding. Some of us commented on how large they were, but there was nary a crumb left when we were through. It was like eating a soft but crunchy and sweet cloud. We got a peek at the buns being made, the ovens, and a man making the milk tea by straining it many times through what looked like a ladies' stocking.2) Chinese-style breakfast. Tiny place, no English anywhere, long queue for take-away. No tables were free, so Fiona told us to look for a table that looked like they were about finished, and then basically hover and breathe down their necks until they were done. We ended up squeezing into a table where a single local man took his merry time finishing his congee. We were served rice rolls--sheets of rice \"pasta\" rolled up jelly-roll style and then cut into bit-sized pieces. You sauce them with peanut and hoisin sauces and a sprinkling of sesame seeds. They are eaten with wooden skewers (like a long toothpick) because they're too slippery for chopsticks. Delish, and new to me. Great local experience.3) Soy product shop. No English. They only serve 3 soy products, which are made on-site--we saw the machinery/methods. Most of us tried the tofu dessert, ladled out of a big pot in thin layers, served hot with ginger syrup and sugar. Pretty good; I've had it before in the US, but not with ginger. Two people opted for the soybean milk, served warm or chilled.4) Braised meat shop. No English. Apparently a Chiu Chow-Hong Kong fusion. We had braised goose and pork knuckle served with a dipping sauce and rice. Delish. I think this is the first time I've had goose--it tastes very similar to duck, but is more expensive. 5) Traditional Chinese bakery. No English. Here we were given a packet of cookies--walnut, almond and sesame. Some gobbled theirs then and there, I saved mine for later--also delish.6) Noodle shop. No English, but there was a photo of Samantha Brown with the owners in the window. Also a write-up and photo of an apparently famous and respected Chinese food critic. We started the tasting with pickled turnips, then had egg noodles with shrimp roe and broth served alongside. The noodles are hand-made with a bamboo pole by the owners at home. The shrimp roe was a new taste for me, a bit bracing but far more pleasant than Chinese dried shrimp, which I do not care for. Others were not so enthused. Non-tasting stops included wet market streets with noodle shops and shops selling dried things, including a dried gecko-like reptile splayed out on a stick like a fan. We stopped at a kitchen supply store featuring knives of many shapes. The area has a lot of notions shops (buttons, ribbon, fabric, etc.), some pawnshops, local clothing stores and phone/electronics stores and stands (including a discount electronics mall). We also stopped at a snake shop that served snake soup and snakes in cages awaiting slaughter. Fiona also stopped and discussed the difficult housing situation for the city's poor, showing pics on her phone of \"cage houses\"--stacked cages meant to house large animals that some humans call home. Quite distressing, especially after seeing renovated loft buildings in Central that rent for $75,000 HKD monthly, and a tacky pink Bentley whose garage space rent isprobably nearly as costly.Overall, very worthwhile tours. I would try to do one or the other at the beginning of your visit, so you can return to the places visited. Plus, you'll learn about so much more than food on these tours, about this always fascinating, always frenetic, always changing (not necessarily for the better) city."

There is so much choice when it comes to food here in Hong Kong but if you are not a local deciding where you should eat can be both challenging and confusing. The foodie tour (central and sheung wan) took us to some excellent family run restaurants and shops where the food on offer (wonton noodle soup, barbecued pork, pork and shrimp dumpling and crispy bbq pork bun, egg tart) were outstanding examples of the slow food movement still available in Hong Kong. Not only did the tour help me understand Cantonese cooking better, it also provided some history of the area, a tour of the wet markets, an opportunity to learn more about fish maw, shark fin, dried scallops and mushrooms, the medicinal qualities of turtle soup and why drinking sugar cane juice is good for sore throats. Our two young guides were excellent and the walk through central and sheung wan was a fabulous way to feel a tiny bit more prepared for all that Hong Kong has to offer. Highly recommended."

After a while it didn't feel like I was on a tour, but more the feeling I was been shown around the area by a friend passionate about her city. This I must say made the day very enjoyable. I recommend that you DON'T eat any food before you start this tour as even after the first food stop you start to fill up quickly.Thanks to Silvana for making this a experience one of my greatest highlights of my stay in Hong Kong."

I still am savouring the tastes in my mouth - even the cane juice which I thought I would not like was delicious. Sylvana was a first class guide, so knowledgeable and the tour not only takes you to six eating spots, but you have Sylvana giving you the stories of the shops, the changes in the area, the challenges long established family businesses have with rents etc. the walk through the wet market was especially interesting though sad to hear next time I return to Hong Kong it will no longer be a street market and the area will have been redeveloped into trendy cafes.I have some slight walking difficulties on steps (there were very few) but Sylvana took time to check I was ok with the walking pace, which I was, but it was nice to be asked.I am so glad I found out about this tour here and I plan to do the other tour on my next visit. All arrangements are perfect with very good email communication in place etc So if you are thinking should I book or not the answer is, yes yes yes"

We secured our booking through a PayPal payment and we were then sent a confirmation with the location on where we were to meet. There is usually a total of 12 people on every tour which allows for opportunity to meet with other tourists and locals on the tour. Make sure you have good comfortable walking shoes and that you do not have a heavy bag or handbag to lug around as the tour lasts for approximately 3-4 hours. If you are not a big eater I would recommend to not eat breakfast and just have a coffee/tea before you join the tour. Also don't forget to tip your tour guide at the end of the tour. Enjoy!"

It was a great tour for those who know a bit about Hong Kong but don't know how the food is made, or are not aware of the everyday lives of people at the lower end of the social spectrum (our tour introduced us to everything from shared apartment living and the illegal purveyors of items like roasted chestnuts to some of the most popular small restaurants - some including Michelin stars). Our guide, Fiona, exuded enthusiasm for Hong Kong and was willing to discuss any topic that came into our heads. With one vegetarian and a couple of small children in tow, she did not have an easy task but kept us all well fed, happy and entertained -- and we learned quite a bit too!

Sham Shui Po. It's a little off the beaten path. But not too exotic to drive away first-time Hong Kong tourists. This is the real Hong Kong mall! I went to Elements Mall the other day and it's just like any other high-end glossy shopping mall -- might as well be in Dubai or Malaysia or Singapore; I would never know the difference.

Even though I have friends that could recommend great places to eat, bc there are a gazillion restaurants that are tucked away in little corners, it was really nice to have someone to guide me to the best that HK has to offer. Plus the tour guides are knowledgeable about the history of these dishes came to be which speaks to HK's unique history. My favorite was the sugar cane juice and the egg tart (to die for ^^) My group was small, only 4 of us, so we were able to get to know each other and ask lots of questions. Highly recommended!!"

The food was delicious but then it is hard to get bad food in Hong Kong (HK). The tour is a lot about the culture as well as food. We have visited HK previously and are reasonably adventurous travelers so perhaps our expectations were a bit too high for this tour but then we were there for the food more than the walk via markets, historic buildings etc. Food was superb, the tour was OK but not spectacular. Great for the first time visitor and a good introduction to HK life so if you have never been to HK or experienced Chinese/HK culture this is well worth doing. Yummy staple food, clean foodie places and knowledgeable guide. Pretty easy walking, not a lot of distance covered, and lots of stops. Pretty 'english-i-fied' tour in wealthy area so I would like to try the tour these guys do on mainland HK as we really love wandering the back streets of Mong Kok where you do step back in time. We are also pretty adventurous with food and so we thought the food we tasted on this tour was faultless, but mainstream. However the places you visit on this tour you will go back to I am sure.... the baked pork buns were special!"

So skip lunch and go hungry there is a lot of food to try.Not only do you get great food you get explanations of the places you are eating at and why and a little history of the city itself. Perfect. You will go to places you will want to go back to and they give you other recommendations throughout the city as well.Next day was the Kowloon tour. We tried things we normally wouldn't have and enjoyed it very much. It's a great way to get introduced to both parts of this great city.We had a different guide for each tour and they both were very pleasant and spoke excellent English."

Really liked this walking tour, and agree with the comments from other reviewers - well organized, interesting, informative. A few more comments: I did this tour on my own as my husband is here on business (and I took time off to see the other side of the world!). Being a solo traveler can be intimidating for some, but the tour guides were very welcoming, and I was part of a nice group of about 12 from all over the world. NOTE: You can specify dietary restrictions when you book (i.e. no pork, no eggs, etc).That said, the food on the tour was interesting and tasty - we had 6 stops in the 3.5 hour tour in two different neighborhoods - we tried shrimp wontons/noodles, BBQ pork, sugar cane juice, dried fruits, dim sum (4 different dishes) and, finally, egg tart, which was shockingly good. In addition to foodie insights, the guides - who speak perfect English - gave insights about HK history, culture and day-to-day life. I would suggest skipping lunch and come hungry - the portions are big. By stop 5 of 6, I was full! NOTE: There was a good amount of walking, a few hills, but nothing too hard. TIP: It's also a good idea to do this tour early in your visit to HK as it will give you great options to go back for a complete meal and to check out the neighborhoods and shop. And, finally, wear comfy shoes, bring extra water, and get your camera ready! Go forth and EAT! :)"

We then had sugar cane juice followed by Dim Sums and custard tarts. All the places we were taken were out of the way and unless we had done this food tour we were not know they existed but be left to the over priced restaurants that tourists crowd to. My only regret is we did not do the tour the first day we arrived as this would have given us a whole lot more options and understanding of where to eat.I simply can't praise this tour enough and urge very one visiting Hong Kong to do the same as you will not be sorry. Do this tour as soon as you arrive and really open the doors of Hong Kong food for yourselves."

The tour combined food tasting with an insight into Hong Kong life in Sham Shui Po as well as behind the scenes look at the restaurants and shops in the locality. It is a tour for anyone who is a foodie at heart, and doesn't just like authentic food, but also is interested in how history and societal changes affect the food. We visited about 6 restaurants starting with breakfast and ending with lunch in authentic places. A number of restaurants I would never walk in to by myself as a tourist but once inside the food was fantastic. My kids loved the rice rolls, pineapple (crispy) bun and roast goose and all the restaurants visited were very accommodating of kids - however none had a high chair. Also, most of the restaurants were tiny and couldn't fit a pram which had to be left on the street. Having said that, it was always safe and could be stored in the doorway of most the restaurants. The tour guides were Savannah and Fiona who were well versed with all aspects of the local area. They also provided recommendations for additional restaurants and shopping options. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting HK."

What a great time was had by all - Our guide and host Silvana provided not only a 3 \u00bc hour gastronomic and historical tour, but given the ongoing events of the time - a little bit of an insight into both the politics and underlying deeper socio / economics issues. All of which offered a slice of Hong Kong life off of the beaten tourist track. This tour provided an insight (and taste) of small family run businesses - many of whom are being squeezed by rising rents and real estate prices (the eye watering real estate prices make Malibu almost affordable by comparison). But I'm guessing that ultimately food tours stand or fall by the quality and variety of food - and so with super comfort food such as rice rolls and congee; a tofu dessert to die for, fresh soy milk the taste unlike any from a supermarket back home; braised goose and pork knuckle; and finally egg noodle with shrimp roe to die for (not to mention the century egg pastry!)A foodie tour of a city is always on our must do list and IMHO the HK Foodie tasting tour is the best I've been on and sets a new benchmark.

The team do a great job putting up an amazing tour (very unforgettable experience). What's not to love about the tour - the food, the history, the company (it's a small group so you're never lost in a sea of people and can ask all the questions to your heart content). Our guide, Silvana was a really really really (repetition for emphasis) amazing guide. Her enthusiasm, passion and genuine excitement sharing bits of her culture and her life with the group was infectious.At the different stops, the food choices are explained and the staff were a lovely bunch with smiles on their faces. The three hour plus on the tour did not feel like a chore at any point. I found it really engaging as the guide through the walking speaks through the history of the area, the food. She also worked her way through the group - getting to know bits about each and everyone (which I thought was a sweet, warm and personal thing to do). I loved this tour (can you tell?) and would recommend it to everyone and anyone whatever your interests. I enjoy getting to learn about food (so it was a no brainer for me booking onto the tour) but one doesn't have to be a \"foodie\" to get the best out of the tour - just an appetite and open mind for fun and to meet people.At the start of the tour, you get a guide with the stops on the tour and recommendations for places to go afterwards. I would recommend people to go along to this in the first few days of getting to Hong Kong as it sets up one's journey. (that doesn't really matter though, just go along for it - whenever, most importantly). GO!The Hong Kong Foodie Tour was a highlight of my time in Hong Kong. It was that good (I really loved and enjoyed it), I booked on the other tour they had (unfortunately, the typhoon had other plans...LOL). If you ever get to read this (thanks so much Hong Kong foodie team)."

The tour was a great follow up to a bus tour the day before. Our host, Silvana, gave us a great insight into life in Hong Kong. We visited 6 family businesses to eat and drink local food as well as visit sites of interest on the way. The food was excellent. The group was small, there were 9 of us. I think group size is restricted to 12. The trip was excellent and the trip was great value for money. I'd recommend anyone who enjoys quality food to join a tour."

The walk through Sheung Wan was fascinating with our guide sharing interesting anecdotes and pointing out historical sights along our route. For these, our guide stopped and had us gather around her so that everyone was sure to hear. There were 5 tasting stops, all perfectly spaced out.Unfortunately I booked this tour for my last day in Hong Kong so I was unable to return on my own, whether to eat or buy some fruit, or even to shop for gifts."

It's fair to say that we are of different levels of bravery with food and ability for walking about, but the food choices were safe while still pushing a few boundaries and the pace of the walk suited all of us.A special mention should go to our guide Silvana, who was entertaining and informative. She even helped my mum out in the tea shop buying some bits and pieces to take home. A captivating speaker, she made an effort to speak with everyone on the tour and did a stirling job of keeping us together and safe from traffic! The food selection was excellent and really opened our minds to trying out local places instead of playing it safe with branded eateries. We regretted not having time to return to the won ton soup shop, and I never got around to trying goose - but I will certainly now be hunting down these dishes and more in my local Chinatown! We had an absolute blast on this tour, each of us enjoying something different and taking some new ideas away with us.If we are ever back in Hong Kong we will be coming back for more foodie tours.A huge thanks to Silvana once again for being our guide on such a warm day, she did a fabulous job."

We went into the kitchen and saw the roasted meat hanging from the ceiling and watched wontons being made. Our guide introduced us to the families who ran the restaurants and they shared information on the food, how to eat it, how traditional Chinese families cook and use ingredients and eat their meals and even how to tell the difference between duck and goose on your plate!Along the way we were shown various sights and provided history and information about the area and how things were changing. Our guide was so knowledgable and spoke perfect English.Highly recommend his tour. If we had more time we would have done the other tour which covers breakfast/lunch."

This place looked so remote to me I didn't feel like it was my hometown. Hearing a lot of good words from friends, I randomly bumped into this food tour and decided I should give it a try to reconnect myself back to the town. The tour mainly aimed for expats and tourists, but the tour guide Silvana made my felt very comfortable and welcomed. Well, I have to say, I considered myself quite a local expert, but through the tour I learned a lot of local history from Silvana, along with the delicious food that filled my stomach. Good god, I even lived in Central for 2 years before I left for Australia, but how pleasantly surprised that she could still show me the faces of Hong Kong I had never seen before. And among all the tours I've ever joined, Silvana is one of the top 3 most favourite tour guide I've met. She had really in-depth local knowledge and took care of every single guests during the tour. It's such a pity she had to watch us eating all the taste food through the whole tour without having a bite!"

The guide was friendly and knowledgeable and provided the group with a leaflet which included a map of the places we went to, other restaurants which were recommended and suggestions for other foods to try. The tour went to locally owned, food places which produced the food on-site and where family run. It was an excellent variety of food (lollies, dumplings and roast meat) and definitely some of the tastiest. If you have a chance to do this tour, I'd certainly recommend it."

The meeting places were really easy to find if you use the MTR (underground metro), which is very simple. Equally, other guests took taxis and said it was also pretty simple. Even though the days I chose were super hot and humid, the guides were professional and took care of us with bottled water on arrival and air con stops where requested.

Luckily we had a great group with us, and no rude tourists like the ones who expected the tour guide to pay for a coke drink and items not on the menu).

Some of the great restaurants in Hong Kong are ones that tourists do not normally see.This was a must do tour. Many thanks Savannah"

Now it is not only food that is interesting in this area but also the markets and local businesses. Prices here are some of the best around and as Savannah says \"this is where the locals shop\".

I had made quite a few local friends who had shown me around the town including the local cuisine and where to eat (both more 'western' and 'local' places). I decided to take the food tour with Savannah on my own, curious to see the places she would take me in Central, which was the area I lived. After the first stop at the shrimp dumpling and noodle place, I knew the tour would be special. She took us to the best 'local' places, run by local families. What really set the tour apart was not only the fantastic food, but that she gave lots of local history about the eateries and the areas we were walking around. I really enjoyed the little things she would point out about why buildings were certain ways, or how she explained the taste and use of the funny looking vegetables in the the wet market. I did the tour by myself and was totally fine and happy the entire time! I liked the tour so much that I also did the Sham Shui Po tour too. On the second tour I ate foods I hadn't eaten the entire three months I was there - they were definitely unique and well thought out food choices. I also really liked seeing a working class Hong Kong neighborhood as it was very different from the often too western feeling Central area. I'm still dreaming of the pineapple bun and egg tarts\u2026never thought I'd really love these things but that's what Hong Kong does to you! Thank you Savannah for introducing me to some of the best places to eat in Hong Kong!"

We started the tour searching 1-1/2 hours for the meeting location. We have taken numerous tours throughout Europe and Asia and the majority of private tours meet us at the hotel or for an extra fee can arrange transportation to the starting location. This tour only came with directions from the train station once we arrived on Hong Kong island. Our hotel was located in Kowloon. We took the ferry across the bay and when we finally found the meeting location we were all in a very pissed off mood. I did comment to both tour guides about the directions and the female guide had a sarcastic comment back that our hotel was closer to the train station than the ferry. Here's my question back, \" since I don't live in Hong Kong, how would I know that?\" I didn't like her attitude after that. The male guide was awesome, he went to school in our home town so we got along great. My second complaint is the fact that we booked a private tour which is for up to 8 people and we only had 5. So I paid for 8 but they only needed to supply food for 5 so the rest was profit for them. My daughter wanted to try turtle jelly which wasn't bad and they didn't charge extra for, but they shouldn't since they saved the food cost for 3 people but they were too greedy to pick up the cost of 1 can of coke that my son ordered. Really? Aren't you making a ton of money already on me. That's just greed!!! My final complaint was that I spent 820.00 USD on the tour and they charged me 110.00 USD gratuity for 8 people as part of the total. Although there were only 5 of us, again, Greedy!! The term gratuity is given as a tip when the service is above average. The gratuity should have been at my discretion and not forced upon me and taken when I signed up for the tour. The food at the stops was tasty, but not the best I've tasted. I did a fabulous food tour in shanghai by a company UnTours that was outstanding and Jamie was an awesome guide. There was a large part of history on the tour but my husband really enjoyed that. They did provide us with good directions by train to get back to our hotel across the bay. It was an enjoyable tour but for private tours they should give custom directions from my hotel, not generic ones."

Silvana, our friendly and knowledgeable local guide, provided a real insight into the history of the area and also tempted us with the variety and taste of the food that was offered in 6 different family run restaurants, shops and tea houses, in this fascinating area. We walked through the Wet markets, which are gradually being depleted as property developers move in. Our guide was able to tell us about some of the fresh fruit we were surrounded by and she showed us a number of stalls which were selling dried fish products and live fish tanks, waiting for customers. For me the highlight was the wonton noodle shop and the tea studio, but my partner's favorites were the Chinese dim sum shop, (which we returned to the next day for more delightful dim sum) and the roast meat restaurant. Everything was fresh and authentic. We really appreciated learning about the cultural and historical background as we strolled through the small streets and laneways. But most of all we enjoyed all of the delicious food which we were able to eat on the way. We did not need any dinner that night."

Her knowledge of the local culture and food was very thorough: it felt like you were walking around with a friend who just happened to live in HK and was taking you around her favourite places. Unlike many tours, the structure was conversational and unhurried. Our guide was more than happy to discuss anything we asked about and really allowed us to see and taste heaps of things in a relatively small geographic area. The food was obviously the highlight (the braised goose is something to savour) but I cannot complete this review without mentioning the kitchen shop. If you are after a good knife, in particular a heavy cleaver, you are in for a treat. The meeting point is easy to find, and for us, only 5 stops away on the MTR (Tsim Sha Tsui). This tour is worth every cent \u2013 I totally recommend it."

I had a bit more time in the city on a recent visit, though, and decided to join a food tour to discover new local eats, as well as get to know the city from a different view.The Hong Kong Foodie tour was excellent - a good mix of Hong Kong's culture and food. It built my knowledge of Hong Kong cuisine, as well as local practices and customs. And it allowed me to explore parts of the city I had not previously visited.The guide adjusted to dietary restrictions quite well, which I very much appreciated, as I could not eat meat on the day of our tour.Wear comfortable shoes with good traction - you walk up and down stairs and inclined streets. Also, if taking an afternoon tour, skip lunch. There will be much for you to eat during the tour.Read more here: http://whyhellomel.blogspot.com/2013/09/a-hong-kong-tour-for-foodies.html"

Still it is well-worth it, since you couldn't know about the restaurant or what to order there, if you didn't have a local to guide you.

Rather than simply trust our noses, we signed up to explore the city with the experts of Hong Kong Food Tasting Tours.Our guide was Silvana and we embarked on our adventure with a group of ~8 at about 1:30pm. From there, we visited 5-6 venues for AMAZING foods, and got many more recommendations and tips for the duration of our stay. The wonton - superb. The pork barbecue - thrilling. The tea tasting - heart warming. The dim sum - naturally, out of this world! And the sugar cane juice - so SWEET! I have to say that the snake soup recommendation we followed up on later was also spot on (snake, too, tastes like chicken).Hong Kong can definitely be thanked for the fantastic food culture and cuisine, but without Silvana (awesome, awesome, awesome guide) and Hong Kong Foodie, we never could have tasted our way through such a fun Saturday.We would strongly recommend this activity to anyone who A) likes food, B) is good to walk the streets for several hours, and C) doesn't mind learning a thing or two."

I did the Central/Sheung Wan tour.There was a group of 13 of us, I think, plus the guide, Silvana, who was lovely. Very knowledgeable and friendly. The six venues we visited were all interesting and served some great food (I went back to the dim sum restaurant and the wonton noodle restaurant a couple of days later). A couple of the places we visited I would never have gone into on my own - just due to the lack of English signage and not really knowing what they sold or how to order!Don't eat lunch beforehand! You do eat quite a lot of food but it's spaced out a bit and there is a little bit of walking around so you have a few minutes to digest:-)) The sugar cane place, by the way, is absolutely fine. Its decor is original and it's not fancy, but it's in no way unhygenic as a previous reviewer stated. All my group drank their juice and enjoyed it. We could see it being prepared in front of us.Try to do this at the start of your holiday. I returned to the area and visited a few places that Silvana had mentioned (i.e. a market and the Central escalators) and then dropped in to a couple of the restaurants we had visited. You get a map showing the restaurants the tour visits as well as others that they recommend, so hang on to this, it's useful if you're in the area!There is another tour you can do to, in the morning, I think.

Part of the pleasure was meeting the other members of the group, but our guide (who I believe founded the enterprise) was the real star. She is charming and bright and very knowledgeable. And it is a great pleasure to be introduced to places that would be hard to find on one's own. The shop that sells roast meats, for example, is not one I would have thought to enter, but oh, my, the barbeque pork. And the won ton noodle soup place is a treasure. And if you don't know the difference between a Hong Kong won ton and a Shanghai won ton, you need to take this tour.

Our guide was fantastic, a Hong Kong native who pointed out so many hidden gems and details I would have walked right past. I didn't enjoy all the food we tired but that was kinda of the point, to try different things. Everyone in our group had a different favorite of the foods tried so they covered a wide range on this tour. I was the only vegetarian in our group but was able to eat something at every stop we made. My only critique of the tour is they should time the tour to allow people to shop at some of the stops. We packed alot in and had to keep moving to make each food stop and the website is clear that there isn't time to shop on the tour but you can go back after but it's hard not to want to buy something esp in the Kitchen supply store!Over all a great morning and when I head back to Hong Kong I hope to take their other food tours!"

The places we ate at were actually pretty good, however there was one location where we had a sugar cane drink that was just disgusting inside. I wouldn't drink my beverage as I had no idea how hygienic the place was. I was actually very unhappy they would take tourists to this location. Just disgusting.Our guide was very knowledgeable however, discussing the local buildings to kill time, was a turn off. This is a foodie tour, stay on topic. Also it was $90 US. Not worth the price as the locations were low price restaurants as the guide pointed out. $25 is the price it should be. Also, don't ask for tips right off that bat. Poor etiquette."

We chose the Sham Shui Po tour as we had been to Hong Kong several times before and thought it might be nice to get out and see an area we had not yet explored. Our guide was incredible and i really appreciated the way she looked after my gluten free needs. She advised what i could and couldn't eat upfront and offered alternatives along the way. Having done this tour i would feel confident visiting this area again (nto sure if i would have before this) and all i could hear my Mum say for the next few days was \"Can we go and have another pineapple bunnnnnn?\" :) HIGHLY recommended and a wonderful addition to any Hong Kong adventure :>"

I really enjoyed this tour (I did the Central one) - I wish I had had the time to do it closer to the beginning of my trip rather than so close to the end because I didn't have a chance to go back to some of the stops. It was also a useful orientation to the central Hong Kong area. The tour does go up some steps, and is long (about 4 hours), but there is plenty of time to rest, bathroom breaks, and the pace seemed fine to me. The only stop that dragged was the tea shop, the lecture on tea was much too long.The guide (Sylvana) was informative and nice, she provided a good mix of information and entertainment. The comments about there not being enough \"foodie\" information are unfair, I think. The food stops are not new wave or ultra modern to require exotic explanations, the food is sampling of typical Hong Kong fare. It was all very good and extremely fresh. I was happy to have the help to sample local dishes that I might not have known to order without a guide. There was nothing too \"weird\" on this tour - if you are looking for really non-Western food this is probably not the tour for you. No chicken feet or jellied turtles. But the food was good, varied, and the commentary was an interesting mix of local information and Hong Kong history.I've never been to China or Hong Kong before, so there were some things that intimidated me in ordering in restaurants and I have to admit, I'd been sort of sticking to restaurants that cater to Western tourists. But this tour gave me some information and experience in how to order in more local Hong Kong restaurants that that was well worth the cost of the tour.Really, if you factor in that you are getting a fun afternoon and a TON of delicious food - it's a HUGE bargain. Highly recommended."

It was a mix of food stops and other information about the area. They website said no more then 8-10 to a group but we were about 15!. As a foodie I expected more conversation about the food and why the Chinese people use certain types of herbs, spices, etc., instead we walked around learned a little history about the area and ate at 6 locations in total. 3 of which were beverages. I was somewhat disappointed given the fact you pay so much money about 90.00 US and get about 20.00 or less worth of food! A market tour of Soho or a restaurant tour would of been more interesting."

I will never eat another steamed BBQ Pork Bun. If you do the Central & Sheung Wan Tour, hang out for the BBQ Buns!! You will be fighting over the crumbs.

The tour took us to an interesting array of traditional eating places and all at a leisurely pace that allowed for everyones questions on the way. Our group of eight seemed just the right size in the busy streets and the temperature was perfect. A reasonable amount of walking up and down hills is involved so go on this tour with that in mind. We really enjoyed it, however those less mobile might find this a challenge, especially in humid weather.Some of these places may well disappear in the years to come as real estate prices continue to rise. If you want to experience the authentic food of Hong Kong today and catch a glimpse of the past then this is a great tour. Thanks Silvana, for adding to the richness of our visit to this vibrant city."

The stops were all local cuisines and the atmospheres and tastes were varied.

I absolutely loved the Pineapple bun, and have already found a source in London - I hope they are as good! We felt this was good value for money as all the tastings were included (about \u00a355 each for nearly 4 hours entertainment).

Although some of my rather elderly european family might not be the most adventurous Asian eaters, they loved it all! The favourite on the Sham Shui Po tour must have been the meats and the freshly prepared pickles at the yummy noodle shop. My other half loved the homemade soy milk shop (real, super fresh made-that-day silky soy milk - nothing like what you buy in regular shops out of a carton!). During the Central tour, the dim sum visit was superb and super fresh and delightfully light as they should be, we lapped up warming (and cooling!) teas and discovered the best locally made chilli paste on the planet! (I've been back three times already to by jars of the stuff..) Highly recommend and we're going to book the next lot of visitors who are coming around Christmas, we liked it that much."

Be warned though that it IS a walking tour and may not be suitable for older individuals, as we had a couple older ladies take extended breaks at the tea houses due to the heat and humidity (Silvana was VERY accommodating). That being said, the walk is very casual and very well paced, and is interrupted by incredible food tasting!

We wanted to book the 'original' foodie tour, the Sheung Wan & Central tour on our 1st of 3 days in HK but it was booked up despite us requesting this day weeks in advance? We wanted to go on a foodie tour as early in our stay as poss so chose the next available tour on the 2nd day which was the Sham Shui Po tour. With hindsight we probably didn't understand what this tour was all about compared with the SW&C tour but it certainly wasn't a pleasurable experience! Sham Shui Po is a run down area of HK, on the verge of being a slum! The 'food' on offer is the basic food that the locals eat, most of which is prepared in squalid conditions & is either bland or unpleasant tasting. We wanted to taste a selection of good HK food which presumably the SW&C tour provides. Please be wary of booking this tour unless you are very adventurous & prepared to try the local food on offer. The guide, Silvana is very good and knowledgeable about HK in general but we just the thought the food was too extreme for Western tastes. The area, although poor, was very interesting and the people very nice and welcoming but the conditions & cleanliness were a worry. The last place we ate in smelled of rotting food which made us feel nautious!"

Your delightful guide will also provide you with recommendations and valuable information about ordering great fresh food later on, as well as teaching you about the cultural or local significance of the food and the family businesses which produce it. You might also meet some interesting fellow travelers on the tour. The best recommendation I can offer for HK Foodie Tours is to tell you that I have booked a second tour for a few days time. And I can't wait!"

Silvana, our guide, was very knowledgeable, smart and took the time to make everyone in the group (there were 12 all in all) feel welcome and engaged. We discovered some interesting bits and pieces about the Central and Sheung Wan area, walked through some un-touristy back streets and had a great time, even if it was drizzling throughout. The food stops were also very good, some better than the others. Aside from food stops and the food information, Silvana also pointed out historical, cultural and architectural points of interest. I plan to take their other tour, Sham Shui Po Food tour the next time I'm in Hong Kong."

As I was travelling alone and not for the first time to Hong Kong, I wanted a tour taking in the lesser known aspects of Chinese food whilst also discovering more 'local' areas of Hong Kong in a group. This tour ticked all the boxes! The size of the group was perfect (6 people) and Silvana, the guide, was very friendly and extremely knowledgable about the food and area. What I loved about this tour was that I was able to taste food that I've seen many times before walking through the streets of HK and that there was a broad selection of food to try: typical locally baked goods/sweets ('pineapple' bun); drinks (soy); desserts (local typical biscuits) and savoury dishes (goose dishes and homemade noodles)! Aside from the great selection of food, the area itself is fascinating and REALLY added to my enjoyment of the tour! It was so local and appreciated Silvana pointing out all the history and aspects of life of a typical Hong Kong-er, which I never would have had the opportunity to learn about otherwise. From the way they live and the kind of accomodation they occupy, local eating habits to family run businesses: everything was a real eye-opener. The tour lasted around 4 hours, though as you're stopping every so often, wasn't tiring and time flew by. I would wear comfy shoes, though. There are rest stops along the way and time to take pictures - don't forget your camera; it's a photo enthusiasts paradise! You're advised not to shop during the tour (can see why, easy to get carried away!), though wasn't a problem as I returned later to the places that caught my eye, after the tour had finished.I fully recommend this tour for a unfettered insight into local food and life! Thank you so much HK Foodie, and Silvana, you really brought the tour to life!"

For tourists that want a more adventurous experience that is not in the typical tourist area of Hong Kong this is the tour to pick. My family and I are familiar with traditional dim sum so we wanted to experience something a little more unique and this hit the spot taking us to odifferent places to eat and shops in the neighborhood. Highlight might have been the place that served fresh soy milk. I have never enjoyed soy milk before but the soy milk here was delicious. Make sure you come hungry because they give you a ton of food spanning from breakfast to lunch."

As a solo traveler, I appreciated how much Silvana, our wonderful guide, included me in the conversation. Her history lessons on the neighborhood were incredibly interesting and made the experience that much richer. We visited six eateries, all specializing in something different. Since it was the morning tour, we started with a delightful breakfast of freshly baked pineapple buns and HK-style milk tea. Then we slowly worked our way through the old, working-class neighborhood, stopping at places of note such as an old pawn shop and a family kitchenware business. The day was filled with pleasant moments, like when we stopped to get bottles of soy bean milk and the shopkeeper let us taste his freshly made tofu dessert for free. At the pudding shop, we got to have our photos taken with the elderly owner who happened to be enjoying his breakfast in the small dining room. Of the dishes and traditional snacks we tried, the roasted goose was the crowd favorite dish. Just don't fill up on the accompanying rice as that's not the final stop. By the time we ended at the handmade noodle restaurant, I was completely stuffed!"

I also enjoyed the history lessons in between each of the stops. Even though the tour took about 4 hours (through Central and Sheung Wan) it didn't really feel like it was that long. The guides were very friendly, knowledgable and helpful. I wish I had done this tour when I first moved here!!

The places we visited were all off the beaten track and I never would have discovered them if not for this tour.

I want to come back and do the other tour; it will be first on my list of things to do!Finally, I thought this was just amazing value for money.

It is so easy to get to on the MTR too.

It was an excellent tour in an area we probably wouldn't have uncovered ourselves, and helped us understand local foods away from the normal dim sum style. Our guide Sylvia was really lovely and knowledgable and showed us local shops and market and explained history of the area, as well of course the food.

Next was a visit to a tea shop where we sampled several teas, and tried making our own Oolong tea. We strolled through the streets and visited the local food and wet markets on our way to Dim Sum, which was good - especially the pork bun. Last was a traditional bakery shop where we had an egg custard tart. This tour was excellent. Silvana was very easy to understand and it was really interesting.

The meeting spot was civilised, safe, comfortable and weather protected in the lobby of a nice business tower. We had 9 tourists on our day, 3 of them were my husband, 9 year old daughter and I. Silvana was absolutely lovely, intelligent, informative, polite, with a very likeable personality and a genuine passion for her profession. We were all given a brochure at the beginning, showing a map of where we were going, and all the details of the eateries we were to visit, and a bunch of other suggestions for later on, as well as useful Cantonese phrases.Aside from being a delicious and excellent quality foodie tasting tour, Silvana also covered food culture and customs, local heritage, impact of gentrification, the quest of quality SMEs in the food industry, residential living conditions and all sorts of interesting topics. It was absolutely fantastic, and while I spent a good part of the tour taking dozens of great shots (I'm a keen photographer), I was listening to almost every word she said (regardless of appearances). My daughter grilled me later on why I wasn't paying attention. I was paying attention, it's just that I was multi-tasking! I loved the fact that this tour gave us an intimate socio-cultural journey through the heart of Central and Sheung Wan, which we could retrace the following day (and we did in part). It covered Cat Street (Lassau Row) and The Ladder and passed local schools, aged care facilities, disability workshops and temples. It was probably the most richly detailed 4 hours I've spent in my recent life, and yet it was not at all exhausting. It was pleasureful throughout. They even scheduled appropriate toilet breaks. They thought of everything! You do need sensible walking shoes, and there are quite a lot of steps involved (great for working the pork and dumpling fat off your thighs!), so you might get an itsy bitt puffed at times, if you're not used to lots of steps. Silvana was also very good with our daughter - Not at all patronising, like some people can tend to be around kids. Our daughter asked lots of intelligent questions and Silvana answered with consideration and respect every time.The food was extraordinary and the choices of eateries showed integrity and a genuine commitment to recognising 'the little people' in the community who strive so hard to provide quality food and beverages that are true to Hong Kong's epicurean heritage. I once did a food tour in New Orleans that I thought was brilliant at the time, but this tops that one, hands-down.I could rave about this tour for weeks. It was highly educational, exceptionally well thought out, and I'll leave others to talk about the food choices, as they were all exceptional. Bravo HK Foodie Tasting Tours - LOVED the experience - Thank you so much."

We were a group of 8 from various countries which was a perfect size allowing us all to ask questions and there were a lot of them! Silvana answered them all expertly. The tour exceeded all our expectations and we would thoroughly recommend it to all visitors to HongKong both first timers and experienced visitors."

I had both an incredible guide and tour group- all very friendly. Our tour guide (female, but I forgot her name - I am incredibly bad for remembering names). Anyways, she took us to places I would have never known about or would have ever walked into. One place had zero English and no pictures to go off of when ordering and the staff could barely speak English. So in this case, it was perfect she took us there because I would have never gone else wise. My recommendation: Don't eat a lunch. Have a bigger breakfast. This tour fills you up. It's 3.5 hours long. Time flew, so if you think 3.5 hours is long, it is not. Also, if you are a solo traveller this is a nice option. Not only will it help you get your bairings and help you decide what to do on your trip, but its a good place to talk to and meet like minded people/tourists. It can get a little boring doing things by yourself. Surprisingly, this tour is partnered with the food tour in Chicago (one of the best ones I have done). Because of this it was modelled in similar fashion. So in addition to the food, she entertained us with history of Hong Kong, the different neighbourhoods, buildings, people, agriculture, etc. and she was very open and knowledgable when anyone asked specific questions. Enjoy!"

I not only sampled great local dishes, but I was able to get my bearings and then navigate the city so much better for the remainder of my trip. As I have explained to all my friends, the tour more than paid for itself. Rather than eating at the more expensive and touristy restaurants, I was comfortable eating what and where the locals eat during my stay in HK. I hope to find other tours like this in more cities. Until then, I can't wait to go back to HK to eat the delicious and inexpensive dim sum HK Foodie turned me on to."

This is a great way to try all the favourite delicious foods that you want to eat, but don't know what it's called or how to order it without pointing or getting lost in translation (mushrooms anyone? - inside joke.

Anyways, I digress.Book this tour and you won't be disappointed. You definitely eat a lot (not tasting size portions) and you do walk a bit (so good for eating a lot!). The best part of this tour is you go from place to place and everything is all set and ready to go for you. There's no waiting, no struggle to order what you want to try and you are provided a good explanation of what you are eating, a bit of history of the restaurant and much more!This tour is great for first timers to Hong Kong, regular visitors and even locals. We had some locals on our tour that were amazed at the different locations and even some of the back roads we walked in.

To find out about the other side of life - the old HK lady pouring water onto her stack of cardboard to make it heavier, as recycled cardboard sells by weight to the tea expert who really gave us a glimpse into why tea is so revered in HK and China - all of it so interesting and more than you would normally discover as a tourist.

We visited three small family run traditional restaurants, one Chinese tea shop, a Chinese bakery and a shop that made and sold sugar cane juice and turtle jelly. All the food and drink was made freshly by traditional methods, and it all tasted outstanding. We learned about different teas in the tea shop, did some tastings and learned how to make tea properly by the enthusiastic owner. We gorged on wanton noodles, barbecued pork rice, a variety of dim sum, and a wonderful egg tart.

Great architecture, lots of older neighborhoods (the old man's haircut place was eye-opening!) and of course living up to its name, this tour was a fantastic experience for foodies! There was a perfect balance of eating vs. strolling vs. learning about the history of Hong Kong -- i.e. right when I was getting really full, we took a longer stroll before the next foodie stop; and right when I was craving something sweet, we got egg tarts. Must have taken a lot of planning! Tour guide was also very knowledgeable about Hong Kong (not just food scene but cultural topics as well) given her native upbringing, though she was a great communicator and presenter in English as well! Especially loved the hole-in-the-wall roast pig place and the dimsum place -- the former tourists would never be able to find and the latter was simply delicious. What I wished I got to try a bit of was the Hong Kong style French Toast and milk tea! Thank you Foodie Tour for pointing this out and mapping it for me though -- I must return to try! Sounds delicious! Highly recommended if you're looking for a delicious afternoon, especially right now when the weather is nice and cool!

I ate a light breakfast, and then didn't even start feeling hungry again until about 11 pm that night. Thanks for the great experience!"

This was a great tour, and the idea is to give the visitor (or local) a good guide to some great places to eat in and around the Central / Sheung Wan areas of HK Island.We walked around a few food places over the course of the afternoon, and got some good ideas about more restaurants and food stalls to check out in the area, as well as whetting my appetite for some more things at the places we went to (from a Char Siu pork shop to a dim sum place).My only regret is that I didn't do the tour until my last full day in HK, so I didn't get the chance to check out these spots again and explore the menus in more depth."

I loved all the food we tried and found it really helped me feel more comfortable about heading into other local eating places that otherwise I maybe would have shied away from. Plus, getting a bit of the history of the area and the background story on some of our eating places was fabulous as well, Sylvana was a great guide - really helpful and friendly.I went back again for more Dim Sum and probably would have revisited more if I had more time - especially wish I had made it back to the roast meat place as that was my favourite. As well as the tastings we visited we also got a list of other recommended places to try and it was great having those tips too. Definitely try the French Toast place if you go to HK...so good!I would say that the food wasn't highly adventurous but I was fine with that and at a few of the stops there were other items that you could have gone back for if that's more the thing you are after (turtle jelly or roast pigeon anyone?)."

Our tour guide Silvana was very nice and was very helpful in explaining the food as well as the sites in history of the neighborhood that we were in.

I recommend not to eat much before, in order to fully enjoy all the great food that is presented to you during the tour. What we loved about the experience is that we went to places that we would have not dared to enter without a local, and this gave us a unique opportunity to visit and taste the food those places were offering. But this isn't just about food: our guide gave us much cultural and historical information, which helped us to understand and appreciate HK.

            "review": "Make this the first thing you do in Hong Kong!. I will be honest, I tend to travel on my stomach. If the local food is good, the trip was wonderful and I want to visit again. If the food is so-so or bad, I will generally try another destination. I live in the Pacific Northwest and there is a lot of bad \"Chinese\" food here and I am generally not thrilled with it. The Hong Kong Foodie Tasting Tour was absolutely wonderful and I will definitely visit Hong Kong again.I have never been on a food tour, but having recently seen a food tour being conduced in Portland, OR, I thought that might be a good way to get a feeling for Hong Kong. I did some research on-line and found this tour and read the reviews on Tripadvisor. After some deliberation (do I really want a tour? Me, who prides myself on going my own way?), I booked the tour for the day after I arrived. It was amazing and possibly the best way to be introduced to Hong Kong and the local food.There were 5 of us on the tour- two from the US, two from Singapore and one American living in Taiwan. Silvana introduced us all and kept conversations going throughout the tour. At each stop (5 in total), she asked us about the dishes in our local areas. We had fascinating discussions.The food was the star, though. The first stop was a noodle shop. It was my favorite! We had yellow noodle soup with HUGE wontons filled with amazing shrimp. She had us try the broth before we added any other flavors (red vinegar and chili sauce). It was the best I ever had and got a bit of food high from it. The next stop was roast meat. I saw a lot of roast meat shops on my walk through the city that morning (tour started in the afternoon) and was a little nervous. The shop window was filled with roasted duck, goose, quail, pork and suckling pig. The pork that was served was wonderful- moist, tender, flavorful and perfectly done. The third stop, after a wonderful long walk, was a sugar cane juice shop. That was the first time I have sugar cane juice and it was a real eye opener. It was sweet, but earthy at the same time. Very refreshing!We had a longer stop at a nice little tea shop. It was the most modern shop and the quietest. Ivan, the owner, was very knowledgeable and very proud of China's tea. We learned how to steep each type of tea, how to pour tea properly and now to really appreciate tea. It was right next to a neighborhood shire and was very serene.The second to last stop was incredible. Dim Sum! I had been looking forward to this stop since I booked the tour. It was amazing and exceeded all expectations! We had crystal shrimp dumpling, shu mi, baked pork buns and spring rolls. All were excellent, fresh and wonderful! I am used to the dim sum with the carts and large dining rooms and this was nothing like it. It was hot, fresh and had so much flavor, sauces were not needed.Our last stop was for the sweets. We stopped at a tiny bakery to try egg custard tarts. This has become my favorite dessert!Along the tour, Silvana pointed out other restaurants that carried local food and were good places to eat. I ended up going back to three of the tour stops and one of the other suggested places. I can go on and on about this tour, but I cannot put into words how wonderful it was. I felt so much more comfortable with Hong Kong, the food, the culture and the people from this tour. I would highly suggest you take this tour your first full day in Hong Kong. It was a great introduction to everything that is Hong Kong! As a side note, Silvana suggested a restaurant in Macua (I was going there in two days). I was amazing and I am so happy she suggested it!"

Not only did we have great food and benefit from a little narrative whilst walking around in Central and Sheung Wan, this tour made us more comfortable with the whole Hong Kong food scene. We are not food shy, but I doubt we would have braved a tiny cafe just off Cat Street for french toast - and worked through the language barrier - without the tour. Likewise, The roast meat shops are fascinating to look at, with hanging ducks and squab and geese in the windows, but intimidating. Now I would be happy to go in and negotiate a bowl of duck and rice, or char siu.We later returned to three of the places we visited on the tour. We intended to return to the tea shop, but got sidetracked and missed it.The tour includes a bit of walking but it is not strenuous, and the dishes are very approachable for people not familiar with Asian cuisine. I think it would be suitable for most any visitor, and very exciting for those who are not familiar with Chinese food. But just because the dishes are not adventurous does not mean they are not delicious. (I am the guy who would be eating fried scorpions in Beijing just for the unique experience, but I loved the wonton soup and shumai, too.)"

Silvanna, our tour guide, took the 5 of us around on an almost 4 hour tasting tour that also included history, culture, and local insights. Even when it began to rain a little we pushed forward and didn't allow a bit of wetness to dampen our spirits. We did buy umbrellas at a 7-11 after which the rain promptly stopped. :)The tour has 6 stops that allows you to try Hong Kongs most popular foods and drinks. Even if you are familiar with Hong Kong food the tour will take you to the very best places to try the highest quality items. The dim sum place was my favorite and I returned there the next day for breakfast. Additionally the places on the tour a super cheep so you soon discover something things in Hong Kong don't have to be so expensive to enjoy quality. The tour has lots of walking around the neighborhoods which is great but if you are less mobile this tour might be a bit harder to do. Also remember that the heat and humidity can be a bit much to handle if you're not used to it. At the first stop you get a nice cold bottle of water that helps. But you might want to bring your own or buy some at a 7-11 along the way. And make sure you were comfortable shoes!All in all I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting Hong Kong and has a few hours one afternoon to spent eating great food and learning about a fascinating city."

Our guide was a Hong Kong local and very enthusiastic and knowledgable on both Hong Kong and their local food. What was great was that she took you to places that you would normally never find, or would be a bit worried to try on your own. The food was fantastic - from barbeque meats, to dim sum, wontons and tea tastings - it was defnitely worth while. She also provided you with a list of food spots to try out once you complete the tour. I tried some of the eateries and they were really authentic and the snacks / food we had were excellent.

The guide was extremely knowledgeable on the various aspects of both Hong Kong food and the countries' history as well.This tour took us through Central which is one of the older areas off Hong Kong island. It\u2019s an easy walk through a mix of both old and new buildings and shops. Many of the restaurants we visited have been run by the same families for multiple generations, so you can be assured that the food is very authentic and a good example of local food culture.Included in the tour is a list of suggested restaurants for specific types of meals. We made use of the Hong Kong french toast and milky tea option on our own and it was excellent.If we\u2019d been on our own it\u2019s unlikely we would have ventured into many of these restaurants, but that\u2019s probably one of the best reasons for taking this tour. The locals are are often surprised to find tourists in their favourite restaurants or cafes but they\u2019re always welcoming and it\u2019s a great experience."

Some of these wonderful food places might not exist in the future as another urban rebuild is planned. If you only do one special tour in Hongkong make sure it is this one.

Wonton noodles in an incredible broth; meltingly good char siu pork from a tiny restaurant you wouldn't look twice at; dim sum of a quality far above more well known and expensive places; a tranquil tea shop (and a lesson on how to pour tea properly). Interspersed with all that great food was a relaxing walk through the back streets and lanes of central and sheung wan. One minute you're plunging through crowded pavements, next you're in a quiet back alley learning a bit of Hong Kong history from our lovely guide. All in all, an excellent tour for people like me who live here but haven't discovered Hong Kong's secret gems and a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon the next time visitors are in town. A word of advice: there's lots to eat on this tour so make sure you start it on a empty belly or you wont make it to the pastry at the last stop (I had to take mine home!)"

Food is as mentioned as other reviewers: bbq pork rice, dim sum, egg tarts, wanton noodles (which I also got it off my guidebook). During and after the tour, i kept wondering why would a local want to go for all these common items? I had too much expectations, perhaps for more adventurous food or things that locals would be really excited to get to know/taste. disappointing. saw so much street food along the way but didn't get to try, even though i thought those are the interesting food that should be in the tour."

My wife and I love to discover all the nooks and crannies of each city we visit, follow your nose so to speak, and go off the beaten track, those side street alleys in Florence, little ma and pa run eateries in Hakone etc. So when I found out about a new foodie tour in the city I live in - right here in Hong Kong, I thought what can they bring to the table that I don't know about already!! I was curious.As it turned out, it brought us an enjoyable day filled with wonderful surprises! As a Chinese brought up in Australia, not that I don't know what a wonton noodle is, or har-gow (steamed prawn dumplings), these types of food I can find in many places in this wonderful city of ours, but what was special about this tour and the food it introduced, was that the foodie guide brought us to new places we've never considered eating at before, quite off the radar, and all family run places with very interesting history and background. During the walk, we also noticed loads more of the history in the area thanks to our lovely guide, some of which we walked past every weekend without blinking an eye at, then it was like, wow... didn't know this was here with such a story behind it. Our guide was super friendly, helpful and informative at the same time, we felt very comfortable with her, like family.Some of the most memorable bits for me during the tour walk include finding an old small shop selling old school style cooking sauces that my grandma used to cook with, a 70s hole-in-the-wall eatery (which crossed our path during the walk, but not a designated eating location) was pointed out to us by our guide for some traditional \"HK style afternoon tea sets\", the tiny family run dimsum place that produced very very tasty treats, and a history and learning session in tea drinking which blew my mind (although the tea instructor could be less teacher-like and more friendly in general...). I was actually told off gently by the guide (in a very nice way of course... haha) because I wanted to do some shopping after the tea talk, but she informed me they don't encourage shopping as this is a tasting tour, but I'm welcome to come back later at our own time if I want to purchase some. I thought later, this is actually very professional of the tour guide, I was impressed.Anyway, we took the tour in April. We'll most likely try it again next year to see if they have a new route and perhaps some new discoveries! I will recommend this to my visiting friends from abroad, it's a fantastic way to see a different side of Hong Kong as we know it, and as long as you like to eat off the beaten track like us. ;)"

The food tour is excellent not only because of the great local food we had, it was the stories and the experience that really makes this special! I learnt so much even having lived here for a little while. It challenges comfort zones to go to small local restaurants and wet markets where tourists might be cautious to give it a try without knowing the language and what to order!! It is very organized and well run. The tea place is especially interesting where you can learn about all sorts of Chinese tea and their benefits! Highly recommended if you're looking for great food and experience!"

Perhaps I have a picky taste bud . Heading to the tea shop feels like a visit to those 'factory' shops that I dread in a group tour. Tea master was naggy. It would be better if we can save the time to try other food (I'm sure Hong Kong has lots more to offer) than to sit and watch a tea ceremony. Some of the food stalls (e.g. egg tarts and wan tan noodles) are just easy public knowledge. Ask a friend, do a google, or read some guidebook, you will probably get them. I didn't feel that the bbq pork rice was worth the tour. I tasted better ones on my own and I wonder if the shop was chosen because it was just in the vicinity.  To be fair, I like the tour when they touched on the family history of the shop, the history/culture of Hong Kong and even the walk along the Graham Street wet market. It gives more perspective than just the food alone.  But then again, for the price that you have to pay for a group tour (i.e. there was clearly a fixed route and fixed food items to try), I'm not sure if it is worth it."

Besides the food, you can even learn more about tea brewing and it was also very nice to meet the boss of the Tea Studio and I have learnt more from him.

As someone who has been to HK over 10 times, and who also gives culinary tours in Shanghai (www.UnTourShanghai.com), I was excited to take the tour, but also thought I'd seen and eaten it all. I set this up for 10 other friends who were in town for the weekend, and we were not disappointed. The tastings go through the best part of Central HK, and the food stops are interspersed with just the right amount of background on the city and the historical buildings. Our only regret is not doing it on our first day in town, because we would have definitely gone back to a few of the restaurants for a few meals (SMOKED PORK!). Unfortunately that wasn't possible, but now I have some more ideas on restaurants and food streets to return to next time I'm in town. Thanks again, and I can say without hesitation that this tour is a winner, even with a group as big as 12 people! Discounted group prices would be nice, and allowing for a bit of shopping on private tours would be nice (especially at the tea shop) but everyone was very happy with the tour! THANKS for making me look good by setting this tour up for everyone."

After spending some time in Korea with my Korean speaking relatives, and basically doing what they wanted - our visit to Hong Kong was on me for planning. I planned out the first day to do some sort of tour guide to get a feel for the city, and decided what better tour than one with food? Booking was simple through the website, and we had adequate directions to meet our guide - Silvana. My mother and I had a personal tour, and it felt very comfortable having a native take us around, and answer any questions we had. The food was great, Silvana was great - and the price was very reasonable. Worth doing on the beginning of your trip! We visited the roast meat shop that Silvana took us to the next day, and would have never found it if it wasn't for the map we were supplied during our tour. I don't think we would have been to find it easily. Even after having Silvana there, the next day it was a bit intimidating because none of the folks there spoke english. But, alas! Our food guide map had the english pronunciation for BBQ pork on Rice so we could order like pros. For a relatively new tour set up, this was run very professionally and I hope to try any new food tours that they have set up next time I visit. Kyle from Ann Arbor, MI"

I am not quite a foodie and my wife is quite particular about what she eats. She enjoyed this walk and tasting very much. All of the places we stopped at were clean and comfortable. This is not a gourmet tasting event, but rather an authentic look at classic Cantonese food and drink. Each stop had a special history and built on an overall theme.Our guide, was able to share an oral history, with a great appreciation for the city and culture.

Instructions about where to meet where well explained and the brochure she provided with route and info about tasting stops was well laid out. Her stories about the history of each of the food stops and interesting facts about the areas we walked around were great. Little things like the shop that made shoes for kung fu.The food at all of the stops was lovely. My favourite was probably dim sum square. This restaurant was reviewed in the South China Morning Post several days after my tour veryvfavourably.My son lives in Hong Kong and is keen to try some of the other restaurants suggested on the tour brochure.Overall, I cannot recommend this tour highly enough and I hope next time I am in Hong Kong, I hope Foodie tourschave started tours of other parts of Hong Kong."

The tour guide was extremely friendly and so full of information, having grown up in HK herself. The tour group was also quite small (around 10 people) and allowed us to stay together as a group on the entire walk, take photos and ask questions, in a private setting. The Chinese restaurants that where chosen for the tour were not only diverse and tasty, but all were owned and run by local families who were brought up, for many generations, in HK. Learning about how their families started and grew their business gave eating their food a deeper cultural meaning. The tour took 3 hours (with bathroom/water breaks in between) and even though you do walk quite a bit, it's as a nice day out, learning about HK, exercising and filling the belly with scrumptious food all the same time!

Far different than the other tours that I went on (to Victoria Peak, Harbour Cruise, etc), this one was the most authentic and worth every penny. The guide spoke perfect English, the \"foodie\" tour group I was in was small so you really get personalized service. The restaurants/food stalls that they took us were also visited by the locals and everything was yummy (egg tarts, wonton noodles, bbq pork, etc)! The tour guide was very attentive and explained the history of all these attractions in the area as we walked by them. It is definitely an off-the-beaten-track kind of tour and I would do it again!"

Not only do you get to try some of Hong Kong's best local foods, but you will learn about the history and culture at the same time. Silvana was a wonderful tour guide, professional yet fun and very insightful (and her English is perfect). We explored the quaint streets of Soho and Sheung Wan and tasted some of the most delicious foods in Hong Kong. Do this tour early in your visit because you get a pamphlet with all the best places to eat that you can use for the remainder of your stay. We had wonton noodle soup, roast pork, dim sum, and sugar cane juice just to name a few and a wonderful lesson on tea. Definitely do this tour, you will not regret it!"

Well, I never thought I would do something like this, going on a tour to sample food.. but since Hong Kong is famous for food and if you have limited time and energy, this tour is the best way to get a crash course in the city and its famous tastes. It turned out to be a lot of fun as well !!! Just be aware that bringing in extra friend without booking a ticket upfront is not going to work out."

I lived in Hong Kong for a couple of years in this neighborhood and was totally surprised by the tasting locations as they were tucked away like hidden gems just waiting to be discovered and enjoyed. With a funky variety of tasting locations, an awesome guide and scrumptious treats blended with a casual stroll throughout bustling Hong Kong - this tour is an absolute must!"

Silvana also told us the history of the food, restaurants, and some history about the surrounding areas. It was a great experience.I love food, that's why I had this tour with my friend.

I am an expat working in HK, and like most, I have visited and seen all the typical HK attractions. In fact, I just went by the typical top 10 on the Discover Hong Kong website. However, these tours are unique and not your typical been-there-done-that type of experience. Michael, the tour guide, speaks clearly and in easy to understand English. He mixes in very informative facts with some humour, history and trivia as well. He tells you what to expect upfront, and is always accommodating to peoples\u2019 needs. He has scheduled drinks / restroom breaks, will wait for latecomers or let them know how to catch up, allows time for photos and is never in a rush. The tours are run smoothly and efficiently, and are always well prepared. He even provides cups and forks for you for his food tour! All you need to bring is yourself and an appetite. I have also been on the history tour, religion and temple tour and even a hiking tour and they are all free - where you just pay what you want and you don\u2019t feel pressured to pay. The food delicacy tour (my personal favourite), does have a cost but you are basically just paying for the food and you get to try a large variety from snacks to desserts. The tour guide truly has a passion for it and it never feels like he\u2019s just \u2018reading from a script\u2019 and bored with it.  Overall, I recommend these tours for both visitors, locals (who have also commented that even they are seeing new things too), and working expats like myself. I have a new appreciation of what HK has to offer and it helps break up the routine of work, tall buildings and concrete."

Everyone likes something for free and I was very pleased I chose these tours run by Mike.The Delicacy Tour was run at night and the City Tour I did the next morning.Mike is well organised, professional and most importantly knowledgeable and very entertaining. Definitely NOT the run of the mill plug and chug follow the guy with the flag type tour!.The city tour was enjoyable and informative. We had a good look around the island side of Hong Kong. At the end of the tour Mike took some of us who were hungry to a local food hall for lunch (NOTE - This is not part of the tour and you pay for what you eat and drink). He helped place the order as well but could not join us for lunch as he had another commitment. He went above and beyond to help us with this!As for the Delicacy Tour, well I'm not going to say to much about the food as I promised to keep it a secret and surprise for his future guests. (NOTE - Though the tour is free you pay as you go to the food vendors for what you eat, it is so cheap as well). The variety of food is interesting to say the least. Much you will enjoy, some you will be challenged by, some you will be thinking 'I just ate what....????' but no matter what you will have a blast. I think the bigger the group you end up with the more entertaining it will be just watching everyone try to guess what they are eating. I am allowed to let slip one item I tried to the great amusement and thumbs up from the local men in the restaurant when I downed a very tasty shot of 'Snake Penis Wine'. It was really good, sweet and strong. It was doubly good as it had no 'chunks of snake manhood' in it ;)Don't worry as there are no bugs on the menu to eat but I'm sure Mike could find some to try if your keen and no animals are killed in front of you then cooked.Regarding the 'Free' part of the tour, yes it is free but a tip to Mike of what you feel the tour was worth to you would always be appreciated but as stated by Mike it is not expected nor is it pushed. I was more than happy to give a tip on both tours as it as well earned because Mike exceeded my expectations for sure!Go on the Delicacy Food Tour with an open mind and you will be rewarded by trying foods that the locals consider every day and normal for them. You wont eat like this at home, so just go for it!Cheers Mike and thank you for a really good enjoyable day and night.Regards,Milan"

As a result of how friendly and enthusiastic Michael was, we then decided to join the religion tour. Michael was knowledgeable and adapted the tour based on what we were interested in finding out. When I lost my phone on one of the minibuses, Michael went above and beyond in phoning the relevant people and accompanying me to the minibus stop point (during his own free time) which resulted in me getting my phone back. He really deserved so much more than the tip we were able to give him. All the best Michael and thanks for a great Hong Kong experience."

It was also not too taxing of a walk, and there was opportunity to sit down and rest whilst listening to Michael delve into the history of our surroundings. I will definitely be joining again when next in HK, probably try out the delicacies tour and really stretch my tastebud limits!"

As a local, we often neglect the obejects' histories & rationale of existence even if we pass by them on a daily basis (and most cases, we don't even recognize such object even existed!). Michael, the passionate guide who led the tour, have done so much fact finding and managed to condense all of the interesting information together with the well planned route was simply fantastic. Well versed and caring for those who joined the tour, the 3.5hrs walk from Admiralty on a Saturday morning was very enjoyable -- and I actually learned a lot of new & interesting facts about things I see everyday. Thank you Michael and I look forward to joining your other tours soon!"

The tour guide was well-informed, charismatic, and accommodating, and while the food selections might take you out of your comfort zone (no spoilers here...), you're sure to try something new and almost certain to discover something you didn't know you loved before. The tour will introduce you to local dishes and experiences not easily accessed by tourists, and the price is unbeatable.If you find yourself in Kowloon on a Friday night, you should definitely consider taking the cuisine tour."

He is very knowledgable of Hong Kong, speaks flawless English and is very considerate of everyone in the group. He never left anyone behind and waited for people who stopped to take pictures or who were simply slower. I really wanted to go for a swim as well, although the tour was intended to be purely a hiking trip and he of course accommodated for that! Made me so happy! By the end of our hike he even carried my bag (I packed way too much) as he saw I was getting exhausted from carrying it. I know he has 2-3 other tours in HK and I'm very excited to join again! I can definitely recommend Michael and his free tours :)"

I went on the Made in Hong Kong tour and we went to a print shop, sausage maker, qipao (traditional Chinese dress) maker, dried seafood goods shops, and more. It was about three hours long, and the time flew by. At each place Michael had arranged for the master of the industry to speak with us a little bit about his occupation and Michael helped translate English questions into Cantonese so that we could ask questions of our own.

I have already participated in three of Michaels tours: the \"religious\" tour, the \"delicacies\" tour and just recently the \"historical\" tour on Hong Kong Island, each of them special in its own way and absolutely recommendable. Michael is a great guide, very knowledgeable, dedicated and well-prepared, but also knows how to present historic facts in an interesting and fun way. As I had two friends visiting me for the weekend who wanted to explore the city, my past experiences with Michaels tours led me to recommend to them joining this walk. They were delighted: Hong Kong (Island)s history, sights and fun facts wrapped up in a nutshell! I have been living in Hong Kong for eight months now and although I had already done a good deal of \"sightseeing\" stuff, I also learned some interesting new things about this incredibly amazing city. So I can recommend these tours for visitors, tourists, but also expats who have been living here already for quite some time but for sure do not know everything about HK yet - I think even some \"true\" Hong Kongers might find it useful. And in the end, you have nothing to lose. As the tours are on tip-basis, it is in the end up to you to decide how much it was worth to you. It's hard to beat that in terms of value-for-money."

I found Stephen via a Google Search, and was immediately impressed, not only with his very informative website, but the service he gave me before, during and after my tour with him.Before my tour with him, he was very quick to respond to my emails, usually replying within 24 hours of me sending them. The reason I like to hire private guides is because it gives me a chance to personalize what I want to see. And Stephen was more than willing to make sure he included some of the more recent events - e.g., the Umbrella Revolution - in Hong Kong's ongoing transition back to China. My 8 hour tour with him was the end of September, 2016 and I have nothing but very positive comments about what I was shown and his explanations. He is very much focused on giving visitors a more \"authentic\" Hong Kong, focusing on cultural aspects of the City, rather than on common tourist attractions or more Westernized sections of Hong Kong. I happened to be staying in the Sheung Wan section of the Central District, which not only made it easy to start the tour, but ended up being one of the cultural centers he wanted to focus on. So my tour actually started from my hotel in Sheung Wan.My personalized requests included a discussion of the Opium Wars as well as the Umbrella Revolution, which he gladly described.Stephen is native Hong Kongese. And I greatly appreciated his ability to talk about the ongoing tensions that many Hong Kong people have with assimilation back into mainland China. His descriptions included the \"controversial\" use of the Simplified Chinese Character Set (which many there view as a symbol of Communist China). He took me to the Admiralty district, where students and protesters took over sections of Hong Kong's financial area during the Umbrella Revolution. Other stops on our tour included more temples dedicated to Confucius ancestor worship as well as the gritty markets of Northern Kowloon. I was also treated to a steep hike up a hillside in Northern Kowloon, where I got a nice view of Hong Kong's skyline. Also included was a memorial park where the British first landed and it is here where Stephen gave me a great summary of the Opium Wars.Probably the most unique and unexpected thing Stephen took me too, was the memorial park where the Walled City of Kowloon used to be. It was a fascinating place, photos and other memorials to what used to be a huge slum where native Hong Kongese were walled in, surrounded by the British during colonial times and up until the mid 1970's. After my tour, he gave me hints on going to the Tian Tan Buddha and other sites on Lantau Island. As well as recommendations on where to shop for some unique souvenirs.Stephen was extremely helpful, speaks very fluent English, and was very attentive to my wishes and needs. The tour included a lunch stop and when I needed, bathroom breaks. It was a great pleasure touring with him for a day and I give him my highest marks as a tour guide (and I've had many guides in many countries). I would highly recommend him as your guide."

Having traveled extensively, I look at guidebooks, history books, and TA reviews before finalizing any plans. This time, I was excited about our tour with Stephen based onTA reviews. Yet, I agree with rainecj: our experience with Stephen far surpassed our expectations in every way.Stephen's e-mail communication is immediate, appropriate and free of any sales pressure. He provided us with excellent recommendations and helped with every step of our itinerary. Of the days we could tour, he was only available for one full day. That is my only regret!His recommendation of Lantau/ fishing village tour was a surprise--but what a treat! Our tour was pure joy--beginning to end: beautiful sites, wonderful hikes, excellent knowledge of and passion for local history, culture, and people. Great eye for photography and hints for taking better pictures. We visited temples and wet market, fishing village and sampled foods there. We walked on a beautiful serene beach and stopped to see a local family owned food store. None of the sales pitch or tourist-filled sights. Instead, Stephen carries with him great love for and deep understanding of both--local customs and history and international history. His college education in history and government is a great help to his broad view of the world and understanding of the place Hong Kong occupies within it. To top off already outstanding experience, he researched and connected me with a Macau tour guide we loved (he never worked with her but did research because I asked for recommendations). That's not all! Within a few hours, I got an e-mail from Stephen that had a summary of our day with descriptors and history highlights. He was asking for feedback and ideas to improve the experience further. Truly, I have no suggestions--this was an outstanding experience in every way!"

We were met at our hotel, we purchased Octopus travel cards and then we caught the MTR to Sheung Wan and walked this interesting district visiting an historic ancestral hall. Back on the MTR to Sham Shui Po, a very authentic district and then our final stop was at the Kowloon Walled City Garden which has a very interesting and recent history. A 5 hour tour - bring lots of water for the Hong Kong humidity and sturdy walking shoes."

What I got far surpassed my expectations. I easily found Tung Chung via the MTR and met Stephen. The trip by bus to the Lantau fishing village of Tai O made for good introductions and Stephen's enthusiastic cultural knowledge was just the ticket. Although raining heavily, we had a very enjoyable wander under umbrella, through the streets, pathways and temples of Tai O. After a refuel of refreshing ginger pudding and bus trip to Pui O, we set off on a hike to Mui O taking in the Asian Water Buffaloes and other insect wildlife and then on to Tai Ho. The views from the coast and highlands looking out and back up towards Hong Kong were breathtaking as the rain cleared. I returned to Tung Chung, tired after the trek (57 yrs old), but full of wonderful memories. Six out of Five for this. Well worth the day trip out of Hong Kong if you want to see something different."

The highlight of the tour was definitely the Kowloon walled city park and its history. Stephen knows a lot about the history of all those places and can give really interesting insights regarding to culture and day to day life in Hong Kong. We all enjoyed this tour a lot and would recommend it to our friends, as it's a really special experience and a great chance to get to know the non-touristic spots of Hong Kong.

Stephen is a history and political studies scholar and he was able to fill us in on HK's conservation efforts and the political scene there.

Stephen is educated, personable, flexible and interesting. His historical knowledge is great (I was particularly interested in the period of HK\u2019s colonisation), he is politically aware and was also able to give us a lot of information about the Chinese customs that inform the HK way of life.

We have been on a 8 day City Trip to Hong Kong in March - April 2016 and during the planning fase we wanted to get the most out of it so we decided to book some private tours. As we had booked pior already a more city focussed tour I was on the lookout for a guide that could bring us more out of the city and to more rural areas including some hiking if possible. Tripadvisor brought us to Stephen. During the contact fase (mail), Stephen was on top of his game, pro-active, informative interested to understand our needs and he planned a complete tour around our requirements and shared the mainlines of what was awaiting us via mail. Our hotel was based on Jaffe Road (Causeway Bay area - Hotel Mira Moon) we agreed on starting the tour on March 29 from Tung Chung city which was 50 min travel by MTR with Causeway Bay station as our leaving point. Arriving in Tung Chung Stephen gave us a warm welcome he is a very open, communicative and attentfull person and truely interested in you as a person. We did a tour in Tung Chung, Ma Wan Chung village, Yat Tung estate and the Tung Chung Battery. From there Stephen took us on a bus going to Pui O a small beach village where he introduced us as well to something we didnt expected but very much appreciated being seeing Asian Waterbuffalo's wandering around freely in an area going to the beach. From Pui O we took the bus to Tai O where we had an excellent tour of Stephen including a very nice local lunch. Stephen introduced us to Wong Wai King a local Tai O writer whom has some kind of little museum and is famous for written a beautifull book about Tai O which we bought (personally signed copy) and gives insight on the history of the little fishing town. We also signed a petition against extending the Cable tray into the village as that would kill the already affected authenticity of the little town. From the town Stephen took us for a hike more in the rural part, we recommend to have decent walking shoes when going for a hike. Stephen brought us to beaufitull spots excellent for nice pictures. From Tai O we went to the Big Buddah, the Po-Lin Monastery and back with the Nong Ping 360 cable system, the last 3 not being part of Stephens Tour but we were lucky he joined us back down. Stephen is very knowledgeable on history, culture, politics, architecture, cuisine anything basically related to Hong Kong and even China in general. He is very motivated to give you the best tour of your stay in Hong Kong. Stephen speaks multiple langauages so do check for your own language if you would be less comfortable with English. We can highly recommend Stephen as your private guide if you want to see and be informed about a different Hong Kong."

Stephen was a wonderful story teller, captivating our attention the entire day by pointing out various important landmarks, and referencing both their historic and cultural significance to the city of HK. We stopped for a lovely lunch at Dim Sum Square (which we went back to later in the trip), where he arranged for a special lunch, accommodating my vegetarian dietary needs.

Not only did Stephen help me plan the day that I would spend with him, but based on my interests, he also helped me schedule the rest of my free time in Hong Kong, ensuring that I got to see the more touristic sites that were important to me, and easily visited on my own. All through my time in Hong Kong, Stephen made himself available via whatsapp to answer questions about activities, restaurants, and other tour operators. The day of the tour was perfect. It honestly just felt like I was hanging out with a friend that had many shared interests with me - a love of the outdoors, photography, history, and culture. He took me all around Lantau Island, jumping on and off the city bus, navigating fishing villages and hiking trails. It was a really special day that was the highlight of my time in Hong Kong.I would happily recommend Stephen to anyone that is looking to get beneath the touristic surface of Hong Kong, and see more of the city than just Victoria Harbor and the Peak. Additionally, the quality of the tour aside, Stephen is actually just a cool guy with a great sense of humor that's fun to hang out with and spend time with. If I ever go back to HK, I'll happily explore more of Hong Kong with him."

The tour ran seamlessly and without a hint of rush. He immersed us in Lantau for the day: fishing village, nature and hidden sights that are not in English guide-books. I still remember how delicious the peanut-stuffed rice cake tasted at a stand he recommended. I love Stephen's deep knowledge of Hong Kong history. He will gladly sprinkle information during the tours for added value, but if you're not into it, he does not insist. He will adapt to the group and individual preferences. I highly recommend Stephen. If you're looking to experience the relaxed, local flavor of Hong Kong beyond the urban glitz, I could not think of better tours!"

Stephen is very knowledgeable and quite personable - he happily met us at our hotel and proceeded to introduce us to various parts of HK. He was careful to ask our particular interests prior to the tour and really arranged visits based on this - much more attention to personal interests than we could have hoped for. Very happy to take extra time and discuss - he was not on a rigid schedule but rather would happily take some extra time if we had questions or wanted to see something in particular. Great value and our highest recommendation!"

We find ourselves burned out after 15 days running all over the country visiting vendors and attending trade shows. We look forward to our time In Hong Kong near the end of our trip. We enjoy the shops and restaurants, however there is only so much shopping and eating you can do and a couple days so we thought we'd look up a guide and go out of the city for a more cultural experience. Those searches lead us to Stephen and I must say it was a solid decision to spend the day with him. He's a wealth of knowledge. Easy going and his English skills are outstanding. Stephen met us at the harbor (ferry from HK). From there we took a 45 min bus ride to a fishing village where we toured the town and temples. Very cool stuff! We had lunch at a local restaurant which he recommended. We then hopped a 20 min bus ride to an area where a path goes along some wetlands that held water buffalo. Really cool to see them so close up. We went on a long hike (4 hrs) up a mountain and back down towards the harbor. What a great view the entire way. if you're looking for an outdoor adventure with a great historian, Stephen will not disappoint. Good luck and Good travels!Bill"

He is eager to share his city, it's culture and it's food and you can tell that it's more about sharing his passion rather than just a job. He is also very easygoing and a pleasure to be with. He was slightly concerned with us being one of his first Asian customers and he wondered if we would be as interested as Westerners but I think he did an excellent job and tailored the tour well.If you want to visit touristy sites, Stephen will not be the guide for you (and he would also recommend you to do it yourself) but if you want to have a feel of the real Hong Kong and it's different facets, then he's the guy for you!Friendly, prompt, knowledgable and reasonably priced, I would without reservations recommend him to anyone seeking a private walking tour guide in Hong Kong."

We're Malaysian-Chinese and although we have some cultural similarities with the people of Hong Kong, there was still a lot we didn't know so we decided to go on a walking tour. From the booking to drop off, Stephen was really great! He was thoughtful, always in contact and really took into consideration what we wanted to see and learn. He was also really knowledgable and like I said, although we do have some cultural similarities, I still got to learn so much about Hong Kong's rich history through Stephen, something I don't think I could have done without a guide like him. He also brought us to a loooot of food places as we highlighted that as one of our must-dos. I'm still drooling over some of the dishes! (The goose rice and the French toast were amazing).He also brought us to temples, parks and even a little hike for a lovely view, changing his schedule on the go to suit us as he got to know us better as the day went on. The whole tour was pretty off the beaten track and that suited us perfectly.I think going on a walking tour with Stephen is a great idea for someone who wants to know the real Hong Kong. Spending the day with him really gave me a feel of this amazing city and was just a lovely experience. Plus, I think that even if you're of a south East Asian background, you still stand to learn a lot from one of his unique tours so I would still recommend it, just be aware that his tours are usually away from the usual tourist hotspots so if you really want to see those, you might want to set aside another day for it. Thank you loads Stephen! Let us know when you come by to Sarawak :)"

He took us to the Lantau Island...there, we could learn more about Hong Kong's culture, their people, their jobs, their religion. We went to a traditional market. Then we took amazing pictures of a fishing port and village and after that we climbed throught a place where we could have a nice view of the complete Island! It was a great experience. Stephen is so polite and friendly and he knows well his country. I really recommend this tour. Don't miss the opportunity of learn about Hong Kong!"

It was our first time to the beautiful island of hongkong and our trip was to visit Disneyland for my 8 year old daughter.once that was done our energy was drained and wanted something for us the parents. Stephen being so well versed with english and knowledgeable and kind enough to take my daughter into consideration took us for a tour then ended up with beautiful dinner. Even my daughter loved thetour...walking to the peak and she did not complain. So if a child does not complain....it says everything.Thankyou for showing the three of us a different part of hongkong....a part where as a tourist we would have not without your help.Much thanks from us and Imaiah remembers you as much as she remebers disneyland"

Initial plan was to visit Lantau island, but since the weather forecast was not that great, Stephen was flexible enough to fullfill my request to do something else. He suggested to visit the Kowloon walled city and the markets and temples in the neighborhood. He is great guy, very knowledgeable and passionate. Every part of the visit was accompanied by history, anectodes and interesting information. I even got to try local food, from the most typical (roast duck with rice, milk tea) to the weirdest (pike intestine on a stick). On top of being a great guide, Stephen was also interested to hear about me and my experiences, I appreciated this exchange.I will for sure go back and this time, I will join him for a hike on Lantau. Looking forward"

He has exceptional cultural and historic knowledge of Hong Kong and China, and is able to share his insights in an engaging and personal way. His friendly person made for good company, where we always felt safe and intrigued where ever he brought us. I can highly recommend taking a guided tour, but take your time to communicate your interests with Stephen, both before and during the tour, so that he can make an exciting itinerary. We asked for the focus to be on local culture and history, avoiding all the touristy spots that we visited on our own and that can be read about in books. He took us to East Kowloon, bringing us to local markets & food courts, temples and even old shabby districts soon to be demolished. Along the way he explained many of the cultural quirks and traditions that where present all around us but often overlooked. I am very thankful how Stephen graciously shared personal anecdotes, making his factual insights uniquely real. It was interesting how many Chinese religious customs that have mostly gone lost in mainland China, survive in Hong Kong and are kept alive by the city's older generations. The best part of the tour was the Walled City exhibit. What a fantastic story!! :)"

The tour is very well structured and very interesting to understand the Hong Kong society evolution.First, the market tour helps to understand the traditional culture and appreciate the food diversity. Also the importance of the temple is introduced there and it will be illustrated by the visit of a local temple.After, the visit of the park is very interesting because it illustrates how dense the city is and how the lack of space have created crazy situation (well commented especially with the historical context of the area). The temple visit is also smoother as it is a very local and quite, so it is easy to ask questions.Last but not least, the tour of an old area is an interesting point to compare past and future.

We booked a tour with Stephen who adapted to our busy time schedule and personalized our tour based on what we wanted to see. He was extremely friendly, knowledgeable about the city, history, and food. It was a great tour to experience the city at a glance, including temples, street food, parks, public transports and a great city stroll packed with stories about life and customs in HK. Communication with Stephen has been flawless and he even sent us a planning and itinerary of Must-see attractions and places in the city after our tour. I would 100% recommend using him for your visit! Thanks a lot!!"

It was an amazing tour which was fully personalised. We were interested in Hong kong's history, culture and nature. So we started the walk in the district where he told and showed us a lot about the culture. Then we were given a short history lesson and visited 2 non-touristy temples and ended the day with a hike to a mountain from which we had a magnificent view of the skyline of HongKong. I can definitely recommend this tour while staying in Hong Kong especially because we went to places that we would normally never visit as a tourist. Stephen is a very nice guide and speaks good English. Thank you for the great day Stephen!"

The tour we had was at Tai'O village in Lantau island. One thing that is great is that Stephen is very knowledgeable. Any questions you have about Hong Kong or in general, Stephen will spark a good conversation. Therefore, the tour wasn't formal, but more fun and personal, which is exactly what we were looking for. Also, the length of the tour and place visited we're really interesting, and it was even better with Stephen, because he was able to explain a lot on the temples, fisherman village, history of the place, etc. which we would have never known by visiting on our own. Also, one thing that I must note is that Stephen took the time to learn a little bit on our cultural background (Quebec, Canada) in order to make the tour more personal and convivial. This is a major plus I find in a tour guide!!! It makes the trip not feel like a tour but more like a cultural experience with a local. 2 thumbs up!"

About Stephen:He is one of the nicest people I've meet during my traveling around the world. He knows a lot about the City, Chinese (and especially Hong Kong's) History, the Culture as well as Relegions. He will show you some very interesting places, which are hard to find on your own, and can tell you everything about it. I was really surprised how much he knows about other countrys and there culture all around the world, he was well informed about my home county (Germany) and also about recent events whats there happening. If you are looking for an nice, friendly, well informed, good english speaking Tour Guide I would totally recommend Stephen. He will make your stay in Hong Kong very special.About the Tour:The Tour was 2.5h long and startet at an good to find Subway Station on Hong Kong Island. He gave me clear instructions when and where we meet. Unlike me, he was there at time and waited patently for me to arrive. I simply underestimated the huge amaount of people on the subway and came a few minutes late. Then the Tour started. As my preferences for the tour was on culture and history, we started to walk through an local market where you can buy some really crazy things I've never seen in my life before (not even on similiar markets in china mainland). There was no other western looking people around, so I had the feeling it was a real local's market. After that we went on to an very impressive temple where he told me a lot about the religion and history of it. Then he showed me around the oldest part of the Hong Kong city and also explained a lot about it. I could write a 10p essay about the trip but for this \"short\" review this seems to be enough. Just go on and book your tour with Stephen. I had not that feeling of an touristic guided tour, it felt more like a travelling experience with an good old friend."

He is ridiculously knowledgable about everything from history to culture to nature, and he understands many foreign cultures so he can put everything in context for you, regardless of what continent you come from. He is also very up-to-date on current events and outs a lot of effort into understanding what is going on around the world, so even just talking about current events is very interesting! His English is clear and easy to understand, plus he has a great personality.He is also very accommodating- we only had a small window of a few hours with which to squeeze in a tour before or flight out, he was punctual and kept everything within our time limit so we had no stress at all. And in that short time, we learned and saw so many things, even in a small part of Lantau Island, that really surprised us.Even if you have only an hour or two to spare, I can guarantee that his tours are completely worth it, and if you are truly interested in learning about Hong Kong this is the best thing you can possibly do!"

            "review": "Great local tour outside the city to see the other side of HK. I had the pleasure of Stephen showing me around Tai O, a small village outside of the city - about one hour away from the city center. The place in itself was very interesting all though the fishing community the livelihood of the village had been based on almost has disappeared. From the village it is also possible to see the construction of a massive bridge towering in the nearby ocean making a very concrete contrast between the localized past and the global future changing the landscape.Stephen chose the site based on very brief questionnaire I filled out online before coming to Hong Kong making it possible to for him to personalize a guided tour that fit my interests. In my case it was history, culture and food. No doubt that Stephen has extended knowledge about Hong Kong and Chinese history and culture. This made the bus ride to the village in company with Stephen (almost :) ) as enjoyable as the tour itself. So if you are interested in the history about Hong Kong I definitely recommend Stephen as your guide. Finally, I had a day on my own a couple of days later and asked Stephen for a couple of recommendations for where to go in the city, what to see. I expected a couple of names of locations or sights and then I could do some research myself. However, in stead I got detailed descriptions including detailed journey plans using public transport on how to get there and continue to the next site. So definitely going the extra mile. Stephen is a very nice guy who is very enthusiastic about what he is telling about. And his English is also very good so no worries there! I had a really great afternoon.Thanks."

His tours are packed with culture and history as opposed to shopping and glitz. He makes the most of your time by letting you do The Peak, Star Ferry and other time consuming things on your own, as opposed to wasting time on lines.he also makes great suggestions and sends directions and pictures for things to do and see apart from the tours. He made our time in HK wonderful.Abraham AlvarezNYC"

He planned the tour in advance according to my interest and time so I really could get the most out of the tour.We walked around the older parts of the Hong Kong island; went to the \"wet market\" ; saw temples hidden between skyscrapers ; and even had a local breakfast.It's an amazing thing to have a tour guide that does not only know the place and its history but also lives (and loves) the place and the culture. This way we really saw the city from inside and I got an opportunity to feel the local Hong Kong culture.

Who knew Hong Kong was more than just a lil big city with pop flashy lights, towering towers, and suited up suits crawling out of the woodwork. What I loved most about our city walk and island hike was Stephen's accute attention to detail and his conversational prowess. It is rare I meet individuals who are aptly able to discuss anything and everything in between... not to mention while hiking for 8 hours in high humidity uphill both ways! Ok ok... maybe it wasn't uphill both ways but goodness knows I felt the burn after! Such an awesome day with such an awesome individual. The day hike on Lantau Island from Tung Chung to Tai O was a fabulous experience I will never forget!"

Before the tour, he was incredibly detailed with planning a tour that I would be interested in and giving me all necessary information I would need for getting to Lantau and he gave me some tips for my entire Hong Kong stay. He really did a great job doing a tour customized to me. He was incredibly knowledgeable about Hong Kong and Chinese history, their politics, and the local culture. I had mentioned being curious about how chinese characters differ from Japanese kanji as I live in Japan, and he went out of his way to discuss the meaning of different characters around town. He took me on brief hike up the side of the village and I got to see a side of Hong Kong I didn't know existed. He also sent me a detailed self guided tour for my last day of Hong Kong and it was also just as careful considerate of my likes and what I needed to accomplish on my last full day. Stephen's love for his culture and history are evident in his tours and you leave knowing much more than you did before you started. I would recommend Stephen's tours to anyone, especially those looking to dig a little deeper into the culture and history of Hong Kong."

Only after requesting reservations, however, did I realize the expense: $115 an hour...not including meals! So I did some research of Little Adventures and read several positive reviews. I also came across some negative ones and was impressed with the thorough and personalized responses Little Adventures gave to these (few) disgruntled customers. Overall, reading these reviews helped me decide to keep my booking, convincing that I would indeed be getting my money's worth: a catered food tour with excellent customer service. Daniel was assigned as my Won-ton-a-thon tour guide, who freelances with Little Adventures when not providing PR for local restaurants. And before my tour, Little Adventures and Daniel himself were good about corresponding with me, addressing all my concerns and detailed tour preferences.Daniel is an eccentric individual, incredibly well traveled, a skilled conversationalist, and very knowledgeable about culinary arts. During my food tour of Sheung Wan and Wan Chai districts, I ate some delicious, local, \"the camera eats first\" food (and which Daniel partook; which should be expected, but the custom to pay for the tour guide's meals, as well as you own, is not clearly mentioned from Little Adventures). Though I immensely enjoyed the food, for me, the highlights of my tour were of what I visited and experienced: one of the oldest local supplier of snake wine, meat, and medicine, a 4 time Michelin recommended Cantonese roast meat shop, an 80-year-old candy store, the birthplace of Wonton noodles in Hong Kong, the oldest market street, one of the oldest (and notoriously hard-to-find) speakeasy bar, an iconic sugar cane juice ship (since '68), the oldest temple in Hong Kong (and which incidentally some historians think is responsible for giving Hong Kong its name), and the infamous wedding cart street. Besides giving us a historical tour, Daniel also gave some invaluable local knowledge: taxi drivers, once you're inside their taxi, legally have to take you wherever you want to go; if they refuse, just ask to be taken to the nearest police station where you can ask for directions. Hah!In the end, I paid approximately $400 USD for a 3.5 hour tour, and spent an extra $650HKD for souvenirs and food. Though I still feel Little Adventures' fees are a bit inflated (due to a lack of competition, or perhaps a \"value-based pricing\" strategy), I thoroughly enjoyed my tour and was thankful for my tour guide, teaching me that sometimes it's worth budgeting for experiences like these.

It was our very first experience in Hong Kong and a brilliant introduction to the city. Our tour guide Daisann was fantastic. Her knowledge of China's culture, food, and politics is second to none (she's an award winning travel writer). We experienced an amazing combination of local food, history, and customs. Learning about Hong Kong's past and present added depth to our trip and gave us great perspective throughout our stay.BOOK THIS TOUR!"

They will also share tips and information on things to do while you're in town and must try food and cultural experiences."

Thank you Diasann for a passionate and fascinating glimpse into what it is like to live in Hong Kong.

Daniel is so knowledgeable, trained as a chef and works in the industry. He is a lot of fun too. Our first stop was the historic Honolulu Caf\u00e9 which was filled with locals having breakfast. We joined them with egg custard tarts and macaroni soup, all delicious and part of Hong Kong breakfast traditions. .Next he led to a variety of food markets pointing out the various fruits, vegetables and meats and poultry for sale. The whole time we walked, Daniel taught us about Hong Kong history, home life and religion. We asked for restaurant recommendations near our hotel and they were both outstanding! Thanks Daniel and Little Adventures in Hong Kong for a wonderful morning's introduction to a great city."

Janice was so incredibly knowledgable, insightful, and interesting. She knew the answer to every single question that we asked, even the most obscure ones. We did not realize that learning about the food of a city could be so fascinating and could teach us how so many of the unique traditions in Hong Kong came to be.

We started with a morning snack of yum cha in a popular local eatery, then walked through a variety of markets selling herbal and traditional medicines and to a shop selling a variety of Cantonsese cooking sauces and pastes. We then saw temples, markets, specialist food stores and tea shops, and had a guided formal tea tasting, before heading onto the wet markets and seeing the vast array of foods on offer there. Finally we had a wonderful and delicious guided dim sum lunch before heading back to the airport to catch the next flight. All of the things we saw and tasted were accompanied by fascinating, insightful and entertaining conversation with Daisann, covering the cultural, political, historical and artistic side of Hong Kong.

She took us to a tiny dim sum restaurant filled with locals that we never could have navigated ourselves and explained the history, culture and local customs as we toured the Hollywood Road district. The entire experience, from booking through farewells, was handled with professionalism and courtesy. Highly recommended."

Little Adventures hooked us up with Janice, a great person/food blogger/guide to show us around HK Island for the evening. They were able to ensure we tried everything we wanted and then some. While a little pricey (4 hour = $460), we were able to sample a huge variety of food. My suggestion to maximize both the price and the experience is to max out the group size (I believe 3 or 4); with 2 we found ourselves getting full earlier than we would have hoped (this might be a personal problem :), but I suspect with a larger party this could have been mitigated and price split between 2 couples would have been a great price point.All-in, really was a fantastic night. Learned much about the city, culture, food, and went home fat and happy!"

This was our second time in HK and I wanted to make the trip memorable and do something very different. I had read about the custom walking and food tours offered by Little Adventures Hong Kong and knew that they would be ideal for what I was looking for, especially since their custom tours are meant for no more than 3-4 people. Communicating with Daisann at Little Adventures HK was very easy via email before we arrived. She helped understand what experiences we were looking for and customized two different 4-5 hour walking and food tours for us. These were truly the highlight of our stay in HK. The first tour was the Won Ton-A-Ton food tour and what a full day of touring! Taking a tram on HK Island we went to an old HK coffee shop of which few remain. What a walk back in time and a unique part of the HK heritage. After tasting a vanishing array of coffee shop delights (milk tea, egg tarts, scallion bun and crust less toast spread with peanut butter and warm condensed milk) we walked the streets in Western where all the amazing Chinese shops are that displayed dried everything, most of which Daisann had to define for us and explain how and why these herbs, fish, etc. are used. Daisann had a wealth of information for she can speak Mandarin and has lived in HK for 12 years (formerly a New Yorker!). Dim Sum lunch followed in a restaurant where only Mandarin was spoken. What an amazing and delicious lunch she chose for us, my favorite always being the sea cucumber! We ended our full day by an impromptu walk through the student \u201cOccupy\u201d which was occurring at the time in Central. This was a profound experience and Daisann helped us understand the reasons for this occurrence. Our second tour took us to the far reaches of HK that most tourists would never ever stumble upon on their own, Shau Kei Wan and Sam Ka Tsuen. Shau Kei Wan is an old sea village and we walked its street market which was very busy this being a Friday. Best of all, no tourists so we drew quite a few stares. We sampled various teas at a teeny tea house and visited a shop for one of Daisann\u2019s favorite snacks which were waffles that tasted like ice cream sugar cones! We walked many of the old streets of the area which were studded with very very small and old shops. Of course walking makes one hungry so we stopped at a terrific noodle shop where they make their own fish cakes and fish ball noodle soup. I could have stayed there all day eating that soup it was soooo delicious! We then strolled along a nice promenade and typhoon boat harbor to get to an old ferry that took us across Victoria Harbor to the old fishing village of Lei Yu Mun famous for its fresh seafood restaurants, and what restaurants they were! Huge and many tanks with all sorts of fish and sea creatures available to be cooked and served to you in the associated restaurant. Enormous blue lobsters, huge king crab, and cuttlefish were only some of the offerings among the variety of fish available. Walking through the narrow alleys of restaurants led us to the real gem of this tour: the 80 year old village of Sam Ka Tsuen. This village represents a typical fishing village of HK looking just as it did decades ago. The contrast between this old village and the glaring lights of HK Island across the harbor was jarring, especially as now it was dark. What an amazing two days of touring with Daisann. She gave us experiences of HK we never would have achieved on our own and filled us with knowledge of its cuisine, culture, history, and people in ways that only someone truly in love with her adopted city could. There was nothing that we disliked about our experiences at all and the tours are no problem for anyone who loves walking, to learn new things, and to have fun exploring the unknown. Thank you Daisann and Little Adventures of Hong Kong for making our trip truly memorable!"

My partner and I had a great time - our guide, Emma, was a fantastic tour leader, and I found her enthusiasm and genuine personal interest in the history of Hong Kong to be a highlight of our walk around Wan Chai. She is a lifetime resident of Hong Kong and her personal background is very interesting and unusual. The tour took in a wide range of different local, religious and historical sites, was an easy walk that was just the right distance and not at all challenging. The food and drink samples were great - not just typical Asian fare but also a Chinese medicinal tea shop and a typical breakfast - who knew about toast and butter with condensed milk, as a traditional HK meal? Not me, anyway. Our group was particularly lucky in that one of the group lives on Macau and brought Portuguese egg tarts for us to share and compare with the HK version. I definitely recommend this as a relatively quick and easy way to get to know more about Hong Kong, and if you're lucky, you'll also get Emma as your guide. She was also very helpful in recommending restaurants to visit at other times, and providing contact details for some medical treatment I needed while I was there. Thanks Emma!"

Daisann met us in the lobby of our hotel - The Pottinger in Central (fantastic as well!) - she sat us down for about 15 minutes to get to know us both and tell us a little about herself, the places we would be seeing, and the plan for the next 4+ hours. Then we got started -- she took us to the most amazing little hole-in-the-wall places that we never would have found by ourselves -- we felt like we experienced the \"real\" Hong Kong, not just the tourist spots we were able to research on our own. Our favorite stop was an outdoor restaurant with the most fantastic, flavorful tomato noodle soup we've ever had. Daisann felt like more like a friend than a tour guide. She's incredibly knowledgeable, intelligent, funny, and genuine. We couldn't have asked for a better tour. It was worth every penny. Thank you Daisann!!"

We had a very short time in Hong Kong, and we chose these tours over all the things that everyone we had talked to told us we had to do. We were so pleased with our decision, as we saw things that an unguided visitor would never see. The first was a four hour walking tour. We first experienced an outdoor cafe serving retro HK haute cuisine. Imported items such as macaroni and canned tomato soup, incorporated into the Cantonese palate in an interesting and delicious way. In another tiny shop, we had the most incredible crackling pork, roasted until the skin was crisp, thick and still delicate. We had a tea tasting and the opportunity to purchase some tea. We roamed the streets of the herbal markets where dried ingredients are sold both for traditional Chinese medicine and for incorporating into everyday cooking. Finally, we had soup in a noodle shop where perfect noodles are stirred into a flavorful broth with some vegetables and Wonton. We revived to go to dinner at a Cantonese restaurant with a chef as our guide for our second tour. He had spoken to the restaurant chef earlier in the day and had preordered some dishes. We had a multi course meal and had the benefits of descriptions of the preparation of our dishes in English, and a Cantonese speaking guide to help us order. It was a spectacular experience. This is a Foodies must do!"

It was first on the tour and I wanted to eat the entire bowl but I held back so I'd have room for more. Saved it on my Google maps, however, for next time :) Tea tasting was really cool too. I highly recommend the tour.One star off because of the price, however. I ended up shelling out $500 USD total. Around 450 for the tour and another 30 or so for the food. And it was a little insulting to not only have to pay for my food, but also for the food my guide ordered and ate, which was unexpected.I have done other Hong Kong tours for 1/3 the price of this one and I did not have to pay a dime for the food and drinks we had. It would have been more reasonable if I had someone with me to split the cost, but I didn't. I wouldn't recommend it solo unless $500 is a drop in the bucket for you. There are better tours for the solo traveler out there. With two people to split the cost the price wouldn't be AS bad (only double what I paid for some other tours I did that were just as good)."

I did this tour as my apartment was in Wanchai and it was a great introduction that gave me a little more confidence in getting around. Daniel is a wealth of knowledge, particularly with restaurant recommendations. He clearly has a passion for what he's doing and it shows in his tour.For the private walk, Daisann and I went back and forth a bit trying to find an itinerary that would work given that it was Easter Sunday and Ching Ming, and that we had a flight in the later afternoon. We decided on a food-centric walking tour of Sheung Wan, which I was a little apprehensive about as I had done some exploring in that area myself. However, she was able to shed a whole new light on the region and showed us some really interesting places that I had not seen. It was a great way to spend half a day, and the timing worked out perfectly.Then, as if the two tours by themselves weren't enough, when we returned to HK after a trip to Palau for a night, she had left us an amazing present at the hotel we were staying at.

I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Little Adventures.My travel companions and I arrived in Hong Kong while Chinese New Years was in full swing and thus found that our guide books and many online advice columns were useless in directing us to restaurants and cultural activities, not because they lacked pertinent information or failed to interest us, but rather because everything was closed!We contacted several food tour companies most of which were either closed or fully booked. Little Adventures went out of their way to accommodate us, opened especially for us, and led us on an amazing tour even amidst the closure of many of the top locations they normally visit. Daisann was extremely personable, knowledgeable and tailored the tour to suit our interests, while also giving us a taste of the Hong Kong only a seasoned local could find, and showing us the things we wouldn't have even known to ask or look for. Our discussions covered everything from architecture and real estate, culture, religion, cuisine, to fortune tellers, politics, traditional medicine, and daily life in Hong Kong, while we visited local buildings, markets, restaurants and even a temple. Our group consisted of a Chef, a Chinese-Canadian, and a History teacher, and all three have declared ourselves to be wholly satisfied and pleased with the accuracy of the information imparted to us, as well as with the food selection. I would highly recommend this tour, and hopefully will be able to use this company again."

Despite everything being closed and being turned away by every other tour operator, she was willing to take us out on an adventure in the city. Learnt so much about the culture, history and food. The food we tasted was truly authentic and could not have been experienced without her presence. In addition, updated restaurant guides and 'things to do when not with us' made the booking last much longer than the 3 hours we booked. Furthermore, she went above and beyond - not a clockwatcher, and more than able to answer any questions that we could have thought of. I certainly plan to come back and book with them again.This experience made HK feel like a second home.Don't worry about the price, it's worth every penny."

We ate foods and went places we never could have found on our own, visiting small villages and eating local specialties, listening to Daisann converse in Chinese with the local people. We toured the markets and learned what many of the dried herbs and foods were used for, drank medicinal teas, and began to understand what Hong Kong was all about. Our three tours with Little Adventures were the best possible way to get to know the real Hong Kong."

We have lived in HK for over a year and always wanted to do a tour, to learn more about the culture and one that i could recommend to all our visitors - well we found it. We did the Wan Chai Food and Culture Tour and it was excellent. Our tour guide was Daisann, a fascinating American lady who can speak incredible Cantonese and has lived in HK for a long time. We went to a traditional tea house and tried some delicious HK breakfast food, roamed around the markets learning about all the food and traditions, tried some Chinese medicinal tea, visited the temple in wan chai and sampled the famous egg custard tart. I learnt so much and enjoyed every minute. My only complaint is that i wish it had been longer. It was 3 hrs long and the time flew by. We didnt have time to do everything on the list. 4 hours would have been perfect, to fit in the rest. But the tour was still brilliant and i would highly recommend it to everyone - visitors and expats."

I was in Hong Kong for work and didn't have much free time to experience Hong Kong outside the business setting, but one thing that I really did want was to get a sense of what Honk Kong is like beneath the skyscrapers. I emailed Little Adventures in the evening thinking that there was no way they could accommodate me for the following day, but to my delight I got a prompt response that I could join a group tour the following morning. I did the Wan Chai tour and it really was more than I even hoped it would be. Daisann was a wonderful guide and the tour was filled with interesting facts and stories about Hong Kong and its history, as well as what daily life is like for the locals. We also stopped by various places and had some very good food, that on my own I never would have ventured out to try.Once the tour ended I continued walking with Daisann as she was going in the direction of my hotel anyways and she kindly asked if I wanted to grab lunch with her. I happily accepted and we ended up having lamb curry at a Cantonese Muslim spot that I most definitely would not have known on my own. That meal I shared with Daisann is one of my favorite memories of my visit to Hong Kong and was truly a highlight of my trip that I love to share with people that ask me about the trip. That gesture on Daisann\u2019s part really speaks to her as a person and she brought that same enthusiasm and care into her tour. More than anything, my experience with Little Adventures was like coming to Hong Kong to visit a friend; I really got a much more authentic and personal experience. I wish Little Adventures and Daisann could be in every place I visit. Thank you Daisann and Little Adventures!"

Although I am Asian and not unfamiliar with street stalls, markets and temples I learned so much walking around Wan Chai with Daniel. Sure, you can read guide books but going on a tour with an insider, you get news and little snippets that are \"now\"... everything from real estate prices to the latest restaurant trends. Fanling with Daisann the next day proved just as informative. We got to see how the Hakkas lived in walled villages which are really at the point of disappearing with the encroachment of new developments. I loved both tours, enjoyed the lunches we had with Daniel (who is a trained chef and so knows his food) and Daisann very much.

This was our first visit to Hong Kong and we signed up for two excursions, a walking tour with a focus on local food (markets and cafes/restaurants), and a guided Cantonese meal. Both added so much to our trip, and provided a deeper understanding of the unique culture of Hong Kong (and put into context the current student protests and some of the challenges faced in this region). Daisann was our walking tour guide, and her passion for and knowledge of Hong Kong as well as her flexibility and good humor made the tour a real pleasure. Daniel was our guide for the Cantonese meal, and the dishes he selected as well as his explanation of the customs, preparation and presentation made a delicious meal truly memorable. He also recommended a fabulous tea shop and another restaurant that was a favorite with locals to try on our own , where we enjoyed fabulous roasted pork and duck. Both Daisann and Daniel went above and beyond to help us before and during our visit, and we highly recommend Little Adventures In Hong Kong, whether your interest is Hong Kong cuisine, culture or a mix of the two."

Being an Australian living in Hong Kong, I already have some knowledge of HK, its food and culture, but, unfortunately, no Cantonese. I booked a tour with LAHK to give me, and some visitors from home, access to the amazing world of local food that a Cantonese speaker can provide. Daisann, and her tour, far exceeded our expectations. Much more than a food tour, Daisann treated us to her immense knowledge of Hong Kong food, its history, and, at this important time of the Occupy Central protests for democracy, the social and political fabric of the city. An amazing time to be in Hong Kong.Setting out in the morning for some extremely tasty dim sum in Sheung Wan, Daisann was able to order a variety of dishes for us, explain them and engage in some jovial banter with the trolley ladies which, in addition to few laughs, provided a very local experience for us - her Cantonese is fluent. We were guided through the winding streets of dried seafood sellers and herbalists, explanations and discussions along the way, stopping for milk tea and more snacks at a cha chaan teng .. all excellent!Daisann tailored the tour to suit our particular interests in addition to food, in this instance urban and cultural planning. The stories and history Daisann provided, allowed us a unique opportunity to view the city from a newly informed perspective and understanding. We had such a great time with Daisann, who is very entertaining and an absolute fountain of knowledge, that we ended our tour in the air conditioned shelter of a pub where we had a few drinks and continued chatting.It was a fantastic tour.

We ate SO well (roast goose, pork, amazing noodles) but even better, learned about the preparation and what went into it from a proper chef, which Daniel happens to be. What also made an impression on me was the fact that the LAHK folks are into sustainability and locally made food (this appeals to Brooklynites, the stereotypes are true).

I was assured that Johannes was a more than competent and very accomplished guide. He seemed to be a nice person upon meeting him, but at these prices one expects a true professional. We started our tour walking the neighborhood, and he discovered a lot of his usual spots were not open. He apparently did not check the holiday schedule ahead of time. So we wandered the neighborhood looking for what was open, without a real plan. We got to see a market and ate in a few shops with some explanation of the food items we were experiencing, but by no means did he have encyclopedic knowledge of the topic. On another day a tour billed as an Art Antiques walk and pub crawl amounted to more of the same, amounting to walking down a street in and out of shops with the only planned item a visit to a private museum of Ming and Ching Dynasty furniture. After paying an additional fee, there was a knowledgeable person that joined us to explain the furniture, but the collection itself was disappointing, only amounting to several similar chairs and tables. One of the proprietors was a friend of the guide. The pub crawl amounted to a cocktail in a bar down the street. Having a Chinese/English speaking guide was helpful, but walking in and out of shops on a given street I could have done myself with a language app instead of paying $500 for for 4-5 hours of a poorly organized tour."

An award-winning journalist, she fell in love with Hong Kong and has made it her home. Our half day spent with her, followed by another half day with her colleague Daniel Cheung, were absolutely the highlights of our week in Hong Kong. We wondered through backstreets and markets, noticing what we would otherwise not have seen. The architecture of different eras crammed side by side; an extraordinary array of herbs and medicines, baskets of frogs and many kinds of fish ready to be taken home and cooked. Small businesses clinging on tenaciously alongside ubiquitous multi-story developments. And we ate like locals as we went. Simple and delicious congee with century egg from a tiny shop. The best roast pork from the 'pork place', where we squeezed in beside workers on their lunch hour as Daisann, a fluent Cantonese speaker, ordered and told us about how the pork was cooked and the broth flavoured with cooling pear. Outstanding Won Ton soup from a hole in the wall cafe - Michelin star and all. The L.A. team knows their food. We ate from their recommendations most of the week, and they were spot on. Daniel took us to a fabulous bar that we would never have found ourselves, and which we re-visited later. With Daniel we wondered Hollywood Road taking in antiques and art and, a real treat, a private viewing of a superb collection of Ming and Ching Dynasty furniture and 1920's & 30's artefacts. For all this, the pace was relaxed; a relief in the heat of July. For me the best part was hearing Daisann's insights into Hong Kong's history and contemporary events, shared with our encouragement - we are interested in that kind of thing. We felt as though we had met warm and intersting new friends, and had been allowed to scratch below the surface, even if just a litttle. We will definitely be back next time we make it to Hong Kong.

Daisann and her co-workers have put together a very thoughtful, flexible and enjoyable tour/discussion of Hong Kong that we strongly recommend. I wouldn't call this just a walking tour, or a food tour, but rather something like you might experience when a friend-of-a-friend decides to show you around her city, and takes the time to figure out who you are and what your interests are. That happens rarely in tours of this type. They only take small numbers of folks to retain that intimacy, but in our case it really made it special, and she reorganized things more or less on the go (slightly) in accordance with the conversations we were having along the way, and what she found out about our background. Wow!Hong Kong is of course very modern, very up-scale in the shopping district and easy to navigate, but that doesn't mean you'll find your way to the out of the way stuff, and some of the most interesting points, that might have been part of the old Hong Kong but which are rapidly giving way to 55-story high-rise condos. Daison will guide you in amongst all of that, all the while regaling you with stories that make you appreciate her journalist/travel writer's eye for interesting local details that we would have missed otherwise. We were there just before a special, politically important period, and would have missed the run up to this and its significance on a much larger stage had we not been with her for two days.And the food along the way was surprising in its variety (I thought I had had Won Ton noodles before -wrong!), and its reflection of the efforts of local chefs to provide their customers with something special - and not necessarily tourists. Never in a million years would we have found our way to the places we stopped to eat, and the stories and pictures we collected along the way.We wound up doing two tours with her on two different days, and wound up wishing we could do more, in other cities. We will be keeping in touch with her and her company, and you should too!"

The best part, however, was her knowledge of the city, including its history and current economic/political trends. Definitely added to our time in HK as we saw things we would not have otherwise!"

Since my initial trip with them back in March 2012, I've returned twice to Hong Kong and on both trips tapped their services. My second trip was in December 2012, where I did a half day tour followed by a dinner at an excellent Cantonese restaurant. What I came away with, and the reason I would come back again to LAHK on my third trip was the depth of knowledge and expertise in navigating the HK food scene excited by the team. Despite HK being quite the international city, when it comes to trying to experience the best authentic Cantonese cuisine, there is still very much a language barrier. As a non-Canto speaking American tourist with limited time, not having to worry about this is an immense relief, combined with knowing I am being introduced to places that have been curated by the knowledgeable staff to my specific taste - it's really these two things that brought me back for my second, as well as third trip to HK. For example, we went to Ser Wong, and I'm sure I could have managed to order the snake soup on my own, but it was knowing the back story of that dish in that restaurant as well as the other dishes we ordered there that I probably wouldn't have known to order on my own that made the experience memorable. That evening, we went to a high end traditional Cantonese restaurant (I'm reluctant to identify the restaurant - my little secret, maybe for a little bit) and the LAHK team picked the best dishes (some of which had to be preordered) as well as some excellent seasonal dishes. Again, you might be able to figure some of these things out, but I did't have to because the heavy lifting had been done for me. The meal was excellent, by the way. My last trip to HK was this past April, where I only had a day in HK and I had another excellent, curated Cantonese meal. I know there were less expensive tour options in HK, but for my time and money, I find LAHK a great value. I really have come to trust the LAHK team with my trips to HK, especially given my time tends to be limited. I appreciate the staff's knowledge and familiarity with the ever evolving HK dining scene, their knowledge and passion when it comes to Cantonese cuisine, and their overall excellent attention to detail and customer service."

For visitors who truly want to EXPERIENCE Hong Kong rather than just \"see the city\u201d then booking an adventure with Little Adventures in Hong Kong is a MUST! As a corporate event planner based in Southern California, I was asked to set up a social activity and group dinner for colleagues and clients attending a conference in Hong Kong in May 2014. This is a well-traveled group of more than 20 people who didn't want the standard run-of-the-mill tour that you end up napping through; they wanted an experience; something they would actually remember past dinner. I\u2019ve always set my standards high and was not going to disappoint them, but HOW can you succeed in such a quest from thousands of miles away? Well, it was easier than I ever thought possible. After extensive research, and much frustration, I found Little Adventures in Hong Kong through Trip Advisor and my goal became a reality. I worked directly with Daisann to customize a memorable walking tour weaving through the historic Wan Chai district, followed by a private, guided dinner at a Michelin-starred Cantonese restaurant. Our resident foodie and guests were delighted with the walking tour and the added experience of extending our \u201ctour\u201d into a guided culinary adventure to round out the day. By having Little Adventures in Hong Kong plan the menu and provide a guide as part of our dinner experience, our guests were given an opportunity to experience dishes they may not have chosen on their own, sample a wide variety of revived Cantonese dishes and gain a stronger understanding of the ingredients used as well as the history and culinary principles in Cantonese cuisine. Planning events sight-unseen from thousands of miles can be a nerve-racking experience, but working with Daisann put my mind at ease. With her attention to detail, prompt communications and extensive knowledge of the \u201creal\u201d Hong Kong, the entire experience was wonderful. Even with a 15+ hour time difference she took the time to speak with me when it was convenient for both of us (and occasionally woke up VERY early on her end to fit a planning call into my busy schedule)! By the end of our planning, I felt I was sending my group off with a close friend rather than a tour guide.If you book an adventure with Little Adventures in Hong Kong, I am confident your experience will be unforgettable and one that deserves more than just one page in your scrap book!"

It was a flying visit for us, (only two nights) and we hadn't done much research about the city, however this tour was certainly one of the highlights of our short trip. It helped us not only understand local food but also the neighbourhoods, the geography of Hong Kong, and even the trams! Daisann is a very interesting person, having travelled the world working for publications, she knows her stuff. Her fluent cantonese meant she had a deep grasp of local culture, rituals and traditions, communicating expertly with restaurant staff, taxi drivers and the odd characters we bumped into in the street. Our food tour covered a little cafe where congee and bread was served, a wet market, a roast pork shop, meat markets, roast goose shop, soya milk tea, a bakery, noodles and wonton soup, Chinese voodoo, a real cat with a 'welcome' sign around it's neck, chicken soup and a lot of sweating on my part! My sister said she'd seen and done more in Hong Kong in 4 hours that she'd done in 2 previous visits.What's also very good about this tour is the after service - a list of recommended restaurants in HK, and the knowledge that if we had any further questions Daisann would be ready to help out.I have no hesitation to recommend this tour to anyone, in particular if you are new to HK and want to get a grasp on the city quickly, but in a personal and engaging way. Thanks again Daisann."

From cheap local tea, to boutique bars, to simply daily convenience tips of trams, trains and travel cards - this day was enormously helpful to orientate me well. It wasn't an energetic, rigorous walking tour of many miles and sights, which an athletic type like me would have been up for. It was more a gentle, casual but well thought through jaunt of the area and things to know about and to visit. At the time, I enjoyed it but came away a little unsure of the value given the cost. However now that I've been here for a month or so I appreciate how much was revealed to me that day and how much it fast tracked my understanding. I'd recommend it to others.Peter, Sydney Australia"

I contacted Daisann and told her what my interests were--real streets, real markets, and most of all real food. She proposed a customized itinerary, and she really delivered. First of all the food was amazing, from a little hole in the wall place that served beautiful, flaky crust egg tarts to a delicious Cantonese lunch with dishes I never would have dared to order on my own (just let her do it, which she will--in Cantonese!). I should mention that when I booked she also emailed me their company's guide to restaurants in Hong Kong that I used to find great places to eat after the tour.But what really made this tour stand out from the run of the mill was the level of insight I was able to get in a few short hours into Hong Kong. Daisann's a journalist, and she knows the ins and outs of the place, and especially the current events. She was able to give detailed and nuanced answers to all my questions about the local economy and society. I came away with a better understanding of Hong Kong and China than I'd gotten from some of those professional seminars I was here to attend--which made this tour an exceptional value indeed!"

Our walking tour was with Daisann, who proved to be extremely knowledgeable and able to show us more than we could have believed possible about the history, politics and culture of this amazing city.. Our walk around Sheung Wan, which was followed by an superb dim sum lunch really opened our eyes. She took us to find some wonderful xo sauce which is going to spice up our meals now we are back home.I cannot recommend this walk highly enough, and we will certainly be calling on Daisann again on our next trip."

I was introduced to places and things I could never have found on my own. The walk was tailored to my own personal tastes and there was no pressure to do or try anything. After my morning, I felt empowered to explore the rest of Hong Kong on my own. A wonderful introduction to the nooks and alleyways and sumptuous food of Hong Kong. Definitely one the most memorable days here. I am a Raving Fan for sure. I will join her team again on my next visit"

We went on a walk with Daisann through the Central and Sheung Wan neighborhoods, snacking at places that we would never have found otherwise -- a congee stand; a shop selling wonderful roast pork; a Hong Kong noodle restaurant tucked into an alleyway -- and visiting small producers of things such as xo sauce (much more flavorful and nuanced than what we get here). Along the way, we learned about Hong Kong's history and architecture, traditional Chinese medicines, current real estate development pressures, and relations between Hong Kong and mainland China. We even heard some great stories about Daisann's days as a calypso singer in Trinidad."

We both love food and wanted to go on a walking food tour in Hong Kong but did not want to go with a large group. We were lucky enough to find the Little Adventures in Hong Kong Food and Walking Tour and decided to sign up.Our tour guide, Johannes Pong, was amazing. He was friendly, knowledgeable and funny. We were taken on a wonderful four hour experience throughout part s of Hong Kong that we would have missed if we were on our own. We ate unbelievable food at local restaurants and food stands and we are still talking about it with friends to this day. Johannes had us sample well known Chinese food as well as giving us the opportunity to try things we do not have access to in the U.S. like snake soup. By the end of the tour we felt like we made a new friend, ate wonderful food and saw so much of the amazing city of Hong Kong. I truly recommend this experience if you visit."

This was our first time to Hong Kong and Asia and we thought it would be a great, personalised way of getting to know a new city and country, without being part of the typical large tour groups \u2013 we were not disappointed. We had the most fantastic tour conducted by Daniel and cannot recommend this company nor Daniel enough. The tour itself was a great way to get to know the city and learn all about its history, politics, culture and, of course, food. It gave us a real insight into the back streets of Hong Kong which we would have been unable to find by ourselves. Daniel was a tremendous tour guide, with a great knowledge and true passion about the city. He took us to great places and showed us invaluable inside local hints and tips. The tour was so much fun and we all felt very comfortable in Daniel's company.He also took us for a dim sum lunch, ordering what he felt was most suitable. We had the best dim sum we have ever tasted! After a fantastic day with Daniel, we really felt that he was part of the family and cannot thank him enough for making our time in Hong Kong a more memorable one. Whilst the price of the tour is not cheap, it is worth every penny to experience a truly personalised tour with an extremely passionate and knowledgeable guide. We would recommend this tour to anyone visiting Hong Kong. Thank you!"

Being from the food industry ourselves, we found Daisann to be very knowledgable and she took us to some amazing places. Taking this tour on the first day is fantastic as it helps to orientate you in the city, gives you the opportunity to return to some of your favourite places, and visit the ones you didn't have time to do on the day. Doing this tour gave us the confidence to visit places on our own that we may not otherwise have had the 'balls' to walk into. We ended the tour with full bellies and laden with excellent XO sauce, soy sauce, black vinegar and other locally made foods. We have recommended this tour to friends who have lived in Hong Kong for years, and will continue to recommend this to anyone who is looking for a personalised experience with a great host! We would do it again in a heartbeat."

Little Adventures in Hong Kong is an unparalleled way to gain an in-depth understanding of the history, architecture, landscape \u2014 and of course, food \u2014 of a unique urban phenomenon. I encourage anyone interested in what Hong Kong has been, is, and will be, to contact Daisann and find out about the range of places and urbanist topics you can explore with her.I am an adventurous and generally autodidactic traveler, but when I heard about the Little Adventures tours, I thought it might be a good way to get an in-depth experience out of what was to be a very short stay in Hong Kong, and my first time ever in East Asia. I couldn't have imagined how well-suited an experience awaited me. As a New York City-based historic preservationist, I am interested everywhere I go in the visible history of urban spaces, and in how historic resources are understood and treated in contemporary economic, political and social life.I met Daisann in the heart of Central, where we resumed a conversation on these topics that had begun over email. We plotted our exploration around Fanling \u2014 a still-rural area near the border with the mainland, where ancient walled villages and silent wetlands still sit (for now) just beyond the monumental postwar New Towns public housing projects, and a new wave of gigantic luxury housing development. It was a perfect place for Daisann to help me understand the course of Hong Kong's real estate-driven politics and policies over the last several decades. On our way back, visited Shek Kip Mei, the site of Hong Kong\u2019s pioneering high-rise public housing development \u2014 the ancestor of so much of Hong Kong\u2019s skyline \u2014 where some of the striking original modernist buildings are being adaptively reused. We wandered through a rollicking street market nearby, in an \u201cordinary\u201d residential neighborhood that was alive with activity during the Chinese New Year holiday, unlike the touristy areas I might otherwise have been largely confined to.All this plus a dim sum lunch with Dongguan specialties, and typical blue-collar Hong Kong snacks on the way.... All in all, not just an education about Hong Kong, but a stimulating exchange on the nature of global cities today."

But, add moving with his family to live in Vancouver, Singapore and Sydney to finish with Cordon Bleu in London before moving back home to Hong Kong is nothing short of a gift.Daniel, clearly raised and educated all over the world, is a young man who is passionate about food and his hometown. No better combination to set out to explore a teeming city with so many nooks and crannies than with a native who speaks English, with a British accent, Cantonese, Manadarin and \" enough French to get by\". My day was tailored to my specific requests: Learn as much as I could about Hong Kong. Learn how to order a meal and then the polite way to eat it. Learn how to navigate my way using public transportation.I am now zipping around Hong Kong like a native, feel confident I can go into any off the beaten path eatery and all the while appreciate where I am because of all the things Daniel showed me and explained. His stories of his family and so many relatives were fascinating adding yet another dimension to my experience. I travel a fair amount and love taking tours first off to learn about a city. My time with Daniel rates as one of the best. His knowledge, sense of humor and passion for food, culture and his city made my tour seem like a visit with a family friend."

Daisann's experience and knowledge resulted in a very unique tour. And we all enjoyed our discussions with her regarding life in the city - she very patiently answered our questions.

It was exactly what we were hoping for, easily exceeding our expectations. We felt it was worth every dollar and would recommend it to friends and family with no hesitation.A guide can really make or break a tour like this and Diasann was fantastic! She is very knowledgeable and her appreciation and love for Hong Kong and the local culture shone throughout the tour. We found her to be a fun and delightful host, providing a lot of information about Hong Kong, for topics including the food, the markets, the city, the language, and the history. She spoke fluent English and Cantonese, which made it very easy to get around and interact with locals. Moreover, she really went the extra mile for us in a number of ways. When we mentioned in passing that we liked to cook, she took us to a local place that sold an incredible X.O. sauce where we were able to sample before deciding to buy. At the end of our tour, she also went out of her way to escort us to a high-end tea store near Times Square so that we could look around and shop. And unbelievably, when we arrived at our hotel the day after, we found a gift bag waiting from her that included some soy sauce from a different store that we weren't able to make it to as an extra side stop on the tour. I couldn't believe it! We really felt special, and she made us feel like we were her close friends visiting from out of town. For us this type of personal experience is what ultimately delivers a higher value. Oh, and she also helped provide us restaurant recommendations for the rest of our stay, even reaching out to the owner of a restaurant we were considering!We appreciated that the tour was private, just us, and felt that it added to the personal experience. You can tell that through long practice they've polished the agenda and logistics. Everything started on time, and it was easy (and interesting) to meet at the Foreign Correspondents Club. From there, the tour brought us generally from west to east across a good portion of the island central via a mix of taxi cabs and walking. It was nice to do it this way. I realized later that we ended up seeing a little more of the city than I originally expected, and that we didn't get tired from too much walking. She also mixed in some extra places, like a local wet market, a popular street for dried herbs and medicines, and another street where they sold wholesale dried fish. It was eye-opening to learn how much dried fish bladders cost!Of course, the food was very good too! We liked that we stopped at some local places that you couldn't just find from just any tourist book. The stops made a good, logical progression, from a more traditional, lighter breakfast to a mid-day tea, and then a dim sum lunch. We didn't overstuff ourselves, though we did run out of room towards the end and ended up choosing not to sample a couple of other items after dim sum. The duration of the tour was scheduled for 4.5 hours, but we did end up going over time - though it never felt that way, and we never felt hurried.If you want to interact with your guide a lot, are genuinely interested in the city and the food, and don't want to do it in a herd of people that you don't know, this tour is for you! We'd recommend doing it early in your trip to take advantage of their insights, advice and recommendations.It is absolutely worth it!!"

Daisann was an outstanding host with extensive knowledge about Hong Kong food, traditional medicine and culture. The walk provided a wealth of information about the ingredients and philosophy of the local cuisine and medicines and the lunch, besides being extremely tasty, gave us the knowledge and confidence to eat at other local restaurants that otherwise we would not have been able to find or navigate. It was a wonderful introduction to Hong Kong which we would unreservedly recommend to others."

We were only in Hong Kong for 3 days and wanted something that wasn't guide-book reliant. We did have to postpone until 2 p.m. but we were being constantly notified through text the day prior. I really appreciate that kind of professionalism rather than a last minute \"Oh well, we're really sorry\". Janis took us to places both popular and local. I can't tell you how invaluable it is to have someone show you around (anywhere) that speaks the language, is truly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the food. It was 4 well spent hours, and it was only around the Central neighborhood because of the weather. It made me wonder where else we could've gone on a sunny day. We visited 6 different places and had quick bites/light meals. Do not have breakfast. Come hungry, take photos and business cards. Ask for a copy of the menu if you can. Not everyplace was outstanding, but the place (I wish I could remember the names) that served the Ha Zi Low Meen (sorry about the spelling), the milk tea/french toast place, and goose restaurant more than made up for it. 4 out of the 6 places were certainly not in our guide books, I don't even think they would show up on Trip Advisor. Big thanks to Janis. Her knowledge of cuisine was super impressive: Ingredients, dishes, regions and cultural tidbits. She was patient with our endless questions too. It's definitely an expensive tour. I noticed the prior reviews didn't mention what their fees were, so it's best to just get in touch with the proprietor. But if you're a food enthusiast, and want to try some down home, everyday regular fare and not just another tablecloth establishment-which by the way, they sent us recommendations for those too, how awesome is that?-and are terribly short on time, do book the tour. It was quite special. Thanks again Janis."

My partner and I came to Hong Kong for a conference and only had a half day free to explore the city, so we didn\u2019t want to waste time fumbling around with a guidebook. We\u2019d used private guide services with success in other cities, and based on the great reviews we decided to book with Little Adventures. We\u2019re glad we did--in fact we\u2019d have to say rate they\u2019re the best we\u2019ve used in our travels anywhere.Daisann, our host, is a terrific host who really knows her stuff. She led us through the little side streets and markets of a very old Chinese area of Hong Kong, explaining every item and how it is used in food or in medicine (they\u2019re often the same thing!). My partner is a doctor and interested in Chinese medicine, and Daisann was thrilled when she took him into an old herbal shop to meet the traditional doctor--who was delighted to meet us, showed us through his apothecary and posed with us for a photo. This was all possible because Daisann speaks Chinese like the locals even though she\u2019s American (from New York, I think). You have to see the surprised look on people\u2019s faces when she opens her mouth!. We love our Chinese food, so we also asked Daisann to take us to dim sum, and we\u2019re really glad we did. Once again, she used her Chinese to help us navigate the restaurant (we were the only non-Chinese there), and order dishes from the Chinese menu. We expected the food in Hong Kong to be good, but had no idea it was THAT much better than what we can get back home. We\u2019re very happy we booked with Little Adventures and feel it was well worth it. We got more out of our short time in Hong Kong than we ever would have on our own. In terms of expertise, knowledge, and the right fit, this was exactly what we were looking for in a tour. We have no hesitation in recommending Little Adventures to other travelers like us."

Owner and guide very nice but our experience was disappointing. This is not an inexpensive private experience and we enjoyed learning about the cultural eating habits of the locals; however, the tour did not live up to the website. We were expecting small bites along the way to get a real sense of the depth of flavors. Our guide had a great personality and seemed to know many people along the way but he kept asking what we would like to eat. We reminded him that we were there for the Won-Ton-A-Thon (whatever that entrailed). I felt like this tour guide should be the expert. We should have been asked what we would never want to try (e.g., fish that were alive on the plate) and then taken his recommendations for all the rest. We enjoyed viewing the markets, dried food shops, etc. But we would never do this again."

We came home with a pretty good impression about how it is to live in Hong Kong today, but also how it was to live there before all the construction works and retail industry \"took over\" the city.

But even more than it's fascinating history, I was drawn by the idea of eating real Cantonese food in a predominantly Cantonese city. I've become fairly proficient in eating locally and deliciously in Europe & Latin America, but I knew my very limited knowledge of spoken & written Cantonese would be an impediment to a full and satisfying experience in Hong Kong. Finding Little Adventures seemed like it might be the perfect solution, and it was -in spades. Daisann - who has seen much of the world as an extremely accomplished travel journalist - fell in love with Hong Kong and has made it her home, and her passion shows. I would highly recommend the full 5 hour Won-Ton-A-Thon and suggest that once you give her an outline of your areas of culinary interest you leave the details in her very capable hands. She will give you plenty of options within the framework.As others have mentioned, it's not just the meals themselves, but the larger context Daisann provides by taking you to the markets and purveyors that supply many of the restaurants around the city, and in some cases, around the world. You'll finally be able to identify those wondrously strange things you might have come across in your local Asian market, and you'll come away with new knowledge about what gives a particular dish it's color, texture, & flavor. And the restaurant experiences are greatly enhanced by Daisann's facility with the language - she'll order the best and most interesting things on the menu and if they're out of something or the recipe has changed she finds out the why and how. My little adventure was a great beginning to a fantastic week in Hong Kong and made my time there richer, deeper, and tremendously resonant."

Janice was our interpreter for a morning, and a great one at that. The tour unfolded beautifully. She started with the basics in Sheung Wan - deciphering the dried-food stalls of sheung wan - and as the day unfolded adjusted the tour based on her perception of our interests (chinese medicine, for example). One of our party had recently had knee surgery, and was a little slower on her feet. I especially appreciated that our tour cut a relatively flat path through hilly Sheung Wan."

We actually ate dim sum twice, once at an old fashioned tea house, and then later at a gourmet restaurant where we would have been utterly lost without her to translate the Chinese menus (they had an English menu, but like most Chinese restaurants the best dishes are on the daily menus printed on little slips of paper in Chinese). We ate amazing roast goose, a perfect little bowl of won ton noodles, and we still managed to get in some walking around the enormous herbal and dried food market in the center of town, with Daisann identifying every unusual ingredient (and then later pointing them out to us and explaining how they were used in the food we were eating)It was our travel fantasy to eat like Hong Kongers in Hong Kong, and thanks to Little Adventures, that's exactly what we did.

The one-on-one tour is a definite bonus, as two people can easily hear everything Daisann had to say (and that with the noise from the streets is most welcome) and of course a small group can move around easily. On our own we would never have discovered any of the places we visited and even if we had, we would never have understood or appreciated what we were seeing. Daisann's knowledge and enthusiasm was evident and the pace she set was leisurely. We weaved our way around streets of old Hong Kong visiting both dry and \"wet\" markets, to temples, to specialist shops, including ones selling paper replicas to \"feed\" dead ancestors.We glimpsed local people living their lives and running their businesses. It was just fascinating. We sampled milky Chinese tea and ate thick white bread spread with peanut butter (a local delight) sitting in a funny little restaurant on plastic stools. This reinforced for us how non-touristy our tour was and how lucky we were. Daisann's Cantonese was used throughout and without her knowledge of the language we would never have tasted the best Yum Char ever. Up until then, we had always thought Yum Char was over-rated, but this restaurant changed all that. The specials of the day were all in Cantonese and even if by some miracle we had stumbled across this restaurant (a bit difficult when it is on the third floor) we would have missed so much. We were more than happy to leave it to Daisann tho choose the dishes that showcased this most famous cuisine. I could go on and on, but suffice to say we just LOVED the whole experience, and being with Daisann was like having a friend to show you her special places.

Being a foodie and a lover of Chinese cuisine, I contacted Little Adventures in Hong Kong to go on a five hour \"Won-Ton-A-Thon\" food tour of city. I am also an adventurous eater so I was determined to eat snake soup (which luckily for me happened to be in season). After meeting up with my extremely knowledable and Cantonese-speaking guide Daisann, we visited a dim sum restaurant that catered almost exclusively to the local population (we were the only Westerners in the entire bustling restaurant). The food was phenomenal. Daisann not only chose the most delicious dishes for me to eat but also explained each item in detail. The restaurant was located near the dry markets so I was able to explore this section of the city while en route to do more eating. Per my request, Daisann took me to a special restaurant that served snake soup, which was actually quite satisfying. What really made this tour special was Daisann's intimate knowledge of the food scene in Hong Kong and her ability to tailor the tour to my food preferences. My father, who was in the city on business, met us for lunch at a more upmarket dim sum restaurant that had mouth-watering flash-fried pork buns (definitely worth traveling to Hong Kong solely for these buns!). He is less of an adventurous eater so Daisann made sure to order some less exotic dishes as well. If you are looking for an experience where you will get to eat your way through Hong Kong while learning about this fascinating city, a tour with Little Adventures in Hong Kong is definitely the way to go.

I try to do food tours in new cities as I feel it gives me the best access to the true pulse of the city; its traditions, food, drink and the reasons they came to be. In Hong Kong especially, the reasons why are as important as the actual indulgence. The places visited were integral and authentic. Janice was ever-knowledgable and adaptive to our particular ideas (namely, off-the-beaten-path foods). It all culminated in an unforgettable experience in gluttony, adventure and education!"

We saw parts of Hong Kong and Kowloon we would never have seen enriching our China experience. Both Janice and Daisann introduced us to incredible restaurants and food. Janice steered us to the best Night Market stalls for the best of Hong Kong tastes. Daisann made Hong Kong come alive with rich history, photography and food. In 30 years of traveling, I have never taken a guided tour and was reluctant to start now. However, the private tour experience of Little Adventures is highly recommended. When we return to Hong Kong my first phone call will be to Little Adventures."

We contacted Little Adventures in Hong Kong Food and Walking Tours before our trip to Hong Kong because we were interested in Food and Photography and wanted to have a knowledgeable local take us to places we would probably not see on our own. The guys at Little Adventures in Hong Kong Food and Walking Tours were really friendly and helpful as we went through the process of booking and they send us great tips for restaurants and things to do when we arrived. The walking tour was 4 hours and we saw a part of Hong Kong we hadn't come across during our own days of discovering the city. Our guide was really knowledgeable about the food, architecture and the history of Hong Kong and gave a great frame to what we saw on our tour. We ended the tour with a lunch together and it was great to have her recommend food and other restaurants based on what we wanted to experience. I would without doubt book another tour with Little Adventures in Hong Kong Food and Walking Tours should we go back to Hong Kong - it was a great, highly personalised and highly valuable experience."

I was visiting Hong Kong for a conference and was able to take a day off and was so happy to have found Little Adventures to help me see and feel what life is like in Hong Kong. Two friends were able to join me on the tour. Our guide, Janice was knowledgable, delightful and insightful. From dry markets to wet markets (you'll just have to go on the tour to find out what those are if you don't know!) to temples and some great dim sum, the five hours (slightly extended tour) was some of the best spent time we had in Hong Kong. I have traveled extensively throughout the world and although I am very comfortable getting around unfamiliar locations, I don't always know what I am looking at or the back story. A personal tour with someone who can explain the traditions and culture is invaluable. I highly recommend this tour company!"

A first trip to HK for us and although we are pretty independent travellers we wanted to get an insight into the food and culture/traditions around the HK/Chinese cuisine (and knew that we wouldn't be able to fully achieve this alone and without guidance!) so, we took a four hour trip to the Sheung Wan District (with Janice). Although we didn't really know what to expect, we had certain expectations of some of the things the day/tour would cover however, she blew them out of the water!! The trip was terrific, not your everyday 'typical guided tour' and we both thoroughly enjoyed it, learnt so much more than we could have ever imaged and had the opportunity to ask all our questions! We found Janice to be so informative, knowledgeable and easy to be with. It really was a true insight into life, traditions, culture and everyday that we otherwise certainly would not have experienced. Highly recommended."

Admittedly, I\u2019m not the most adventurous soul when it comes to visiting new places, much less a city the size of Hong Kong. However, I was determined to do some exploring and not interested in participating in the generic \u201cexcursions for spouses\u201d provided by his company. Before we left I stumbled upon Daisann\u2019s Little Adventures in Hong Kong website. After a few E-mail exchanges I was able to convey what I was hoping to see on this trip. I booked two four hour walks with Daisann and I must say the experience I had exceeded my expectations! Daisann is truly a wonderful traveling companion extremely informative but also intuitive enough to allow the first time visitor to Hong Kong experience the city through their own eyes. Dining was a pleasure because she speaks Cantonese fluently, which is such a plus when you are trying to order food. We ate meals I never would have dreamed of ordering! \u00a0When I \u00a0returned to the hotel and exchanged stories of the day with the other spouses, it became quite evident \u00a0(although I knew it already) that I had a much more diverse and interesting visit to Hong Kong. All I can say is \u201cMoney well spent\u201d and many thanks to Daisann for bringing the reluctant explorer out of her shell!"

It was priced a bit higher than some of the other tour offerings but this was our trip of a lifetime and we wanted the best of everything. Exploring Hong Kong with a professional travel writer was just too good to miss! Well, I have to say that Daisann lived up to all our expectations and then some. She's smart and insightful, tells great stories, knows everything about Hong Kong and took us to places we never would have discovered without her. Best of all, she explained EVERY thing, all the little details about Chinese life in Hong Kong that outsiders like us would certainly never find. After our walk, we went to the most delightful dim sum restaurant. Daisann ordered for us in Cantonese from the Chinese menu, so we got to try things that the locals were eating. The staff were clearly amazed and delighted by this American woman speaking to them in their own language and so were we!This was truly the highlight of our trip to Hong Kong.

I found several glowing reviews on Trip Advisor and so I decided to make contact with Diasann to get some more information.The email correspondence was smooth and informative - within a few days we had organised and paid (made easy through paypal) for a 4 hour tour with Janice.Janice agreed to meet us in our hotel lobby on the morning of the tour. We were in the lobby right on 9am and so was she! Because we were staying in Mong Kok (the tour took place in the Central Districit) she gave us a few options on how we could get across to Hong Kong Island. We opted for the MTR, so Janice accompanied us on this trip and gave us some tips for using the subway system - which did help us throughout our trip.We made many food stops including an authentic yum cha breakfast/lunch place - this was one of my favourite places on the tour. Janice told us what we were eating so there was no mystery and she also was able to explain how each item was made. She gave us details history about this kind of eating in Hong Kong while we ate. We would have struggled with a language barrier without her and I probably would have been a little intimated trying to do this on my own!There were many other stops and at each place Janice was able to give us some detailed insight on the food, the people and the history. She was engaging, friendly and knowledgable. She answered all our questions and gave us suggestions for other places to visit and things to see and do for the remainder of our holiday.I am so glad we booked this tour - it was worth every cent and I would highly recommend Little Adventures in Hong Kong Food and Walking Tours to anyone who enjoys food and wants to get to know a bit more of the real Hong Kong.

On my request we visited a couple of temples which I loved, and where Jason told me some of the background and traditions. And being a keen photographer i got to enjoy taking photos of the wet markets with old and young selling their fish, fruit and veg. A very enjoyable morning if very hot and sweaty!

Her insights into Hong Kong and its culture come not only from her obvious intelligence but from the fact that she speaks and reads Cantonese. Daisann is sophisticated while also being very warm and approachable. The tour starts at a private club in a historic building. Her warm welcome made me comfortable immediately and I felt like I was seeing a friend! She tailors the tour to your interests or needs. We visited various neighborhoods, temples, medicine shops, and restaurants. I would have never discovered these places on my own. One memorable spot was visiting a hidden part of a temple that you never see. What a fascinating exploration. I am a foodie and could not miss the dim sum lunch at an authentic restaurant. Having Daisann order in Chinese was an entirely different experience as the English menu did not seem to offer the same description. Such a memorable meal.

The day before we started emailing folks in the top 10 on TripAdvisor. Amy had a cancelation and we had her the next day for the entire day. She adapted to our long list of 'must sees' and packed a lot into the day we had. She also told and emailed us after on the remaining things in our list so we could do them the other day we were there. She was awesome."

We managed to go all over the harbor, island and mainland and see all of the sites. We hit the flower markets, bird market, went on a fishing boat ride around the harbor, the peak and even snuck in a visit to the Ritz Carlton for a view from 103 floors up! We also stopped for a great local lunch that we both enjoyed immensely. She was great at explaining the history of Hong Kong and was always ready with answers to our questions. I highly recommend her tour and would totally book with her again!"

These were no straightforward travellers - both of them being visually and hearing impaired but very independent people. A trip on their own around the amazing city of Hong Kong was not an option and Amy came to our rescue. Incredibly good communication to ensure their time was well utilised. They raved about their time there. Amy helped with accommodation option suggestions and even personally drove them to the airport and saw them to their check in after it was apparent a taxi service would not be appropriate for their onward leg to London. Just outstanding. You are absolutely in the right hands by using Hong Kong travellers - but it blew my parents away how much the impact of having Amy as their guide shaped a fantastic day."

This is a private tour, so you can request the length of your tour and what you would like to see. Amy also has lots of good suggestions. She plans everything carefully and thoroughly to ensure that the day is fun and interesting for everyone.For a small additional charge, Amy met us bright and early at our resort on Lantau Island. She helped us buy our Octopus Cards and we jumped on a ferry to Hong Kong Island, where Amy told us about the history of Central and the feng shui of various buildings. Then, we rode the tram to the top of Victoria Peak and took a stroll along a beautiful, shady path with uncrowded views of Victoria Harbor and Kowloon. Our morning snack at a Peak restaurant was fun - there were puffs filled with ice cream, bubble tea and fresh lemonade available.While in the area, we took a double-decker bus to Hong Kong Park. Be sure to sit in the top story and in the front for an especially fun ride! At the park, we enjoyed the Museum of Teaware, lotus ponds, gardens and the wonderful fountain. Hong Kong has one of the best mass transit systems in the world and Amy is an expert at getting around. After a stroll through a bustling outdoor market and sampling some exotic fruits, we climbed on the MTR for a ride out to the New Territories. There we visited the Hong Kong Heritage Museum in Shatin. The museum is modern, but built in a courtyard style and is quite beautiful. I loved the traditional Chinese brush paintings representing the seasons. There were also amazing exhibits about ancestor worship, traditional medicine and the fishing village at Tai O on Lantau Island. But, what I found most fascinating was the huge exhibit about Cantonese Opera - staging, costumes, etc. We zipped back to Kowloon on the MTR and stopped at a small shop to sample some snacks favored by local school kids. Then, it was on to the Wong Tai Sin Temple. Don't miss this colorful temple full of Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian worshipers. Be sure to see the twelve zodiac animals and rub the dragon's paw for good luck! The temple claims to make every wish come true! Be sure to try throwing the fortune sticks and do see one of the fortune tellers.Our last stop was at the nearby Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Garden. Both are very tranquil, beautiful places and a great way to end the day.We could never have done this much in one day without Amy's expert guidance, knowledge and good humor. She really is a fantastic guide. And, you'll feel as though you made a new friend."

We had 3 days in Hong Kong at the end of a 2 week Southeast Asia trip and left the planing until the last minute for this piece. We contacted Amy a day and a half before we were to arrive. She was great about answering immediately and working with us. She was booked (reading the reviews I can see why) but arranged for us to tour with a colleague Melanie K. Melanie was EXCELLENT, low key, friendly, super knowledgable and flexible in what we wanted to see. We went out on one of the hottest days in Hong Kong and were able to see a lot as well as take interesting breaks. We had lunch in a Dim Sum place we would have never found as tourists-very cool. Also in walking/touring with her we learned how to navigate the city with various forms of transportation so were able to explore on our own the next day (although we talked about hiring her again because she was so great). Two specifics that we loved 1) We really enjoyed talking to Melanie about everyday life in Hong Kong...education, a bit of politics and history and general info about living in a big city 2) Melanie sent us a follow up email with restaurant names, things to do the next day, and walking maps to several places we had talked about visiting. Anyway, I think all of these reviews are right on- if you are a first timer, this is an excellent way to get to know Hong Kong! PS we're in our late 50s and the walking was totally fine."

She has an incredible personality and unbelievable people skills. Our family of four felt at easy with her within 10 minutes of meeting her. I have two daughters with very different personalities, but Amy fully connected with them, and they ended up loving her. Amy took us on a \"six\" hour tour of Lantau Island. I use quotation marks because, even though the contract stipulated we would be using her services for six hours, she decided to go extra early to the ferry station just to make sure we had good seats on the first boat. also, at the end of the day, she even volunteered to take us safely back to the hotel. We declined, but you could tell she meant it. Oh, and after the visit, she emailed us to see if we had made it back, and included a very lengthy list of recommendations for restaurants, coffee houses, markets, and even shops to buy a backpack. We cannot thank her enough.anyway, back to the tour. We took the ferry to Tai O. She quickly navigated the narrow streets and made time to stop for snacks (I had previously mentioned to her that I love street food). She even bought fruit and shared it with us. We took a short boat ride around the area, and came back to tour the island a little more. The day was very hot and humid, so sensing we were tired, she changed the schedule and took us to a local restaurant to have delicious pizza and coffee.After we were done, we took a bus to the Big Buddha and she went up the 268 steps with us. I mean, come on, she could have just said \"I'll wait for you guys here\", but that is not Amy. On our way to the cable cars, she stopped and insisted on buying Ice cream for my daughter. Just like that!I think you get the idea. I would highly recommend her to anyone visiting Hong Kong, and looking for the best time ever. Amy, Thank you so much, My family and I love you!"

Amy was the perfect person! From the moment I sent off an enquiry on Tripadvisor she was responsive and helpful to my questions of her. The tour was fantastic very informative and very Hong Kong! We used all modes of transport which was fun, a small group so easy to move around together and wandered streets, markets & temples we would have never have found on your own. On top of a terrific morning of tastings, culture and sightseeing, Amy took us to lunch at the famous Maxims Dum Sum House at the City Hall. This was much needed after a few hours of walking and talking!! Amy was the perfect tour guide, informative, witty & just a lovely person. Post our tour we asked many more questions of Hong Kong of where to go and what to do. Guess what that evening an email in my inbox with step by step answers to the questions we had asked. I would have no hesitation on recommending Amy to any traveller to trust and be guided in the amazing City of Hong Kong."

I cannot praise her highly enough for her warmth and friendliness. She made us feel as though we were loved family members she was showing around her city. nothing was too much trouble - showing us how to get octopus cards, top up the same, travel the rail network, short cuts to popular sights, beating the queues, the list goes on. besides seeing the popular places we ventured to the meat and fish markets and delicious eateries, hidden temples, rode authentic sampans and saw and learnt so much about hong kong in those 2 days. amy arrived at our hotel and whisked us back safely each day. we also had a wonderful night with amy's husband on the harbour for the new year fireworks. Thank you so much for your delightful company - we were certainly spoilt to have you. best wishes to you, matt and the kids. when you are next in Australia, you know where to find us."

Really enjoyed our tour with Amy who met us at our hotel as arranged and on time. Amy was very knowledgeable and gave us a running commentary about HK, as we boarded the bus, answering our questions along the route. We experienced various modes of transport, tried Snake soup in a market and stopped for lunch at a Dim Sum restaurant. We visited different areas of the city within distances manageable for the four hour tour. It gave us a real flavour of HK and enabled us to navigate around more easily by ourselves on our second day. We asked to be shown the more hidden HK and to include a Dim Sum stop and back street markets and Amy planned the four hours before we arrived, checking via email that we were happy with her suggestions. We would recommend to anyone visiting HK as we all enjoyed our time with her. Thank you Amy."

While she was booked out herself, she could not have been more helpful setting us up with other guides and providing tons of helpful information. She also booked us on her New Year\u2019s Eve harbour cruise which turned out to be a brilliant way to bring in the New Year. The boat was well equipped and watching the fireworks from the deck anchored along a dozen other boats in the middle of the harbour was an unforgettable experience. Amy herself was handling the catering and logistics (I felt sorry for her as she hardly got a chance to enjoy the evening herself) and couldn\u2019t have been a more gracious hostess. Embarkation at North Point and disembarkation at Sai Wan Ho worked out perfectly for us staying at the Harbour Grand HK. Would thoroughly recommend Amy and her Greeters!"

I've been on many tours in various cities around the world but Amy's has to be one of the best. Our tour took place on a very wet morning but it certainly did not dampen Amy's spirits. She is enthusiastic, friendly and extremely knowledgable. We crammed a lot in during our morning including some history, sightseeing, sampling the local food and a glimpse into the locals way of life. At no time did it feel rushed though and Amy seemed very willing to tailor things to our needs. At the end of the tour we were shown a great restaurant which I'm sure we would have never found otherwise. Also, Amy emailed me with other tips on things to do for the rest of our trip which I thought was a nice gesture. Highly recommended!"

She was fun, friendly, knowledgeable, and very intuitive about what we would like to know, where to go, and what questions we might have. We had a few last minute changes and additions to our itinerary - and she accommodated our schedule changes without a problem. Also she helped us see way way more then we would have been able to do in a whole week, leave alone two days! She got our tickets for Lantau Island and the Big Budda experience in advance so we could skip 3 hour long lines which we would be stuck in had we done it ourselves without her. She made reservations in a really authentic Dim Sum restaurant where we had an outstanding delicious and educational lunch. Without her we would not have known about this place or would not have known what to order or how to communicate with staff who did not speak much English. So long story short - with Amy it's a 5 star experience all around, just like having a really cool knowledgeable and fun friend in Hong Kong. Book a few days with her - you will not regret a second of it!"

However, this being New Year's Eve what's most important is the atmosphere and this junk certainly didn't failed on that point. Celebrating the new year with a wide array of interesting people from all parts of the world certainly made up for any discrepancy of food and drink. Also, the junk was easily the nicest I've ever been on with plenty of space to mingle which anyone who has been to a fireworks display in Hong Kong is nearly impossible to do with the crush of crowds. The fireworks themselves were nice, but not amazing as Hong Kong saves their best for Chinese New Year celebrations.All in all, a bit expensive but still worthwhile event. If they figure out the food and drink situation I would happily do it again and recommend it to anyone."

From there we went for some Dim Sum at a local restaurant which was excellent, Amy ordered for us and her choices were good, we even returned to the same restaurant the next day. We also visited Wang Tai Sim Temple which was lovely that was more crowded very interesting to hear about the different religions . We then got the Star Ferry across where we visited the Peak which has stunning views over Hong Kong. We took the tram back. Amy had recommended we get an Octopus Card which was excellent value it could be used on the buses, the Star Ferry, the MTR and even the Tram. I would highly recommend doing a private tour with Amy, Hong Kong is so busy I feel we would have missed stuff and her recommendations as to places to visit and getting around Hong Kong were invaluable."

And the dying art of bamboo scaffolding still used for building skyscrapers was something to be seen.We had a dim sum lunch on the 26th floor in central Hong Kong and walked through the very prestigious Peninsula Hotel foyer where the string quartet were playing and heard about the fleet of dark green Rolls Royce available to select guests, we even got to see one on our travels.It was a last minute decision to take us to what we thought was the highlight of the tour \u2013 the Chi Lin Nunnery.

My wife and I have just returned from a three week trip to Vietnam and finished off with a few days in Honkers where we had never been to. We booked Amy before we left and felt very comfortable with her from the first email. From the outset she was able to give us information that was relevant and helpful.On the day of our tour the weather forecast was not encouraging and Amy called us to see if we still wanted to do the tour as it was likely to be a bit damp. We were on a tight time schedule and we were still keen to go come what may. Amy said she was up for it if we were so at the appointed time we met her in the lobby of the hotel and headed off to the closest MTR station and with Octopus card in hand were introduced to Hong Kong's famous public transport system which really is fantastic. Amy took us to the Chi Lin Nunnery and when we got there the rain had started in earnest and it was travel umbrellas and 20 paces. The nunnery in the turned out to be a great experience if anything it added to the serenity of this beautiful place and meant we had it pretty much to ourselves because most other tourists were seeking cover from the Black Rain event which it had just been upgraded to. Amy gave us another chance to literally take a rain cheque but we come from Australia and were not overly concerned with a few spits of rain and so on we went. It was back to the MTR and off to one of Amy's favourite restaurants for lunch where she ordered a nice selection of dishes the standout being the Honey Glazed Pork. With lunch over the next stop was Wong Tai Sin Temple to rub a lion's paw for luck, burn some incense and have a fortune read lots of fun and then back on the tube to get across to HKI to hop the tram to the Peak. Amy had already been in contact with the \"Guy in the Sky\" (her hubby who worked in the IFC) real time weather man to see what it looked like at the top of the Peak who assured her it was all good. We walked up from Central to the tram station making a few detours to learn about some of the interesting history of the area and then literally walked straight on to the tram which is almost unheard of. At the top Amy gave us some time to immerse ourselves in what has to be one of the best views in the world and then when we were satisfied with that took us back across the harbour on the Star Ferry to drop us off at the YMCA where we had started. We had a great time out with Amy and it really set us up for the remaining time we had in Hong Kong and Macau. Amy backed up with more information and travel tips which we followed over the next couple of days and she was even kind enough to give us a couple of tickets on the Macau Turbo jet which were set to expire.... BONUS. We would have no hesitation recommending Amy to anyone who wants a fun low fuss intro to this amazing city."

With a bike you can see a lot of things in a very short time, covering a wide area of attractions. We were pleased Amy pick a friend Richard for helping us - so we had two guides! Both are very kind and warm persons, so we felt very comfortable in their company during all the trip. The trip itself is not very difficult, as the New Territories are all flat (not like HK island). The trip is also very safe, as it runs on cycle paths all the time. Probably the most important thing is they both came from western world and are now HK residents, so you can get a good and understandable perspective of this marvelous place.With two guides, on safe clycle path you have all the time to talk about the exceptional scenery.

(We are two senior ladies ... but I can definitely see how Amy's approach would work for anyone: couples, family, solo travelers). In addition to the requisite HK tourist stops, she advised of other things we could do when not with her, even making a reservation for a wonderful tea at her recommended location. But, it just gets better: One of her colleagues (Jacky) had some spare time and joined us as well ... as they introduced us to a local restaurant and helped us choose local specialties. (Would never have done this on our own.) Such fun! And then, the crown jewel ... as we learned that Amy and her colleague had organized a Chinese New Year boat cruise in the harbor ... to see the amazing Hong Kong fireworks. (Yes, we extended our stay by an extra day to do this!) By the time we departed Hong Kong, we not only had met an amazing excellent tour guide ... but also felt as though we now have a friend there in Hong Kong. Truly a trip to remember ...

The things we did on our own still felt like Amy was with us as she 'd give us things to keep an eye out for, recommendations on how to get the best out of the attractions we visited. Even what probably seemed simple to her but what was a great help to us was the MTR's to take, which exit to take & then even which direction to take when leaving the station (Thanks Amy, We could have ended up anywhere). Christmas Day we headed over to Macau, the day before Amy helped us buy our tickets for the ferry & happily gave directions & recommendations whilst there, once again helping to give us more amazing memories for our first christmas away from home.We would not hesitate to recommend Amy to anybody visiting Hong Kong if you want to get the best out of this city.

Amy was very quick at responding to my inquiries during the booking process and worked with us to create an itinerary that suited our needs and interests. The protests in Hong Kong were in their first week during our travels, and Amy took it upon herself to contact us by email while we were in India to update us on the status, and to assure us that we were in no danger and that our tour would not be affected. Amy met us on time at our airport arrival gate and she quickly proceeded to get us set up with public transit passes. She also made sure we had a place to store our luggage, and checked if we needed to exchange any currency. We took the train into the city centre, during which time Amy provided us with a brief history of the city and answered any questions that we had. We went for a quick walk through the financial district, where Amy pointed out interesting features of the architecture and the history of the area. We then were able to walk by the area where the protests were held, and then to the Wan Chai market. Due to the protests, some of the roads had barricades but Amy was able to quickly and efficiently arrange alternate routes of travel. We visited Victoria Peak that has a beautiful view of the city and harbor, then back down into the city for lunch at a fantastic vegetarian dim sum restaurant and tea house, and finally to visit a nunnery and garden. We ended up running short on time, but Amy was able to keep us on track and make the most of the time we had; she even ended up staying with us almost an hour beyond our scheduled time before making sure we arrived safely back at the airport. Although not originally from Hong Kong, Amy is very knowledgeable about the city, knows travel routes very well and has no issues communicating with native Hong Kong residents. Although we were jet lagged and still had a long flight ahead of us, she was very personable and made sure that we enjoyed our day.

It was definitely the right decision, since traffic can be terrible in Hong Kong but the train quickly delivered us with just one or two stops before our destination. Amy also was generous with her time. On our second scheduled day with her which was suppose to be a biking day, it was raining, we met at the bike location and realized it wasn't safe to travel that day.

Having never been to Shenzhen and knowing how big and complex it can be, I wanted to find someone who could show me around and enable me to have a productive and enjoyable trip! Amy definitely made this happen - her knowledge and enthusiasm were so appreciated, showing me all the different areas, as well as helping me to pick up some great bargains with her amazing bartering skills! Without her I wouldn't have found/seen anywhere near as much and I found it comforting having such a knowledgeable person to guide me in a place where very little English is spoken."

TripAdvisor led us to the amazing Amy of Hong Kong Greeters. We were not disappointed! Amy met us at our apartment & we spent the next 7.5 hours (although we only booked her for 6) exploring the wonderful city that is Hong Kong. The markets close to our apartment, bus ride to the peak, the peak itself & its amazing view, tram ride back down, dim sum, MTR to Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple, where our futures were told, ladies market, where Amy spent an amzaing amount of time trying to get us bargins, then finally back to our apartment...We, family of 2 adults & 2 kids (14 and 10) had a great time. Amy got us onto the Octopus card - easiest way to use the public transport system. She introduced the kids to a very different place - our 10yo daughter was having culture shock the night before, but after our day with Amy was OK with most of the new sights & sounds. Not only did we have a great time with Amy, she also then sent us an email at 11pm after our day with an update on the all the things we discussed during our day with her - a good tailor, a day in Macau, good places for dim sum near our apartment, good places for cycling & walking, best place for our 14yo to buy a new camera, best places for shopping, including specific location of particular shops we wanted to visit, best way to see Hong Kong from the ICC Tower - don't pay for the observation deck, go for drinks at Ozone bar - and so musch more. It was like Amy was an old friend, & we were just travelling with her to a place she knew & we didn't. We would recommend Amy to anyone who doesnt know Hong Kong & wants someone to introduce them to this wonderful city. The best comment came from our 14yo son, he said he couldn't believe how much of Hong Kong we had seen and it was only our first day...it seems like we had been there for a week. Thank you Amy."

I had won a trip to Hong Kong on a TV game show, but did not take the trip then. 30 years later, I finally made it here. Amy took us to some of the city's top sights and showed us how to use the public transportation (MTR, ferry, etc.) We saw the skyline from atop Victoria Peak, rode the 100-year-old Tram back down, rode the Star Ferry across Victoria Harbour to City Hall's dim sum restaurant for a delicious lunch. A visit to Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple gave us the opportunity to seek the advice of a fortune teller. Since Maxwell is a fan of airplanes/jets, Amy took us to the Toy Street Market for affordable miniatures. By the time Amy left us back at our hotel, we felt very comfortable about getting around Hong Kong on our own. We definitely recommend Amy as a tour guide, should you be lucky enough to find yourself in Hong Kong!"

We saw so much more than we thought possible in the time we had, including some pleasant surprises such as Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Garden which were stunning.We have learnt so much from the trip and certainly got a true experience of Hong Kong life and culture.Amy we all thank you again for a wonderful day and making our time in Hong Kong so memorable.

This works for shooting video without much understanding of what you are seeing. By the time you figure out what building the audio track is describing, you have already moved past the building. The bus audio track is historical in nature, but out of historical sequence, thus not very meaningful. The tickets were $50 apiece. Then we signed up for Amy's walking tour for about $10 more and the whole experience changed. No language barrier as there was when we got off the bus, and we could ask questions. Not only did we learn historical information in context, but also culture and customs in this part of the world. You need to do this tour! Brian & Bobbi Santa Barbara."

We are usually very happy to explore new places by ourselves but decided, based on the relative short time in Hong Kong available , to get the 1-1 treatment. I must say that we were delighted with Amy and believe that her service is really great value for money and a \"must do\" for Hong Kong.Firstly, the booking and payment was effortless and our pre- tour email correspondence with Amy gave us great confidence and excitement. Amy was also extremely punctual on the day.Secondly, Amy made full note of my wife's post-surgery back condition and created a great itinerary that allowed us to experience the real Hong Kong, whilst also visiting a number of well-known landmarks and sights. Amy was friendly, helpful, and sensitive to my wife's health- always allowing us to travel at our own pace.My wife and I are not extrovert people and we had some pre-tour concerns about getting along with a tour guide for a whole day but Amy was great company and there was never any uncomfortable silences during our 7 hours together. It was just like looking around with a friend that knows the City very well. We had a great Dim sum lunch together and, with Amy\u2019s help, could order much more adventurous dishes from waitresses that could speak little English.Lastly, as we visited the Ladies market, Amy showed her real skill. She helped us to find stalls that had \"quality\" stock in a \"back room\" - this one was on the 23rd floor of a nearby apartment building. Once the good stock was unveiled, Amy haggled like a pro and got us some great bargains.I must say that, while I\u2019m a seasoned traveller, I\u2019m sure there was a lot that we experienced on the day with Amy that we would never have achieved on our own, or in a large tour party.We certainly would not have followed a local stall owner for two blocks along the back streets of the ladies market , entered a shabby block of flats, and then haggled aggressively with the local expert to buy a handbag :-). Amy appeared in her element and completely confident and this made us a lot more comfortable.Finally, and this was the biggest praise I could offer. There was absolutely no clock watching. Amy was adamant that she would stay with us until we had secured exactly what we wanted from the markets. We overran by at least 50 minutes and there was no question of requesting further payment or any pressure . We suggested, during the day, that we may be interested in visiting Macau. An hour after the tour finished we received a mail from Amy with precise details of how to get there, where to get the best priced show tickets, Turbojet Ferry times, and additional tips and recommendations. Absolutely first class !In summary - we had a great day and would thoroughly recommend Amy to our friends and colleagues travelling to Hong Kong in the future."

To sum things up, this was the best day of our week in Hong Kong and China, having a western guide that really knew the local ways really put us at ease, Amy was definitely the right choice, it was like being shown around by a friend."

I would not hesitate to recommend Amy to anyone visiting such a busy city as she really gets you familiar with the place and shows you things as you travel around.

If we hadn't spent the day with HKG, we wouldn't have experienced the best noodles I've ever had, that beautiful park in the heart of bustling Kowloon, nor would we have had nearly as much fun at night. Thanks so much HKG. It's great to eat and drink where the locals do. If you've got more secrets up your sleeve, we'll go with you guys again when we're back in February!"

Amy from HK-greeters is a very enjoyable and committed guide. A must!1. On my first day, Amy guided us through the busy heart of HK-island. HK is hectic, grand and impressive. You're hardly able to take it all in. The tour took 3 hours. We talked and discussed while walking at a leisurely pace, we hopped on a passing tram and visited crowded, local markets, old houses and temples (at places you wouldn't expect). We went inside shops, ate at a food stand and ended our tour with a well deserved cup of coffee. I enjoyed it very much. 2. My second appointment with HK-greeters was on Sundaymorning. I took the guided bicycle tour in the new territories, away from the busy citylife.To me, this was a revelation, as it is not something you would expect to do in HK. In Sha Tin, a suburb, I met Amy again at the MTR-station, we rented a good bicycle around the corner and started the tour. We cycled all the way on well kept bike paths along the shoreline, parks and suburbs. Bike paths are safe and always separated from motorized traffic. We made some stops for a drink or a snack. In the afternoon the bike paths were more crowded. It was a fun, relaxing and slightly adventurous tour."

However, during my visit, I also wanted to see as much of Hong Kong as possible. I came across the Hong Kong Greeters website & felt it catered to my needs as I wanted something personally tailored as well as showing me the 'real Hong Kong.'Amy has been living in Hong Kong for around 3 years and she gave a refreshing take on the country, ideas of things to see & do as well as recommending some great places to eat! It was fantastic not to be herded along (as can often be the case as part of a large organised group tour) but to have my own personal guide to take me to the places I wanted to visit. My time with Amy was well organised & enjoyable but most importantly, there were no unscheduled stops in 'tea houses!' We travelled across Hong Kong on foot as well as on public transport (Amy arranged for an Octopus card). We also got a few taxis but using the local transport really added to the experience. Amy was organised, professional and enthusiastic. She was able to answer my many questions & contributed greatly to a fabulous holiday."

And again from our first phone call because he was flexible and pleasant with a very nice voice and impeccable English from his many years living in Australia (but without twang).Jacky gave me a good whirlwind of Hong Kong to give me a basis to explore confidently alone later. The next day we did a thorough one day look at Macao. We then went into Mainland China for my business and were together for two entire days of travel, which he arranged with the casual ease of one long familiar with travel in these same areas. We used Uber, trains and subways and a superb hotel. He never lost me in the crowd and knew exactly where we would meet after going through different Immigration lines. I found him an easy companion. He was good at finding the balance of being an informative guide but not overwhelming with too much talk.I do not know what he could possibly have done to improve his service to me given what I wanted, asked for and was capable of. (I walked a good deal; other options are possible!) He even took some photos so I could focus on the experience, not on a camera.At the end of our time together Jacky gave me careful instructions for two more days in Hong Kong based on what he had seen of my desires and abilities. I was able to navigate those using the experience he had given me to move about on various transports, including buses and ferries, with self-confidence. You can plan to work with Jacky with complete assurance. He has my unreserved recommendation."

We had a brief stay in Hong Kong, and we contacted Jacky to show us some of the \"non-typical\" sights, as my husband and I had already visited the city once before and had seen all of the major tourist attractions. Jacky gave us a WONDERFUL tour - it was personalized and unique, and it gave us a really great sense of how people live, shop, eat, commute, etc. in Hong Kong. It was exactly what we wanted. He is also great with food - he guided us through an excellent dim sum lunch, and we also stopped by a bakery and picked out some great Hong Kong treats (try the cocktail bun - my new favorite!). He also shared so much interesting history about Hong Kong that we never knew. It was a really great day, and we are SO glad that we hired Jacky for this tour!"

Our first stop was the Tai O fishing village. We spent an hour or so just meandering through the town and tried their pastry which was peanut flavored -very good! My friend got yelled at for taking a picture of this woman chopping fish - we didn't understand what she said - but she got her message across. We saw long boats where they were rowing through the canals. Very much a village that relies on fishing for making its livingNext we took a taxi to the Big Buddha. It is 268 steps to the top. Quite doable and the view is very scenic. We also had a vegetarian lunch at the monastery. Not a vegetarian but the food was good and very plentiful. I highly recommend.Next was a little village that looked like the shops were from Disneyland - very whimsical and touristy. I bought some figurines from the movie \"Ted\". From there we took the nong ping cable car to get back down. Jacky was very accomodating as my husband wasn't sure if he wanted to do this. Jacky was very open to an alternative if my husband didn't want to do this. In the end, he decided to do it and was fine - I was the one who ended getting a little uncomfortable a couple moments. I thought it was great.Jacky was a friendly, knowledgeable tour guide. He touched base with us the night before to confirm and his communication skills are excellent. You can't ask for anything more in a tour guide! Thank you Jacky for a wonderful tour."

Walking with Jacky around the many streets in HK allowed us to see many things within a day trip.

The day of the tour he was in the exact meeting place at the airport and we started the tour right away.

Jacky then took us on a terrific tour of Hong Kong. We walked to areas of interest as well using available local forms of transport...such as Trollies, Taxi and Ferry, subway/train. Without Jacky's help we would have had to get to the Airport many hours early by Taxi ( approx 1 hour required in traffic } and we would not have been able to see some very fascinating sites in Hong Kong. Jacky was professional, courteous, friendly... just an all around great person to spend the time we had before catching the Express Train to the Airport.

Then we explore old city of Hong Kong and Soho etc.I saw professional dogs walker I did not expected to exist in Hong Kong.Then we rode a subway to Kawloon Prince Edward station( the border end of old teritory in Kowloon) exploring the area then rode double deck bus to the Star ferry pier with spectacular view of Hong Kong skyline with the night lighting. We then rode the Star ferry to Hong Kong, them I took the airport rail to the airport. I learn how to use all public transportation and see how the local live and spend their days. We had a hot milk tea and local bakery for afternoon snack. I also learn about the Octopus card. He is very friendly and knowledgable about the history and current issues of Hong Kong. His English is impecable as he spent 10 years of his youth in Melbourne, Australia. His English is Americsn though although I heard some hint of British English at times. I had a good time spending about 6 hours of my 12 hours layover in Hong Kong. I had previously visited hong Kong twice. The first time in 1969 and the second time in 1980s. The city has changed tremendously. We became a good friend at the end. I highly recommend Jacky Wong as your local tour guide. I will use him again if I am in need of a private guide to Hong Kong."

He also took us to a yummy yum cha place for breakfast.A couple of downsides were that our flight was about 45 mins early (before 5am), so we were waiting, which we didn't mind, and checking on the people holding signs, looking for my name to indicate his arrival. Rather than the usual A4 sized paper, Jacky uses a flashy app on his phone, that makes the name scroll across. It looks cool, but meant we missed each other for 45 mins, as he had realised we were early, so was there the whole time.The other downside, was it wasn't clear enough what was included. We caught the train from the airport, and got return tickets, which weren't included. The Yum Cha was extra too, though I kind of expected that. the train down from the peak was also extra.Also he didn't take payment at the beginning, and when we got to the end we had over spent the small amount of $HK we had gotten at the airport, so that was pretty embarrassing for us.You'll also get a lot of emails afterwards begging you to review him on trip advisor, so I have finally capitulated."

For us - one of the most interesting aspects of the day was using local transit! We were off to the Star Ferry for a \"cruise\" across the harbour and we then took a local bus to The Peak. Jacky quite rightly advised (we discerned later) that you see more on the bus - you can wait hours for the Peak tram and you don't see much until you get to the top. At the Peak a bit of history and an understanding of the layout of the city then down the tram for a walk through the historic district and mid-levels - and a tram ride to the local markets. Visiting the markets and seeing the vegetables, fish and meat all laid out was a highlight! Jacky was great at answering all our questions regarding how locals live, where it \"matters\" to live, the political situation with the PRC and local issues. Next a bus to the other side of the island to see Aberdeen. We had an enjoyable putt around the harbour in a small local boat. All in all a great day - Jacky delivered us safely back to our hotel"

Jacky met us at our hotel on the morning of the first day, he was prompt and polite and had a very calm and considered personality. He is not an overly chatty guy, but I liked that about him, there is so much to absorb in this busy city, but his presence was not imposing at all. Any question asked, was answered thoroughly, and he offered insight when necessary.We did not feel rushed, yet we kept a steady pace. In four hours, Jacky showed us how to use what seemed like every mode of transport (bus, ferry, tram, train and taxi), gave us a brief history of Hong Kong and an overview of the culture. We saw the main tourist sites, where the locals shop, the hip areas and he also pointed out places we should come back to if we had time. After the tour, Jacky marked out on a map where we had been so as we could retrace our steps if we wanted to. We were happy to find that a few days later we could still find the places he had taken us to. We saw more with Jacky in four hours than we would have we had wandered around like aimless tourists for two weeks and we also had the confidence to explore event further.If you haven't been to Hong Kong before I highly recommend meeting up with Jacky on your first day; it's like having a friend showing you around their city, and the experience in priceless.Thanks Jackie."

We were collected from our hotel and taken on a six hour walking journey being amazed, and entertained at every corner. We experienced every mode of transportation that Hong Kong offers, saw the old and the new, tasted the most delicious dumplings and custard tarts, drank authentic Hong Kong coffee, walked through markets, enjoyed a visit to many historical sights. At the end of our day over a beer he then proceeded to pass on his vast knowledge of Macau. We visited Macau the next day and saw so much thanks to Jacky. Value for money? Absolutely, a lifetime memory, thank you so much we haven't stopped talking about it."

Jacky was outstanding in his orientation of the city, transportation, food, restaurants and neighborhoods. In a short time we had the knowledge to be able to go out on our own and find our way. In fact we returned to many of the places that Jacky took us to for a wonderful experience. Plus Jacky kept in touch with us after the tour to answer questions and make suggestions. I highly recommend this tour if you are in Hong Kong, it will be well worth the effort. Thank you Jacky !"

We were reasonably familiar with Hong Kong but not with Macau. So with our past good experience with private tours in France, we decided to book a tour with Jacky after reading the good reviews on TA. Jacky met us at our hotel in Macau. He brought us through historic Macau and also the iconic Lisboa and Venetian hotels. Walking the streets of Macau on a hot sunny day was not easy for the kids and seniors but Jacky managed to bring us through it smiling, perking us up with timely drink and snack stops, and cheering us on with his knowledgeable commentary and good humour. He also brought us to a local cafe for a really delicious lunch. At the end of the tour, we learnt so much more about Macau then we would ever have been able to had we done it ourselves. We will highly recommend Jacky's TIA private tours. In fact we plan to get Jacky again when we next visit Hong Kong!"

Jacky met us promptly at the airport and got us to the central district right away. He made sure we hit all the highlights in the short amount of time we had. We started the morning eating at a very cool dim sum restaurant that the locals frequented. The food was fantastic. Jacky then led us through several historical sights and markets. We tried some Milk Tea and tasty desserts. He then guided us to the ferries for a short trip across the water to Kowloon Bay. I thought Jacky did a great job tailoring the tour for our short layover. It was a great way to see the city."

We had a full-day layover in Hong Kong, so made reservations for Jacky's all day tour, and were really, really glad we did! He's a native to Hong Kong; young and energetic. He helped us, by email, before the tour as to where to leave our carry-on baggage, and where to meet at the airport. He converted our dollars to the local currency to save time, knew where to go to avoid the long lines (like on the Peak Tram), where to go where the locals go (instead of the touristry areas), and truly maximized our time in Hong Kong, including where to go for a true Chinese lunch, teaching us the customs of eating in China. He also gave us some history lessons on this amazing city. All in all, we saw a LOT for being there for only one day, thanks to him. Highly recommended!!!"

As we had covered a number of the markets earlier in the day with another guide, Jacky was flexible with our night tour and took us to areas we had not already visited as well as viewing the streets all lit up at night. The areas looked completely different aglow in neon lights. He also took us to see both the good and bad sides of Hong Kong which we enjoyed. It started to drizzle and we left the markets and at our request went to visit the Ozone Bar as well as the Intercontinental. This was a treat and we enjoyed hearing Jacky talk about Hong Kong.We went to Macau the next day with Jacky and it was fabulous! He used to live there and knew alot of the history of Macau. We walked through the old sections in the morning and ended up walking through the casinos in the afternoon. It was a great mix and he spent the right amount of time at the different places -- enough so we could see the site and wander around but not too long as to get bored. I have a food allergy and he made sure we ate a restaurant in a hotel that was used to dealing with allergies. We were only in Hong Kong for 2 1/2 days and I am so glad that we took a day to visit Macau. The night market tour was interesting but we had seen much of the same earlier in the day (our fault -- not Jacky's). I would definitely recommend a walk through the markets at night to see the lights and all the people. It is quite amazing."

            "review": "Walking Night Tour - Waste of Time. DISCLAIMER: we were negligent in thoroughly reviewing the contract and did not realize the payment currency stated in the contract was USD, not HKD, thus resulting in a radically higher fee than anticipated. This oversight was completely our fault and has no influence or bearing on the experience that ruined our very short visit to Hong Kong. If you are looking for a boring and negative perception of Hong Kong, Jacky will fit the bill. Jacky speaks English very well and earned 2/5 points for appearing to have high level knowledge of how to navigate the city as would any local (street names, public transportation, common events/activities around the city) but provided no unique or interesting perspective to what a basic tour should provide, not to mention a personal tour. We learned more in the 20 minutes we spent reading Wikipedia, over the dull three hours spent with Jacky. Jacky met the two of us at our Hong Kong Island hotel. We briefly discussed some of the activities we had already completed in brief Hong Kong visit and what we were looking forward to seeing in our personal tour. Jacky determined that a walking tour through Kalwoon and its evening markets would be a good fit for us. During the 25 min commute from Hong Kong Island to Kalwoon, there was very little conversation. I was hoping that Jacky would jump in with facts, history, or interesting information about the evening ahead, but other than surface level discussion about his career and background, no other talking points were exchanged. Having spent several hours at the Hong Kong Peak audio tour earlier that day, we had a high level introduction to Hong Kong history but were eager for more information. We picked Jacky\u2019s brain about the history of Hong Kong and the geographic advantage to its location. While he appeared secondary education of Hong Kong history, his delivery was curtailed and contradictory to what we had heard/read. For instance, when we inquired whether the reference to Kalwoon meant nine dragons, he stated that was incorrect and the reference to eight mountains and a Chinese emperor was \u201cmade up history.\u201d In a moment of odd silence, he did not offer up any additional information. Immediately upon arrival at Kalwoon, Jacky suggested he was tired and offered to go for Hong Kong Style Milk Tea at a local diner. This was how we started out our tour. Again, there was little discussion. Thirsty for information (not Tea), we began spewing questions at Jacky about the location, politics, history, culture, etc. Having a communications background, I was able to fill the air with a healthy amount of questions, but after an hour it became exhausting. After about 1 hour, I made it a point to inform Jacky that we would like a more informative tour without us having to ask so many questions and he responded \"I like when you ask questions, it's better for me.\" Jacky had answers to all of our questions, but his answers were high level and did not contain historical depth. Despite not having a real grasp on the history, he had nothing of interest to share. His responses about Hong Kong life and culture provided us absolutely no breadth or uniqueness. We literally had to ask every single question. If we didn't ask a question, there would be silence or Jacky would state the obvious name of the street, market or area. The following quotes are verbatim: When I asked the significance of the Peninsula Hotel, Jacky said \"it\u2019s an old hotel with a nice lobby.\"When I asked about economic influence and the main export, Jacky said \u201cwatches and re-export.\u201d When I asked if there are fun facts that I should know about TST (Tsim Sha Tsu), Jacky said \"not really, I wish there was. Tourism in Hong Kong is going down, there really is nothing that special.\"There was zero entertainment value provided by Jacky and on all accounts of what a tour guide should be (Energetic, Storytelling, Talkative) he did not meet any marks. Although Jacky was very explicit about the contract and we were clearly at fault for misinterpreting the rate, collecting even a dollar for this type of tour is a robbery. Jacky has no business being in the tourism industry and depicts a shameful portrayal of Hong Kong."

We have just spent 5 days in Honk Kong and we were keen to see Macau, but we could only allocate one day for the tour. After much research we decided on a full day tour with Jacky Wong and I must say we weren't disappointed. Let me begin by saying that if you're after a cheap quick and 'dirty' tour - then look elsewhere. Jacky isn't cheap, our full day tour cost us about $650 USD, BUT....the old adage applies.... \"You only get what you pay for\". For those with discerning taste (and reasonable means) who elect to read on, I shall continue...Jacky met us precisely on time at our hotel, the Novotel on Nathan Rd. Our journey by ferry to Macau was smooth and our tour unfolded as we had requested. We were less interested in Casino's etc, and much more interested in the culture, history and architecture of Macau and its UNESCO World Heritage status. Our tour by foot was smooth, targeted and covered exactly what we had asked for. I'm of the view that a traveller might be able to execute this tour alone, but it would not be easy. Jacky made navigating the journey seamless and simple, saving a lot of wasted time. Perhaps this is they key value of this style of tour. It is straight to what you want to see, with a detailed local knowledge, with the benefit of a tour guide who not only speaks English like a native, but someone who certainly understands Australian humour and nuances.I've used personal guides like Jacky a few times - not often, but occasionally - and from my perspective our tour today (11th Jan) was money well spent. Thanks Jacky! (and sorry about the shorts, although they caused a lot of mirth for the locals...)"

He Knows Hong Kong inside out & Will take you through the real Hong Kong even if you are short on time and make you experience the city like you really should - Like a HongKongese if you May!We covered a fair bit of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island and after we came back to the hotel he sat down with us and explained what are the other places we should see around nearby (we were in sham shui po) and also in Lantau Island (part of new territories) once we get there which was very helpful. He also offered to call him up if we needed any help.Last but not the least,Be very clear what you want from the tour, as it is not a travel agent package tour wherein services will be packed, you are basically paying for his time and not for other things although he was kind enough to buy us some delicious egg custard tart ,sweet bread (I am forgetting the name will ask him) and a refreshing hong kong tea as part of the experience! Overall , a must do if you are willing to walk and experience the true Hong Kong outside the hotel rooms and resorts !"

He also did a fantastic job showing off Macau in a way a tour group could not. Taking the time to visit the historical sites as well as a few casinos. Jacky has great knowledge of Macau. He also took photos and later e-mailed them to me. I highly recommend Jacky and the tour. Jacky gave a great tour and it was a great time."

I regularly book a private guide when arriving in a city for the first time. I made arrangements with Jacky via email and he maintained contact with me via email and cell phone during the week leading up to my arrival. The booking and confirmation process was easy. On the date of the tour (May 28, 2014) Jacky met me promptly as arranged in my hotel lobby. Of the many private city tours I have taken, this felt the most authentic and personal. We traveled by public transport - MTR via subway, bus, trolley and minibus, as well as using the Star Ferry and taxis. His explanation of the subway and transit system enabled me to confidently use the MTR and taxis on my own the next day. Jacky is very personable takes special effort to assure his client is comfortable and sees what interests them. We visited a few notable tourist sites, but also as a result of our dialogue, visited a few places such as local markets and food vendors that interested me. I have already recommended him to friends traveling to Hong Kong later this year."

But the tour was not of any great caliber; We went near Boundary street and Nathan, etc; from reading the other posts this sounds like a pretty standard tour. We were able to ask questions about local customs and expectations re:tipping, etc. which was helpful. He bought street bites for us - but didn't inquire as to whether there were any food restrictions before spending our money on the food - one of the ladies was pregnant and the other can't eat spicy food!A big storm was due to hit the island so we ended up going to a high-rise bar and getting a drink and chatting. We asked him about other sites; Jacky seemed peculiarly anti-Hong Kong - he warned us off Stanley Market, Victoria Peak and other landmarks as tourist traps and not worth a trip. He was pretty high up on Macau though. Based on his recommendation we shortened a planned trip to Stanley Market. The thing was, Stanley was great! Yes, it is touristy - in the way Saint Augustine is touristy. We had a great afternoon and wished for more time. Luckily, I was able to go again and enjoyed the promenade, the view, being by the coast, etc. There's a great ex-pat bar there called Smugglers Inn which I highly recommend. However my travelling companion was miffed as she wasn't able to return due to her work schedule. The funny thing is that Jacky was adamant about visiting Times Square when he visits the States. Talk about touristy! LOL. Bottom line: Jacky is a nice enough guy if not the most imaginative. And don't listen if he tells you not to spend a day at Stanley Market."

Let me start by saying Jacky is lots of fun to be with, knows his city well, and speaks native (Australian) English. First was the walking Tour of Hong Kong, where we not only walked, but found our way around on bus, tram, subway, escalator, and ferry. By the end of the day, we not only had \"seen the sights\" but had our own Octopus cards and felt confident finding our way around Hong Kong by ourselves. Jacky gave us lots of ideas for further adventures. And did I mention the wonderful dim sum lunch??Next was the day in Macau. The morning explored the Portuguese heritage of the island and included a yummy Portuguese lunch. The afternoon took a look at the casino development...not gambling, but understanding what has been and is being built here, and how it relates to mainland China and Hong Kong. And last, the Kowloon at Night visit to the teeming street markets. To the Westerner, block after block of stalls may look somewhat the same. With Jacky, each block is different. Here is where the real life of Hong Kong is. Loved it!All I can say is, whether you plan a day or a week or the rest of your life in Hong Kong, you'll get a great orientation, and a fun day if you hire Jacky to show you around!"

He organized a tour to the New Territories and a visit to Macau \u2013 this was the only part of our trip, where I felt of having a local expert would be beneficial, as I\u2019m normally do all be myself. All went perfectly. From several initial e-mail exchanges where we pre-planned everything to organizing a car for the day (otherwise all my wishes would have been impossible to accommodate \u2013 and by the way a lot cheaper compared to the offer from the hotel) up to getting the ferry-tickets to Macau in advance and even doing pictures of us both with his own camera (of course mailing them to us afterwards) and my own one. He gave me hints where best to exchange money (where I would get the best rate), to which restaurants to go during those days where we would be by ourselves etc. I can only highly recommend Jacky. He respected our interests fully. Not the usual travel guide who constantly talks and swamps you with facts and figures you anyway forget soon\u2026.just what is really essential to understand where you are and the key facts. I told him in advance, that I\u2019m a keen photographer and sometimes need my time to get the right shots \u2013 he suggested spots for the best views. We like to take our time with lunch (in places where local people would eat) and to smoke a cigar afterwards \u2013 he knew the right places where you can do this. These sorts of things which show you, that your individual preferences are always respected.Conclusion: When we come back to Hong Kong, we will definitely book Jacky again to show us the more \u201chidden secrets and unknown gems\u201d of his home town.

Jacky met us at the airport as soon as we landed which was 7:30 in the morning. His detail on where to meet him at the airport was very accurate and very easy to follow. We seen so much of Hong Kong in the limited time we had. There was no way we could of seen as much on our own. We took several different transportation systems to see the city. We also got to try the local cuisine. Which was very tasty and interesting. My kids really raved about Hong Kong after our tour. And my son is usually pretty quiet. But Jacky really made it interesting for them. Yes the tour may seem a little expensive to some but how much can you learn driving around in a bus or taxi by yourself. Hearing the history, and stories of Hong Kong has much added value to the tour. Plus the tour was very personal not a whole bunch of people sharing the tour with you.

We were unable to find a guide that could take us for all 3 days, so we used 2 different guides that we found on tripadvisor. Both of the guides were fantastic! Jackie handled days 2 and 3. He was everything that was advertised. He was very knowledgeable about all things Hong Kong and Macau, and was most importantly flexible in terms of what we saw each day. With 7 people touring, and with the age range of 10 to 75, you can imagine that we needed to occasionally alter the plan inter-day. Jacky was absolutely happy to go with the flow. In terms of the actual touring, he was very good at getting us around a very crowded city and avoid most of the lines. In one instance, on our way to see the Big Buddha, he took us out by the airport, and then on a local ferry (20 minutes), to avoid an hour long bus ride to the Buddha. Besides saving time, it was very interesting getting to interact with the truly local people. Jacky was also great with the children. My boys were focused on buying a few electronic type items. Jacky was not only able to take us to the area of Hong Kong where the locals go to buy computer parts, but was able to find, and negotiate, the purchase of all the items they were looking for. This was over and above any expectation that we had. Jacky was also thoughtful enough to take some photos of us during our tour, and forward them to us by email. I could not recommend Jacky more highly for anyone wanting to get an insiders view of either Hong Kong or Macau."

I wanted him to pick us up in our hotel in Shenzhen as myself and my daughter was not sure how to get over to boarder. BOY am I glad he did that as we would have been in the wrong line, which would have taken hours to get through customs, very confusing signs!!! We booked him through Tours by Locals which was great, as we were able to customize our tour and some companies do not let you. Everyone is looking for something different in a tour and being able to write Jacky he could get an idea what we were wanting. We wanted to see a little of old Hong Kong, test street food and see some popular places for tourist and locals. We loved our experience with testing foods and for lunch he took us to a place with only locals and no one spoke English. He looked through the list of items on the menu and we tried several local dishes, some we liked some we did not but the experience of this was fabulous! When I tour I ALWAYS pick a person that speaks the language and is a native of that country or area. We were able to see a lot in a very short time, Jacky knew where to go, the best way to get around including, a small bus ride up the mountain and a cable ride down the mountain, WOW that was great. We were able to see everything and more than what was on our list. I highly recommend Jacky!! I have posted a couple of photos."

We emailed each other prior to our arrival in HK (on our honeymoon) to discuss what we might like to see. Jackie suggested we have $500 HKD for each of us for transportation, snacks, beverages and shopping. Upon arriving in HK the night before our tour with Jackie, we spoke via phone and confirmed time and arrival at our hotel.We decided to see the Island and city by local transportation; which was great! Jackie asked us if there was anything specific we wanted to see and we told him to take control and show us HK as a \"local\". our base was a tour of three different areas: White collar, Middle Class and Working Class neighborhoods. It was very interesting to see each group of locals in their working and living environment. Jackie's knowledge of the Island and mainland is very extensive and he had great insight to each of the areas we visited. In addition, we toured 3 different street markets, local department stores, high end shopping areas and sampled local snacks and drinks. In addition, we had an incredible Dim Sum lunch at a local establishment (Jackie ordered all the food items and they were most excellent.)Upon escorting us back to our hotel, we asked Jackie to join us for after tour beverages. We landed on a patio at local bar 4 blocks from our hotel and enjoyed beers while reminiscing about our day. When we go back to Hong Kong, Im sure we will connect with Jackie again; for a more 'informal' tour of local drinking establishments.We enjoyed our day with Jackie immensely and look forward to our next visit with him!"

I can just say that it was an absolutely memorable experience that I will never forget. Jacky picked me up in my hotel and over the coming 7 hours Jacky showed me a good mixture of both the 'must-see' sights, as well as many hidden treasures of Hong Kong that the 'ordinary tourist' does not see. Jacky speaks English excellently and has a very broad knowledge of the history of Hong Kong. I very much enjoyed talking to him, although I was so impressed of many of the things that he showed me that I was rather calm. Needless to say that he also picked a very authentic place to have lunch and to enjoy some of the sweet delights that Hong Kong has to offer the afternoon tea. He found a very good balance between giving me enough time to watch and enjoy the views, make photos etc. and not to waste too much time at certain places as many other attractions were still to come. He finally also gave me very good suggestions what to visit over the next few days. So, I can only very highly recommend him and will definitely book him again during my next visit to Hong Kong."

He seemed delighted that we called and helped us plan a ferry trip back to Tung Chun to the MTR. Call him for your travel plans and you will not be disappointed."

Jacky went out of his way to accommodate us, and was very willing to increase the length of the tour based on what we wanted to see, and to even change the itinerary based on what we wanted to do. We did a combination Kowloon nightlife tour with some food stops thrown in as well. I wanted an introduction to Chinese cuisine, and Jacky took us to a very authentic hot-pot restaurant. We had a good time eating the food, and Jacky gave us instructions on what was what, and how to \"cook\" the food. I also enjoyed traveling as the locals do, via the local Kowloon buses."

I have chosen top hotels and airlines , Seabourn as our cruise line and private tour guides based on trip advisor reviews . What can I say . Our experience with Jacky was definitely well beyond what I would have expected. Forget about private car , driver and guide . Not only do you waste your money but you also waste precious time . Jacky's mantra is to do nothing twice . That means if you take the public mini bus up to the peak you will take the tram for the return . I have been on the peak several times before but I have never seen it as I saw it this time . This statement applies to our Lantau experience as well as to our Macao day trip . Jacky knows the hidden gems , be it a small but excellent Portuguese restaurant or be it the little ferry that goes to Lantau and no other tourist was aboard .Bottom line an more then satisfying experience with a knowledgable well educated young man with style who knows where to take you and what to show you"

Ironically Hong Kong, unlike the other Asian countries does not have many places of interest or a history and frankly, in my view, hong kong is all about its people and their lifestyle. We had a totally tailor made itinerary and it includes shopping for mammoth tusk carvings, kind of jerky pork among everything else. We our selves were not to confident of achieving all the in one day especially with the Christmas shoppers but then we didnt know Jacky at that point either. Jacky had planned the trip to go \"against the traffic\" we took the bus to the peak and Tram coming down. the bus had no queue. the drive was longer.. but better views and the line at the trams station! I don\u2019t think we ever back tracked the whole day despite ever increase shopping needs. This is a skill that needs to develop. This we realized the remaining time we spent in Hong Kong. Even with years of travel experience, we really struggled to be efficient in HK. Once we spent 2 hrs and 200 dollars to travel from Aberdeen to kawloon. Just getting there became a struggle as not many people on the street spoke English. Try locating the sony shop in Nathan street. Wonder where all the sign boards are.We never got a Cantonese meal right since the day we were with Jacky. Something\u2019s we ate since then is still unknown to me and i prefer to keep it that way. We walked.. talked... he updated us on little history they had, we did amazing local shopping. it was a fulfilled day and not until we came back to the hotel we realized what a lot we had achieved without that much of an effort. We missed all this the rest of the time.Not many people in Hong Kong can match his charm. He actually smiled as he spoke with us!!!!!. Amazingly friendly and totally down to earth. We are sorry that we never had a chance to meet for a meal again. Highly recommended as a very professional individual"

While friends were sceptical that I needed a guide in Macau since I understand and speak some Cantonese and Mandarin, I was determined to have one just so that I won't miss out on any of the must-sees in Macau as well as the history behind them. We (a group of 4) are neither serious shopaholics nor foodies nor history buffs, but just a bit of each. Jacky was able to meet our varied needs well without wasting any time 'cos he really knows his way round Macau and the large casino hotels. I was pleased to visit Taipa and Coloane for a glimpse of the 'old' Macau which was more leisurely and laid back. Finally, despite the declining standard of food in Macau, Jacky selected Crown (Wong Kun) restaurant which served good crab porridge, and shrimp roe noodles in response to our request for these 2 famous Macau dishes. We rounded off our lunch with a yummy portuguese tart from Margaret cafe. It was a pleasure to see so many lovely and well maintained churches in Macau and thanks, Jacky for leading us on the heritage trail at a nice pace despite my anxiety that we may run out of time to do Taipa & Coloane. You really know your stuff and we thank you very much."

Jacky Wong Shenzhen Day TourWell organised, flexible, personable, knowledgeable, courteous and interesting guide.These are only just a few of the adjectives I could used to describe Jacky. He provided a very professional service well tailored to suit our diverse family needs. This was for a wife who had specific shopping requirements not just normal tourist trap sites. My twin adult boys also had special electronic and sports clothing requirements. I just wanted an interesting day out without the concern of organising the family or dealing with the hassle of thinking or planning the tour.I would highly recommend Jacky to everyone who wants that unique personal tour guide service.DetailsMy wife and I had been to Hong Kong several times in fact we spent our honeymoon there and had been back a couple of times since. My sons had not spent any time in the city.This was the last time we would spend as an entire family touring. The boys had just turned 20 and they have different interests when touring now. So I emailed Jacky for a tour around the city of Shenzhen He designed the tour based on some facts about ourselves and our interests.He arranged to meet us at our Hong Kong hotel and took over from the moment we left there to until we finished and departed at the border at Shenzhen. In fact we spent nearly 12 hours with him. In that time he kept us informed about all aspects about the journey (impeccable English and native speaking Chinese).Every question was answered and he amused us with key culture backstreet facts. He was not a typical fact quoting tourist guide, who lacked emotion or thought. His commentary was unique and informative with lots of little insider points of view. He protected from the touts who just wanted to sell us anything. We had strangers just walk up to us and shout \u201cSHOPPING\u201d in our faces."

Leading up to our trip to Hong Kong, my wife and I debated whether we would even need a guide because the city is so tourist-friendly and public transportation is excellent. Nonetheless, we heard from friends who had used guides in Hong Kong previously that it would be worth it to have one since our cruise ship would be docked there for approximately 16 hours (8am to midnight). After reaching out to many guides, we realized that the cost would be very high to hire someone who can offer a customized tour for 2, for at least 8 hours. We finally found Jacky's name and information online and were pleasantly surprised to hear his response. He would take care of us as if we were friends, offered a very reasonable rate, and told us that he could stay with us the full 16 hours if we wanted! Nobody came close to offering us the full 16 hours without charging 2x or 3x more than their base rate after the first 8 to 10 hours. After agreeing to have Jacky as our guide, we went back and forth trying to put a basic itinerary together. He knew the city like the back of his hand and set up a few sample itineraries for our day. Once we arrived, we found him to be very knowledgeable, still flexible to our wishes (what to see/do the day of the tour), and most importantly, just fun to be with. He obviously knows the main tourist-oriented spots, but also the spots that only a true local would know about. We ended up doing some shopping, where I had a fantastic custom suit made and then shipped to the USA. We visited some historical sites, which Jacky was able to explain and teach us about. The food choices were excellent too...we got to sample some of the most delicious Cantonese food based on his recommendations, and then we topped the night off with some drinks at an awesome bar/lounge overlooking the city! All-in-all, I'd have no hesitation recommending Jacky to anyone - couples, families, college kids, retirees - because he is very knowledgeable, flexible to your needs, and just goes at the pace you're looking to set for your trip."

We used various forms of transportation and got to see quite a bit. Jacky was fun, energetic and anxious to please! He is extremely knowledgeable and has the ability to make every stop exciting. He provided exceptional value and even met with us the day before the tour to discuss what we wanted and how he could accommodate our every requirement. Jacky exceeded our expectations! I am confident he will exceed yours. I have recommended him to amny friends and anyone who has used him has felt the same way I do! Book with confidence....Jacky is a keeper!"

We were very grateful of the time we did spend with him as he gave us a little insight into Hong Kong as a local. We are really sorry we did not get to spend the whole day with Jamie and unfortunately we didn't have another spare day we could change to. We will do all we can to get back to Hong Kong some day in the not to distant future to try again to take this tour which we knew from the start, would have been a day well spent. Keep up the good work Jamie and we hope to meet you again one day"

He has lived here for 43 years and he loves his city. Jamie was so thorough in preparing us for our visit. He instructed us about the Octopus Card and areas we might like to see, but he wanted us to see what we \"had on our list.\" We told him to please just plan our 6 hours with him the way he would take close friends who have never been to Hong Kong. Well, he did and he did a masterful job!! In just 6 hours I felt like we had really become acquainted with Hong Kong with all its facets. Jamie knew so much detail from the everyday life to the economic status of the city to its religion which is not very serious. If you want a really amazing tour to really learn about the \"behind the scenes\" of Hong Kong, you will thoroughly enjoy being with Jamie. He was fantastic!!! I might add that because he lived in the USA during his early years, his English is perfect! Thank you Jamie for 6 amazing hours!"

The first was a four hour tour for my 15 year old (very mature) daughter to enjoy with Jamie while I was in a conference. We got very lucky that both tours were the only time during our 5 day visit that it did not rain. Jamie took Juliana to the top of the peak. Not just where the vast majority of tourists go, but further up for spectacular views and photo opportunities. They then took the cable car down and talked about life in Hong Kong. He stopped for bubble tea, which is one of her favorites. A couple of days later, following a typhoon, Jamie took both of us to a temple that was close to the public housing and a bit less crowded than other temples. He talked at great length about the culture and rituals of the Chinese and their superstitious. He was both highly engaging and funny. From there we went to the Ladies market. He taught us how to negotiate with the locals for goods sold along the streets. We used public transportation and felt very comfortable and safe throughout the journey. We would highly recommend him!J3 was one of our best decisions."

I carefully looked at tripadvisor for help in choosing the best tour for me. I decided on a full-day walking tour with Jamie. I'm so glad that I did. From the moment my decision was made J3 Private tours made everything as easy as possible. Jamie asked what my expectations were, if I had anything that I particularly wanted to see and what, if any, limitations I might have. I decided to leave the day entirely it up to him. I was not disappointed. Jaime picked me up (right on time) at my hotel and off we went using a variety of transportation options including trains, buses, taxi cabs and boats. We started the day at The iconic Chi Lin Nunnery, very serene and peaceful. We enjoyed the Nan Lian Garden - lots of bonsai trees, rocks, koi, waterfalls, pagoda, red bridge (even though it is really orange)! etc. After a quick drink we were off to Nathan Road - longest road in Kowloon, almost 2 miles of shopping and home to the iconic Peninsula Hotel and a fabulous view of the Harbour and Hong Kong Island We took the iconic Star Ferry to Hong Kong Island (lower deck) and a taxi to Stanley where we visited a most unusual Temple. A nice walk around the Stanley market and a relaxing lunch at a lovely Mediterranean restaurant. Each stop enhanced by Jaime's story telling and knowledge of Hong Kong history. Great buss ride back with breathtaking views of the harbor, Cricket Club and other interesting sites. No trip complete without a visit to Wanchai wet market to remind us that Hong Kong is certainly a multifaceted destination. Certainly a fun filled day made so much richer by Jamie's knowledge, sense of humor and love for his adopted county, Hong Kong."

After some research on TripAdvisor, we found Jamie and J3 Private Tours Hong Kong. I'd like to congratulate myself on an excellent decision, but alas, it was a stroke of luck on my part. Jamie is a wealth of information on Hong Kong having lived there for the past 44 years. Though a Brit, Jamie has lived longer in Hong Kong than many of the younger 'native' tour guides. He has lived the history they have only read about. We spent a wonderful day touring parts of Hong Kong that aren't necessarily on the big bus tour routes. Jamie is able to customize your trip for you and get you to exactly what you want to see while in HK.Walking with him and listening to his historical and modern tidbits on HK was a great way to experience the city first hand. Though a showery day, he made even the occasional stops to get out of the rain enjoyable with his knowledge. We learned a lot about HK and some of the history of it's predominately Chinese population. Very informative.Our day was capped off by a visit to \"The Peak\" (a must see). However, Jamie foregoes the normal tourist view points to show you a much broader view of HK and Victoria Harbor. Well worth the 15 minute walk off the beaten path to catch this view.All in all, an excellent way to see Hong Kong on a first visit. I would have no hesitation in booking another tour with Jamie and fully intend to do so on a future visit to HK. Highly recommended!"

Having not been to HK in 30 years I was a little overwhelmed to tackle the job of tourist with my four daughters ranging in age from 15-22 by myself so booked 2 consecutive days of tours with Jamie. Jamie arrived promptly at our hotel and took a a few minutes to chat with me and the girls and see what we were interested in and get a feel for our personalities. He quickly figured us out and off we went. Won't go into too much detail but, was a wonderful combo of walking and getting the feel of the culture and then having the pleasure(cool air) of taking the very efficient public transportation. Jamie blew us away with his \"special spot\" on Victoria's Peak and gave the girls an unforgettable experience at Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple. Had a beautiful authentic delicious lunch of dim sum and got to know each other better. Can honestly say Jamie was personable and funny and so easy going with my girls which is always key to my girls enjoying themselves on what sometimes can be a boring history laden tour. He really made sure that he gave them knowledge and experiences that would be interesting to them. Really appreciated that as a mom and made the second tour day eagerly anticipated by all of us. Second day we took a scenic bus tour to Repulse Bay, wandered around, took in the beautiful view and had a great lunch where once again Jamie patiently answered all of our questions. He even let us take a quick detour into the H&M because what teenage girl can resist!!?? Don't want to give any of Jamie's secrets away but, we had a wonderful time and would definetely look him up again if we are ever fortunate to visit HK again!!"

Jamie will tailor your tour based on your time, interests and personal requests. We love learning about the 'little things' in places we visit, that sometimes are only noticed by the locals. Jamie provided that. He also took us on the MTR as we wanted to feel comfortable traveling around Hong Kong without the use of taxi's. It was seamless and I would strongly recommend utilizing the MTR. Don't forget your camera and your walking shoes and know what you might be interested in, so you can focus on that first.

I came across Jamie and his website and gave him a tough challenge, to wow us with something I may not of encountered and was of interest.I have to say Jamie excelled himself and initially met us in our hotel and we travelled out to Diamond Hill, on the MTR, to see the Nunnery there. He took us through the history and the links between the Nunnery and the Monastery based on Lantau Island. I don't want to spoil your visit but its worth an hour of your time and the caf\u00e9 is a nice tranquil place to take a rest. Check out the Red Bridge (\"shh, it's not red, it's orange!!!).This was followed by trip to Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple (Statues, Gods, Turtles, Incense, Lucky Sticks the works). Were all forms of Hong Kongers worship come together. (See if you can spot the Star Wars look-a-likes and find your luck character. If your unfamiliar to Chinese Astrology Jamie will break you in gentle. Everyone there knows him and he's a real local with all the staff; I suppose that comes from living there for 40 years during the colonial times and now a Spec. Admin. Region of the PRC.Jamie's knowledge and depth of subjects is vast and I am sure that if you engage his services you will have a great experience and understand what makes Hong Kong tick, why it's so special, and why the Hong Kongers don't want to surrender what they have.Should you book with Jamie he will avail other tours and visits you can do on you own, without his guidance. A very valuable tool, should you wish to explore more of Hong Kong. As in my childhood/teenage years, and now, I found HK to be one of the safest cities in the world and no-one will bother you if you don't want it. Don't forget to go to the Races on Wednesday nights at Happy Valley, and be daring catch the tram, a great way to see the city, night or day. Buy yourself an Octopus Card at the airport when you arrive, you'll find it invaluable and they do special train fares into HK at reduced rates and you'll find a free (air conditioned) mini bus service to all the hotels when you get to the HK terminal.Finally, Jamie is a petrol head and is fascinated by the plethora of high value, prestigious fast cars. HK is the place to visit should you wish to see the best of the best, there's even a Ferrari Sales Garage on Repulse Bays Beach. Thanks Jamie, for getting our holiday off to a great start."

Jamie gave us some great ideas about a good place to eat our first evening and some great things we could do during the evening. Thanks to his advice we had the best dim sum we have ever eaten anywhere and we saw some incredible highlights of Hong Kong after dark. The next morning he met us at our hotel at 8:30 a.m. to take us on a fast-paced, interesting 3 hour tour. We took the ferry, went up to the peak, saw the cathedral, the lucky lions at HSBC, an interesting fresh food market, the McLaren showroom and much, much more. If you have the chance to take a tour in Hong Kong, look no further. Jamie is the best!"

Let me start by saying I'm a 45 year old woman who was traveling solo for the first time ever, and never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine I would set foot outside the safety of the HK airport, but I did!! And I don't regret it for a moment thanks to the awesome Jamie of J3 Tours!!I was flying home from Western Australia and knew ahead of time that I would have a 9 hour layover in HK, so after some research, I decided that I couldn't sit in the airport the whole time without at least seeing some of this amazing city.I booked Jamie well ahead of my trip and he answered all my questions in a very timely fashion. We met in the airport at a predetermined spot and set off on an incredible 4 hour adventure!!Right from the start, Jamie and I hit it off. Especially when we found out our sense of humor was quite similar and the laughs were plenty after that! We used all public transportation which I highly advise. Nothing gives you a sense of what a great city this is until you've surrounded yourself with it's inhabitants, and the Air Con was a relief after the humidity outside!It was 4 hours of sight-seeing, education and all out fun!! It would take me days to write out everything I experienced and felt, but I will very enthusiastically say that this tour is an absolute MUST DO. Don't look further, stop researching and just book J3 Tours. It is worth every single 'penny'. You will not be disappointed!!If I ever have the opportunity to visit HK again, I'm hoping to have my daughters with me, and I will most definitely introduce them to Jamie and have him show them the city as well!"

Canadians do appreciate the dry British sense of humour so that added to the fun of the day. The temple at the end of the tour and the insight into the \"culture of luck\" that is a large part of the fabric of Hong Kong was an interesting insight. Jamie's experiences as a non-Asian living in Asia were enlightening. Prior to and after our tour Jamie sent us loads of information, via e-mail, on things we would see, how to get there with incredibly detailed descriptions, what to expect, best times of day, restaurants to try, etc, etc. The dim sum restaurant he suggested at the end of our tour, One Dim Sum, was excellent. The one mildly negative comment was that we found the cost of the tour to be a bit high. To be fair, that may also have been because our Canadian dollar is not at a high value right now. Well done Jamie. Keep shooting all those exotic cars you see in your city every day."

He took us to a number of places that are off the beaten track. He is extremely knowledgeable about Hong Kong. We enjoyed spending time with him both because of his expertise, but also because of his great personality and his sense of humor. It was a great way to learn about Hong Kong. We walked extensively and utilized public transportation at every opportunity. Jaime gave us an excellent introduction to the bustling city. We would recommend Jaime to anyone who is looking for a great guide in Hong Kong. We were also impressed by Jamie's follow up. After our tour he emailed us a number of excellent detailed suggestions for our day on our own. Jamie was very efficient and punctual. We had a great time. Thank you Jamie"

We had 4 hours to explore with him and had email communication in advance to let him know our interests. We were touring on a Sunday and had read that Victoria Peak was crowded that day so had suggested that we do this on our own the following day. Jamie is very accustomed to taking tourists to the Peak and in many of the reviews, they tout his special viewing spot and he really wanted to take us there so we went. We took a taxi in both directions because the line for the tram was so long. There was a political protest taking place with about 5,000 protestors forming a human chain the entire length of the trail. Jamie's \"special viewing spot\" is on the trail which anyone can walk. Despite the crowds, we felt Jamie's attitude was demeaning. I guess we are more tolerant of differing viewpoints and this condemnation was disheartening. The torrential downpour at the Peak was unexpected, but always carry an umbrella for sun and rain. There was absolutely NO view once it started raining.We enjoyed the nice bathroom stops in the fancy hotels, but we are not the type interested in multimillion dollar baubles in the jewelry display cases, nor the Rolls Royce Phantoms at the Peninsula Hotel. In fact, this kind of opulence seems so wasteful when so many people in China live in poverty. The comments about the billions of dollars of real estate spent to live in status locations was absurd. We began to understand why Jamie said that Hong Kongers rate low on the happiness index, because they can never achieve the amount of wealth and status they desire. So sad not to be satisfied with life's basic needs and to work together for the good of the community as we had been exposed to the previous weeks in Bali and Tanzania.We appreciated being shown where to exchange our currency at the Chungking Mansions, and we would never have trusted to go there alone as it really is quite \"dodgy\". We also went to the Nan Lian Garden which is a beautiful and calm oasis from the chaos of traffic and people in the city. We enjoyed our vegetarian lunch in the restaurant in the garden which has a waterfall veil falling over the windows as you dine. Then, we walked on our own to the Nunnery and enjoyed the serenity of the chanting and praying of local people and nuns. We really appreciated Jamie's followup email with directions to several destinations that we wanted to explore on our own. We enjoyed the ferry to Cheung Chau Island, about 30 minutes from the bustle of Hong Kong. If you are looking for a more authentic \"Chinese\" village, this is a quaint place to visit with nearly empty beaches and no cars! It made for a nice afternoon trip with a ferry coming back into the city as dusk became night and the lights of the city were coming on. Beautiful.The following day we took the \"free\" 3 hour walking tour from the Clock tower near our hotel in Kowloon and although we didn't cover as much of the city, we had a guide with a very positive attitude and that was a refreshing change."

Usually, a guide will represent a location, devise a plan of attack to get you to the highlights of the location and provide tidbits and facts as learned and experienced through their training and own native perspectives.Jamie does not pretend to do any of this. Jamie gives an easy walking tour of Hong Kong based on his observations of you, his client and what you ask to do or see and interjects his opinions and knowledge somewhere in the middle of the process, as he continues to size you up. Actually, a quite clever approach!It makes for a refreshing tour. Like having a big brother show you around, because he knows what you really will find interesting, and throws in the more unusual facts that he feels will entertain you well along the way. Not formatted.Our 8 hour tour included the usual Hong Kong must sees that are on every Hong Kong tours list, but were approached from an off the beaten path method. Jamie pace is leisurely and avoids all the crowds.Jamie shares an outsiders perspective of Hong Kong; therefore the knowledge you are given is a more cultural perspectives than textbook facts. As an Englishmen, having lived in Hong Kong for over 30 years, his observations make for a tour that most will enjoy - however he does not hold back on his opinions, which may include you too! Be prepared.Yes, you could probably find many of the locations on your own, but you would be lacking in enjoying Jamie's wit and insights, and of course knowledge. Time is money when on vacation, and Jamie's tour is a wise investment in making sure your time is not wasted and you walk away with more than just \"facts\". Yes, he will provide additional directions for things to see, after your tour, and through his \"training\" during your tour, it will be easy to navigate on your own thereafter. If you are looking for more than a parade of Hong Kong \"must sees' and textbook knowledge, I recommend you engage Jamie's services. His tour offers more insight and understanding of Hong Kong than just the basics!"

He provided the perfect combination of seeing interesting things, learning interesting facts, getting a sense of the inner-workings of the city, and making it fun instead of feeling like school.

Jamie picked us up at the hotel and as per previous correspondence we had left the planning the details of the tour until we met. This was just as well as it rained pretty well all day so having the flexibility of a personalised tour was a real bonus. The tour itself was interesting, informative and entertaining. It really felt like we were being taken around by a well informed friend intent on giving us a good time. We certainly saw parts of HK that one would not normally see as well as managing a dash to The Peak during the only short break in the low cloud and rain the whole day. I may be giving away one of Jamie's secrets but the restaurant in the YMCA is not what you expect and is a great place for lunch off the tourist trail.

Visiting beautiful nunneries and inner city temples along with Jamie's information of the area gave you a real feeling on the way in which the locals really went by their day to day business.Jamie was also kind enough to send through a lot of additional information of other places to visit including directions and top tips so that we could spend our last days clearing up our things to do list.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Jamie's tour to friends and family and my advice to you if considering it?

We went to the peaceful Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian garden. We actually saw a nun - per Jamie this is like seeing \"Bigfoot\" - a very rare sighting!. We went to the Temple where they many HK people go to play the \"lucky stick\" game. I say playing a game for a reason. They shake out a stick and if its an unlucky stick number, they put it back and try again. I got #62 which means - double easy life. I liked that one so didn't feel the need to go back for another one.We went to the Peak and Jamie took us to his favorite spot which is about a 20 minute walk away from the observation point. Its on a walking path. We had a beautiful view of HK. Jamie was enjoyable to be with and felt like a friend. I would highly recommend Jamie to anyone who is looking for a private tour."

Nothing in the city is inexpensive, including a tour with Jamie, but you certainly get what you pay for and much, much more. We took trains, buses, a taxi, a tram, ferries, moving sidewalks, escalators and elevators covering about 20 miles in our 8 hour tour of the city. There is simply no way we could have seen all of the sights in a single day with any of the ship's tours, and when we compared notes and pictures with others on our ship we came out the clear winners for the best tour. Thank you Jamie for one fabulous day in our new favorite city."

The travelling became part of the experience with anecdotes and information about the areas we passed through to reach our destination. Once at the destination Jamie's knowledge was passed on in a very entertaining delivery that was genuine and pitched for all ages in our family group. Jamie was very considerate, making sure we had a first class experience. He even cut short our tour when rains came in, rearranging for later in the week so getting wet didn't spoil our enjoyment. We definitely gained invaluable confidence using public transport that enabled us to follow several of Jamie's detailed recommendations for other places to see on our own.Overall a first rate experience that left us feeling connected to the history and day to day life of Hong Kong as though we live here."

He is a very friendly person, with a deep knowledge of the city and all the anecdotes about such a great place. We had not just wonderful time with him during the tour but also a lot of hints for the following days so that we were able to get out the best from our time. Great also if you have children with you. In my opinion, consider always the longest time you can afford, as time literally flies.Actually you have to consider his tour as the best investment you can do while in HK!Trust him!"

We started at Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple that really gave us a insight to Chinese religion and how important numbers are in their lives. Just when Jamie told us that we would draw some attention to us, we suddenly became surrounded by smiling mainland chinese women that wanted their photos taken with our blonde and blue eyed daughters. For girls from the selfie generation that was a really exciting experience! We then went to many other places like Nathan road, the Peninsula Hotel (and all the luxury cars outside), star ferry, Stanley and much more. We learned a lot about Hong kong and their culture, and we saw many different sides of Hong kong from the public housing in Wong Tai Sin to the skyscrapers in central to the old colonial Stanley. We had a great day and would highly recommend Jamie as a guide to anyone that is looking for a great day in Hong kong. Or actually many great days since Jamie kindly offered his recommendation and detailed guides to other places to visit by ourselves. Although all the talk about numbers made us feel a bit uncomfortable seeing that our plane back home was departing from gate 44. Luckily we are not chinese so we got home safely!"

Met us in the lobby of the Residence G hotel and we were off for a 5 hour tour. His incredible knowledge of Hong Kong history, people, customs and beliefs really helped us understand the city and how it works. We used the subway, bus, cabs and walked and had a truly wonderful time. His advice on things to do after we were together was excellent and he is a \"must do\" when coming to Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the day we had for our tour was cloudy and foggy. Made for a really cool trip across the Star Ferry, but not good for photographs at his \"special\" spot at the peak. Oh well, we'll try again next time. I'll also be on the lookout for those special statues around town next time. Personally he is a super nice person, witness how he treats and is treated by people we encountered on our tour. I couldn't recommend him more....thanks Jaime. Hope to see you soon on our next trip."

It was a gloomy, cool and foggy day but his upbeat personality and sense of humor cut thru all of that. By subway, ferry and taxis, we covered lots of ground while he filled me in on history, cultural norms, religious customs, local government, etc. I had a view seldom seen by the average tourist, including public housing (he pointed out clean streets and lack of graffiti and why), the details and importance of picking lucky numbers, temples, original markets and modern neighborhoods, bays and piers. Because of the fog, we did not visit the peak, but I did not miss experiencing it because he later emailed photos taken on a clear day. We did not enter museums or visit touristy shops, using our time to be on the streets and near the water. He dropped me off back at my hotel lobby after a fun day - felt like touring with a friend!"

Most importantly to us, he was able to answer all the very detailed questions we asked of him about the history and life in Hong Kong ranging from income tax rates to real estate values as well as a whole lot more. To us, these details really made an impression of Hong Kong that we will have with us for the rest of our lives.

I had read about Jamie on trip advisor and knew he could help two older ladies from the English countryside manage the transformation to large city inhabitants. Hong Kong is a huge City with fantastic transport links. Prior to our trip and upon booking Jamie, he emailed us with all the info needed. Very professional, very trusting, no deposit required....... Perfect.He met us at the hotel as agreed and the took us on great trip through Honk Kong'shistory with iconic views from the peak, historical buildings and traditions, social and religious history travelling to parts of Hong Kong your average visitor would not see. He also gave us the way with all to get our Octopus cards for the remainder of our trip.However the aspect that places Jamie above a bog standardguided tour(apart from his humour) is the aftercare. He had recommended a top Dim Sum place to eat the night after our tour which was close to our hotel. After 45 mins of looking I sent a desperate text to Jamie explaining we were lost and within two minutes he replied and gave us the exact instructions to find this place and we had the best Chinese meal ever!When we got back to our room there were seven suggestions for things to do the next day so with his instructions and a map of the islands we sat over a beer and made our choice.The next day, armed with Jamie's detailed instructions with photos at every turn, we country folk mastered the MRT, public bus service with our octopus cards walking through buildings, up and down escalators to get to our destination which was across the other side of Hong Kong Island. Stanley what a great place. Wow! No high rise, great market, sea front restaurants what a difference and an area we would never have seen without Jamie's help. We had lunch on the front in quiet and peaceful surroundings. Bliss.We are now in Sydney feeling pretty pleased with ourselves for making the decision to stop in HongKong when the apparent safety of Singapore has always drawn us on previous trips. Hong Kong was very safe........ We were there just before Chinese New Year so it was teeming.Thanks Jamie........ Wonderful trip which we will always remember."

He also gave us a better understanding of the political and economic situation in Hong Kong. Next, we returned to Kowloon and walked through the Peninsula Hotel, giving us a preview of afternoon tea (which we did later in our trip).Almost as wonderful as the tour itself were Jamie's follow-up notes.

He has a good sense of humour which added to the experience and left us feeling both informed and entertained at the end of the tour.

It had the best uninterrupted views of HK and we had it to our selves!He knew a Vietnamese Restaurant where we shared dinner.We then caught a taxi to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, saw some amazing chocolate at Chocolate Creations and caught the Star Ferry to Kowloon via malls / Apple Store / Hong Kong Eye.We dropped into the The Peninsula Hotel, walked up Nathan Road and he dropped us off.We might have done all of this our self in 4 hours, but probably wouldn't have. More importantly Jamie's interesting commentary and very tailored approach made the night for us.It was worth every cent!"

This was our first ever walking tour, and it did not disappoint\u2014my mom can't stop talking about the tour days afterward!Despite his busy schedule, Jamie accommodated our last-minute booking for a 4-hour tour on our last day in Hong Kong. We had seen most of the major attractions after being there a week, so our only request was that we go somewhere new that we hadn't visited and more off the beaten path.Even with the downpour that day (Jamie is not discouraged by bad weather!), we managed to visit some interesting sites, including the Wong Tai Sin Temple and Mongkok wet market in Kowloon, that we would've otherwise missed. At his recommendation, we ended our tour with a satisfying dinner at Din Tai Fung.Throughout the tour, Jamie shared historical, current, and cultural issues/events of Hong Kong and its people as well as his own experience growing up and living there for 40+ years (and all with no sugar coating, which I appreciated). He was a jovial, easygoing, and enthusiastic guide.Jamie's tour was a worthwhile way to end our first trip to Hong Kong, and we would tour with him again. We recommend you book him for a longer tour (can be anywhere from 3-8 hours) and do the tour at the start of your trip, so that you can refer to his insider tips and recommendations when planning your itinerary. Share your interests/requests and ask questions to get the most out of your tour\u2014Jamie has much to offer. Have fun!"

When he greeted at the hotel, he already knew our names and professions. He gave us a representative sampling of what we wanted to see, starting with the enormously interesting Wong Tai Sin temple, with an informative introduction to Hong Kong religion and money. He called our attention to the throngs of mainlanders, who looked at us westeners much differently than their Hong Kong brethren did. From there we visited the Mong Kok street markets (and saw how subaltern Hong Kongers live.) Watching a fish monger whap an eel against the sidewalk was quite striking! He taught how to haggle for silk scarves in the Ladies Market, and recommended another, hugely eclectic market that we visited on our own (Yue Hwa Emporium.). As part of our tour, he took to an excellent restaurant, where he (at our request) ordered a sumptious repast. After lunch, our 6 hour tour turned back to Hong Kong island (another perk of thetour was to learn how to use the subway system) where he gave us a brief but informative tour of the architecture and a recent art installation.He escorted us back to the hotel, a tour that turned to 6 \u00bd hours with not a moment wasred. After the tour he sent us a well thought-out list of suggested activities."

Early in December 2015, my wife and I, along with another couple booked tours with Jamie of J3 Private Tours Hong Kong \u2013 one in the morning and the second in the following evening. Jamie met us at our accommodations in Tin Hau and we set off on foot. It was as if we had known him for years from the very first moment that we met. His sparkling and truly outgoing and warm personality serves him exceedingly well. It seemed as though he knew people where ever we went. A veritable treasure trove of information on this fabulous city, we learned facts and figures on various aspects of Hong Kong that would be impossible to acquire from other than a true expert and resident. He has so many \u201cinsider\u201d stories about the city that a typical group tour guide would never be able to learn of, let alone share. In addition to experiencing the serious cultural and physical aspects of Hong Kong, we quite simple \u201chad a ball\u201d while we were seeing the sites\u2026lots of good laughter made our long walks seem easy. Jamie showed us how to use the MTR and bus systems which are extremely convenient ways to move about this great city. We left Hong Kong with the feeling that we were leaving a new friend behind. We truly felt that his services were worth every penny of his fees. One simply cannot go wrong by booking Jamie as a private tour guide. He has justifiably earned our highest possible recommendation."

As total HK newbies, Jamie met us at our hotel and we started the tour off by going to the train station to purchase our Octopus cards. We appreciated Jamie's local knowledge and expertise of commuting through HK. Our first stop was Victoria Peak; a quick train ride then taxi to the top and then a walk to Jamie's secret lookout spot for the best view. The best thing about having a guide like Jamie is that he knows all of the \"secret\" spots and how to avoid the crowds and lines. Next we trained back into the downtown area and took a walking tour through the central business district, with Jamie pointing out all of the significant buildings and historical monuments, while simultaneously impressing us with his wealth of local history. Next came the highlight of our tour, a visit to the Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple. Again, Jamie impressing us with his knowledge of the statues and gods, explaining the importance of lighting incense and trying our luck with the lucky sticks, all while giving us the background on the superstitions of the Chinese and numerology. It was fascinating stuff! Lastly, we had asked him to end the tour at a casual dim sum restaurant, and we were not disappointed. It was a nice place, with great service, food & prices. Overall, we felt that our time with Jamie was well-spent. When I asked him to recommend some things for us to do on our own the next day, Jamie emailed me a bunch of detailed information and directions. That is what a professional guide does!"

Now, I had made a few specific requests for Jamie in advance, as we had already toured a number of HK sites by that point, and I was hoping to get a chance to learn a bit more of the history of the island under British Rule, focusing in particular on the inspirations for the old James Clavell novels, Tai Pan, Noble House, etc... and Jamie delivered in spades! We started off by going to the Peak, which is one of those classic must-see tourist destinations you read about HK, and it definitely lives up to expectations! We were treated to a great walk along an unexpected path towards the best view of the city, narrated with some great insights from Jamie on the history and recent news on all sorts of notable (and little known) landmarks. Jamie's knowledge of the island and its goings on is encyclopedic and we were really left with the sense that he had tailored the tour to our own interests. From the Peak we took the Tram down and got the best seats and view on the tramway, descending down to the financial district where we first explored a bit of the history and significance of St. John's Cathedral and then moved on to the HSBC building and had a great introduction to the architectural design warfare between the major rival banks over achieving the best Feng Shui and continued on to Statue Square, Prince's Building and New Court of Final Appeal to learn a bit more about the original \"Taipans\" whose built their headquarters there, and which became the heart of commerce on the island. All in all the tour was a great success, we ended off at the Mandarin Hotel going a bit later than we had scheduled so in parting he gave us some easy to follow directions to place to stop for lunch nearby, which we took and were extremely satisfied!Although we were interested in some of the colonial history of HK, it's clear that Jamie has a wide range of experience conducting many different types of tours of the city ,and the best advice I can give is that if you want a specific type of tour experience just contact him and tell him what you're looking to do. Top Notch, definitely recommended!"

Jamie told us about Hong Kong through the eyes of an ex-pat and long-time resident, and was not shy about his opinions. We had some interesting discussions. Jamie tailored our tour to our interests, which he does for all his clients.

Jamie took us to temples, shrines, markets, The Peak, Stanley, a seaside lunch, and a short bus trip! While on the mainland we had local guides who were Chinese (and excellent), it was unique to be able to get a foreigner's perspective of Hong Kong from Jamie - although he's lived there long enough to be considered a local himself. Being a typical Brit, he had us in stitches with his sense of humor. He told us things about the Hong Kongers that were enlightening. We definitely felt as if we'd gotten a taste of Hong Kong in half a day and many, many insider tips for the following two days that we spent on our own. Jamie genuinely cares about the people in his tour and he listens to what you'd like to see and/or experience. Highly, highly recommend. You won't be sorry!"

Jamie did a great job assessing what we could/should see and getting us around the city (on a rainy day) in an efficient manner. He was courteous, personable, and well informed and gave us a wonderful Hong Kong overview. I would not hesitate to hire Jamie again if we find ourselves in HKG again, hopefully when we have more time and flexibility in our schedule. Many thanks Jamie!"

We booked a private day tour on the 10th Aug for our anniversary treat and we were not disappointed. Jamie is a fantastic guide and we were given a diverse tour of the city. Jamie is very knowledgeable and could answer any of our questions and we had some very interesting conversations so much better than being one of many on a group tour. I would not hesitate in recommending Jamie and when we return to HK (which we hope to do soon) I will be booking with Jamie once more."

I am so glad that I found Jamie, having lived there for more than 40 years he certainly knows the city, the quirkiness of life in Hong Kong. He is well read, current on politics, business, culture which leads to great conversations. In our tour through the city I felt like I was out with a friend. We used taxis as well as public transportation and covered quite a bit of the city. We were not overly tired, we went back energized and still talking about all the things we saw. Jamie even gave us the right advice as to where to stay since we had an early flight out of Hong Kong. After years of giving tours he seems to be able to gage his clients well and what they would like to see. I am looking forward to my next visit to Hong Kong."

Jamie's communication both pre and post booking (and indeed post tour) is clear, concise, accurate and prompt. We wanted to do the tour on our first day to both orientate ourselves and to see parts of HK we probably wouldn't otherwise see. Jamie delivered a masterclass in a day tour. It was like walking round with a very well informed old friend. The conversation never flagged and included both detailed information and little tit bits about life in HK generally. A natural story teller with an easy manner that keeps you engaged throughout.We were concerned that an eight hour tour in the heat and humidity might be too much for two of us in our fifties. It is perhaps here that the skill of an experienced guide comes through. Yes it was hot and humid but every time it was perhaps just starting to affect us it was time to visit an air conditioned building or move onto the air conditioned metro or stop for a cold drink. We actually over ran at the end of the day and walked over 5.5 miles without really noticing. Now that is skill and experience.We did indeed see things we would not otherwise have seen in areas of HK we would not otherwise have visited. We also got many useful ideas on how best to see things on our own, best times to visit, tips for viewpoints etc.Overnight we have received so much follow up information from Jamie that we will need longer than the week we have to take advantage of all the excellent suggestions.We cannot recommend Jamie highly enough. We have been travelling since January and Jamie is the best guide we have had. Absolutely excellent."

We got the chance in June 2015 with our daughter and her friend. For this visit we wanted to lean more about the history of HK (which is rich), but more from the perspective of a colonist who lived the transition from Britain to China. We found Jamie through TA. Jamie was fantastic, HK is a small place and we thought we saw it all on our first visit. Jamie made our second visit more enjoyable than the first (which we did not think was possible). We learned about what drives the HK people, how they live and the about the many facets to the jewel that is HK. Jamie is a accomplished photographer, car enthusiast, and lover of nature, all of which helped make the day we spent with him fun. We would all highly recommend Jamie for your visit!"

You don't have to worry about the itinerary with him as he would have a rough idea planned out for you already. Just set out with him and you are bound to come back with a wonderful day where you did not have to worry about directions/what to do next. We went to many attractions with him in Hong Kong (peak, nanlian garden, star ferry, Wong tai sin, chow tai fook etc). Besides that, he gracefully provided us more details on things that we could do on other days! Places to eat, things that we can do and also how exactly to get there. He's a great guide and so friendly that you'd feel you were just spending a day out with a friend:) Thanks for making our Hong Kong trip a more memorable one!"

We always treat ourselves to a personal tour guide in one city when we travel and luckily for us Jamie was available on very short notice. There were so many factors that could have dampered the 1st day in Hong Kong and it was just perfect with Jamie. We arrived 10 hr earlier after traveling for 16 hours but Jamie was very considerate with the pace of the tour without anyone mentioning it. Nevertheless, a lot of ground was covered in 4 hrs with a well traveled 7 yr old in tow. Even though the weather was hazy,Jamie sent us several beautiful photos of our family overlooking the Peak using his camera. It was hotter and more humid than we had ever experienced in our lives, but we rode the MTR train, the Star Ferry to Kowloon and Tram from the Peak in great comfort. And that great Octopus card he talks about in great length we used afterwards at Starbucks, the indoor ice skating rink and grocery store in the Elements mall connected to Ritz Carlton by escalators. And even after the tour, he emailed us 10 itineraries ( we used 2 of them)with detailed instructions and pictures so we could navigate HK on our own. Incredibly generous!"

I told her I would do some research and get back to her. That's how I found J3 Tours on Trip Advisor. The reviews were so engaging that I suggested to my colleague that we bypass our associate in Hong Kong and sign up directly with J3. What a great decision! Jamie met us at our hotel and took us all over Hong Kong - subways, taxis, walking, ferry - we did it all, including lunch at the famous Peak Lookout Restaurant. Along the way, Jamie had wonderful stories, special places (one special viewing spot high above Hong Kong that was spectacular!). Not only was the day enormously enjoyable - Jamie is great guy and lots of fun to be with. We even taught him a thing or two - including how to use Shazam!

Our expectations were surpassed! We found Jamie to be very professional and knowledgeable. He was very friendly and we enjoyed his great sense of humour. Our 2 daughters aged 7 and 9 found him entertaining and his jokes very amusing! We had a lot of fun and learnt so much more than if we tried to visit these places on our own, let alone even know these places existed! He was very efficient and organised in taking us on a bus, ferry and trains. He met us promptly at our hotel and took us to visit Stanley Bay, Murray House and Blake Pier, Stanley Promenade and Stanly markets, a ride on the Star Ferry, visit to the Peninsula hotel, walk down Nathan Rd and marvel at the 24k gold Mickey Mouse. There was so much to see that we seem to run out of time after 4 hours. Jamie said that we didn't have enough time to do what he wanted to show us, possibly because we made a few drink breaks, as our girls were getting a bit tired. He offered to take us on another 4 hour tour free of charge! We were very impressed and surprised, but also obviously very happy. After our tour, Jamie sent us about a dozen emails with itineraries and detailed instructions and directions with photos attached, outling other day trips we might like to do on our own while in Hong Kong .The following week, Jamie met us at our hotel and took us to see the Wong Tai Sin Public Housing (poorest neighbourhood in Hong Kong), Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple, walking in the peaceful Nan Lian Garden and Chi Lin Nunnery. The highlight for us on this day was the visit to the temple to shake the lucky sticks. We had a lot of fun shaking the sticks and interpreting our lucky numbers. The girls loved this and wanted to keep doing it over and over! We also burnt incense and had photos with our \"animal Gods\". Jamie's tour was one of the highlights of our trip to Hong Kong. We thoroughly enjoyed his tours and will definitely book with him again next time we come back. Thank you Jamie for a first class experience!"

Jamie had organised the perfect itinerary for the occasion, we visited the IFC Mall, Mid Levels escalator and stopped off at SOHO where they have every restaurant except Chinese! The Mid levels was an exciting place to explore, Jamia Mosque, Rednaxela Terrace and stopping off to check out just how much it cost to purchase real estate in Hong Kong. Jamie answered all our questions about life in Hong Kong and had us patting the HBSC Lions and Fu dogs for good luck! Our surprise at the end of the evening was a visit to the opulent Ritz Carlton Hotel and the Ozone Bar on the 118th Floor where we took in the magnificent harbour views."

He picked up my daughter's and I from our hotel and headed straight to the Star Ferry to explore Hong Kong Island. Sights included the view from the Peak, the Peak tram, St. John's Cathedral, HSBC building, Wong Tai public housing, Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple, Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Garden as well as familiarising ourselves with Hong Kong's public transport and taxi system.Who could have believed that we could have seen so many sights in a day!The pace was excellent and the girls got to try their hand at the lucky sticks at the Sik Sik temple.After parting with Jamie we felt confident to safely use all modes of public transport throughout Hong Kong. Jamie emailed us ideas and directions for numerous other tourist sights, these all included detailed pictorial instructions and we never got lost once."

What struck us the most about Jamie was the care and attention to detail that he exhibited prior to our arrival. We were in communication with him several months in advance and gave him some ideas of what we would like to do. We received several very detailed (including photos) emails from him about what to look into prior to arriving in Hong Kong. Once the tour started we received very honest and professional treatment and an \"insiders\" look into life in Hong Kong. We would have waited for hours to take the Victoria Peak tram but Jamie knew his way around and avoided the long line-ups. Plus, Jamie showed us the home of 'Cream Bro', Hong Kong's famous cat which we would have missed even though it was just around the corner from our hotel. Trust Jamie to tailor your tour based on your interests."

We met him in the morning and immediately got on the subway to a temple - the Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin temple - where we instantaneously were inculcated into the Chinese culture. Sculptures abound and numbers both lucky and unlucky were explained as well as witnessed firsthand by pulling wooden sticks with numbers. Saw public housing. Walked a lot and ended up at the waterfront Promenade for view of Hong Kong Island,the ferry to Star Island, then taxi to the Peak. And then Stanley Island.a great day and a real snapshot of Hong Long. Jamie was truly a delight, sharing his historical knowledge as well as personal observations from living here for forty years. Late that night he emailed us exactly what to do the next two days - perfection! From a tour guide, and a real joy to travel with Jamie."

He also teaches you how to get around and gives you insider tips on popular tourism sites. Had it not been for Jamie, we would have waited in line for hours for the Victoria Peak tram and gone to the observation deck with the mobs. Instead, we took a short cab ride up and a stroll to a much better vantage point with few people. At the Sik Sik Temple, we would have had not idea what was going on, but Jamie explained the beliefs in numerology, fortune telling and the Chinese zodiac animals. We had never been to Hong Kong so the 6 hour tour we did with Jamie was perfect. After the tour he emailed us detailed instructions and suggestions for things to see on the rest of our stay."

It was all shared with a high level of enthusiasm. Our small group had ages of 20 to 58 and he seemed to know what each one of us enjoyed and made a point to keep us all informed and entertained. If I was to ever take a tour in another part of the world I would hope Jamies clone will be the one doing it. He truly made that part of the trip special for all of us.

When you have been in Thailand where the people are so friendly, its hard to see people who are living in one of the best cities in the world and yet seem so unhappy.The colours, smells and tastes of Thailand are so vibrant and Hong Kong seemed the opposite. To me, I would liken Hong Kong to a beautiful girl or boy with no personality. Almost soulless. Having said that, I only spent 4 hours in the actual city, so I didn't give her a fair shot I suppose.I would recommend Jamie any day. Thank you for the lovely evening out."

When Jamie met the four of us at our hotel to give us a walking tour of Hong Kong, one that had been prearranged by my wife, I have to say I was a little dubious. Let's face it, right away you have a pretty good idea that this Yorkshire accented gentleman is not Asian! I'm thinking, \"what is he going to do or show us that we couldn't do ourselves using hotel pamphlets?\" It ended up as, \"Just about everything, that you could hope to see and do in a relatively short time by someone affable, understandable, witty, and with forty years experience, that's all! Ha! Jamie is a true gem. My wife and I have been blessed by having walked on every continent in the world in our travels, our relatives almost as much. This means we have had tour guides by the dozens...and dozens. I would put Jamie in the top five of our experiences with guides anywhere. Top marks for local knowledge, ease of relating to us and our needs, a willingness to follow our requests instead of a rigid agenda like most guides, and an ability to quickly establish an honest to goodness heartfelt camaraderie. We felt like we were partners in an adventure rather than students at a lecture. His tour used all the local transportation methods with easy to follow, interesting, and at times, quite comical, explanations and instructions for using them again when we'd be on our own. His choice of \"inside\" destinations was right on the money. We were never disappointed or bored, quite the converse and my in-laws are sticklers!At the end, my wife, her sister, and brother in law, went inside the hotel, and, instead of going home, Jamie decided to keep me company while I \"vaped\" a pipe or smoked a cigarette, probably both. (several months later I was to quit those nasty habits all together). Well, we regaled each other with stories and jokes and asked and answered questions about ourselves for well over an hour. When he found out I was with a rock band we really started connecting. He was a lot of fun to talk with and a very memorable person...after all, it's been over a year and it's still fresh in my mind. An hour ago I ran across Jamie's service while browsing the web's travel section and am only now fulfilling a promise I made to myself a year ago, that I would tell others not to miss Jamie's wonderful tour of Hong Kong and not miss the pleasure of meeting Jamie himself. Sorry about that Jamie. See you next time Helen and I visit Hong Kong, count on it! ; )"

We wanted to make the most of it and get some walking in :) Trip Advisor to the rescue and we found Jamie, and what a great find. It was Chinese New Year and our booking was last minute. Jamies real time online scheduling is awesome as is his communications. He asked about what WE liked and wanted to see which is a great asset, it demonstrated his caring for our satisfaction. All the 5 star reviews are accurate so I will not regurgitate it all :) We really do not write many reviews but Jamie deserves this one. He is straight up and knows HK so do not hesitate to us his services !!"

He met us in our hotel, discussed what we wanted to do, and then we set off. He obviously knows all the tricks, and short cuts - like taking the taxi up to Victoria Peak and avoiding the hour long queue! And also where to walk to get the best photo shots. Our highlight was the temple visit, shaking the sticks and learning our future !!!! He was also able to give us useful information about what to do/see on the following day - we took the 260 bus to Stanley on the south side of the island which was brilliant. An absolute mine of information - Jamie is well worth the cost. You certainly wouldn't see, or learn as much about Hong Kong from the open top bus tours!"

He knows what tourists want to see and he does provide excellent follow-up for other ideas for restaurants and sites. The first activity with him is to go to the subway and buy a transit pass which lasted for our whole visit. Covers all public transportation and is half price for seniors. Great idea. We usually like to do a Hop-On tour, but with Jamie, we didn't need the orientation of a bus. Yes, the tour is pricey but it is a customized tour with a small group and a VERY good value. He explained a lot of local customs and interesting tidbits about how people live in Hong Kong as he has been there for 40 years but still has a delightful British accent with that sharp, dry British wit. Great way to end our vacation."

My husband and I engaged Jamie for a half-day tour after we had already done a cruise-arranged half-day intro to Hong Kong by bus (you know, Victoria Peak, tram, Repulse Bay, Aberdeen) and wandered around by ourselves for a whole day (flower market, bird market, electronics market, Nathan Street, mid-level escalator, SOHO). So, we left it to Jamie to fill in the holes and we thoroughly enjoyed our time together -- highlights included a white-knuckle bus ride to Stanley, taking a ding-ding, and rubbing the famous HSBC lion's bullet-pocked rear end for good luck!Just as important as the tour itinerary, though, we learned so much from chatting with Jamie about everyday life in Hong Kong and getting his ex pat take on the politics and culture. Plus, if you need help or advice on other things to do in HK, Jamie has wonderful email instructions for places to visit and to eat ... including pictures of every turn along the way! Following his directions was like going on a treasure hunt and he saved us lots of time and frustration.So, book Jamie if you can!"

He even took the time to lay out some things to do our remaining time in HK (which was perfect).

I've just come off two tours with Jamie--one midday, one night--and both altogether exceeded expectations. Jamie provides only customized itineraries and knows the best places to go (like his spot on The Peak!), has the best anecdotes to share (which give remarkable insight into culture and history alike), makes the most hilarious wry observations (such as ours regarding nun sightings at the Chi Lin Monastery), and nigh guarantees his clients the best possible time. He moves at just the right pace, ensuring depth and breadth of exploration, and seems to work for love of the job. (Proof of this: He didn't just allow but altogether insisted my traveling partner and I to reschedule our night tour when the weather soured. Who else, what other tour company would do this? But that's just Jamie's way, to say nothing of an indication of his commitment to excellence.) Put simply, he's \"the one\" for, well, just about anyone. Trust in him; you'll not be disappointed. Just make sure you book early. (He books up fast, but he does take last-minute bookings when his schedule allows.)"

The operator indicated that my review was number 444, which in Chinese mythology signified death, death, death. I found this interesting as during the tour he constantly pointed out instances of chinese mythology and superstition, which he duly mocked and belittled. I found this to be a blatant insult of the local people, and significantly detracted from his service.Based on reviews, decided to book a couple of tours. Communication at booking is friendly and efficient. On meeting our tour guide you quickly note that he has the gift of the gab. This is important to note as the services provided by this operator are almost all totally dependent of his ability to communicate. Play along and he'll dazzle you with nonsensical facts such as the fact that Hong Kong has 43,000 rubbish bins, there is a ministry for slopes, and the avg apartment is 33sq metres. Hhhmmm fascinating! All of the sights we visited would have been just as easily accessible with a guide book. However, his tour did provide an insight into the bitterness that the the local British have as a result of the handover back to China. On a number of ocassions he displayed a blatant resentment that any local could exercise any authority over him. This detracted significantly from the quality of his service as we found it most embarrasing and disrespecful. On a lighter note, I must say that his sense of dress is quite fetching. This comment is warranted as he made similar sarcastic observations of my dress. Totally rude and disrespectful and nothing to do with providing a tour! The tour was worth it in the end, just to see a side of conflicting cultures and confirm the true feelings of those who have resented the hand over of Hong Kong back to China. By the way, he did volunteer that he owned 43 rolexes! My, how fascinating, though not much relevance to gaining an understanding of Hong Kong and its culture. I'm sure people will still be taken by the inane facts and figures! By the way we rescheduled one of the tours. This was done a day in advance, not minutes before the tour as he suggested. The tour guide actually added that the change in time suited him better. Also the cost of the tours is far in excess of what the service that is provided, as noted in other reviews.Finally, I'd like to point out that my original review, for the short time that it appeared on tripadvisor, received 7 helpful votes. This is worth noting as it appears other tripadvisor users found it relevant to their trip planning and research."

On our six hour tour with him, we road the train, ferry, bus, taxi, and walked the peak trail. One of the many favorite stops was the Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple where we observed the locals and learned the meaning of all of their rituals. We toured the flower market, bird market, walked the Peak trail to a viewing destination that was far better than what you would see from the observation deck.

It was our first visit to this amazing and fascinating \u201ccity\u201d. First impressions were not particularly favourable as the traffic was horrendous due to student protesters obstructing roads. It was a \u201cwhite knuckle\u201d taxi ride to our hotel through back streets.Our early perception of Hong Kong was completely changed the following day. Fortunately our son, who had visited Hong Kong a few months earlier, advised us to secure the services of Jamie at J3 Tours Hong Kong (http://j3tourshongkong.com/). Jamie is an entertaining, friendly, ex-pat Yorkshireman who has lived in Hong Kong for most of his life. He has a deep understanding of Hong Kong and its people.Jamie gave my wife and I six and a half hours of his time on our first full day in Hong Kong. Six and a half hours may seem a little OTT when only in Hong Kong for a few days but it was worth every minute. Jamie showed us places we would never have found ourselves, educated us in the culture of Hong Kong and physically showed us how to navigate around the city and surrounding area by public transport (which is an education in itself). The same evening Jamie emailed us sightseeing recommendations together with detailed instructions of how to get there. My wife and I are reasonably experienced travellers and normally avoid guided tours but, on this occasion, it was a \u201cgood call\u201d. Try Jamie, you won\u2019t regret it.On the back of Jamie\u2019s introduction to Hong Kong my wife and I had a fabulous time.

We were visiting HK by cruise ship on December 30, 31 and January 1. Since this was our second visit to HK, we were looking for a unique off-the-beaten-path experience. Jaime definitely delivered. We explained to Jaime that we wanted to gain a sense of \"daily life\" in HK - where the locals live and work, how they spend leisure time, neighborhoods and communities. Taking the public transportation system with Jaime definitely added to our experience. We walked with Jaime through working neighborhoods, markets, residential areas, neighborhood religious sights, and all the time Jaime explained in detail how each of these neighborhoods fits into HK life, religious practices, politics, economy, etc. It was a wonderful surprise when Jaime took us to the neighborhood where he lives. It really personalized the tour for us. If this is your first visit to HK, you are likely looking for an experience that concentrates on the \"must see\" sights, and I'm confident that Jaime could design a tour to include all of these sights specific to your interests. For example, he took us on a night tour to Victoria Peak - a very \"must see\" sight that we had visited previously in the daylight - for the most exceptional and unforgettable view of the HK lights and skyline. It's breathtaking! This is one of the great features about Jaime - he makes a point to design a tour specific to each tourist's interests and desires. Jaime is very accommodating and polite as he escorts his guests through his city. He loves HK, and by the end of your tour with him, you will love HK (and Jaime) too! If you are looking for a uniquely special experience with a charming tour guide, who speaks excellent English (because it's his native language!), then Jaime is your man! We highly recommend booking a tour with Jaime of J3 Private Tours Hong Kong! Thank you, Jaime, for giving us three spectacular days in HK!"

He will share his vast knowledge of the train, bus, ferry and taxi system while showing you famous sites and unique, out of the way places that most tourists might pass by. From a glamorous bathroom in a luxury hotel to a tiny bakery tucked away in the basement of a bustling shopping center the variety of experiences covered in a five hour walking tour were brilliant.And learn you will! With a nine hour layover at the Hong Kong airport at both ends of my trip, I was able to comfortably and confidently navigate the public transportation system by myself on the second layover thanks to the very detailed and clear instructions Jamie unselfishly shared via email after the tour. I even found the bakery again and enjoyed another bun!I may never pass that way again but thanks to the kind attention of Jamie I will hold memories of this vast city and have a deeper understanding of this fascinating place. Should my travels put me at the Hong Kong airport with some time on my hands again, I will certainly contact Jamie who will quickly respond to my questions or, perhaps I will book another tour."

We started our tour at 10am with Jamie meeting us in our Lobby at the JW Marriott. Our only request was to visit a few parts of Hong Kong that a typical tourist might miss and the rest of the itinerary we left to him.We began our tour up to \"The Peak\" and a short stroll to Jamie's favorite spot. WOW, what a view of the city. \"Spectacular\" and not to be missed! We then journeyed down and I mean straight down on the Tram and spent 5 hrs. walking, hopping on and off the MTR and visiting the flower market, bird market, street markets, a unique temple, etc. etc.. So many things of interest and I could go on and on. We ended the day visiting the Mong Kok protest site. Very Interesting!I must say the \"extensive\" knowledge Jamie has about everything you pass is very impressive! He is truly a \"walking encyclopedia\" of Hong Kong. Jamie delivered a great experience and \"do not hesitate\" to book a tour with him!My husband travels the world on business and has been to Hong Kong but never had the time to tour. This was my first trip to Asia and I am a self proclaimed scaredy-cat , but this tour took all my hesitations away. I now can admit that I Love Hong Kong! Jamie supplied us with very easy directions of interesting things to visit for the next three days of our stay, we had a blast! Please take the time to view his pictures via his website. Thank you Jamie for a great time!!!!!Sarah & David Lapinski Syracuse, NY"

Even though he wasn't available for his full-day introductory Hong Kong extravaganza on our first day in Hong Kong, Jamie kindly squeezed us in for a great 4-hour visit to the city. He gave us a great behind-the-scenes view of real Hong Kong life, and filled us in on the juicy historical and sociological details we were thirsting for! And at the end, he dropped us off at our dinner reservation to make sure we found our way and made it on time. We also appreciated all of the tips he gave us for activities that we could do on our own on the other days we were there. All-in-all, a great HK experience!

This was my first trip to Hong Kong, however my husband has visited before on business and \"done\" the usual things, \"The Peak\" etc.From my perspective Jamie offered a new slant, inside knowledge and advice well beyond the time you spend with him to assist you during the rest of your visit.Basically it is your tour and Jamie will tailor it to what you wish it to be, if you don't know what you want I am sure you will enjoy what you are given! He provided more than a tour as, during the day, he found out what we might be interested in and emailed us extra information accordingly. We found our day with Jamie to be invaluable in giving us the confidence to just go out there and explore! In fact we bumped into him near the Star Ferry Terminal nearing the end of our trip when we had just decided to go to Cheung Chau Island on a whim!Thanks Jamie!"

My husband and I have lived in Hong Kong for the past year and when my in-laws came into town, we wanted to get a tour to explore areas of Hong Kong that we haven't before. Jamie was the perfect guide, meeting us at our apartment in the Mid-Levels, we explored Kowloon, took the DingDing, picked fortune numbers at Wong Tai Sin Temple and admired the beautiful view at The Peak. He knows all the ins and outs of Hong Kong and will plan a perfect and flexible itinerary for you which is exactly what great tour guides do. I was even impressed after when he sent 5 other places that we didn't visit and hadn't yet been to in the past year. He sent pictures, directions and the best ways to get there....what a huge and wonderful bonus!! I would highly recommend J3 tours to anyone visiting Hong Kong for the first time or if you have been here before, especially if you want to take advantage of public transport and see Hong Kong how the locals do."

We set out by subway -- which gave us an opportunity to walk in several neighborhoods and experience HK's excellent transportation system -- for two great sites. We first visited the Chin Lin Nunnery and related Nan Liam Garden, both of which were outstanding. After a couple of hours there, we traveled to the Wong Tai Sin Temple, a lively and very interesting Buddhist/Taoist temple. We have spent the prior two days in HK as part of an Odysseys Unlimited 3-week tour of China and HK. Neither site was on our Odysseys itinerary.

Since we were limited in our time in the city, we wanted to spend that time with an expert. For us the difference that Jamie makes is his local knowledge. As a long time resident who lives with real locals, not in the fancy ex pat areas of town, Jamie was able to give us a real sense of the city, its history and its people. We were able to see some of the great high points of the city, including Victoria Peak (from his special vantage point, worth the walk!), the Star Ferry, Kowloon and some of the outlying areas. It was a really great overview of the city but to really know it, I would recommend getting more than one day out of Jamie if you can manage!Traveling the city by public transit was great. HK is very well connected by trains, buses and trams, it really is the way to get around. Don't be intimidated by doing a full day tour on foot. There are plenty of opportunities to sit and cool down throughout the day in HK's oppressive summer heat. We also had a lovely lunch in Kowloon at a dim sum-fusion type of place. Jamie's recommendations for food should be heeded. The place we went to he has eaten at more than 500 times!!With anything in life, you get what you pay for. What we received was an unforgettable, bespoke day that was the perfect way to end our honeymoon in SE Asia. Jamie's knowledge, humour and company was worth every penny.

I highly recommend hiring Jamie for your first day in Hong Kong so you can orient yourself to the city. I made 2 requests of Jamie a) take me places that are a little off the beaten track b) provide some recommendations of places to see during my remaining 6 days in the city. He excelled at both, mixing temples and walks through the city with a visit to an island via ferry where everyone rode bikes rather than cars. It was a very authentic experience and I got some of my best pictures that day. I peppered him with questions regarding local customs, what to do / not to do so I could feel comfortable for the rest of the week. As soon as I got back to the hotel I had a series of e-mails with recommendations and explicit directions for a great list of things I should do for the balance of my week. Spectacular tour, recommend to anyone."

It was for sure not planned and it was a right pain for the 3 of us.Deb enjoyed her trip to Wan Chai, plus we enjoyed the day with you and the various highlights that Hong Kong has to offer. Anyone who is looking to tour Hong Kong, well Jamie is your guy because he fits in your needs and looks after you so well during the day. His use of Public Transport is second to none and he gets you to your destinations the quickest way possible. Jamie's humor is also excellent and nothing ever seems to faze him."

Jamie was very responsive to his email (does he sleep?) and despite late notice he had a slot which we booked an evening tour which is a little unusualCan't fault his customer service and assistance pre tour post tour and his email suggestions for places to go and eat are very good.Whilst I admit the tour got off a little slowly (we went to the peak where we went the previous night) however we went to a much better viewing point and Jamie probably took one of the best photos of my wife and I that we have ever had taken. From here it all went well and the ad hoc nature of the tour and being with a true local (even if a westerner for intensive purposes Jamie is a local) was great. We saw some interesting buildings, features and heard some funny stories. Don't be afraid to ask loads of questions as he will know most of the answers but sometimes you have to press (it's not a big bus narrative tour after all).We went to both Kowloon and HK side which was good. Using a combination of taxi and MTR was good as it allowed time to explain some aspects of local life and history.Perhaps the best added benefit of the tour are the suggestions and email guides he sends to these locations, you can't get lost and we used a couple of the suggestions for the next day.Certainly made our trip to HK ore fun and has given me a good opener to the place and I can't wait to go back, and again use Jamie for a different part of the island."

There were 3 of us on the tour.(we had only met each other the day before as this was part of a business trip). I felt like we were a group of old friends and Jamie was showing us around his home. We experienced all modes of public transportation including rail, ferry, bus, and tram. He told us, after one day with him, we would master the MTR and could do it on our own with no worries. How right he was. We left the itinerary up to him and he took us to the main attractions. Elizabeth B comments give more itinerary details of our tour. He shared his extensive knowledge and personal views of culture, politics. Our tour was an eight hour day tour. I would not hesitate to recommend Jamie. Some reviews have commented on the price, it was well worth every dollar spent."

I have never been to Hong Kong before and wanted to see everything I could while I was there. He picked us up at the Clock Tower and we were off from there. We took the Star Ferry to Hong Kong Island and the MTR to Tung Chung. We took the bus to the Giant Buddha (including cow sighting!) and we climbed The Giant Buddha and the 268 steps up and down! Then we took the Cable Car to Tung Chung and the MTR to Central. We took a taxi to The Peak and we took AMAZING pictures!! Then we took a taxi to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and then the MTR to Wong Tai Sin (Wong Tai Sin Public Housing). We ended our trip at the Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple where we rubbed various statues for good luck. Jamie dropped us off at the MTR Station and gave us perfect directions back to our hotel.I learned so much on our tour and we walked over 8,000 steps. His knowledge is impressive and his energy was invigorating! I highly recommend Jamie!"

While the city is relatively easy to navigate, we didn't have the time to research the \"not to be missed\" spots, how to get there or the best times to go (or avoid). Price - I agree the tour is expensive but welcome to Hong Kong. Everything here is expensive. The price is competitive for a customized tour in HK. Jaime picked us up from the hotel promptly at 9am, by the time he dropped us off at 1pm we'd learned more about HK then we could have read in a guide book. We discussed historical issues like the lease of HK to Britain, as well as current issues such as the changes in HK over time, the controversy in raising minimum wage, the cost of education and apartments, the absence of daycare and the existence of foreign maids. Here's a quick synopsis of what we did along with my commentary. - The Peak (amazing views and only a short hike)- Tram ride down (so happy we didn't have to wait in the line coming up - looked like an hour wait)- St. Johns Cathedral ( just in time to see the procession)- Cheung Kong Centre- HSBC and the lucky lions (and a spot for the foreign maids to spend their day off)- Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple (also got to see a procession and hear about all the HK traditions)If you want an insiders guide to the city, jaime is a great choice!

My 14-yr old daughter and I were lucky enough to join my husband on a whirlwind around the world business trip with some time for vacationing in April 2014, during her April break. We had literally 48 hrs in Hong Kong before heading off to our next destination. We had traveled from NYC to San Francisco on a Friday, left SF on Sunday afternoon and arrived Hong Kong Monday night. My husband was booked from 7:30am the next day through 11pm that night, so my daughter and I were on our own for Tuesday. I lived in HK as a little girl in the mid-60's andf had never been back. I had some memories of my years there and a strong interest in seeing some of the places I remembered. I researched tour guides a couple of months before our trip and had several recommendations for some professional tour companies, but decided to research some independent guides thru Trip Advisor. I'm so glad I did as that's how I found Jamie. During our correspondence over the next few weeks, I told him of all the places I remembered from my childhood and he knew them all. Since we were only in HK for 2 days, I knew we wouldn't hit everything, but Jamie was able to fit in as much as possible and provided a fantastic tour down memory lane for me, and a glimpse into my early life for my daughter and husband.I'm sure we would have enjoyed a nice tour with a large tour operator, but I have no doubt it would not have been as informative, personal and meaningful as the time we spent with Jamie.Thank you, Jamie for a nostalgic and fun couple of days. It was a pleasure for us all."

Having arranged a 4 night stay in HK after a holiday in Vietnam we wanted to have a whistle stop tour of HK showing some of the highlights of this wonderful place, so after trawling through web sites and Trip Advisor one name kept on popping up all the time with great reviews and this was Jamies. We wanted to have a tour on the first day of our HK trip so we could get an understanding of the transport system while in the hands of an expert.Jamie came to meet us at our hotel which was the Marriot Sky City (next to airport) from there he took us to the Airport Express HK station so we could get some travel cards (Octopus) from there we took the train to HK Station where we took the Star Ferry to TST Kowloon. Jamie was letting us know all along the way points of interest and details of the area. This area was a great photo opportunity (as was most places) Jamie was always willing to take any group pictures along the way. From here we went passed the 1881 Heritage and Peninsula Hotel (actually went inside the Peninsula for a look around, very impressive) then headed to Nathan Road, we wandered along the road passing the many Chow Tai Fook high end jewellery shops (44 I seem to remember) and viewed the 24k Gold Mickey Mouse that was on show in one of them, priced at $460,000 and weighing 10.5 kg. From there we jumped back on the MTR and headed to Wong Tai Sin and had a look around the Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple, Jamies knowledge in this area is just outstanding he gave us detailed information of all the points of interest. We all had a go at shaking the bamboo cylinder (Kau Cim) containing fortune bamboo sticks (100 sticks in total with a number written on each one) this referred to good or bad luck.. On my attempt I chose the number 25 on 4 separate occasions which was quite spooky. From here we took the MTR to Mongkok and had a brief look around Langham palace Mall, we then proceeded again on the MTR to Admiralty and then took a taxi to the Peak. Jamie took us away from the tourist area and to a spot of his choice, this was just wonderful. Along the way walking in the Peak area we observed some of the HK wildlife, some quite large spiders, we managed to get some great pictures of these along with the wonderful view of HK from this amazing vantage point. This was the end of our tour and from here we took a taxi to IFC / HK station and headed back to the hotel.I cannot express enough the value that Jamie brought to this private tour he is very flexible and made our day very enjoyable. On the tour was myself my wife & daughter and we all felt the same. Some people may think the rate that Jamie charges is a little high.. I guess I thought the same initially, but remember you get what you pay for. We were more than happy.."

I was traveling back from 14 day photography trip throughout mainland China and had a laundry list of areas I wanted to visit in Hong Kong. Jamie was extremely helpful in coordinating all logistics for my two full days we traveled together. I was not after typical tourist shots and wanted to hit out of the way markets, villages and Hong Kong older lifestyle locations. He tweaked my photo 'wish list' to cut out a couple unrealistic items (based on time) and added in some real nuggets I had not thought of. I was there during a very hot and humid period and Jamie was a trooper hanging in with me the whole time as we made our way in and around Hong Kong, hiked up to the big Buddha, and through wet (fish) market areas.There is no way I would have been able to see and photograph half the locations I did without his in depth knowledge of Hong Kong and neighboring islands. His knowledge of the buses, ferries and 'short cuts' allowed us to travel very efficiently and not waste time waiting around for transportation as well as sequence shoot locations to maximize time with minimal crowds. Jamie also provided great recommendations and time saving suggestions for my free time after our two day tour ended allowing me to easily explore other Hong Kong areas on my own including 'his spot' for shooting Victory Harbor at night.If you want the most out of your time in Hong Kong and a true custom guide, J3 Tours is the way to go. I highly recommend Jamie for other professional photographers and tourist alike. Don't bother with the canned tours, book Jamie, you won't be disappointed."

We visited places we would never be game to go on our own, and saw things in the markets we have never seen before! (And in some cases, hope to never see again!!)

When we met Jamie we had already had a previous introductory tour of Hong Kong with another guide so the challenge to him was higher and he was easily able to meet the challenge of providing us with complementary information that was fascinating to us. Jamie has the advantage of being a western world educated individual with a life spent in the eastern world. His perspective is thus incredibly interesting as he can easily underline the differences, the complements, the fusions, the advantages, the sparks and the champagne bubbles it makes in daily life in Hong Kong. We felt we could ask all possible questions and he had history, economics, current affairs, and anecdotes to tell about so many subjects. Fascinating. Definitely recommend."

He clearly loves taking people on tours and you feel like you've made a new friend. He followed up the tour by providing detailed email guides for many other day trips. I highly recommend his tours - so much better than a large group of strangers. Thanks Jamie for a wonderful day."

It was my first time I have used a private guide in my travels and what a great day we had with Jamie we all felt like we were spending a day with a friend not a tour guide. Jamie showed us how to use the public transport system, we learnt about history and culture and saw some amazing sights but especially our visit to the Peak we will never forget. To end a great day Jamie left us at one of his favourite restaurants where we all enjoyed a delicious meal. Jamie's day with you does not stop there he forwarded us many itinieries of places to visit with detailed instructions and even photos to match so travelling around was made even more easier for the rest of our time in Hong Kong. Words cannot explain how much we appreciated the time and effort he puts in to making your holiday enjoyable and carefree. Five days in Hong Kong was not long enough for us so when we return we will be definitely contacting Jamie again to spend a day with him to discover more of his wonderful country.Thank you Jamie again from Louise, David, Sue, Andrew"

It was nice to know he would allow for a flexible itinerary given I\u2019d spent quite a bit of time in Hong Kong on previous trips (and previous tours with Jamie) so didn\u2019t feel the need to come up with a list of must see things ahead of time. He really is a consummate professional who cares a lot about providing his clients with a good experience. It was super to see him again and the tours we did (including a couple islands I hadn\u2019t visited before as well as some off the beaten track sites in the New Territories) were as great as the previous ones I\u2019d booked with him. I\u2019m all for learning the lay of the land and getting around on my own, but it\u2019s also nice to be able to relax and follow the lead of a personable, skilled and interesting local."

Afterwards, he emailed me lots of different options (with directions) for filling in my remaining days in Hong Kong. If I ever get back to Hong Kong I will certainly do another tour with Jamie.

            "review": "Wonderful 6 hours with Jamie - we did so much!. Hiring Jamie in Hong Kong was a very smart decision. Despite a wind driven rain, we saw and experienced so much. WE contracted him in advance for 6 hours. I had a few things that I wanted to include in our tour with him (Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin Temple) and also wanted to experience all modes of transportation (MTR, Star Ferry and Bus) while on tour. Jamie fit that in and so much more. He picked us up at our hotel (Fairmont) at the appointed hour. Besides above, after purchasing Octopus cards, he also pointed out the various kinds of public housing in the city. We took the bus to Stanley - 45 minutes each way by bus), went to the TST Promenade for a very toffy view of HK Island, stopped in the Peninsula Hotel (the restrooms are not to be missed - and if you don't mind the wait stay for Afternoon tea. (We did not have time to wait for 1 1/2 hours). Jamie did give us the tip that if you showed up for tea between 5 and 5:30 the line would be minimal. Because he knows so much about Chinese customs he explained the meaning of numbers, and explained exactly what was happening in the temples and why. It was very helpful in the remaining 3 weeks of our travel on the Mainland. Jamie is articulate, funny and engaging. The only thing I would have done differently is I would have brought our own camera rather than asking him to take photos for us. (He did send us all the photos he took while on tour - and many others). In his web description it discussed his camera and his ability, but it was raining buckets and he was a little hesitant (understandable) to use his camera. We also toured independently the day before we met Jamie. The Nan Lian Garden and the Nunnery should not be missed and if you only have a day - be sure to include both in your tour with Jamie. We arrived when it opened at 9:00 and there were very few people there. I highly recommend Jamie and think a 6 hour tour is ideal.Tip - use the balance on your Octopus card for buying bottled water or a Starbucks as it is taken at 7/11 and Starbucks."

It was nice to know that once we'd booked with Jamie we could let him take charge of the day. We only had 3 days in HK and wanted to make the most of all our time there so decided, rather than muddle along as we usually do, to book a professional tour guide to show us what was HK had to offer. There was no pre-determined itinerary. Jamie met us at the hotel and then talked through what it is we were wanting to get out of the tour, special interests (photography etc) and go from there. It worked for us. The day was extremely varied from the MRT/Octopus cards, Sik Sik Yuen Wong temple (Jamie explained all the differing aspects of the temple), Star Ferry (fantastic and of real character), The Peak (special Jamie spot), Wanchai Market (interesting to see the real locals going about their day to day lives), but to name a very few, there really were too many sites visited to list. All means of public transport were used which simply added to our immersion into HK life. The day with Jamie added to our confidence to venture further afield on our own, which we did on the remaining days. Jamie even emailed us idiot proof directions to Lantau Island (Big Buddha) - they worked perfectly. We ran out of time to use other suggestions he made. Jamie was happy to talk about wide and varied aspects of life / culture in HK and was incredible at pointing out the unusual that we would otherwise have ignored. We were delivered back to our hotel with plenty of ideas for the next 2 days solo site seeing. Initially I felt we could have squeezed more out of the day and certainly some elements didn't work for us (I still have nightmares about a monstrous gold Mickey Mouse), but we set Jamie the challenge of showing us the usual and unusual and he not only delivered but gave us time to soak up the surroundings. It worked. Its not always about rushing from one site, grabbing a few photos and charging off to the next \"must see\". We had a great day, Jamie's style and approach works. You won't go far wrong by putting your precious time in Jamie's hands. This review is written by a Yorkshireman living in Yorkshire (using so many words has not been easy), so tha's nowt more to say than \"Jamie - keep up thee good work!\""

            "review": "Great tour all around - would definitely recommend. My wife and I opted for a 8 hour private day tour in Hong Kong with Jamie in mid April 2014, and it was the best decision we ever made as this tour turned out to be the highlight of our first trip to Asia! We felt that in the limited time we had (3 nights in HK) a private tour on the first day would allow us a \"taste\" of the city and we could then choose our activities for the following days. While a private tour is not an inexpensive option, you definitely get your money's worth in terms of how much you are able to see and do with Jamie's tour, so there was a lot of value in that for us. We estimated afterwards that if we had used a subway card and guidebook we might have been able to see 1/8 of what we experienced on the tour, and really would have missed the Hong Kong from a local resident perspective, which was extremely valuable to us. We can't say enough good things about the experience with Jamie, all emails were very professional and courteous. We were well taken care of from the moment we were picked up in our hotel lobby, to the \"after tour\" followup email we received later that evening after the tour giving us detailed directions (with pictures even!) on getting to some of the other sites we talked about during the day with him that matched our interests. A true professional, he knows Hong Kong intimately, and shared his knowledge and love of the city with us. You simply will never get that perspective in a group bus tour type arrangement. He even provided us with an emailed recap of what we saw and did after the tour, which was really helpful when trying to remember the names of some of the places we went. We especially appreciated the fact that Jamie adjusted the tour based on our interests during the day, and adjusted our activities based on traffic and tourist lines at popular attractions.This allowed us to save a lot of time and see more of the city. We especially enjoyed walking to his favorite overlook spot of the city, a stunning view that most tourists would never get to see based on where it is. We appreciated the fact that no questions were off limits, and we were able to have some very interesting discussions about the city, without the sugar coating that you get in a group tour or from a guidebook. We would highly recommend his tour to anyone looking for a unique, educational and fun way to experience Hong Kong with a local."

While we covered a lot of ground in our 10-hour day (a Wanchai Wet Market, slow ferry to Cheung Chau to explore the island, \"his\" spot on the Peak for spectacular views away from the crowds, Star Ferry back to Kowloon and the Promenade for view of Hong Kong Island and spots in between), we were never rushed or pulled away from where we wished to linger. It was, all in all, a terrific day and a highlight of our three weeks in China. Don't miss the opportunity to tour with Jamie when you're in Hong Kong.

Some times I wondered whether he was towing us a long with his stories....but they all checked out. He really knows his stuff. We started on the subway, followed by ferry, by taxi, by bus and street car. He taught us how to spot the tourists, which is now useful in our everyday travels when we see someone carting a suitcase down the sidewalk (insdie joke). He left us in a market, gave us a few tips on who and what to avoid, so we could search for a painting for our home. We made it unescorted back to our hotel with a beautiful painting that fits right in. Thanks so much Jamie and if you are ever in Canada look us up! Sarah and Shawn"

Because we had filled our days with pre-booked excursions, we weren't available until the last day of our trip in order to book with Jamie. Luckily it worked out with his schedule! We asked Jamie to show us some HK culture, and he absolutely delivered! He is witty, knowledgeable, and I highly recommend him if you're thinking about getting a guide. It would've been incredibly useful had we had time at the beginning of our trip to book him."

He made our time in Hong Kong, both with him and on our own, productive, informative and fun. Highly recommend touring Hong Kong w/ Jamie."

We covered a lot of ground in 6 hours, saw a lot & figured out how to navigate our way around the city, which all of a sudden became much less intimidating. We gave Jamie an idea of what our interests were & he set up an itinerary that we couldn't have designed better ourselves. We also ate at his \"greasy spoon\" restaurant which ended up being our favorite meal in Hong Kong! Jamie sent many emails of suggestions for things to do during the rest of our stay in Hong Kong which was incredibly helpful!

Purposefully leaving all the planning up for a 9-5 daytime tour up to him, we met in the lobby of the Kowloon Hotel and walked to the water front harborside walkway, then took the Star Ferry to HK, a regular speed ferry to Cheung Chau Island for a very interesting journey back in time, the high speed ferry back (40 and 30 min respectively), a taxi to the peak (skipping lunch in a Vietnamese restaurant because we wanted to see more), the tram down, a stop in St. John's Cathedral, a double-decker bus ride, and a walk through the remarkably diverse (from handbags to goats' heads) street market in Wanchai, the area of Suzy Wong fame. All along the way, Jamie provides insights, stories, and answers to questions. We had a marvelous time, and would repeat on another visit, letting him show us more of Hong Kong.

Informal approach is what makes Jamie's guidance different from similar product offered by the overwhelming majority of his colleges.

As someone who last visited HK 32 years ago this is how I remebered the city to be. Thousands of locals and tourists in a working class neighborhood, neon signs, outdoor cooking stalls, shopping in the ladies market...Jamie has lived here for most of his adult life, and so his perspective on HK life, knowledge of this unique area of China , provided us with far more than we could have gleaned from a Hop on Hop off type bus tour.If you are coming this far, perhaps once in your life, let him give you a tailor made tour of HK/Kowloon"

Store fronts along Hollywood Road and Cat Street each crammed with antiques. The Graham Street Market. The tiny shop selling egg custard tarts.

I saw so much in my two 1/2 day tours, including the peak at night (and Jamie's secret spot away from the mass crowds), the lobbies of the Pennisula and Mandarin Oriental hotels, Temple Street night market and the ladies that frequent it! You just couldn't get more opposite sights in Hong Kong.....Star Ferry ride. Can't believe we fit all this in 4 1/2 hours!On my day tour we went to a temple in Kowloon. It was fascinating to watch all the mainland Chinese tourists and their rituals. I also found out I am very lucky, being born in 1968Then we went to Stanley on the bus, which was such a contrast from Central Hong Kong, quieter with beaches. We had a nice cream and walked along the boardwalk, it was almost like being in England! I met a couple of great kids on the bus, who amused me and saw some beautiful houses. I know I would never have come down to Stanley on my own. There is much more to it than just the market!I would definitely recommend Jamie. You will see and learn so much from him. He also emailed me suggestions for the free day I had, which helped me to decide where to go! You wouldn't get service like this from a bus company tour!"

When we decided at the last minute to add 5 days in Hong Kong on to our trip it became a rather daunting challenge to figure out how to navigate this massive city (with little time to do much research). We decided early on that our best chance to enjoy this was to see if we could find a tour guide who would provide us with all the shortcuts and insights we would need to enjoy our stay. Finding Jamie was the answer to what we needed! He turned out to be a friendly, helpful, funny and very knowledgable tour guide. He began the day with helping us straighten out our banking access...which I am sure is not in his job description! We continued to some incredibly interesting sights...some he choose and some we did. At all of them he made sure to tailor the tours to what my family was interested in which made it all very personal for us. During our eight hour tour Jamie was very focused on us and what we needed to enjoy our stay. This concern and focus continued after the tour ended as Jamie sent us a series of emails that helped with the rest of our stay!! That was greatly appreciated...and did make our stay productive, easy and fun. I have used guides before but Jamie seemed more like a good friend showing us a City he knows incredibly well!"

This was money very well spent - it helped us get the most out of HK by cutting through the challenge of local travel and so on. Jamie knows his way around the place and knows the good spots to get to. He is prompt, polite, and knowledgable. I think Jamie would agree that although he has lived in HK for almost 40 years, he cannot provide you a \"local's perspective\" and he will give you an \"expat perspective\", which is fine. Very enjoyable - thanks"

He met us at the hotel and took us to some highlights of the city. More special than seeing the sights was the vast amount of historical and cultural insight and information Jaime had to share. He was able to customize the trip to make the most of one day, and at the end we could not have imagined that we could have gotten more from just one day. Hong kong is full of interesting facts and itself is such a fascinating city - you would lose out if you did not venture out with a tour guide like Jaime. Jaime is honest, easy to talk to, and is eager to share this city he knows inside and out. I hope you pick him to share your time in Hong Kong rather than go with a pre processed tour group. I promise you won't be disappointed."

Jamie then provided us with detailed instructions on how to visit the Big Buddha on our own the following day. This saved us from purchasing a group tour for this 5-6 hour excursion.

Lucky me that I was able to make a last minute booking with Jamie for 5 hours the next day - this tour was going to be the highlight of my trip ! It was my good luck that the day I booked was a sunny and bright Sunday - the best day to be out in the city because its a weekend and people are soaking up the good weather and the atmosphere is great. We met at my hotel near the IFC mall and then made our way to the markets, with Jamie providing interesting and useful facts about the area, the products sold, and its residents. We made our way to the top of the peak tram area but we took a special route to the top and a short 15 minute hike later and we had a great view of Kowloon, the Victoria harbor, that had only locals and almost no tourists around ! Most people head over to the peak mall and take in the view from there but Jamie knows best as someone who has been in HK for over 30 years. We visited the Peninsula hotel next and were surprised by ballroom dancing in the middle of the hotel during the tea hour. We then got metro passes and he explained how the system works and we went to the Sik Sik Yuen shrine. This was a real learning point which Jamie explained the cultures and traditions of the temple and how superstition is ingrained into the mindsets of ordinary citizens. Jamie really made sure that I saw the important monuments, buildings, learned the customs and traditions, and gave advice on where to head next in HK. This was a completely fantastic trip and one I would repeat and recommend to all looking to understand what Hong Kong is all about !"

When my wife told me of the cost of one of these private tours I was initially put off, but she brought me round to the idea and I must say I am very glad she did! Definitely worth the money :)Jamie is a Brit (Yorkshireman originally) who has lived in Hong Kong most of his life and knows all the sights and people, with a sense of humour that was right up our street. He met us in the lobby of our hotel and took us on a tour of not only the major attractions (such as the Peak, Wong Tai Sin Temple, Peninsula Hotel [which we returned to on another day for afternoon tea] and the HSBC headquarters) which were within walking/short metro trip distance of the centre but also those areas and buildings that, while not 'attractions' in the tourist sense, definitely give you an idea of how different it is to the UK and what living in Hong Kong is actually *like*.I only wish we'd had more time. As it was Jamie stayed with us a little longer than we had actually paid for to ensure that we got the correct bus for the area we were going to next, and his local knowledge regarding which attractions to avoid, which were worth visiting, and what times and days were best to visit them to avoid massive crowds and long waits, was a Godsend for our later days when we were fending for ourselves in the city. He is also a keen photographer and found some good spots for me to get some shots myself, as I am just getting into the hobby.We already had an idea of the places we wanted to visit over our 3 day stay, but knew we wouldn't have time to get round them all. Jamie was able to help us hone our list down to the best ones, and decide where to go on which day. If you've already got an idea of the sort of tour you want, the sort of places you'd like to see, he can tailor the tour to hit up those things but he is also capable of dealing with people who (as we did) say \"Er, I don't know really, we just want to get a feel for the city and see what it's like here\" when asked what their aims/goals during the stay are."

We picked up our Octopus cards and began our adventure. We spent the next 7 hours learning about HK, seeing some of the popular tourist spots and enjoying some of the more obscure sights that I doubt most visitors would get to.

He showed us the highlights of the city accompanied by very knowledgable information about the history, lifestyle and culture in Hong Kong. We had an excellent day and would highly recommend Jamie to anyone looking to do private touring in Hong Kong."

He showed us all the big sights as well as anything we were interested in and in a very personal and knowing way as he has lived in Hong Kong for more than 30 years. He could answer all our questions and gave us great ideas for what to the rest of our time there. As soon as he was back home from our tour he sent us descriptions, routes etc for our next adventures and we knew we could contact him if we needed more. We can certainly recommend Jamie."

Last year my boyfriend and I visited and decided to hire Jamie for a day so we could \u00a0take a day off from organizing and figuring everything out ourselves. \u00a0It was great to have someone answer questions and give us guidance that would help us with our plans for the rest of the stay. \u00a0We also just enjoyed getting to know Jamie. He was easy to spend the day with and it almost felt like we had rediscovered a long lost friend who lived in town and happened to be a professional tour guide.Just last week I was back in HK for a week with a friend. We spent two days on tour with Jamie. \u00a0We probably could have managed to see everything on our list\u00a0on our own (especially with the help of sites like this one) but after having such a good experience last year I knew I\u2019d feel like I was missing something if I didn\u2019t spend part of the trip touring with Jamie. Plus, I knew we could accomplish a lot more in a day with him in charge. And since we were in town an entire week with plenty of time to do the usual things, I asked Jamie to take us to some places a bit more remote and more difficult to get to. \u00a0Despite some really wet weather, we had a great time.One last thing to mention... booking Jamie is really, really easy. You look at his website, pick a day/time he\u2019s open and then just email him. He gets back to you right away with all the info you need and you set a meeting place and time. You don\u2019t even have to come up with an itinerary ahead of time if you don\u2019t want to. Last year I was on the fence regarding booking a private tour as to some extent it just seemed like one more thing I had to organize before the trip. Obviously, based on the review above, I\u2019m really happy I did but I also appreciated that the booking process was easy and the person I was corresponding with was going to be the person I toured with in Hong Kong."

Absolutely wonderful and more than I expected!!! I am a solo traveler and was hesitant to venture out alone; Jamie was the perfect guide. Our tour started at 7am, and Jamie was promptly waiting for me ahead of schedule in the hotel lobby. We took public transportation everywhere and Jamie was very conscious of the time so I would not be late getting back to the hotel so I would not miss my afternoon flight. We visited a large temple; Jamie was very knowledgeable (I even had time to purchase a few good luck charms). We went to the Peak, and despite a cloudy day, we managed to get in some very good views; with Jamie's expert knowledge of where to be and when. I highly recommend Jamie for anyone travelling to Hong Kong. I only wish I could have stayed longer. Thank you Jamie!!"

We first emailed Jamie to let him know what we were interested in seeing while in Honk Kong. Jamie met us at our hotel on the morning of our tour, very prompt he was and away we went. We had already purchased our Octopus card the day before (you must get one of these if you intend to explore Hong Kong by yourself. Use it for all the public transport ,ferry, bus and trains). From the very begining we felt very comforable with Jamie and he sure does know how to put a tour together. We hopped from bus to ferry to train on our day tour and that certainly introduced us to the public transport system in Hong Kong. We visited many points of interest during our tour, Jamie just seemed to know the places we would be interested in. We can not praise Jamie enough, he went above and beyond what we expected. Even after our tour ended Jamie emailed us other information on places that we may like to visit while in Hong Kong. How great was he to do that. We would recommend Jamie's tours to anyone who is going to Hong for the first time and also to those that have been before and would like a personalised tour with a great guide. We intend to visit Hong Kong again and will again book a tour with our friend Jamie. Thanks heaps Jamie."

All along jamie kept us interested and amused with information and anecdotes about Hong Kong and its culture. I was a good tired at the end of the day and had a good feel for how to get around hong kong by the end of the tour.

If you are coming from the States and have never been to Hong Kong before, take one day to (semi) recover from the long trip, and then book the 8 hour J3 Tour the next. Jamie will begin by introducing you to the city's very efficient and inexpensive public transportation system. Easy to navigate after his tutorial, not so simple if you had to figure it out on your own. You will then accompany Jamie by foot, subway, tram, bus, and/or ferry to sites you have selected, ones he thinks you would enjoy, or some combination of the two. We chose to leave our itinerary entirely in his hands and we were not disappointed - a nice combination of the places every tourist visits and a few off the beaten track locations that westerners rarely see. Jamie is an engaging and affable host. He has a deep love and knowledge of Hong Kong, but as a non-native ( he's Welsh and came to Hong Kong as a young man/teenager ), he has a somewhat detached outsiders view of Hong Kong and Chinese culture in general that makes for some interesting perspectives. After our tour was over, Jamie sent us a dozen e-mails containing very detailed instructions regarding attractions and restaurants we had inquired about or ones he thought would be of interest to us. Using this information and our new found knowledge of public transportation, we were well equipped to explore other parts of the city on our own over the next four days. The all day J3 Tour is expensive compared to a standard couch tour, but it is a great introduction to one of the world's most complex and fascinating cities."

True, we saved a lot of time (as we may take more time figuring how to go around), but the tour seems to be too expensive for the value he provides. As the tour goes, i started wondering if the tour was worth the money as the attractions he showed me could have been easily visited by ourselves and i wonder if his interpretation as well as rude pokes at the locals' dressing was worth couple of hundreds (in usd). I understand it may be his style of humour but I would have expect a greater appreciation and acceptance of the locals since he has been in hk for many years and he claims to like it. What tipped us over was that the food selection was lousy, we were brought to a old chinese dingy restauant in Kowloon at our request for \"local food\". But it turned out to be orders of westernized chinese food like \"sweet and sour pork\", the likes. Being great foodies and extremely into chinese cuisine, it was miserable for us as the cooking was clearly catered to the western palate and was hardly authenic cantonese cuisine. I wish he can listen to all these feedback and more effort can be put into selection of food .it seems to be a recurring complain if you see read his reviews. What he thinks is hk food may not be hk. so if you are into food, you may want to skip his tours. (By the way, he recommends Din Tai Fung, but it is a taiwanese place, not hk! we had awesome soup dumplings from the original Din Tai Fung when we visited Taiwan previously. ) If you want to claim yourself to be a local guide for 30+ years, you got to be recommending the hk stuff, isnt it?"

He taught us how to navigate it and we felt comfortable taking the train ourselves afterwards. We also rode on the bus and the ferry.

I had to change our tour time and length several times before our appointed date and Jamie was very flexible and easy with the changes. He was also flexible with the tour as we went along. This was my only complaint- during the middle of our tour, I realized lunch is not factored in the tour and my kids were starving. Jamie led us to a pizza shop near the stock exchange and it was actually pretty good. However, I would have appreciated eating some pork buns or other authentic Cantonese food. He made up for it though when he showed us the best egg custard bakery in Hong Kong island. Yummy!We asked about tour guide prices through the hotel and apparently Jamie's is the going rate. But not sure who we would have gotten through the hotel. I am so glad we chose Jamie! He has a great personality and talks to you like an old friend. Since we were only in Hong Kong for 3 days, we really appreciated the private tour. Thank you so much Jamie!!"

            "review": "Highlight of our trip..made all things possible. My friend and I arrived in Hong Kong following a trip to Japan plus a 14-day Asian cruise which ended in HK. Eight months prior to our arrival, I searched Trip Advisor about tours in HK and after I read 10 reviews for Jamie's tour, I booked our spot immediately...especially after reading that one couple wanted him for a full day tour with Jamie and had to settle for an evening tour because his day tours were all booked up by the time they contacted him. After coming from a cruise ship and 7 different group tours on shore excursions - where we usually had to run to keep up with the tour guide because unless you were in the front of the group, you couldn't hear the tour - we were looking for a different kind of tour and Jamie's tours are exactly that...very personal and designed to what YOU want to do in HK. Neither of us had been to HK before and Jamie showed us where to buy the Octopus Card that would let us ride the Metro, the bus, the cable car and the ferry. He took us to many places in HK all the while telling us about the history and the culture. Jamie's been to these sights many times and has an \"in\" with the people who work there so you get to go to places not everyone else does. While we were at the largest temple in HK, he made sure we got to observe and participate in all the rituals (learning about the fortune sticks was fun). He has a wealth of information about HK; when we mentioned at the beginning that we prefer Western toilets (no holes in the ground) he told us where to find them (hotels and malls) and took us to one halfway through our tour. By the end of our tour, we had been on the Metro, the ferry, the bus and a cable car and felt we could navigate them and would be able to go anywhere during the rest of our time in HK without Jamie...but that's not all. When Jamie got home that night, he emailed me exact directions to everything we had wanted to see (including photos) - 10 different destinations in all. I took my iPad with me the next day when we took the Metro, changed trains, got off and went to the street, hailed a cab and showed the cab driver - who did not speak English - my iPad with the photo Jamie had emailed of the Chinese street sign outside the Jade Market and he was able to take us straight there...no miscommunication. We saved a lot of money on cabs by taking the Metro as much as we could and using cabs or buses when there were no Metro stops near our destination. Had a backpack so it was easy to carry my iPad around to refer to when we were using Jamie's directions (he should write a book). By the end of Day 3, we were zipping around with our Octopus cards like HK natives. They say, \"Give a man a fish and he eats for a day; teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime.\" In addition to taking us to some amazing sights and sharing funny stories, Jamie taught us to fish (aka use the public transportation around HK) and now I can find my way easily in what used to be a strange city. He's the best!"

When I wrote to Jamie I mentioned things that were of interest to me, and Jamie did his best to incorporate the things I wanted to see into our tailor made tour. Its obvious that Jamie loves Hong Kong, and loves his job, there's not much he doesn't know about this exciting city, he is the font of all knowledge !!!!By best thing about the tour was that we had a good laugh! he is really funny, we shared the same sense of humour, as we are both from Blighty!

My husband and I had a fabulous day with Jamie from J3 Tours in July last year during a stopover in Hong Kong on our way to Europe. We arrived in HK very early on a Sunday morning and arranged to meet Jamie in the foyer of our hotel to begin our walk. I had never been to HK before so everything was new for me and we both wanted a general overview as well as the ability to move around at our own pace, stopping as our need and interest required. Jamie provided all this and more with loads of interesting information. It was like visiting with a friend who had all the inside information about the city and the people. Our 4 hours stretched out to more and we learned so much more than had we just walked around aimlessly ourselves. Thank you, Jamie. We shall recommend your walking tours, and, remarkably, our youngest son is on his way to Hong Kong later this year , so expect an email."

He taught us how to use the MTA system and we were able to use it to tour on our own the following day, a big timesaver.

Jamie knows not only a way to bypass the queues and get up the peak really fast, but also showed a better place than the visitor centre with stunning views of Hong Kong harbour. After that we wondered through Wan Chai and get a taste of a neighbourhood Hong Kong market. After that it was the Pak Tai temple. Another little diamond of the beaten track. Jamie's inside knowledge of the chinese culture was a blast and really put things in perspective. The peninsula hotel was great as well. The cherry on the cake was the Wong Tai Sin temple in Kowloon. Since it was chinese new year the place was packed. Jamie got us in pretty easely and we were in the middle of a crowd of chinese worshippers trying to get the gods on their sides. Thanks to Jamie it's now clear to me that tying the knot to Confucius the wrong way, you might not end up with the spouse of your dreams! In short: the 7 hrs went way to fast!"

The best thing about Jamie's knowledge of Hong Kong is how extensive and personalised it is.

It's rare to meet someone who takes so much pride in their work and it;s clear from the tour that Jamie loves Hong Kong.

He even includes pictures of subway exits and landmarks to use in navigating your way around! Using his excellent instructions as our guide, we spent our first day exploring the city on our own. He met up with us as planned on the second night. He gave us a tour that truly gave us a real feel for the many facets that make Hong Kong such an interesting city. We went to places from the historic and elegant Peninsula Hotel to the somewhat less elegant and infamous Chunking Mansion - which we might have never dared ventured to on our own. We had a great and fun time and covered a lot of ground in the few hours we spent with Jamie. Myadvice to you is to book him as early a possible if you can, or else you may miss out!"

We were a group of 5 parents, and 7 'young adults', ages 21 - 27. Different ages and different interests. I was completely overwhelmed with the amount of things there were to do and see in Hong Kong and with my complete lack of knowledge of HK and the idea of planning for such a large, diverse group! I was very lucky to find Jamie from J3 tours and he helped make the whole thing doableHe worked with me via email to figure out what we all should see an do. Unfortunately Jamie only had one day available for us but he coordinated with another tour guide we had and made it all work. He provided me with so much information and advice before our trip that by the time we got there everything just fell into place. He made the brilliant recommendation to buy an Octopus Card for everyone. A simple suggestion from him made moving 12 people through a very busy Hong Kong and Kowloon a breeze. If he hadn't given me this very simple suggestions we would have had a very different experience of Hong Kong. But Jamie had many suggestions for me while I was planning the trip. And he sent me very detailed information on many of Hong Kong's attractions and sites - like mini travel guides - including step-by-step directions with photos, on how to use the Public Transit to get to each of these places. Wow! So, we only were going to have Jamie for one day, but he provided me with enough information and precise directions for a month! Once we used the Hong Kong transit system once, we were very good at getting around Hong Kong on our own! Thanks to Jamie's pre-trip information and planning!So, I was very concerned about how I was going to plan for 12 people of different ages and interests. But once I found Jamie, my planning became much easier and I was confident we were going to have a great trip!When we got to Hong Kong and met Jamie I was amazed again. As you can imagine moving 12 people through a crowded metro system and keeping the interest of everyone over 8 hours is a big task!Jamie did not disappoint. Everyone was mesmerized with the places we saw and Jamies's vast knowledge. He divide his time very well, almost seamlessly between the 12 of us as we travelled from one site to another. He could answer any and all questions. He was extremely knowledgable on everything we asked, whether past or present culture, religion, history, politics. Oh, and he had a great sense of humour. It was like spending a day with a very knowledgable good friend. The adults and the 20 somethings all related to Jamie and all had a great day.Although we actually only spent one day with Jamie, he helped me plan our trip before and after we met him. I used his detailed instructions for getting around HK for the rest of the week. We took his suggestions for restaurants and night life for the kids'. Obviously, I can't say enough about Jamie. He was invaluable in planning our entire trip. The day we spent with him was incredible. He made our trip memorable.Thank you Jamie!"

He showed me far more than I would have thought possible in the 6-hr tour, and it was amazing to experience such a great city in a stress-free environment, with someone who knows all of the ins and outs of Hong Kong. Many people think they can get to know a city on their own w/ a map and some looks around the internet, but this is simply not true. It's not just about seeing a location in a city; it's about the smaller details....details you might never learn about a certain building, for example, or that 5 minutes from a major tourist spot lies a hidden gem no one else would direct you toward. Oh yea, and not to mention that to see all the sights you would on a 6-hr tour with Jamie would take you several days, and those days would be stressful and utterly miserable. Just trust me, it's an absolute no-brainer - you want to go on this tour. It's for those little details and the comfort of being around someone whose love for what he does will imbue even the most lackluster tourist with real excitement about Hong Kong. I cannot recommend Jamie highly enough; it was a true pleasure to get to know him and the great city he clearly loves. I will be doing my utmost to book myself onto his schedule next time I'm fortunate enough to be in HK.Tom Price"

But that just added to our sense of getting a better understanding of the city.Basically, he tried to understand our interests before setting out for the day and in turn, we not only visited some of the main attractions, but also some of the unique places that we wouldn't have seen on our own. In addition, he was very personable and we were comfortable with him from the minute we met.All in all -- a great day. Highly recommended!!"

            "review": "Great introduction to Hong Kong. My son and I enlisted Jamie to show us around Hong Kong on day 2 of a 5 day visit. Actually, my wife was suppose to come along too but was with our daughter who was in a Hong Kong hospital having picked up food poisoning in Hanoi. When Jamie heard of what had happened he immediately offered us the option of cancelling the tour. We are glad we didn't because we were not only shown around Hong Kong but were shown how to get around Hong Kong on the excellent public transport system there. Jamie also educated us on many of the cultural aspects of the people of Hong Kong throughout the tour. We visited places of cultural significance, local food markets, and shown grand hotels and other prominent buildings with some interesting history. Jamie gave us advice on personal security travelling around Hong Kong and when and where to be extra vigilant. We always felt quite safe in Hong Kong but it helps to know where and when there are higher risks of coming across pick pockets and the like. If you want a personalised tour from someone with a good knowledge of the history and culture of Hong Kong, a good sense of humour and can show you how to get around on your own with ease, then choose Jamie. Not only did my son and I have a memorable 4 hours travelling around Hong Kong with Jamie, he also followed up with emails on how to get to other interesting places and offered to answer any questions we had during our stay in Hong Kong or provide assistance if needed. That adds up to a great service."

My husband, son & I were planning a 4 day stopover in Hong Kong. A few people had said not to spend so much time there as all there was to do in Hong Kong was shop, so I googled what to do and came across Jamie's tour. It was the best decision to do a tour on our first day. As he explains on his website he talked to us when we met him and then he planned an itinerary to suit our needs. We had a great (busy) day and then that night he emailed all the details of things we said we wanted to do on our remaining days, plus restaurants we might like etc. Every recommendation was spot-on ! (thanks Jamie). Our 20 year old son even said how sad it was that our friends who hadn't enjoyed Hong Kong hadn't experienced the advice of Jamie."

            "review": "\"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRIVATE TOUR OF HONG KONG\". My wife had never been to Hong Kong and I was there once for a pre-cruise stay 32 years ago, so I thought the best thing would be to take a tour shortly after our arrival. I searched and read the tours for Hong Kong on Tripadvisor and decided to book J3 Private Tours Hong Kong based on all the consistent highly rated reviews. It was a choice I do not regret. When I booked the tour several months prior to our arrival I summarized the types of things we wanted to see on our tour. Jamie, our fantastic English tour guide, met us at our hotel exactly on time and for the next 6 hours showed us the sights of Hong Kong, focusing the entire time on exactly the types of things we wanted to see in and around the Hong Kong area. Jamie does not drive so we used only public transportation which I can describe as only fantastic. We stopped for lunch about halfway through the tour so you never felt like you were on a marathon tour. If you really want to see Hong Kong your way and I don't mean sitting on a tour bus then you will thoroughly enjoy your tour with Jamie."

This was our first time in Hong Kong and I believe the tour was a fantastic introduction to this wonderful city. Jamie got us oriented to the local transit mrt and had us cruising over to Hong Kong island on the star ferry. He had interesting insights regarding Hong Kong life and culture..the gathering of nannies on Sunday in the square, mainland chinese shoppers travelling with their luggage full of goods. We also saw some interesting tourist sights, the nunnery and adjacent gardens, a Taoist temple and the ladies market. Overall a great first day. Well worth the money. Afterwards, he emailed us many directions accompanied by pictures of many of the popular tourist sights so we could find ourselves in the following days. Ps. Jamie the Victoria peak lookout spot was fantastic, thanks!"

Everything you would want to see.When my husband and I planned our New Years holiday to Hong Kong, we had reservations about getting a tour guide, as we had in previous holidays simply done it ourselves. However looking back I can say without reservation that it was the best decision to get Jamie to show us the sights. He showed us everything we wanted to see and more. Jamie is very knowledgable about Hong Kong's history and current news and political climate, and can fill you in on the happenings past and present. He also has a lovely collection of photos of old and new HK. Definitely puts things into perspective. We travelled around by using public transportation which allowed us to get a local view of Hong Kong and which was also a very economic way to get around. It was fantastic not only to see Hong Kong with a local, as you get to experience it in a less touristy manner, but you save time in not getting duped into going to pointless places which, but for his advice, you would have wasted valuable time at. We have found that coach tours get kick backs from various places if they take foreigners to shop at certain stores, but Jamie was quite professional and didn't take us to any place where we could be \"prayed on\". Also a pleasant surprise were his emails giving suggestions of additional places to see, which we weren't able to cover with him, once our tour with him had ended. And also a very special thanks for taking the time to research our quirk of \"vow-renewal\" and taking us to the temple for the 'lovers ceremony'. Wonderful memory! Thoroughly enjoyed it, and looking back we have been able to take the most amazing photos! If we visit HK again, we will definitely use Jamie again to see even more of this amazing city!"

It was my first time in Hong Kong, I only had 12 hours and I was a solo female traveller so decided it would be a good idea to get a tour guide for the day. Jamie was quick to respond to emails before the tour which provided me with a lot of confidence in the lead up to the tour. Jamie picked me up as agreed at the airport at 8am and we took in some wonderful sites including the linan nunnery, the lucky temple, stanley market and many other places. He was extremely knowledgable about all the places we went which added an extra dimension to the tour. We also went to famous hotels and to the ladies market for shopping. Being a solo female traveller safety was top of mind and I always felt safe with Jamie and I knew that he wouldn't take me to unsafe areas. Thank you so much Jamie for the wonderful experience. I cannot recommend you highly enough!!"

My husband planned a trip to Asia for us and being that we are from America we decided we definitely needed a tour guide in our destinations especially because we like to get see the non tourist spots. After searching Trip Advisor my husband found Jamie and decided he was the right guy for the job. After meeting up with Jamie at our hotel we were off for the day and it really was jam packed. Jamie took us to quite a few places we probably wouldn't have found on our own, the street that the maids lounge around on their one day off, the market where the locals buy their food (i would never buy fish off the street), we took a drive out to Repulse Bay walked on the beach and of course did all the quirky good luck \"traditions\". Jamie had us throwing money into a fish statue, turning in circles, rubbing statues, rather silly things but why not. When the day was winding down we took a taxi up to \"Jamie's spot\" on the peak, I can't begin to tell you how amazing the view of Hong Kong is from The Peak. I am not a fan of heights and I was a little nervous about going up but it was worth it, I have never seen a view so spectacular before.Jamie really made our one day stay in Hong Kong an enjoyable one, he has a great sense of humor and a passion for his tours. I would highly recommend him and would seek him out again if we decide to go back."

He took my sons, wife and me on an amazing day-long tour that involved a trip to one of the outer islands, a bus ride to Repulse Bay, a walk around TST (including the Peninsula Hotel) and the best lunch we had in HKG. Having lived in HKG for 30+ years, Jamie is able to bring unique perspective and insights that you're never going to get on one of those big tourist buses. He was a great guide and he adapted the itinerary to suit our tastes and to counterbalance many of the sites we'd already seen. For example, he can explain why:- there are women wearing high heels on the beach at Repulse Bay- the license plates in HKG are so unusual- you'll never/rarely see a 14th floor in an elevator- that unusual building is referred to as \"Building of 1,000 A-holes\"- etcTo receive praise from a couple of jet-lagged, cranky teenage boys is pretty extraordinary. Jamie received lots of kudos from my two sons. I highly recommend you book a tour with Jamie as he will take you places and expose you to things that you'd never see/experience on your own."

This review has been a long time coming and I do wish that I had done this sooner so that I could remember the names of all the amazing places that Jamie took us to.My boyfriend and I visited HK last Christmas for 5 days. As this holiday was over the Christmas period we were quite aware that we wanted to try see as much as possible, as well as have time to relax. Which is why we booked J3 Private Tours - I must say purely on the back of all of the outstanding reviews on here. As daunting as it sounds we opted for the 8-10 hour tour and WOW I can honestly say that the sights, experiences, tastes and smells that we experienced during that time were simply amazing.From memory we visited Chi Lin Nunnery, Nan Lian Garden, Victoria Harbour taking the star ferry across to HK island (as we were staying at Kowloon). Victoria Peak, Tsim Sha Tsui and much more. We strolled through the bustling streets at night, got a taste for the renowned markets and experienced what I believe was the best dim sum restaurant in HK - Din Tai Fung. Its places like this that we would have never have gone to without Jamie. He ordered a whole array of different dishes including a special pudding know as Sesame buns/glutinous sesame rice balls which my boyfriend became addicted to throughout the remainder of our stay.Jamie as a person has a fantastic sense of humour and was great fun to be with during the tour.Not only did Jamie\u2019s tour provide us with a complete insight to HK it also gave us the confidence to travel around (feeling like we knew what we were doing and where we were going) for the rest of our stay \u2013 also visiting Ngong Pint 300, Lanteau island and the Big Buddha. As we visited a private spot at Victoria Peak during the day we also decided to take the Peak tram at night which will always hold a special place for me \u2013 a proposal at the top over the Hong Kong sparkling skyline.Thank you Jamie for making our trip so great (nearly a year ago)!"

Religious/cultural/heritage sites, good views, hotels, beach...chocolate shop...and even got some shopping done. Jamie's English humour will also keep you smiling throughout. :) I will not look at numbers, Chow Tai Fook jewellers and certain signs the same way in HK again. Thanks Jamie!! :)"

The tour was a very good balance between small crowded markets and nice quiet gardens, between luxurious hotels or shopping malls and more common streets, between walking time and public transportation time.And the dumplings restaurant was really good...After a four hours tour with Jamie, we were confident enough the next day to go wherever we wished around the city, using public transportation.Very precious."

With a keen plane enthusiast heading to Hong Kong it was only natural that a request to see the famous Kai Tak airport and checkerboard hill would certainly be asked. Our trip to Hong Kong was a bit of a last minute decision so not only was Jamie given the challenge of finding a perfect viewing spot so we could see both the (closed) airport and checkerboard hill but we gave him only a few days to organise it. But he did it! A unique spot and one I would not have considered but it was perfect. Even the 300+ stairs up and down to get there surrounded us by the spirit of this amazing location! Thanks Jamie we can now put another tick on the bucket list! Oh and those egg tarts will be forever etched into my taste buds! Love your work! Kind regards Dianne and David"

I set up a tour with Jamie a few months in advance -- e-mail communication was very efficient and we had no problem working out arrangements. Jamie promptly met us at our arranged meeting place. We spent a full day touring Hong Kong / Kowloon / New Territories and had a great time. We saw places we definitely would not have seen on our own, learned a tremendous amount about Hong Kong, and truly enjoyed Jamie's company. His reputation as the best tour guide in Hong Kong is well deserved. We highly recommend Jamie and will definitely contact him next time we are in Hong Kong."

All communication was clear and concise, even sending his picture so we could find him in the hotel lobby. Tour was all day, tailored to our requests. First day on my first trip to HK, it was a great introduction. Nice pace, nice variety. Fantastic overview of the City.The best suprise, after wrapping up our tour I mentioned we'd be sightseeing again the next day. Within an hour I had five emails from Jamie with recommendations. Okay, nice enough, but his emails inlcuded step by step directions with pictures of small landmarks so we'd know which subway exit to take or which corner to turn at. Over the top perfect. We paid for one day (which by the way isn't cheap but very much worth it) but I felt like with his pictures and instructions he was guiding us on day two as well."

Unfortunately, due to an error on my part we had to cancel the evening tour as I had not taken into account the time difference, in the sense that we arrived a day later than I had thought. After realising my mistake I contacted Jamie, explained and cancelled the night tour, much to my suprise I received a lovely reply, saying not to worry and even an easy to follow itinerary on what to see on our own. This was the start of the amazing and hassle FREE service that Jamie provides.We met Jamie at 9am in the lobby of our hotel, and immediately felt at ease, he first took us to get our Octopus card, explained how they worked, and where they took us and what we could purchase with them . He asked if there was anything in particular we wanted to do/see, and once we told him we were off, covered everything we had asked plus so much more, the day was pleasant from start to finish, in both what we saw/did and his great local knowledge and wicked sense of humor. It will be a day that will stay with us for a long time !The cost was unbelievable, well worth every penny and MORE ! Lunch was YUMMY,so many dishes,all equally delicious ! Thank you Jamie for a great day, and your humour even though my mum insisted on calling you Nigel !Natalie,Audrey & Bradley x"

Jamie gave us so many fun and interesting facts about the city and it's history, he was so entertaining there was never a dull moment. We talked about the other things we planned to see and do on our trip and the next morning Jamie had sent us very detailed directions and tips for each place we wanted to see! Amazing!

As our teenage daughter was desperate to visit Hong Kong we arranged a 2 day stop off on our way to Borneo and booked a tour with Jamie after reading Trip Advisor reviews. We are so glad that we did! We booked a private tour for just the four of us which took I think about 5/6 hours. It wasn't cheap, but well worth it as we were given a real taster of Hong Kong, didn't have to worry about getting lost and saw some amazing sites that we would never have seen on our own. When we booked the tour, and at the start of it we were asked if there was anything in particular that we would like to see, but as first time visitors we left the itinerary to Jamie, with the exception of asking to go on the world's longest escalator that my daughter had asked to see. We weren't swamped with dry information - it was a bit like visiting a friend in a new city - no fumbling about with maps - jumping on and off ferries, buses, trains etc like a local, taking short cuts, seeing the old and new and the less salubrious areas that you wouldn't feel safe visiting alone. We covered a huge area, seeing traditional markets, chinese temples, parks, upmarket shops, backstreets, star ferries, etc etc and looking back feel as though our stay was much longer than it really was.Jamie gives a locals point of view and his own opinion on many things in Hong Kong that would be impossible to get from a guide book and has left a lasting memory. We also thoroughly enjoyed the meal later that evening at the restaurant that Jamie recommended.We were delighted to have spent our only full day in Hong Kong on this tour and would have no hesitation in recommending this tour to family and friends."

We have got to the point with cruise ships that we don't like their excursions because they end up being 10 buses of people all heading for the same stops. So we typically arrange for private shore excursions. We sourced out Jamie from Tripadvisor, and he was well rated. Prior to our date in Hong Kong we had exchanged emails to confirm a meeting place and cell phone numbers. Jamie has spent most of him life in Hong Kong and is very knowledgeable on the history and present day happenings. He's quite a humorous person so be prepared to laugh a lot. He also knows a lot of short cuts on the various modes of transportation so while other tourists are waiting in line to get somewhere, you are already at the attraction.

My wife and I and another couple visited H.K. at the end of July.2012. This was a first time visit for our friends, while my wife and I are former H.K. residents, having lived there for 4 years in the mid-!980s. Clearly, meeting the needs of such different customer knowledge levels would be a challenge for any guide. Jamie rose to the challenge brilliantly because he adjusts his tours to the specific needs of his clients, both in terms of their interests and existing knowledge and their physical capacities. Let's face it, this type of customer focused tour will always beat a formulaic approach. We spent a total of 8 fascinating hours with Jamie, split into two separate four hour tours, one on each of the two days we spent in H.K Jamie met us promptly at our hotel at the start of each day's tour and was able to put together a program for us that presented the current highlights of Hong Kong, while at the same time identifying for my wife and I the dramatic changes that have taken place since both of us were residents. Moreover, even though my wife and I had lived in Hong Kong, Jamie was still able to take us to places that were new to us. He was also great at steering us away from over-congested places that would have wasted our precious short time in Hong Kong in unnecessary queuing. Plus he was very helpful to us in suggesting things to do even during the time we did not spend with him. If your time in HK is limited like ours was, Jamie's services as a tour guide offer the perfect solution for maximizing it. As a tour guide, I would not hesitate to declare that Jamie offers you unbeatable personalized value, whether you are a first time tourist, a frequent H.K. visitor or even, like my wife and I, past residents!"

We chose Jamie because of the good feedback on tripadvisor and were not disappointed. After an initial flurry of emails we settled on a 5 hour tour on our first full day and a 6 hour tour the next day. The tours were mostly on foot and public transport, a really good way to build up confidence for when you come to go it alone. Jamie has no single set tour route but adjusts things to fit the needs of the group. He took us to see many things that we didn't even knew existed. I would say that it is just like being shown around a new city by an old friend. He brings the perspective of a local to the tour, not a sanitized tour bus and \"official views\". The pace of the tour was just right. If you look at his prices and are thinking \"that's expensive\" the answer is yes, it isn't cheap. However, it is good value for money, a personal tour guide isn't going to be cheap, you are paying for a personal service and getting exactly that.After two days of tour we felt we had a flavour of Hong Kong and were equipped to go off doing our own thing. Would we use Jamie's services again, definitely, next time we are in Hong Kong we'll be taking a night time tour (and we promise not to oversleep)."

Had a 5 hours afternoon till evening tour with Jamie and it was just \"amazing\" - that was also my most used word during the tour ;-) I already expected as nice tour, due to so many great comments there on tripadvisor, but I didn't think that it might be such a life time experience. Thanks to Hongkong, and of course thanks to Jamie, who was just a perfect companion, I really had a nice time and I will never forget my visit to Hongkong.I only can encourage all HK visitors to book a tour with Jamie, it's a MUST!Thanks Jamie for that fantastic experience and see you soon!"

There are no set boundaries and most of the tour is by public transport which is fun way to see Hong kong. We were traveling with my 2 year old and 8 year old and I must say Jamie was quite patient in answering the non stop questions of my 8 year old. In our case this tour worked out best as we wouldn't have had the discipline to lug around( especially after a long flight from US). Jamie was patient, knowledgeable and showed us around at a comfortable pace.If you have done your homework and want to visit set areas( like victoria peak..etc) and know how to navigate, then you have a choice to make; given the cost but again it is to be evaluated on a case to case basis."

I was travelling by myself for the first time and had 4 days in Hong Kong, so after finding Jamie on tripadvisor, I decided to book a personalised tour with him.Booking the tour was really simple, I emailed Jamie and told him what I wanted to see and what my likes and dislikes were and left the itinerary in his very capable hands.Jamie met me in my hotel lobby at The Salisbury YMCA and we went from there, taking in the wide variety of differing sounds, smells and sights of Hong Kong. Jamie is a fountain of knowledge on all things Hong Kong and was able to answer all of my questions, but most importantly he is soooooooooooo easy going and funny, it\u2019s just like spending the day with a mate, which was great as it was only the two of us. Being a fellow Brit, it was great to talk about the UK and compare it to HK. He\u2019s a genuinely nice bloke who loves his family and his home...Hong Kong!The day of the tour was the day after the typhoon, so the weather wasn\u2019t great and it was hilarious when we got to The Peak to find that we couldn\u2019t even see through the windows because it was so misty. However, the weather didn\u2019t really bother me as Jamie is great company and he showed me lots of interesting stuff that suited the brief from my email.The tour was great and Jamie took me on the Star ferry, MTR and buses, which really set me up for the rest of my stay and I felt confident navigating my way around. Even after the tour, Jamie emailed me that evening with directions and top tips to other things that I was interested in doing in Hong Kong, so the service continued even after the trip was over.The whole experience felt like a day out with a good friend with inside knowledge, so I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend Jamie to anyone \u2013 just do it!"

As always, things didn't go as planned and a level 10 typhoon hit Hong Kong the night before our scheduled 8 hour day tour. Jamie emailed me immediately (3 am) to reschedule the tour. We ended up doing two half day tours. Jamie lived up to his high standard - we visited both places I had mentioned and ones he thought worthwhile. Jamie's extensive knowledge of the history/culture of Hong Kong and each place we visited made the tour not only entertaining but highly educational. Beyond learning so much more than we would have on our own or with a general tour we had a great time just hanging out with Jamie.

Let me say that every single accolade posted on Trip Advisor about Jamie is absolutely spot on \u2013 he is knowledgeable, professional, courteous, flexible and, most importantly, will make your trip to Hong Kong so much more rewarding and interesting. My wife and I had been to Hong Kong 17 years prior to our recent trip and I had a specific itinerary in mind. After several e-mails back and forth with Jamie, he devised a final plan for our touring. This plan included all of the sights I had wanted to experience \u2013 as well as several other interesting places along the way. His humorous and insightful comments and personable demeanor kept our two daughters engaged and interested and my wife and I informed and involved. In addition, he provided valuable insights into some night-time activities we pursued on our own.Needless to say, I cannot recommend him more strongly.

My wife and I booked Jamie some months prior to visiting Hong Kong in April this year; I had been looking for someone who could provide a private tour that would encompass the \"real\" Hong Kong. My research led me to Jamie from J3 Private Tours and the reviews of his work on here. No one had a bad word to say about him and so I made contact via email. Jamie was quick to reply and provided thorough answers to all my queries. Jamie takes no prepayment regardless of how long in advance you book his services, and he will question you as to your interests etc to try and tailor his tour to your best advantage. If you have no idea he will simply come up with a tried and tested tour for you. Being a private tour this means you travel at your pace and have exclusive access to Jamie's knowledge bank...Our trip started at 10:00 in the morning when Jamie met us as promised in the reception of our hotel. After introductions we were off...first stop the local MTR station to obtain Octopus cards (www.octopuss.com.hk). This is a prepaid travel card of sorts - for those familiar with London its the same as an oyster card but a lot more...These are invaluable and you will use them on the tour with Jamie for all your travel, you can even buy an ice cream with them from the ice cream man if you want!..Once we had collected our cards we set off on foot to Victoria park where we viewed the Statue that the park is named after...then off again on foot to the Diamond hill MTR station where we headed off to the Chi Lin Nunnery, a pleasant time was spent here viewing the artefacts and gorgeous gardens..Jamie provides you with constant chat and commentary and his style is extremely relaxing, he is a very funny guy who tells it as it is..no messing around here!...our morning was taken up visiting various sites around HK including Nan Lian Garden and Wong Tai Sin Temple again all accompanied by a fascinating talk from Jamie. At lunch time we headed off to TST on the metro once more and took in a fantastic Chinese lunch at Din Tai Fung a very busy and extremely popular restaurant serving dim sum amongst the many many other Chinese delicacies. after a 15 minute wait for a table we were seated and Jamie ordered the meal for us all to share - thank god as the method for ordering was not one i was familiar with, plus it ensured we tried things we would ordinarily not order ourselves... the price for this was more than reasonable..after lunch we were off again down the Canton Road taking in the views of the mega label shops etc....we then headed into the Peninsula hotel and the 1881 Heritage area, Located on Canton Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, 1881 Heritage features a shopping mall, a heritage hotel, and an exhibition hall. The original site of 1881 Heritage was the headquarters of the Hong Kong Marine Police from the 1880s to 1996. This was fascinating - from here it was out to the Kowloon Promenade and on to the famous Star Ferry..a trip across the water led us to the new promenade on HK island - and a short walk to the old Royal Navy barracks HMS TAMAR - Jamie had specifically included this in the tour at my request - being Ex Royal Navy I was interested to see what had happened to the place. We completed the afternoon some 7 - 8 hours later heading back to the hotel where Jamie joined us for drinks and some more excellent conversation. This was a fantastic way to see HK for us on our first trip here, and it set us up for the rest of the stay as we had become totally familiar with the ways of the public transport etc.., and with Jamie making more suggestions for the rest of the stay we were able to take full advantage of our short stay. If you are off to HK and want a tour that doesn't involve a coach and a man with an umbrella herding you about then book Jamie - you wont regret it...Jamie thanks a million....Can you read up on Vietnam and Cambodia because we are off their next year and could do with a good guide!"

We first met Jamie back in July 2011, the 1 day tour with him was so good, that we booked him again for 2 days and 1 night tour of HK this time around and Jamie did not disappoint us.We had a thorough tour of Central on HK Island, really enjoyed the snappy view from the 102nd floor of the Ritz Carlton in the ICC building located at western Kowloon. My partner also enjoyed the shopping at Elements located at the same venue. Our 2nd day was spent touring the Big Buddha and the Po Lin monastry, the cable car ride is something to experience, whilst the monastry is definitely worth seeing. How the wild dogs on the island got there is a mystery. Jamie as always was very informative wherever we went not to mention time conscious in utilising the MTR metro to get around HK (make sure you get yourself a Octopus Card $150 HK).Finally, we spent a night tour with Jamie, touring the Temple St Market and Ladies Market. Again we enjoyed Jamies knowledge of the local area, what to look out for and where the best place was to enjoy some of the local food.Jamie is well organised and very pleasant company. We found Jamie very attentive and he listened to what we wanted to achieve and made his recommendations as to how to go about it. We can't fault Jamie, his knowledge, pleasant manner and ability to get people around HK is first class, we'll be back for a 3rd tour with Jamie."

Also, Jamie offered to show us Kowloon and the \"Ladies Market\" on a day when he had a free morning, at no extra charge. He was very helpful in selecting restaurants, planning shopping trips, and advice on the best transportation.

As an accountant, I found that the value that I received was worth the investment! I strongly recommend Jamie for those who value their time and want to maximize the benefit that they receive from the investment in getting a personal walking/ public transport tour. I went for the full 8 hour tour. I expected that I would find this to be too much time. Boy was I wrong, the time flew by as we talked about all sorts of topics and received insights about the various locations that one would not find in a guidebook. I will definitely use him again on my future trips. I have had many people recommend the benefit of a personal tour guide, this was my first time taking the plunge.

We also felt we constantly had to ask questions, to get information.I'd say, take this tour if you want to know the facts, like the history, and if you are looking for general information, not so much if you like stories about people, the city and it's neighborhoods, the food and lifestyle etc."

I discovered him through this site and then read more about what he offers on his website and in these reviews. I'm the last person on earth to take an organized tour but since I'd never been in Asia I felt like some local help would be nice. I ended up booking Jamie because what he offered sounded more like hanging out with a knowledgable local friend than a tour. Ends up, we couldn't have been more pleased and we had a fabulous time. Here are some reasons why: - We relaxed! The previous two days we were in town one of us had a map or our phone out (with a GPS aided map\u2026 if you have an unlocked phone and want to use data get a local sim card.. they are so cheap!) the whole time trying to figure out where we were/ where we were going etc. During our day with Jamie we relaxed and let him do the thinking. We spent our energy asking him questions and learning. - He helped us plan the rest our our week. We had a vague idea what we wanted to do so I asked Jamie to help us prioritize and figure out how to get to each place. By the end of our day together we knew where to pick up the busses and ferries we were going to use the rest of the week. It made the rest of our trip a lot more enjoyable. Although during our stay we never had trouble eventually finding our way about the city, having specific info from Jamie really helped \"de-stress\" our other day trips.- We went by, through, over, under and around (in HK there are hidden and not so hidden paths everywhere!) buildings, parks, statues, markets, etc. we would have never found on our own. - He's just a nice guy and is enjoyable to get to know.Bottom line, although we weren't really having trouble navigating the city on our own Jamie added value to our trip. I'd even book him again on a return trip just to be able to hang out with a local for a day and see what more he could help us discover."

He also filled us in on so much about the rest of the city, how to use the transportation, what else we might like best to do in the next two days when we didn't have him leading us about and what wasn't worth spending our time on, that it was really Value Added. I highly recommend a tour with him in the beginning of your time there as it will make the rest of it that much better. He was also quite accommodating about scheduling and I was very impressed with his immediate response to emails. He is a man who knows and loves his city and has an opinion about all of it which made for some lively conversation along the way!"

He helped us explore the real Hongkong and explained to us the things that we need to know. He is very nice, welcoming and he even shared to us some stories of his personal life. It was definitely worth the money that we spent for the tour and I think that my whole Hongkong trip will not be the same if Jamie isn't part of it. Will definitely have a tour with him again when I come back to Hongkong with my parents. Thanks a lot Jamie (also on the ice cream)!"

On a 4 day visit to Hong Kong I wanted to spend a day with a tour guide to see some of the sights I would not see just by following a guidebook, to get some first-hand knowledge of life and culture in Hong Kong, and to acclimated to the city and see how people who live there navigate and get around. Jamie's tour was absolutely perfect on all counts. He's full of interesting and useful information. Every place we went was well worth it. He was very happy to adapt the speed and content of the tour to my interests. He's a great guy to spend a day with, and after finishing the tour I felt like I understood Hong Kong much, much better than I would have just navigating on my own or sightseeing as part of a big group tour. It also made my remaining solo sightseeing a lot more successful than it would have been without the tour. Thanks, Jamie!"

We ask a lot of questions and there wasn't anything he didn't know the answer to. We had a very fun day that included a lovely lunch at one of Hong Kong's most popular Chinese restaurants. The day ended with a spectacular walk around Victoria Peak to a spot that I didn't even know existed. The views were amazing. I highly recommend spending time with Jamie and seeing Hong Kong without the tour bus! Although we did a day tour, next time I plan on hiring him for one of his night tours of Hong Kong.

Jamie very personable, and will build a tour to meet your needs. Lots of good info, and was very easy to organize and arrange.

I had read about Jamie's tours on Trip Advisor but I was worried in case there was too much walking for us as we are not in the first flush of youth. We need not have worried as he assured me that he would tailor the tour to our requirements and this is what he did. He was bang on time when he met us where our shuttle bus had dropped us off. He bought us Seniors' Octopus cards and we used these for all our travel over that day and the next + entrance for the Peak . We got a refund on the unused part of the card so in the end it all only cost about \u00a36.To start with he took us on the MTR subway from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon and we made a few changes ( so easy with someone who knows where to go) and we ended up at Diamond Hill. We went to visit the Chi Lin Nunnery and Gardens. Now this was a huge coincidence as it was where I had wanted to go but I had said nothing about it because I had thought that it was right out on a limb. It was a beautiful, peaceful place with a few visitors. The whole place was immaculate and really well looked after. Outside the gardens were well laid out and well planted and inside the temples were magnificent. Everything gleamed, even the fruit in bowls which had been placed by the nuns as offerings to the Gods gleamed. It was a lovely place to visit and even after seeing lots of temples in different counties during the previous weeks we were really impressed by the huge golden Buddhas beneath a canopy of gold.Jamie then took us on the Metro again to visit a completely different temple, SIk Sik Yuen Wongtai Sing, which the local Chinese use only at New year. It was full of mainland Chinese. They came to visit the fortune tellers there, to seek messages from the Gods by shaking special sticks out of boxes and to visit the matrimony God where they tied red strings to a rope.We had lunch in the Tsimshatsui shopping district at a restaurant used by the local families. Jamie ordered for us and we had a superb meal.We took the Star Ferry back Hong Kong and then a bus up to the Peak. This in itself was quite hair raising as we had an F1 driver and we sat in the front seat upstairs. Jamie pointed out places of interest which included the McClaren shop complete with sports car and F1 car in the window next to a Rolls Royce shop. The whole of the time Jamie was pointing things out or answering our questions. He was a mine of information. He told us about life in Hong Kong, the houses, the jobs, the people and so on. Yes. We could have done all this by ourselves. But no, we could not have done it all in one day without an awful lot of research beforehand into bus numbers and train stations etc. We certainly would not have had all the interesting background information he gave us. We should have missed an awful lot without his help. He showed us where we could get the bus to Stanley Market the next day and we then led the way for a group of other passengers.He did not rush us but we crammed a lot in besides the main things I have listed.He is a very helpful and personable person and I would recommend him to friends. It was not cheap for just the two of us for 8 hours but it was money well spent and we have so many memories of that day."

Jamie picked us up at our hotel and off we went on foot. He advised us to have our Octopus card and some small bills and coins. We took the subway, the ferry and taxis. We were staying on Hong Kong island, so we visited Kowloon and also went to top of the peak. The night was crystal clear so everyone with a camera was at the top of the peak. A storm was brewing, so we got great pictures of all the lights of Hong Kong. Unfortunatly, my husband was sick and we wore him out before the 6 hours was up. We felt like we were locals after all the tips Jamie gave us that night. I can say that Jamie made a great start to our short time in Hong Kong."

After a wonderful holiday that had included the Venetian, Disney and Ocean Park, it says a lot that this was the absolute highlight of our trip (and the kids even spontaneously thanked me for booking the tours)! While the kids and I were all ready to move on after 6 hours at the theme parks, there was still high energy levels and a reluctance for the day to end after 12 hours with Jamie! (again, with kids, that says a lot!) For both tours Jamie met us promptly at our hotel. We then travelled around by walking, on MTR, buses, and ferry, covering Kowloon on the first day, and Hong Kong Island on the second. The days flowed very smoothly and were perfectly in line with our interests. Jamie had information and observations about everything, which made the experience so much richer, and we learnt so much and enjoyed so much that we never could've alone, on a bus tour, or even with many private tour guides (more on this below). It was also great to have questions answered on everything I saw (on everything from the patterns of other tourists we saw to rents, houses, school, culture, people and places and anything else you can think of). It really did make the difference between ticking the boxes of places seen and having a truly satisfying travel experience.We did have another highly rated private tour guide one night earlier on as Jamie was booked up, and while a pleasant experience there was a huge difference between the two. While with the other all the information I had seen on a travel show, with Jamie it was the sort of information that really does take both a long time living in Hong Kong and a keen sense of observation to come by. He was also amazing with the kids, and in tailoring the tour to suit them - while with the other I was embarrassed by how often the question 'how much longer' was asked by them, with Jamie they were happy and interested the entire day, and reluctant for the day to end!Jamie was kind enough to write about our tour on his website at the request of my kids (they are the 'angelic she-devils), and that shows just a handful of the highlights. We saw many of the mainstream sights such as the nunnery and gardens and market, and many that we would not have thought to see on our own but absolutely loved. With everything we saw, thanks to Jamie we could gain an understanding of what was going on which made it so much more interesting. As well as being knowledgeable and planning a great day, Jamie is also great company. I can be quite antisocial and generally want to escape people after a few hours, but in the case of Jamie he was very comfortable to be around and such great company that we would've rather had him with us every day. The kids just loved him, and are still talking about how great he is, and that it was 'epic' and 'the best'.I will definitely tour with Jamie again next time I am in Hong Kong, whether with kids or alone, and would recommend it to anyone (and will arrange it myself for my mum when she visits if she doesn't herself)."

I enjoy walking and taking time to look around. Unfortunately, I had sore legs from another walking tour (not with Jamie) a day before. Jamie could customise the tour which was suitable for me, a 5 hour easy relaxing walking tour. It's very pleasant and fun to spend time with Jamie, for examples, he showed me the best viewpoint of The Peak which's a stunning spot with memorable story related to his childhood. Thank you for taking me there, I totally forgot I'd sore legs and actually did a walking tour as I planned.He accompanied me to buy Tiger Balm for my sore legs (as my request) and also walked with me to The Peninsula Hong Kong to make sure I could buy its special tea back home. I wish he is always being my teacher for being an excellent private tour guide.From my experience, you can ignore that one terrible review. It's a fraud.

I had the good fortune to find Jamie on Trip Advisor and I am grateful that I did, what a great experience!I was travelling through Hong Kong on business and decided to stay an extra couple of days to get a sense for the city. Being somewhat pressed for time, I decided that a guided tour was the best way to get the greatest amount of value from my short time in Hong Kong. I tend to do my own walking tours when time permits, so I knew that a commercial \"big bus\" type tour just wasn't going to do it. I wanted to experience Hong Kong the way it should be experienced... and that is EXACTLY what I got.My contact with Jamie started by e-mail and it was a very pleasant experience. E-mails were returned promptly, there was no pressure, and advice was dispensed freely. Great for planning your trip. I chose a 5 hour private evening tour. Unfortunatley, the weather on the day we were scheduled to go out was frightful. Jamie showed up at my hotel at the appointed time and offered to cancel or re-schedule if I didn't want to deal with the monsoon like conditions. I took him up on his offer and we decided to go out the following evening (great choice!).The tour on the following day was fabulous. It is worth mentioning that while Jamie is British, he has been living in Hong Kong since 1972. He knows the city the way only a native would and that, makes a huge difference! We visited local markets; made the customary pilgrimage to \"The Peak\" (more on that later) where we enjoyed amazing night time views; explored the nightlife that Hong Kong offers its local citizens, and; took a trip into the seedier side of the city (all very safe, but a great part of the experience). I really feel I saw Hong Kong the way it should be seen!I said I would say a few more words about the visit to The Peak. Frankly, this part of the tour exemplifies why choosing Jamie is the only way to go. To appreciate why, consider that every year, more than 40 Million visitors come to Hong Kong and just about every one of them finds their way to The Peak (Victoria Peak as it is known to tourists). Most visitors take the Peak Tram which involves long line ups each way. Once you reach the top, you fight your way through the crowds in the \"shopping centre / viewing platform\" to get a 90 degree view of the light filled city below. That's the way 99.9% of visitors see it. With Jamie, we took a taxi to the top (elapsed time about 10-15 minutes) once we got there, we took a short walk down a very pleasant street lined with US$40-60 million mansions which led us to a spot where we had the world's most spectacular view of the city below - less time to get there, spectacular view (180 degrees), zero crowds. You won't get that from a guidebook!I left the city feeling like I experienced the real Hong Kong, something I could not have done without Jamie.Jamie, thanks for an amazing experience! Maybe next time around I'll rent a 911 Turbo and we can experience the city from a different point of view! ;-)Martin"

We left the itinerary up to Jamie but as we travelled about we mentioned things we would like to see or do if possible, including local food for lunch, some shops and hotels, and Jamie worked all this in to our day.We were quite unfamiliar with the public transport system so Jamie made sure we understood how it works and by the end of the day we were confident enough to make our own way around via the train.

It is more about the people one meets and the comments they make about their patch that adds another layer of texture to the travel experience. With limited time (we were in Hong Kong for the Rugby Sevens) getting a different perspective and visiting less traveled attractions was for us the way to go. Getting out and walking the streets of Hong Kong was another objective. One day with Jamie, hearing his insights into his home town of many years was a day well spent. Jamie\u2019s knowledge of Hong Kong is remarkable, as too is his ability to negotiate public transport systems to ensure that you experience Hong Kong as a local does. As with anything you pay for what you get. In this instance the views of an expatriate Hong Kong lifer whose love of Hong Kong and real gift of sharing anecdotes about its past, present and future transcends that of a day alone with a guide book and a map."

It was a great way to cover a lot of ground without having to do a lot of advance planning or constantly consulting maps for directions. Jamie took us to worthwhile stops that we would not have visited on our own. In addition to his \"surprises\" he was flexible and incorporated what we wanted to add. Good exercise, good information and good company, his extensive knowledge of the city saved us time and we were not disappointed in our very full day."

However, after the tour was complete I felt I had only seen locations and heard information I could have obtained from any basic guidebook. I was hoping to visit a Hong Kong I couldn't find in a guidebook, but did not, we even ate at the most popular Dim Sum chain restaurant in the city! Save your $3000 HK and spend a few dollars on a city map and see the sights on your own. Huge disappointment :-("

We visited temples and gardens, where Jamie highlighted the seemingly ridiculous and hilarious aspects of Hong Kong culture. We were in fits of laughter!The restaurant he recommended was absolutely delicious - we ate there twice afterwards!The tour ended with a taxi ride to \u201cthe peak\u201d, where Jamie took us to his favourite look out spot, where no other tourist was present. We had a personal view of the entire city of Hong Kong. It was simply extraordinary.Jamie\u2019s personal and jovial demeanor, and his intimate knowledge of the city proved to be an absolute winning combination. In the 9 hours we spent with him, we gained an honest insight into this seemingly superficial city. All in all, Jamie was fantastic, and we could have spent the entire week with him."

My teenage son and I met Jamie promptly as we had organized via brief emails and had a fantastic whirlwind full day tour of Honk Kong. Jamie was very intuitive and took us to a variety of spots that were exactly matched to both our interests. We are a hard act to please, as I am in the art business and we also have very high standards for food - coming from New York City. Jamie never disappointed us as we followed him across the entire city from temples to the beach, hopping on every possible mode of transportation (apart from taxis!). The day flew by and we felt not only had we a good grasp on the city but an excellent day seeing sites we never would have found on our own. Jamie is easy to get along with - entertaining, opinionated, knowledgeable and intuitive. I will recommend him him to anyone I know going to Hong Kong. Thanks Jamie!"

The guide Jammie Lloyd is very interesting guy, a gentleman and a scholar. He has a great depth of knowledge of everything Hong Kong. Jamie has lived in Hong Kong for 36 years and so has a broad prespective of the city and how it has developed. He is also up to date on everything going on in the city both socially and politically. Jamie gives detailed answers to questions that the average bus tour guide would brush over or change the subject when asked. My wife and I enjoyed the 10 hour tour a lot and the time passed very quickly as we went from place to place and got a real feel for Hong Kong. Jamie is very easy to get along with and we could instantly see why his tours get great reviews as he can relate to his clients no matter what their status or background. He took us lots of places both on the Hong Kong and the Kowloon sides as well as on a bus ride to Aberdeen and Stanley (at our request) on the south coast of the island. We also went to the Peak with him in the rain and saw the lights of the city from above. It was great to see the back streets of Hong Kong and go to places we would probably never have venture into if going alone. For lunch Jamie took us to Din Tai Fung which is an excellent, clean and inexpensive resturant that is highly rated on Tripadvisor. One of the great advantages of going on the tour with Jame is that he knows exactly what to do and where to go and more importantly how to get there. Simple things like the best place to catch the taxis with shortest wait or what side of the street to catch the bus on can be so important and make the day much more enjoyable. If you go it alone sure you can do it but it will take you days to figure it out. Jamie does not take tour guests to stores or outlets and in no way pushes you to buy or do anything. He is more than happy to suggest the best place to buy something and help you if you so request. On the tour you have Jamie's full and undivided attention unlike some tour guides who are on their phone half of the tour. We have very high standards when it comes to tours and guides (we hate bus tours and their bad comedy show tour guides) and Jamie really impressed us and we enjoyed the tour a lot. We celebrated his birthday at the end of our tour with a cocktail back at the bar of our hotel, the Shangri-la.So if you are in Hong Kong for days or just a few hours and want to get a real feel for the city we could suggest no better way to do it than to book a tour with J3 Tours and Jamie Lloyd. Another tour with Jamie will be top of our \"to do list\" next time we stop in Hong Kong."

What we appreciated the most about our tour with Jamie was experiencing parts of Hong Kong we hadn't considered or known about. Taking us to Wong Tai Sin Temple where he was able to explain the religious culture of the area which proved to us how valuable it was to have own tour guide rather than roaming around aimlessly. Another highlight for us was lunch, we ate at Din Tai Fung, oh yum! It was delicious, clean and great value for money. We ate their a couple more times during our stay in Hong Kong. I highly recommend a day out with Jamie, his advice was invaluable the four remaining days in Hong Kong. He gave us confidence to use the MTR at any time of night or day. It was a pleasure for us to meet Jamie. ( if you read this Jamie, change your profile picture as you look younger in real life!)"

We had an interesting mix for him to manage & to entertain 3 adults, 3 teenagres and 3 infants (triplets) and his advise to me before meeting was dont worry let me meet the group and I'll plan a perfect trip.True to his word he did from the get go Jaime made himself part of us and it became more like a family day out rather than a tour and the weather became an irrelevance. We travelled on the Star Ferry to the Island which was a big adventure for the 2 year olds as was the following hop on the bus to Stanley where everyone had a good time including my 12 year old son who we had to drag away from the electronic gadgets. Then on to a great Dim Sum lunch at Maxims Tea House after which my wife and I took the younger children back to the hotel to nap but Jaime took the older girls under his wing and headed off past Kowloon for another adventure at the Ladies Market (muchto one of the triplets disappointment as Jaime had become his new best friend and he didnt want him to go). In the end what started as simply tour became the start of a friendship I hope will continue on future visits to Hong Kong. Jaime went over and beyond my expectations as our 5 hours for my teenagers & nanny turned into a whole day of adventure as after my wife & I said farewell to him he safely guided them to new destinations and showed them how to safely get home. During the day Jaime was an encycolpaedia of knowledge on Hong Kong and shared many fascinating insights off the beaten path I couldnt recommend him more highly."

I picked up the tab which was my pleasure.Mr. Lloyd knows how to get around and brought us to many interesting places. My only suggestion is that he should perhaps offer a little more factual information regarding the places he brings us to. For instance, we went to the Chi Lin Nunnery in Kowloon but never mentioned that this impressive place was built without the use of any nails.Also, if you have a poodle do not mention it to Mr. Lloyd. We have two and it was kind of embarrassing because our guide had an unfortunate experience with a poodle which apparently left its mark. I would recommend Mr. Lloyd without reservation."

We traversed Hong Kong on public transportation with him for 10 hours and enjoyed every minute. I asked Jamie to show us the real Hong Kong. We traveled some distance to see and walk through two totally different kinds of towns in suburban Hong Kong - far removed from the glitz and wealth of the designer stores where people queue all day to spend money extravagantly. We had the best dim sum I've ever tasted and visited a fascinating nunnery that doesn't appear in any guidebooks. I rarely visit foreign cities twice, and so I had to totally educate myself during my two days there. While visiting several extraordinary sites, he educated us about politics, banking, the legal system, the economy, the school system and other topics as I peppered him with questions all day. While 10 hours can seem like a long time, Jamie paced our day nicely - that we enjoyed every experience and returned to our hotel with enough energy to enjoy a wonderful evening."

We wanted to start our visit with some help both on becoming more familiar with the city and its transportation system as well as possible places to visit, both \"touristy\" and not. After reading previous reviews about Jamie in this forum, we decided to spend our first day in this city with him. This turned out to be a wise decision.What was nice about having your own tour guide is that there is no set schedule. He did have plans for places to see and we did get to see them, but what was more valuable was the other information he provided. This included when to go to Macau and to the Giant Buddha, all of which was spot on. We became familiar with the transport system and ferries, and the use of the Oyster card (he did learn that they sold these cards now at the airport along with the Airport Express ticket). We were able to see the city from the standpoint of someone who had lived there for decades. All in all, the money spent was well worth it, especially for newbies such as ourselves. I imagine the biggest problem people will have is trying to book him."

Jamie is an excellent tour guide, very knowledgeable and obviously knows his way around the city like no one else! He is very accommodating and you can ask him almost any number of questions that you have about HK. I did not request a specific itinerary so Jamie planned out a very organised day visiting the must-see places, with plenty of time to check out each place and get a few snaps. The best part for me was the view from The Peak that Jamie showed me. It was fantastic!I think that booking a tour with Jamie is a MUST for every first timer to HK. Thanks to Jamie, I was easily able to get around the city the next few days that I was there."

This is a review of an 8-hour personal tour that my mother and I took while visiting my brother in Hong Kong.Jamie is a very knowledgeable and friendly tour guide. He can literally tell you anything about Hong Kong. We loved his low key nature, and could not believe how accommodating he was. We had booked him for an 8-hour tour of the city and had planned on going to the top of Victoria Peak. The weather was just god awful, so instead of dragging us up there just to get it done, Jamie offered to meet with us the following day, after another tour he had scheduled, to take us up there. We ended up doing it on our own because we had an absolutely beautiful morning and nothing else planned, but we were very impressed with his offer. Even though we found Jamie to be an awesome tour guide, I think an 8-hour tour of Hong Kong may have been a bit of overkill. We had just come from spending two weeks in Beijing, Shanghai, and Xi'an, where having a tour guide is ESSENTIAL since no one in China speaks English, there is so much to see, and everyone is trying to take advantage of Americans so you need someone to look out for you. Hong Kong is completely different- almost everyone speaks English, there are not as many cultural sites as in China (we personally had been templed-out), and it's just easier to get around on your own. So I would definitely recommend booking with Jamie, but maybe not for the ENTIRE day. Five or six hours would have been perfect for us, but we were also there for another three days and had a family member living in Hong Kong to meet up with for the weekend."

Just follow Jamie. He was very aware of all of us at all times, especially in busy areas.

My husband, two teenage children aged 16 and 15 and I spent a fantastic day with Jamie on an eight hour walking tour of Hong Kong last month that we will remember always! When I first told the kids I had booked an eight hour walking tour they were horrified - firstly at having to walk around all day and secondly at having to listen to someone they thought would be a boring tour guide like the ones they have had on other tours. They were so wrong and they were very happy to admit they were wrong after our day out with Jamie. Jamie took us to some of the well-known tourist attractions and also some less well-known that we would not have found by ourselves. He gave us the confidence to go anywhere in Hong Kong on public transport and made excellent suggestions for other places to visit during our stay, emailing us detailed information on how to get there. He gave us a great insight into everyday life in Hong Kong, based on his own experiences and this was certainly different from anything you would read in a guide book. We enjoyed a delicious lunch together eating his second most favourite food, steamed dumplings, and he went out of his way to assist us in resolving a shopping problem we had, where I had been duped into paying more for camera equipment than I should have done. He accomplished all this in just eight hours that raced by so quickly, we were sorry when it came to an end. Jamie is the perfect tour guide, knowledgeable, flexible, easy-going and with a wicked sense of humour that appealed to all of us and kept us laughing all day. At the end of each holiday we go on, we vote on different things, best food, best hotel, best purchase etc. Jamie scored top marks in two categories - best tour guide and best day out!! A pretty good performance when two of the voters are hard to please teenagers. I would have no hesitation in recommending J3 Tours with Jamie to anyone looking for a great day out, with a difference, in Hong Kong and I would also say that Jamie's website is a must-read for all visitors to the city. Thank you again Jamie for a most memorable day, we would love to catch up with you again in the future."

Jamie made sure that I knew the booking fee before I committed for the date. He was able to adjust to my spouse's health conditions as he planned our day. As it turns out, we had to drop my spouse off at the hotel to rest while I continued the rest of the tour with Jamie. Jamie knew that I had specific things to buy for my children and he was able to take me to a fabric market that I would not have found on my own. The fabric market was overpowering with colors and different fabrics but I walked away with gorgeous fabric loved by my children! The best part was that Jamie offered his advice in purchasing and seemed to enjoy the market. It was a wonderful afternoon of experiences that I will always remember. My spouse loved hearing my stories of the afternoon and so did my children. Money can't buy the experience that Jamie gives you including the hunt for Diet Dr. Pepper in Hong Kong!"

He gets to tour with all types, I am sure, and his manner is relaxed and casual. I really support Jamie and hope that he has great success in this business. My only suggestion, is that maybe he prints up a map and circles or at least deliniates the route that he takes his clients on for a momento. After our tour, I had no idea where we really went, since so much of it was on subways. It would have made a nice memory, to have something like that."

We have used Trip Adviser and CruiseCritic for planning trips for years and have asked lots of questions but this is our first review. We got so much help from others that we will post a complete review on our entire trip to China but Jamie - the guide we used in Hong Kong was so great, we are writing this first.Just some background. We are an older couple with mobility issues. We have traveled extensively and always by ourselves but usually retain guides independently in cities where getting around is not easy because of distance and time. We planned a 3 week trip to China using China Highlight's because it seemed easier than trying to get individual guides in all the cities we were going to visit. We were flying through Hong Kong and figured we could do HK ourselves as it seemed like an easy city to do on our own and it wasn't part of our package with China Highlights. But we really only had one day there - flying in late on Thursday and leaving early Saturday morning so we just had Friday. After spending lots of time trying to plan our day there I realized we'd never get to most on our own and didn't want to do a big bus tour. So rather than spending time figuring out how to get to everything, we decided to hire a guide. I found Jamie Lloyd (J3 Private Tours) on Tours by Locals and then read all the great reviews on TA. He also has a thorough website that covers everything. We exchanged a few emails and booked.Jamie met us at our hotel at the agreed time. My husband has a hard time with much walking so Jamie altered our itinerary to accommodate us. He was so friendly and knowledgeable and made it easy for my husband to get around. He had originally planned for us to use buses and the subway but after one subway ride we quickly decided taxis would allow us to see more.We went to the Chi Lin Nunnery first and it is an impressive garden. We then took the Star Ferry to Hong Kong Island (we were staying in Kowloon) where we had a quick lunch and then caught the public double decker bus to Stanley Market. Jamie got us there just in time to be first on the bus so we had the first row upstairs seats and wow - what views! And the traffic! We were so glad we didn't try to do this all on our own. At the Stanley Market Jamie walked slowly with my husband and let him rest so I could do some shopping - which I really appreciated. We then went to the Victoria Peak and Jamie walked me out to a special spot he has found to take the best pictures of the Hong Kong skyline. That took all day so we missed a few things I had really wanted to see - like the mid-level elevators but we just couldn't move any faster. Jamie even got us back to our hotel.The best thing about Jamie is his knowledge about all things Hong Kong. He is interesting, can answer every question and really likes his job so he makes you feel like a friend showing you around their hometown. He was definitely the best guide we had during the 3 weeks and I would highly recommend him to anyone. He was so adaptable and attentive to our mobility issues. In fact he was one of the best guides we've had all over the world. We'd love to go back and spend days with Jamie.Just looking through his website will make you feel like you have seen HK. Being there with his expertise made it even better. Thanks Jamie for a great day."

We wanted to see a different side of Hong Kong in addition to the usual attractions. Jamie provided those experiences and answered questions for us all day. He will customize your day around what you want to accomplish or let him put the day together for you. We used all forms of public transportation to get around - subway, bus, tram, ferry - which we thoroughly enjoyed. He'll meet you (if you are on a cruise ship being transported from the port meeting at the clock tower at the Star Ferry on the Kowloon side is a great spot). We really felt like we got the most out of our time in Hong Kong."

We visited Hong Kong recently and had Jamie as our guide for a day tour visiting a Chinese market,temple and The Peak and other sights. We negotiated the subways andferries and this added to the experience,much better than being on a tour bus also by not doing the tourist thing we avoided line ups. We did an evening tour the next day and saw the lights from the Kowloon side and visited the Peak at night which is a must see but the highlight for us was a beautiful garden belonging to a Buddhist nunnery. We saw this at dusk and it was almost surreal in atmosphere. I would highly recommend using Jamie as a guide, he is personable and if you do not mindwalking it is a great way to see Hong Kong.

My mom has some mobility issues and I checked in advance that Jamie could handle this. He was superb. From guiding us down interesting market streets (some with scary sites) to seeing the most beautiful view of HK for free! Quite honestly, the best thing about Jamie is the extra time he took with us. He made sure we got back safely to our hotel (even though it was a bit over our time because of my mom's slow walking). That kind of going out of your way to help people is rare.We took the tour early in our trip and it was invaluable to navigating the city for the remainder of the week.

We asked to see the \"real\" Hong Kong instead of just the glitz and glamour. He started by showing us a good place to change money. We also learned to get around the city with an Octopus Card that enables you to ride all the trains, buses, and ferries (the senior card really saved us money). It was tiring because we walked to most of the attractions but this allowed us to see the local neighborhoods. We did most of the \"must sees\" like The Peak, the Chi Lin Nunnery (although he didn't want to stop there for tea or a vegetarian lunch), Che Kung Temple, and Giant Buddha on Lantau Island. He accompanied us to several good restaurants popular with locals. We're not big shoppers but managed to do a little with Jamie and on our own in Stanley. Perhaps we spent too much time on local color because we never got to any museums, Aberdeen fishing village (which was requested by my husband), or local markets like the bird and goldfish markets. On our own we went to the Stanley market (but didn't know what stop to get off the bus for Abderdeen), Heritage Museum, Temple of 10,000 Buddhas, Light Show on the Aqua Luna, and the Walk of Stars. We would definitely recommend Jamie to others touring Hong Kong. It's best to let him know exactly what you would like to do ahead of time so he can plan the time. There is really so much to see and do that you have to set priorities, especially if you are limited in time."

Very enlightening day in HK to see how locals of all types live. We did the big touristy items (e.g., The Peak), but always with his own take that made it better (e.g., \"secret\" viewing point at the Peak that is far better than the \"corporate\" view that they herd you to). We also did a lot of non-touristy things (e.g., visited his local hospital and learned a bit about the state of health care in HK). I recommend booking Jamie for your first day in HK to get oriented to the city and its transportation. After a day with him, we felt like educated locals ourselves!

He took us through HK from dusk into the night and although I was a bit disappointed in not being able to book a day tour originally, this was dispelled immediately as we dove into the vibrant and beautiful night ambience of Hong Kong. He showed us how to use the subway system which was surprisingly easy and convenient for getting around town and showed us things that we would never have found or seen without his guidance. It was a great introduction into the heart of HK and told through the eyes of an inveterate expat with a wealth of knowledge and street smarts. You could use Abercrombie and such but I truly believe that this was as close to a city as you are likely to experience in a brief time, much more soulful then a guided tour filled with droll facts recited by a disinterested party - thumbs up!"

He tailored a 2 Day tour for us and we felt very comfortable setting out the rest of the week on our own. We spent one whole day going everywhere via the public transit systems along with many fun and interesting sites along the way--both expected and totally unexpected. The second day was mostly walking and we hit many more terrific spots. All the while, Jamie gave us all sorts of tips on how to get where we wanted to go, where to avoid, and many more suggestions for a terrific week! As he advertised, there were lots of surprises along the way. He always got us to the sites we were most interested in, but it is well worth it to keep an open mind and follow along. Don't be afraid to suggest some stops for photos, etc--he is most accommodating. Also, given the harsh summer climate in that part of the world, he made sure we had several well-timed AC breaks and stops for water, etc. We were exhausted by the end of each day, but it was time and energy well spent, and with a great guide!"

Our tour was about as down to earth as you can get; one minute we were walking the backstreets looking for a particular temple nowhere near the tourist's mainstream, or strolling the beach at Recluse Bay, or being personally dropped off for high tea at the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon. Jamie was on time, polite, informative, friendly, flexible and had his own take on this wonderful city. Although Jamie was English speaking, his lack of Chinese did not seem to hinder us in any way, and we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay."

Every visitor coming to Hong Kong needs a person like Jamie who can give them intimate knowledge of day to day informative and interesting things about Hong Kong. Jamie is a sensitive and caring person, who caters for your specific needs. He clearly keeps up to date on everything which is happening in Hong Kong, but is also conscious of a great deal of Hong Kong's features. Jamie took the 3 of us around Hong Kong in one day, we had different interests and were different ages, but all enjoyed Jamie's tour. Jamie was able to balance everybody's interests out, so that everybody had a terrific day!Jamie is a \"walking book of knowledge\" and is very personable. We will catch up with Jamie when we return to Hong Kong because he was one of the highlights of our trip, and we would recommend him to anybody visiting Hong Kong. We strongly suggest you use him and not TOURIST BUSES, you will see why when you are in Hong Kong!!"

Jamie Lloyd of J3 Tours has really separated himself from the pack when it comes to showing off Hong Kong's attractions with a more eclectic approach and well researched approach..This tour is not designed for people who want to be treated like cattle in a mind numbing race around the island seeing how many souvenir shops in the classic tourist traps can be covered in 2hours.This tour is designed for people who want to understand the history, culture and nuances of this fantastic city in a calm yet highly efficient process that clearly demonstrates an intimate understanding of the key drivers and likely future of this metroplois from 35yrs of experience.We thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience (6.5hrs!!!) and firmly believe that Jamie made us much more \"functional\" in a very short space of time with respect to the use of City's the amazing public transport system - the gifts that keeps on giving.Well done Jamie and we thoroughy recommend your services to the more decerning travellers who arrive in Hong Kong"

Jamie planned the whole day based on only a few ideas from me and we were off to see Hong Kong! Jamie is a long time Hong Kong resident that knows the past and the present of Hong Kong, how to get where, and plenty of facts and information about each place and it's surroundings. I highly recommend Jamie if you want a personal tour in Hong Kong. No feelings of being herded like cattle, no rush, no unwanted high pressure sales of any kind......just a personal tour of an amazing city! Awesome views with a very personable friendly funny knowledgable guide.....and in clear English! I am confident Jamie will not dissappoint you with his personal tour!"

I booked Jamie for my first day (4 day trip) in HK knowing that I would be completely overwhelmed by the crowds and seeming chaos, and not knowing where to start. Well, having Jamie as a guide was the perfect thing. I couldn't believe, knowing a bit of HK's history, how all those people who write off the place as a 2 day shopping trip could be right. I had no specific \"must do's\" for Jamie. I just wanted to get a feel for HK (one that didn't involve shopping). I won't give away what we did as it will spoil it for others, but I can say that I had the most extraordinary day - seeing everything from colonial history, to everyday living, to wonderful gardens and breathtaking views. I also feel confident about getting around on the MTR now. My only problem for the next few days is prioritising what I'm going to do, as I've been left with so many ideas. I suspect it will require another visit to HK.....! I can highly recommend Jamie. He's your guide, so he can do it at your pace. And he's good company."

My wife and I have travelled extensively throughout Europe and Jamie's tours are by far the best we have experienced (not to mention much cheaper). Jamie was very gracious as my wife recently had surgery and he offered to take on a 1/2 day trip to the 10,000 Buddhas for free as we did not manage to see it with him. We did not take him up on this as we had a personal issue to deal with back home, but we can not wait to come back to Hong Kong and meet up with Jamie again. He is really a nice guy and I recommend him without reservation."

Our tour embraced the following highlights:From our hotel we went by MTR to Wong Tai Sin. We talked about religion (namely Taoism), astrology, fortune telling and mythology. We met Yau Lau (the Chinese god of love and marriage).By MTR to Sham Shui Po the poorest of the 18 districts of Hong Kong where we looked at the illegal housing structures and urban decay. We talked about the illegal housing structures, cage apartments, government housing and income levels in HK.To the She Wong Sin snake shop.Down the alley past the hole in the wall barbers shop.To the very old Kung Wo Soybean Products shop where we had freshly made fried tofu. To Kwan Kee bakery where we looked at the homemade Chinese deserts.Through the electronics market and jade market. To the large indoor fish and meat (wet market).By taxi to the Bird Market and Flower Market in Prince Edward. By MTR to Chungking Mansions and then the Peninsula where we talked a little about the history of the building, the Kadoorie family and the Japanese and attack and occupation of Hong Kong during the second world war. We looked at the old Marine Police Headquarters (Hullett House) with the Noon Day Gun and Time Ball Tower.We discussed the clock tower / old railway station.By Star Ferry from TST to Central. In summary, a very comprehensive 5 hours during which time we learned much more than we could in a month on our own. We recommend this tour to all newcomers to Hong Kong-it's a must!"

Great Dim Sum Lunch with Michael explaining local customs and foods. We had fun experiencing the \"new\" and the \"old\" of Hong Kong.

Our guide, Laura, was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about Hong Kong and brimming with endless facts and fascinating stories.We started the day meeting Laura at Tung Chung Station, where we set off on a short walk to the 5.7km cable car, which goes through Lantau Country Park to Ngong Ping. Unfortunately, the weather was not great to us and we couldn\u2019t see much except the mist, but we still enjoyed the ride.We visited Tian Tan Big Buddha which was beautiful, and some of us climbed the 268 steps to the top. (And some of us did not.) From the top we took a look at the views and the Offering of the Six Devas statues symbolising the six perfections of generosity, morality, patience, zeal, meditation and wisdom.We also visited the Po Lin Monastery and the Hall of 10,000 Buddha and then took a local bus to the village of Tai O, a historic squatter town with all manner of interesting buildings built out over the water. After a short boat ride \u2013 where we did see the 42km bridge being built between Hong Kong and Macau in the distance, but unfortunately we did not get to see any pink dolphins \u2013 we stopped for lunch at the Tai O Heritage Hotel, the old police station.The highlight of the day for us was certainly Tai O village. After lunch we wandered through the town, stopping at the Lee family ship paste shop and the Mo Tai temple. It was hot and humid so we then enjoyed a beer at a local caf\u00e9 jutting out over the water, before beginning our return trip to Tung Chung Station.It was a full day and most enjoyable, and at the end of our tour Laura even gave us recommendations for Dim Sum restaurants. I\u2019m generally not a fan of big tour groups but I would absolutely recommend Hello Hong Kong\u2019s small tours for a more personalised and fun approach."

There were 10 people on our tour and sitting at small round tables is a great way to get to know other travelers. My favorite part (other than the food!) was learning about Chinese medicine as we walked past the stores selling remedies. It was a fascinating morning, we walked, we took a ride on the Ding Ding, ate at restaurants where we were the only tourists and learned a lot about the history/culture of the area. There is no way that we could have done any of this without the tour. Finally, Laura answered many of our questions on how to get around for the rest of the weekend and gave us great tips on where best to see the fireworks. A fabulous morning, I really recommend this. Thank you, Laura - great memories and thanks for emailing us photos!"

We did two tours with Laura, one led by her around the city proper, and one led by Richard, one of her enthusiastic and knowledgeable guides, in Lantau.Laura and my mother met last year, when Mom visited Hong Kong solo. She enjoyed Laura's personalized tour so much, we signed up to do two tours with her this trip. On our first daylong trip, Laura took us all around the city, tailoring our itinerary to sights we were interested in seeing. I thoroughly enjoyed our day. She's very knowledgeable about Hong Kong and has clearly done a lot of research so that she's prepared to answer almost any question you might ask. Laura is also a good tour guide because she has a good sense of humor and a robust interest in her clients.On our second daylong tour to Lantau, we had Richard as our guide. He is full of all sorts of facts and trivia, adding to the interest of the trip. He is extremely accommodating and, just like Laura, takes a keen interest in his clients. We couldn't have asked for better guides both days. And the great thing was, on our tour with Richard, Laura came along as our friend, rather than our guide. Both days were favorites of my week spent in Hong Kong.As a caveat, we went on another tour the day before Laura's city tour, and our experiences were miles apart. The other tour cost far more money and we saw and learned far less. In fact, we weren't even sure why the places and sights we visited were remarkable enough to have been on our tour. Not so with Hello Hong Kong. Worth every penny and happy to have spent it!"

Right from the beginning of the booking process, it was easy and helpful and I felt confident that I was dealing with a reputable company. Along the way we made changes to our booking and this was handled promptly and with care. Our family did two tours, a food tour with Richard on a Saturday morning and a Private Lantau tour on Monday. The Food Tour was a wonderful combination of trying different foods and seeing where the locals buy their food. Our first restaurant was a fabulous old restaurant filled with locals having dim sum, where Richard chose different options that he thought we would enjoy. He also gave us insights into traditions and rituals. Our second stop was another tiny eatery that tourists would never find, where we tried noodle dishes. Third stop was to have the famous milk tea and our fourth place was a famous michelin star restaurant, again tiny and busy with delicious food. Our final treat was a Portuguese tart. Between all these stops we visited many stores, dry markets and wet markets where we learnt about the different ingredients, traditional Chinese Medicine and saw many out of the way places in the city. Richard was an enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide. I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting Hong Kong. Richard followed up with an email recapping what we had done and seen and providing a link to photos he had taken. This was great.The private Lantau tour was definitely worth doing. Laura was engaging, passionate and interesting to listen to. We were able to skip the queue to go on to the cable cars (extra money is worth it to have the glass bottom crystal cars), which was a fabulous 25 minutes. We arrived in Ngong Ping Village and walked through to the Big Buddha, it really is big and then on to Po Lin Monastery. Whilst all of this you can easily do by yourself (but with queues), it made so much difference having someone explain the significance of things. We then caught the local bus to the fishing village of Tai O and went on a boat ride searching for pink dolphins, didn't see any. Lunch was at the Lookout Restaurant which had a good view. We then walked around Tai O which is very poor and traditional and fascinating. Throughout all of this, Laura gave us interesting information in an entertaining way. Thoroughly enjoyed our day with Laura and really glad we did this as a tour. Again, Laura followed up with an email summarising the places we had been, very helpful. Would highly recommend this company."

Nathan is the gentleman who guided us on this tour and was able to provide us with many insights, recommendations and general knowledge than simply food and restaurant related things. While my wife is very much in to the food, and this tour was primarily intended for her enjoyment, I found myself having as good or better of a time than she was! Nathan was flexible with exactly what we were wanting to do and seemed to very much enjoy his work. Very personable and spoke highly of the company as well, this tells me that there is a high likelihood that other tour guides/employees will enjoy their work as well which in turn of course means a consistent experience regardless of who performs the tour. Overall we got a good sampling of the local cuisine and culture to pair with it for my wife, and I was able to learn many other historical aspects of the city and culture throughout the entire morning and afternoon. NOTE** when booking this tour, make sure to give them your contact information. One couple was late and although Nathan tried and we waited an acceptable length of time, he was unable to reach them as the medium through which they booked the tour did not relay their info. So if you use a middle booking system, make sure to contact them directly and give your info. We highly recommend this company, it was a very memorable part of our Hong Kong experience!"

We spent all day with Laura starting on Lantau at Tung Chung station (an easy train trip from anywhere in Hong Kong) with the spectacular cable car ride to the peak where Big Buddha resides opposite the most magnificent monastery and temple I've seen yet. Then local bus to Tai O, a wonderful little fishing village to explore on foot and by boat, which we did.

I would have never found the places. I went to the Dim Sum place when I was a kid, totally forgot about it. The wonderful part was I walked by the building where my father was a attendant and he worked there for 30 years! I also found the small noodle stall behind the building where he used to get me lunch. It was magical. HK changes so much , but one piece of my childhood is still here."

I did the morning food tour in a small group and it was ideal. The tour guide, Jess, was perfect. Knowledgeable, thoughtful, responsive to suggestions, patient and with a good sense of humor. We visited half a dozen places, mainly restaurants and cafes we wouldn't know existed, or would have been a bit intimidated by the crowds and language barrier. Jess helped us navigate it all with ease. Much more than a food tour, it was a cultural introduction to HK and its food, as well as a great history lesson. If you are visiting Hong Kong I strongly recommend you book this tour early in your stay."

Next we headed off in Central and caught the subway to the Sai Ying Poon station where we tasted our first food selection of the tour- Dim Sum at a traditional restaurant where I felt we were the only foreigners in a crowded place. This was a great experience.Next along Des Voeux road we saw many dried seafood stores with many fascinating uses and picked up a bottle of table wine. We next had another Cantonese culinary fixture -Wonton noodle soup at Mak's. delicious.We went over some ice milk tea and iced milk coffee before taking the cable car to our next destination- for some BBQ pork and rice followed by small walk over for an egg tart in a playground, which concluded the food aspect of the tour.The tour was devised very well but the highlight by far, was Michael, who answered all of our questions we had and was very personable."

Not only did we get to sample some really interesting HK cuisine (wonton soup, dim sum, milk tea, char sui pork - some we liked a great deal more than others but still a good experience as it helped us know what to avoid when we were let lose on our own) but we learned a great deal about Hong Kong traditions and culture which was very informative and really helped improve out understanding of the city for the rest of our trip. We did our tour in the Central and Wan Chai areas on a rainy day but it was a great thing to do at the start of our time in the city and the weather wasn't an issue at all. What was so nice is that after our trip, we received a load of information from Niya about other things to do whilst we were in HK with her own personal thoughts about the best views from the Peak, times and ways to do things and other ideas that may not come up on things like Trip Advisor - we were so grateful for this."

We learnt about the colour-coded weather warnings and what the weather app was to use. Jess provided us information about etiquette for eating dim sum and put us at ease during our first Asian food experience. We even got very detailed instructions about how to reach The Peak's best view point, and how to determine if it was worth heading up (depending on weather conditions). Jess was very open and happy to answer all of our questions, even the nosey ones about how it was living in Hong Kong as an ex-pat.At the completion of the tour Jess said she would send details recapping what we had seen and where we had been and she was true to her word.We left Jess feeling confident we could tackle the MTR and find our way to other restaurants and shopping areas.Thanks so much Jess, it was a great tour which we really enjoyed."

He knows so much about Hong Kong from its history to socioeconomic, culture, and of course, food! Michael knows Cantonese and is really an expert on Hong Kong. We had such a great day with our small group learning from him via 4-5 restaurants. He took us through the working class neighborhoods and markets and we: learned how to enjoy dim sum/ yum cha in the traditional HK way, learned about all the various kinds of dried food, ate at a Michelin-starred noodle place, had some great milk tea. We also had THE BEST cha siu and it was a small place frequented only by locals, tucked into a tiny room. We went to an expensive restaurant the night after and it just didn't compare. Even though it was inexpensive, being able to know about such a place and having Michael treat us to it felt like a luxury. Afterwards we had such a great experience we took him out for a beer and learned even more!! He is a walking encyclopedia :D He also helped us catch a cab to go to the peak. Then we got a bunch of recipes from him via email AND got tips on other places to go to in Hong Kong. Definitely he went above and beyond his tour duties. I highly recommend this tour for anyone that loves food and wants to learn more about Hong Kong in a unique, down to earth way."

I only wish we had done it the first day as we learned so much and explored so many things. Michael has an excellent knowledge of the city as well as the many specialty foods. I was worried about feeling stuffed from four different restaurants, especially as the dim sum at the first place was extensive. However the tour was well paced and we had time to digest between stops. It was a hot summer day, but Michael made time for water breaks and we had as many shady moments as he could find. My children and I enjoyed the variety of food we sampled and ate every bite. Some of it was familiar to us and some was totally novel. We enjoyed hearing the interesting cultural stories about the food. This tour was a highlight of our Hong Kong stay and we highly recommend the tour with Michael."

Although we were late she had waited for us at the meeting point and carefully adjusted to first part of the tour to feed the others and ensure that the intro was covered after breakfast. As other reviewers have said, its best to go hungry and you will benefit most from the experience.It was great to do this in a small group (there were four of us in total) and we got lots of time with the guide. Its well worth doing this type of tour at the start of your visit to HK. Niya also made sure that everyone was comfortable to get back to their hotels / next sightseeing spot.We would highly recommend this to anyone on a first visit to HK."

Hong Kong has nice sites to see but you need guides who can teach and explain the amazing culture. Richard did a fabulous job.We had lunch at the old police station in Tai O, (UNESCO site). I didnt think the lunch was very good and it took 1.5hrs. Hong Kong has pretty poor service in the restaurants. Waitresses and waiters dont work for tips and some just dont care how long or if you get the right food or what you ordered. That said, we didnt need to waste 90 minutes for a below average meal.The Big Buddha was awesome. Great Time overall. Remember it can be hot.

We covered everything we wanted to see as well a beautiful temple with fortune tellers and a nunnery with beautiful gardens we otherwise would have missed. He showed our teenage daughters how to use the MTR and took us on the Star Ferry and up to a great lookout a short walk from the Peak. I would definitely recommend using Hello Hong Kong especially if it's your first trip and you want to get a great overview of the sights and history."

Nathan took us to a great Dim Sum restaurant were we learned how to eat like a local and enjoyed sharing a table with some of them.

She took us to areas that we wouldn\u2019t normally have visited (let alone known about) and really set us up for the rest of our trip. I cannot rate Jess our guide highly enough.

I was looking for a tour that would allow us to see HK at the \"street level\" and to experience HK food. The Public Group Food tour looked perfect so I booked. We trusted our host, the fabulous Richard Dias, and that trust wasn't betrayed! Our experience of HK was positively impacted as a result of the tour. This tour is usually the first thing we tell people about when we relate the 3 weeks we spent in SE Asia. We pretty much recount the entire tour route to them and each dish we ate! Richard took us to places that we would NEVER have found on our own nor likely been brave enough to try. I say brave just because these were local places and we would not have known how to navigate the ordering process. Richard did a nice job explaining the dishes. Richard also took us through the wet and dry markets of HK where his knowledge and passion really came through on this part of the tour. He has a wealth of information and you will have to work hard not to learn something from Richard. And the surprise bonus for me was riding the tram - I loved it especially because I was in the front seat on the top level. Richard's love of HK really shines and he wants to share that love with you. It rained slightly on us but I don't think that should deter you from doing the tour if rain is in the forecast. The tour was a casual, easy going experience. Just a reminder that elbow room is a premium in HK, so prepare yourself for tight places. For us, this just added to the overall experience. Do I recommend this tour - heck yes. Would I do the tour again - absolutely."

We weren't able to get to the peak on the tour because it was really overcast. After the tour Jess sent us an email with instructions on how to get a lesser known place to get a view of the city. Oh boy was it an amazing view! We loved touring with Jess. We only wish we had more time to spend in Hong Kong."

The meeting place was easy to find and the route took us through the older western part of Hong Kong and also the more modern central and eastern parts of the city. The tour lasted for over 4 hours and there were plenty of opportunities for rehydration on a hot steamy day. The food stops were for Dim Sum/Yum Cha at a tea house in Sheung Wan (tasty food and interesting contact with locals), Wonton Noodle Soup in Central (interesting story about the restaurant but the food did not live up to its reputation) , Milk Tea in Central (tasted better than I expected), Roasted Meats in Wan Chai (great food in a bustling restaurant frequented by locals) and Egg Tart in Wan Chai (a tasty Hong Kong creation). The tour included stops at shops selling dried seafoods, gold and jewellery, fruit stalls, a wet market and a ride on the Ding Ding tram to Wan Chai. The tour is a great introduction to a range of Hong Kong foods and an insight into the workings of Hong Kong. It will provide you with an interesting tour and background on Honk Kong that you could not hope to achieve without a knowledgeable local guide. This is a walking tour so a reasonable level of fitness and comfortable shoes are required."

Below is an outline of what we did. From the hotel by taxi to The Peak via Stubbs Road and Peak Road, with some nice views across Happy Valley and out towards the south side of Hong Kong Island with Aberdeen Harbour in the distance. The history of The Peak and the way in which house prices, even to-day, climb the higher one lives up the mountain was discussed! At The Peak Galleria, we avoided the tourist areas and went for a local tour along Lugard Road ,around the base of Victoria Peak, to a point with a nice vista out over Victoria Harbour, taking in the north shore of Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula. The prominent buildings were pointed out, including Government House. The Colonial history of Hong Kong and the situation since the handover was discussed. We then walked back to the Peak Tram Terminus and were able to catch a fairly empty tram right away on the descent into Central.Once at the Garden Road Peak Tram Terminal, we walked down to St. John's Cathedral - dating from 1849, it is the oldest Anglican cathedral in Asia. We then walked along Battery Path and the history and uses of the Former French Mission Building were explained.To the HSBC building to look at the architecture and talk about the feng shui in the building and the development of the shore line and land reclamation. To the HSBC Bronze Lions with the shrapnel bomb damage from the second world war. The discovery and return of both lions from Japan at the close of World War II was explained.To Statue Square Park where we talked a little about the domestic helpers in Hong Kong and admired the old Supreme Court building. The unimpeded view from the HSBC Headquaters across to the harbour was also pointed out as was the only statue in the park- that of a former Chairman of HSBC!! The Japanese Army did steal the rest during the War! We then walked via the GPO and the elevated walkway to the Star Ferry Pier, observing a number of prominent landmarks and the extent of land reclamation in this area. We caught the Satr Ferry across to Tsim Sha Tsui at the tip of the Kowloon Peninsula. The history of the Star Ferry and the development of means of crossing the Harbour were also discussed. Various features of the Hong Kong skyline were pointed out during the crossing. At Tsim Sha Tsui, we first went to the skyline viewing area and the Clock Tower / Old Railway Station. The Canton Road luxury shopping area and the Hong Kong Cultural Centre were both pointed out. To Hullet House / the old Marine Police Headquarters with the Noon Day Gun, Time Ball Tower and the Typhoon Signal Mast. To The Peninsula where we talked not only about the history of the building but about the Battle of Hong Kong and the Japanese occupation. Don't forget about the afternoon tea - it you have time its a lovely way to spend an afternoon!  We then walked to Tsim Sha Tsui MTR Station on Nathan Road from where we caught the underground to Sai Ying Poon Station on the western end of the north shore of Hong Kong Island. We then went for Yam Cha (Tea) at the Lin Heung Restaurant on Des Voeux Road West. This is a very traditional Chinese tea-house with a Michelin mention.After tea, we walked along Des Voeux Road West, Wing Lok Street and Bonham Strand where we saw all of the dried seafood, Chinese medicinal products, sharks fins, fish maws, sea cucumbers, jelly fish, abalone and, of course, The Gecko!! We then cut through Morrison Street to view the renovated Western Market from wher we caught a tram (ding ding) across town to Canal Road West, with various notable features being pointed out along the way. We then walked along Canal Road West and Morrison Hill Road back to your hotel."

People always say that there isn't much else to do in HK besides eating, drinking, and shopping but this was a great alternative. I'm a HK resident and found the tour equally as exciting as the people who were visiting for the first time. Our tour group was a good mix of Australians, Americans, Hong Kongers, and English people.

My favorite part was the container port, we sailed right in and got to see everything! You can't get that kind of experience anywhere else. The guide was so friendly and knowledgeable. We talked about the architecture, Opium Wars, pirates and sunken boats, houses of the rich and famous - it was very interesting!

We are expats living in Hong Kong but when we had guests from the UK in town we got a bunch of friends together to do one of Laura's excellent Hong Kong tours. It was brilliant for both people completely new to Hong Kong and those who think they know it. We enjoyed the excellent traditional trolley-served dim some in a place round the corner from our flat that we'd have never found ourselves, learnt more about traditional markets and went to a fascinating temple where fortunes were told and wishes sealed. Exploring Sham Shui Po was a great addition to the tour as it showed a totally different dimension to the city. Highly recommended."

Nathan is an American, so his English is perfect. He has several years living in Hong Kong and is well versed in the history.

We traveled by foot and walked through several markets, hopped on the MTR and explored different parts HK, rode the tram (awesome way to see HK) and took the Star Ferry as well. We got great views of HK at the clock tower and learned about the history of HK at the Peninsula Hotel (and had a chance to cool off, too!). We also took a tour of the indoor fish and meat markets, which was really cool to see. Nathan was extremely knowledgeable and answered all our questions about a range of topics. We had a lot of fun exploring, and taking so many modes of transportation really allowed us to experience Hong Kong for what it is! We highly recommend Hello Hong Kong!"

I was a bit skeptical about this boat tour but I tagged along with my friend anyways. It turned out to be a very fun and relaxing tour! Laura (the tour guide) was well equipped with fun facts about Hong Kong's history. I learned things that I never knew before and it was pretty interesting.It was also very nice to see Hong Kong by sea on a very comfortable boat, there are nice seating areas on the deck of the boat and it is also a nice way to meet other people touring in Hong Kong. The boat captain is also very experienced and the boat ride was very smooth throughout the whole way. I have to say, my favourite part of the tour was seeing Jumbo the floating restaurant, I had never in my 16 years in Hong Kong seen a floating restaurant and it was so amazing to see the most famous one. I would definitely recommend this to tourists in Hong Kong and also local citizens! You'll be surprised by how awesome Hong Kong looks in the perspective of the sea and how many things you didn't know about Hong Kong.Thanks Laura and Captain Donald for an awesome tour!!"

My tour guide was Jess, she is a real professional tour guide and had so much knowledge of all kinds of little things. She made conversations with everyone in the group.Our tour started with some dim sum, then we moved on to check out all the stuff the little stores sell on the streets. We popped in at a oriental medicine store before trying out the popular noodle place (I had the shrimp wonton soup), this place was visited and rated by Anthony Bourdain.Tour continued to a milk tea place, to a meat/fish and wet market, then by a trolley to another location for some authentic local hole-in-the wall (very popular) BBQ pork and duck restaurant. The tour ended with a dessert. Duration was about 3-4 hours, it was easy walking and part of the tour was taken in a trolley when we changed locations. (make sure to have your octopus bus card and comfy shoes on).Although the food places were already set in advance, the tour guide was open to show us places we wanted to try (i.e snake soup place). It was nice that the group was only 8 people, as these places are very tiny and barely were able to accommodate us together. But it sure was authentic, safe and most importantly, it was delicious!!! And worth every penny I paid."

You will see and learn about everything from the history of the island going all the way back to the times of 'Canton' to the modern shipping ports and container industry. This of course includes buildings that have 'dragon flyways', the wealthiest neighborhood in the world, a sunken British liner, and old pirating hideaway caves. And on this tour you get to do it from the sea (which, again, makes a lot of sense given that it is an island) aboard a luxurious yacht. the refreshments are plenty (including beer - you are on a boat after all) and the company was fun, but what really brought it all together was Laura. Her enthusiasm was contagious and her knowledge impressive. The fact is that when you want to see and do something new you want to do it with a person like Laura leading the way. Can't recommend this one enough. Oh, by the way, we were dropped off in Stanley bay - site of the dragon boat races (so on a weekend leading up to the races everyone seems to be carrying around their custom paddles). What is more Hong Kong than that?"

Although I am a long-time Hong Kong resident, the tour was an incredible way to get a very different perspective on the city. Laura, the guide for our tour, and her able pilot, Captain Donald, really took great care of us. From a slow cruise past HK's gorgeous skyline, to a run around the guts of the bustling container port (where we got up close to megaships being loaded and unloaded), to even seeing Hong Kong's famous floating restaurant, Jumbo, being towed back to its mooring (a unique experience, it only leaves for a cleaning every few years!), the day was jam packed with great scenery and interesting insights. The information provided by Laura about what we were seeing from the boat, Hong Kong's history, and the important role the ocean plays and has played in Hong Kong's development was just right. Funny, interesting, and just enough to give you background on what you were seeing to add to your enjoyment as the boat chugged past the topic of the discussion, without taking too much time away from your friends and the beautiful views.I would wholeheartedly recommend the Hong Kong by Sea Tour, it would be a fantastic way to send a day in Hong Kong, and from what I can tell, is really a unique experience."

First of all they keep really good contact with you by phone and email !!! No problem even your English is not too strong. After booking using their reservation website I was waiting day when they pick me up from hotel. I booked 5 hours tours and it is good. Morning 9:15 Micheal called me from lobby hotel to my room that he is already and waiting. Michel is older guide but he is Irish guy who live here since 1977.He has really lot of news about HK places and also politic and how people live here. When we met him morning we sat in lobby and spoke about what we wanted to see. We have set our target ( more fun than museum and street food ). We got what we wanted. Michael had lot of knowledge about HK and history of HK. I want to say Thank you for him again and say Good luck for Hello Hong Kong !!! Keep your job !!!"

We got to see markets - flowers, birds, electrical, clothes, meat and fish that were where the localPeople shop not simply tourist markets. The itinerary included:Chungking Mansions where we talked about \u2018suitcase entrepreneurs\u2019 and how the building has become a central hub of very low end globalisation. We talked about the history of Hong Kong from the arrival of the Brits through to the handover of Hong Kong back to China To The Peninsula where we talked not only about the history of the building but about the Battle of Hong Kong and the Japanese To Hullet House / the old Marine Police Headquarters with the Noon Day Gun, Time Ball Tower and the bar with the prison cells!To the skyline viewing area and the Clock Tower / Old Railway Station / we talked about the feng shui in the buildings and the development of the skyline. By MTR to Wong Tai Sin to see the council housing and the temple. We talked about some of the social issues and conditions in Hong Kong, religion (namely Taoism), astrology, fortune telling and mythology. We met Yau Lau (the Chinese god of love and marriage). By MTR to Sham Shui Po the poorest of the 18 districts of Hong Kong where we looked at the illegal housing structures and urban decay.To the She Wong Sin snake shop where we tried the medicinal snake and mushroom soup.Past the hole in the wall barbers shop.To the very old Kung Wo Soybean Products shop To the electronics market, through the jade market, the hawker markets and to the indoor fish and meat (wet) market.By MTR to Prince EdwardTo the Yuen Po Street Bird Garden & Flower MarketYou can't do this tour on your own you would not know what you were looking at. The tour was customised to what we wanted to see - no shopping malls or skyscrapers but Chinese people doing what they do.Nathan thank you so much for a marvellous day. Bit of advice - just book and go -for all you healthy types with an iPhone or Fitbit its 13340 steps plus 11 flights of stairs! Have fun - we did."

We met our guide, Jess, at 8:00 at the Clock Tower in the Tsim Sha Tsui shopping center to begin our 4 hour walking tour of Hong Kong. She was just delightful and immediately we formed a bond. We looked at the sights and then walked around Kowloon a bit before we took a ferry to the business center of Hong Kong. Once there, we took a taxi ride to the top of Victoria Peak. But instead of taking the touristy elevator and paying to go to the top to the observation tower, Jess suggested we walk a short path to an outstanding viewpoint. The day was gorgeous and the walk was an easy one. What sights we saw - all of Hong Kong was ours for the viewing! Jess explained what we were looking at and we just soaked in the atmosphere. From here we took the cable car DOWN the peak instead of the usual tourist idea to take the ride UP the peak. By doing it in reverse, we avoided the crowds. By the time we got to the bottom, the line to go up in the cable car was at least 45 minutes long. We were SO thankful that Jess knew her way around and was able to use her tricks of the trade to make our trip so easy and yet to get the full effect. From the cable car area, we walked by St. Johns Cathedral and saw the architecture of the HSBC and the bullet-pocked lions there. We then took a tram up Queens Road Central to the Lin Heung Kui Tea House where we sampled simply heavenly dim sum with Jess's expert giudance. We ate and ate and loved it all, sampling pork and shrimp dumplings, shrimp dumplings, steamed BBQ pork bun, steamed garlic shrimp, spring roll, crispy shrimp wonton and a few others. We were stuffed but it was incredibly delicious. This is definitely a place where we would have never ventured on our own since it is frequented by locals. It was most definitely a highlight of the day. Yum!! We then walked down the Medicine Street and Jess took us to the Cat Street Market and showed us how to get to the Man Mo Temple. Our tour was over at the market and we said a fond farewell to Jess. Hong Kong was our first stop on a 3 week adventure in Southeast Asia and she put the perfect start to our trip. We can highly recommend Hello Hong Kong and Jess - just an incredible company and an incredible guide. I am sure they are all excellent but we felt like we had hit the jackpot with Jess. She was amazing and so sweet and courteous as well. We loved our time with her and marveled at her knowledge, having lived in Hong Kong a relatively short period of time. She is an experienced guide, though, having been a guide in other parts of SE Asia.You are in good hands with Hello Hong Kong and Jess!"

To put it simply: this food tour with Sean on HK-Island was the highlight of our second trip to Hong Kong!Sean, our guide, took his time to get to know each of the participants. We were 8 in total. He took us to selected places that amazed us not only because of the quality of their dishes but also because of their vibrant atmosphere! Only places that are well established, renowned for their tradition. But almost hermetical to tourists.On the way from one place to the other, Sean answered all of the questions we had. I particularly appreciate his great knowledge of the food traditions and life in HK."

It was a great value for the price. All the food was great, and most of the places we visited would have been a little daunting to dine at solo. The walking tour was also great - it was a great chance to learn more about Hong Kong, and its history and culture. The cost of this tour might deter some budget travelers, but if you can swing it? I highly recommend this tour!"

The food tour with Jess was fantastic- we tried various dishes, learned a lot of interesting things about the food habits, the origin and diversity of the Hong Kong cuisine. Jess is not only knowledgeable, very helpful with tips, but also fun to be around. In this food tour I absolutely loved the char siu, the wonton noodle soup and the shrimp dumplings. I totally recommend this 4h tour for all the foodies out there who happen to be in Hong Kong."

I've been on many big-city food tours, and have 3 criteria for a good tour: Introduction to new neighborhoods, contact with a local (usually an english-speaking ex-pat), and samples of exemplars of the native cuisine. This tour exceeded all three criteria. Mike, a Liverpudlian who lived most of his adulthood in HK, guided us through vast territory, on foot and by \"ding ding\". His knowledge of HK culture made us feel like we were on a walk with a friend who happens to live in HK. My only reservation about the tour: the food was good, not great, but perhaps I'm jaded (live in San Francisco CA and have access to great Chinese food at home) BTW: bit of advice- TIP YOUR TOUR GUIDES! These people work hard to share their city with visitors; please show some gratitude."

I recommend this tour towards the beginning of your trip because Hello Hong Kong and their guides are a wealth of knowledge to answer questions about Hong Kong and can make recommendations to streamline the other events you have planned e.g. taxi/bus up to Victoria Peak and tram down, saved an 1hr+ queue on the way up. I have a mild shellfish allergy and there were enough food options that I did not feel hungry in the slightest leaving the tour."

He really knows Hong Kong, and customized the tour to our interests.He met us in the lobby of our hotel in Kowloon, and we were off to the MTR to by Octopus cards and a get short lesson on using the train system. It was incredibly easy.We visited the Sham Shui Po neighborhood to see how some of the poorest folks live, with interesting stops to sample the breads and tofu (we passed on the snake soup). The wet market and the ally barber shop were great views of understanding local life, as were all the shops and stalls we passed while walking through the area. A stop at the local temple led to interesting discussions about the local religions and beliefs, as well as the public housing that surrounded the temple. It was Chinese new year when we visited, so the temple was just an amazing place.Back to the TST area via the MRT to see a more modern view of Hong Kong, including the Chungking Mansion, the Peninsula Hotel, the Old Marine Police Headquarters, and the Clock Tower area.A quick ride over the Star Ferry included discussions on feng shui and modern building design, as well as how the Hong Kong skyline is developing and the process for business creation.We took the tram to Sheung Wan and walked along Wing Lok Street to see all the Chinese medicine shops and dried goods... and incredible sight.And finally, we had Dim Sum at a very local place... the Lin Heung Kui Tea House. Very much off the tourist path.As agreed, we ended the tour on Hong Kong island, and Nathan pointed us towards more temples and the antiques market. We made our way back to our hotel easily without any difficulty, using the navigating tips Nathan taught us along the way (he also gave us a map!).Hello Hong Kong is a first class company, and Nathan was an excellent guide."

I also knew ahead of time who our tour guide was going to be, Ben, and a photo of what he looked like. We took the private \u201cBespoke\u201d tour and it was worth every penny.Ben met us at our hotel at our designated time of 9:30 am on Chinese New Year Day 2016 (perfect day for touring Hong Kong, thanks for working that day Ben). We had arrived the evening before for our first trip to Asia and wanted to experience the many forms of transportation and how to use them easily. We started off by walking to the nearby MTR. We had purchased the Octopus card at the airport when we arrived so moved quickly thru just like everyone around us. Ben explained how the MTR worked and pointed out other important stops that we might want to do on our own during our week stay in Hong Kong. Our first stop was to Wong Tai Sin to see the council housing and the temple. As it was CNY it was packed with many and Ben explained the different types of offerings that were being made and the importance. He took several pictures of us. The people were priceless and very sincere in their offerings.When then took the MTR back to the Chungking Mansions and did a quick walk thru, with Eric showing and explaining so many things. We went to The Peninsula where we talked about the Battle of Hong Kong and the Japanese occupation. We were not staying at the Peninsula but did go back to the bar on the 28th floor, Felix, our last night in Hong Kong. They have a beautiful view of the harbor and it is quiet and not crowded. Then to the Hullet House, the old Marine Police Headquarters with the Noon Day Gun, Time Ball Town and the bar with the prison cells.Next, just a short walk to the Star Ferry to Central. Wow, went back there later in our trip and went to the escalators, unbelievable. Now for a taxi ride to the Peak. Beautiful views and our photographer took some great photos (thanks Ben). We then took a taxi to Aberdeen to have a late lunch at the Jumbo Kingdom restaurant. Our tour with Ben ended here, as with all of his suggestions we were confident we could get back to our hotel on our own. He also shared with us best tips for our additional days in Hong Kong. It was perfect start two our two stay in Hong Kong and Thailand. Thank you Laura and Ben!"

So knowledgeable about the culture and traditions it was wonderful to be exploring with someone who could answer all our questions and show us some extras.Started with Dim Sum / Yum Cha - Lin Heung Kui Tea House - Des Voeux Road West, Sheung Wan.Along Des Voeux Road West ,Wing Lok Street and Bonham Strand\u00a0 where we saw the dried seafoods, fish maws, sharks fins, birds nests, ginseng,\u00a0and Chinese medicinal goods; not forgetting the Dried Gecko!!.Wonton Noodle Soup/ Beef Brisket Soup\u00a0 - Mak's - Wellington Street, Central.Through Graham Street wet market to the fishmonger and the butcher on Gage Street. Seeing all the meat hanging from the walls was definitely interesting. Milk Tea / Yuen Yeung - Lan Fong Yuen - Gage Street - Central\u00a0. Lovely and refreshing drink topped up with ice. Next we went by tram (ding ding) to Wan Chai. Great way to explore on the tram. Second last stop was the roasted meat - BBQ Pork (Char Siu and Siu Yuk) with some green vegetables (Choi Sum)- Joy Hing - Hennessy Road/ Stewart Road, Wan Chai. HONESTLY the best pork I have ever had!!!!Egg Tart -\u00a0Honolulu Cafe (a genuine Cha Chaan Teng)\u00a0 Hennessy Road\u00a0- Wan Chai By the end of the your we were all stuffed and smiling.

We also had the opportunity to have some very interesting discussions on food and other Hong Kong related topics with Michael the guide (an expat who has lived in Hong Kong for decades).

Michael is such a personable and friendly guide, who was very generous with his knowledge with what seemed like our endless questions. We were worried at the first destination that perhaps we didn't have the appetite to eat our way around Hong Kong that day, after dish after delicious dish of Dim Sum was ordered, but we paced ourselves and completed the day with a full stomach of delicious cuisine and a list of places we wanted to visit again. Some of the locations had us wondering, but Michael was right in saying unless you were in the know you'd probably have walked right past - even if there was a line down the road of punters waiting to get in. We were grateful to have him with us and speaking the lingo, otherwise I doubt we would've had the experience we did.If we were in Hong Kong again with some time up our sleeves, we'd definitely look at another Hello Hong Kong tour. Michael true to his character sent us through a few things we should do the following days we were in Hong Kong, with clear directions tailored from the front door of our hotel. We took his recommendation and managed a few of them flying out. Just a little extra added value. Thoroughly recommended! Thank you!"

I felt like we had a friend in Hong Kong. The first tour was a food tour of the Hong Kong side and the next day we toured the Kowloon side. Our guides were Nathan and Ben and both were knowledgeable, young and fun to be with. We never would have found the restaurants on the food tour on our own. They were very local and in fact the dim sum place still has trolleys; only one of two left in Hong Kong. Food was plentiful and included in the price. We took every mode of transportation and walked quite a bit touring neighborhoods and feeling like a local versus a tourist. The second day we opted to do more touristy things...the Peak, the Flower market, Bird market, electronic market, etc...Could we have done this on our own...yes, but our time was limited and we saved lots of time going with a local. For example, tourists take the tram up to the Peak waiting in line. Not us, we took a taxi up and the tram back with no lines. While at the Peak we did a walk that we never would have found on our own. Brilliant and worth every penny that we spent. Having a private tour allows you to do what you want and move at your own pace. Thank you Hello Hong Kong for making our stay so memorable."

The next day I received an email from Laura indicating the tours were available on the dates that I requested. After a couple of emails to go over what I wanted to see during my bespoke tour, the tours were booked.Originally, I had one guide assigned for the bespoke tour, Laura indicated that the guide was not available, rather than trying to rebook or cancel the tour, Laura step in to conduct the tour herself. Laura met me at my hotel lobby and after a quick introduction and to make sure I had an octopus card my non-stop tour of HK started. From the business area and shops of HK Island to the back streets and residential areas of Kowloon, I was shown a great mixer of the historic and culture parts of HK. Laura\u2019s passion for her adopted city HK was very clear by her desire to share all the wonders that HK has to offer. During my tour, there were a couple of items that I wanted to purchase, Laura took several steps to try and make sure I could get those items. During the tour, Laura made several suggestions for other sites and places that I should also check out. As my tour came to an end, Laura gave me detailed and easy directions to get to another location to check out.For my food tour, my guide\u2019s was Nathan and Shawn. After a quick introduction and a check to make sure everyone had an octopus card, we were on our way. From the Chinese medicine and seafood shops, dim sum, barbeque pork and egg tarts, you are taken on tour of some of the hidden treasures of HK Island that most visitors or residents do not know about. During the tour, the guides were very helpful answering questions about the food and sites we visited. Another nice touch is they were also answering questions and giving advice on other sites and places around HK. This was confirm at the end of the tour when the guides asked every person what their plans were for rest of the day and giving them easy directions to get them to their next stop.If you are looking for a very professional, informative and friendly tour company, I would recommend HK tours."

However, one member of our tour obviously didn't read the description that this was a walking tour and was not physically fit to participate. Through the whole day, we had to stop, take breaks, wait around etc. At one point we waited about 20 minutes while the guide and this woman took an alternate route to find an escalator, even needing to call the guide to follow me them. The tour ended up two hours over, eating into the very little time my husband and I had to visit Hong Kong. The guide should have intervened realizing how disruptive the stops were to the rest of the group. The guide then spent the last 20 minutes of the tour trying to find the woman a cab, which was not only not his responsibility, but continued to disrupt the tour, turning it into a wild cab goose chase. The woman should have never have come or quit the tour early, even as others complained. The guide (Michael) handled this very badly. One person missed two stops on the tour as were running so far over. Very frustrating day."

We were on a business trip (5 of us) and had a day to ourselves before work so booked with this tour to see some sights, eat some food and learn some history. Laura was our guide and was fabulous. Took us to see some great sites and great food. Loved the yum Cha, not so much the snake soup but it was an experience. Great history and culture lesson too with being lectured. Laura right steered us to the Stanley markets instead of the Mongkok markets we had suggested, and she also followed up with emails of ideas on where else to go if we had more time. You really should do this tour. Thanks Laura."

But Nathan and Hello Hong Kong made my first trip in Hong Kong unforgetable!After a long flight from Amsterdam, sleepless and jet lag, I didn't expected that I could enjoy my five hours tour in Hong Kong at all.BUT after the first minute that Nathan picked me up at Hong Kong International Airport, I realized that there must be a very interesting trip!I didn't felt that Nathan was my guide, nor I was a sleepy tourist. I felt like Nathan is my good old friend who took me around and showed me the best of Hong Kong. We catched The Peak, walked along Luggard road, visited HSBC building and Nathan told me about the feng shui and the bronze lions. We took star ferry to Tsim Sha Tsui and with my special request sat we on \"the bus\" to Prince Edward. We also walked through the flower market and saw how back streets in Hong Kong look like. It was very interesting. Hong Kong is a big city, many people and busy traffic. But there is very tidy and clean!!Finally ate we Dim Sum at One Dim Sum. A tiny place with plenty of good taste!Five hours went really fast. I couldn't make it alone to experience Hong Kong that much without Nathan and Hello Hong Kong. Nathan is absolutely my kindly and friendly tourmate!I had a very great time and couldn't find any words to say more, but next time I will visit Hong Kong I surely will ask Nathan and Hello Hong Kong to be my tourmate again!!!"

The small group setting is nice as it allows you to interact with others throughout the day. The stops included a traditional dim sum restaurant (average), a bbq pork spot (very good), a noodle shop (ok), a milk tea vendor (ok), and ended with an egg tart (worth skipping). I actually didn't feel like I ate very much on the tour. The dim sum spot offered the best chance to fill up but it was first and we were advised to pace ourselves. My advice would be, order lots of pork at the bbq place and don't be shy about what you want at the dim sum spot. Food wise I don't feel you get a great value on your tour but you do get your money's worth from the guide. Nathan's emails after the tour were a huge help in planning the rest of our trip. He provided lots of recommendations for bars, restaurants, day trips, etc. During the tour he was very informative and I learned a lot."

The amount of food was good for each stop; you were still able to eat or drink at each place but left the tour with a full stomach.

As a solo traveller I went on two tours with Hello Hong Kong- the first was a private tour with Laura, and the second a group food tour with Shawn. I was staying in Hong Kong for a week, and was looking for an introduction to the city- public transport, local/cultural spots and a taste of local food. I couldn't be happier with both tours- Laura is a great, friendly guide and tailored the private tour to match my interests, all the while giving useful travel tips, and great cultural, historical and local insight into the various areas we visited. I'm shocked at how much she fit in 5 hours considering the tour felt relaxed, and never rushed. After the tour, she dropped me off in an area I was keen to explore and followed up with several emails detailing everything we had done, as well as more areas of interest, food stops to explore and useful walking directions to try on my own. The follow up information and tips were SO useful- I used them constantly throughout the week! I had a great time in Hong Kong, and it wouldn't have been the same without Laura's guidance.I took a food tour with Shawn the next day- and it was also great! I ate some of the best food of my whole 6 weeks abroad- the BBQ pork is amazing. Shawn was a really friendly guide and happy to answer and questions from the group. We went to restaurants and food stops filled with locals, which is a great sign. There was plenty of food and variety throughout the tour, as well as some walking throughout various market districts. Again, the follow up emails were great- detailing everywhere we went, and suggestions for the rest of our trips. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend both tours- thanks again!"

Time is short on a cruise and we benefited so much from all of the research she put into this city walking tour with stops at some of the best local eateries in the city and information about the city that she shared as we made our way through the streets.  Our day started with a breakfast of authentic dim sum at Lin Heung Kui Tea House where the locals dine. She explained Chinese medicine as we walked along Wing Lok Street and Des Voeux Road West. We visited the Taoist Man Mo Temple. The wonton soup at the world's cheapest one Michelin starred restaurant (Mak's on Wellington Street) was amazing! Milk tea from Lan Fong Yuen was a cool afternoon treat on a hot day. We got to use the Escalator to tour Soho and took the tram to Wan Chai to Joy Hing on Hennessy Road where we enjoyed the best roasted pork. Laura even e-mailed me the recipe for the delicious egg tarts we had at Tai Cheong Bakery, as well as the method for making milk tea. She sent me a complete list of the places we visited and a some great pictures she took of us on tour--a scrapbooker's dream! I would recommend this tour and Laura to anyone visiting Hong Kong and I hope to have the pleasure of spending a day or more with her again, in Hong Kong, or wherever she plans to expand her business."

We enjoyed Yum Cha (even the chicken feet!), and fell in love with the Ying Yang 'icey' (local drink of iced tea and iced coffee combined into one).

We covered a lot of our interests. A couple of my top interests were the Won Tai Sin Temple as well as the Chi Lin Nunnery. One of the highlights for me though was the Nan Lian Garden that actually led to the nunnery. Jess also took us to a market where she had us tried a snake and mushroom soup...which I thought was pretty good! We ended our tour in a restaurant that Jess suggested and again it was one of the best dim sum we had. Thank you Jess for showing us Hong Kong and making it interesting and fun!"

If you're going to use the tour, ask for Laura!As for the tour itself, we spend two mornings/afternoon together and got to see so many amazing sights and tastes while learning about their traditions.

Jess met us at our hotel and she escorted us on the Star ferry, showed us how to use the public transport and then we walked to so many iconic sights of Hong Kong. She is so knowledgeable about the history, the people, the place. You will see famous places and not so famous places which you would never get to without an experienced guide. Our tour took us over lunch and she took us to a traditional tea house where we were the only western faces, but it was OK because Jess could help us get food, and very good it was too. This is your private tour and Hello Hong Kong have very good communications leading up to the day of the tour to make sure they know what you want to get out of the experience. Not only that, when we said there were certain things we would do on our own subsequently, Jess followed up with very detailed instructions of how to do those things and included a few more suggestions as well. Thank you Jess, without your tour our visit to Hong Kong would have been nowhere near as successful and interesting as it was."

Jess got along great with my mom and I during our private bespoke walking tour and was really flexible with making a change to stop in at the Peninsula hotel for tea (a treat in itself) as we were walking by and then adjusting the structure of the tour thereafter.

We chose to do it privately so that we could go at our own pace and also because we don't normally do tours or group activities when we travel and prefer exploring independently. We also tend not to like using guides, so it is a big compliment to our guide Jess from Hello Hong Kong that we enjoyed our tour so much.We chose to do a food tour as it's a good chance to get off the beaten track of restaurants listed in guide books and trip advisor and get to get some inside knowledge from somebody living in Hong Kong. That turned out to be a good decision since we would probably not have found most of the places we visited on the tour by ourselves. All the places were fantastic - the dim sum was amazing and the restaurant so atmospheric: big and bustling with locals. Not a tourist in sight! It was fun choosing food from the cart and that was where it was useful to be with a guide as it's a challenge with no menu and no language skills! The roasted meat stop was really good too - the barbecued pork so delicious that we almost went back the next day. I am dreaming about how good it was and hope I can make it back there on my next visit.Jess kindly emailed me details of all the places we visited so that we can find them again by ourselves as well as other tips we had talked about. She was very good company - knowledgable but not blinding us with information and statistic overload as some guides are wont to do. She also let us move at our own pace, never hurrying us, even when I stopped to buy stuff at the market and to take loads of photos everywhere. She never made us feel like we were on a schedule and we did end up finishing about 15 mins late and even then she was not in a hurry to wind up. The whole day felt very relaxed.The organisation and communication from Hello Hong Kong was smooth and efficient throughout. As we did a private tour we were able to make a date change to accommodate our schedule and they were really flexible. Doing the tour privately is of course a lot more pricey, and it's hard to say if it's worth it. But if it's within your budget I would highly recommend it. Incidentally, I did look into booking with another company that also had good reviews, and although the tour price was a bit lower, the food was not included. With Hello Hong Kong all the food we had on the tour was included in the cost."

We were very lucky to have Laura and she knew Hong Kong like the back of her hands. She mixed in our tour with a short history lesson, local foods, and also the contrast of old versus new Hong Kong. We were having so much fun that we were saddened to find out that the tour was over. She gave us suggestions on what to see with the rest of our day and also took into consideration our energy levels. At the end of the tour, she placed us on a bus to Stanley where we had lunch and enjoyed a great afternoon by the seaside."

Due to some last-minute scheduling changes, ended up booking a morning food tour w/ Hello Hong Kong and couldn't have been happier with that decision!!Took the morning tour on my first full day in Hong Kong after arriving the night before via a 16 hour flight. The tour, led by Nathan, was the perfect way to fight the jet lag!Food stops included dim sum in the central part of Hong Kong island, homemade wonton noodle soup, bbq pork, iced \"yin-yang\" milk tea, and egg tart. Nathan was an excellent guide and did a great job navigating for the group, ordering for us, and explaining the local culinary traditions. I also appreciated how much history and culture were mixed into this tour, including a walk through the Chinese medicinal goods market, a tour through the wet market, and a ride on the tram.As a first time visitor to Hong Kong, I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the sights, smells, and tastes of the city. It was also a really nice touch that Nathan sent everyone a post-tour email with photos of the group, a break-down of what and where we ate, and tips (including directions) for other things each of us planned to do and see.Thanks again Nathan and Hello Hong Kong!!"

We took the Star Ferry and went to the Cat Street Market. Laura advised us to go to Victoria Peak on our own time since our tour was short and Nathan directed us how to get there when our tour with him was over.

We wanted to hire a guide for a day to do a few things that we had done before (and wanted to revisit), as well as a number of new things that we missed out on last time. Nathan was our tour guide and he is fantastic!! He is originally from the Boston area if I remember correctly, and moved to Hong Kong some time ago so his English is perfect and he gets the kind of things that Americans would like to see and do while there. That being said, he is a personable, charismatic young man that is extremely knowledgeable about Honk Kong history and life. He is an excellent choice for a traveler from any country, not just from the USA. He is very flexible and will do research in advance of your booking if there is something special you would like him to do or to show you that may be a little less run of the mill. He will also do research after your day with him is over and will email you answers to any further questions you might have. My husband and I hire a guide most times when traveling in Asia because we usually don't have much time and want to expedite accomplishing the things we wish to do or see. He will take you to (and navigate your way through) his favorite local restaurant where you may be the only people who speak English, if you ask. Nathan is a great tour guide and an all around cool young man! Our experience with Hello Hong Kong was top rate! While gratuity was never suggested or requested, we tipped him for a job well done, as we tip all excellent tour guides on our travels."

For my last trip to China with another short layover, I wanted a more in-depth experience. I chose the \"Hello Hong Kong small group public food tour\" based on the time (Saturday morning), location (two blocks from my hotel), and its excellent reviews. It did not disappoint. Michael was an outstanding guide, and an expat that speaks Cantonese. Being a Chinese American who does not speak Cantonese, it was very interesting for me to watch him interact with the shop owners, etc. We ate at the most authentic places where there were few foreign visitors, walked through fascinating shops and store fronts, soaked in all the senses (tastes, smells, noises, and heat), and learned about all kinds of interesting facts about Hong Kong. The tour was well-organized, but with flexibility. We all had a grand time! Thank you!"

My son (22) and I (49) were going to be in Hong Kong for 3 days and we wanted to make the best use of our time discovering Hong Kong while we were there. I turned to the internet to find tours and came upon Hello Hong Kong and after a few email exchanges I booked two tours with them. We arrived to Hong Kong late on a Saturday and had a personal walking tour scheduled for 9 AM the next day. We were to meet our tour guide Nathan at a train station and we had no trouble finding our way to him with plenty of time to spare. Nathan took us to several different locations and shared a lot of good information that I know I wouldn't have discovered on my own. One of the biggest themes I discovered during the tour was how much superstition the Chinese have in their culture. That day we walked somewhere between 8 and 10 miles but it didn't seem like it as my mind was occupied listening to Nathan the entire time. Needless to say, we were tired after day one and slept well that night.Day two we again took the train and then a taxi to get to our meeting point with Nathan. This time it wasn't just Nathan, my son and me but we joined Nathan and 5 more people for a food tour. During this tour Nathan took us to several different locations where we sat and tried different foods of Hong Kong. Both tours were well worth the time and money and I'd highly recommend Hong Kong tours. In addition to the tours themselves, Nathan followed up each tour with an email recap of what we did each day and provided suggestions on things to do and see on our own."

My mother was visiting me in Hong Kong and really wanted to go shopping in Shenzhen after a day trip that we did together on her last visit to Hong Kong. While acknowledging that shopping really isn't my thing and that I wasn't able to take more time off work, I booked her on a personal shopping tour through Hello Hong Kong, as I didn't want my mother to go on her own.Once I booked the tour, Kim who hosted the day tour was in touch by e-mail with some very detailed instructions about the day, including some of the essentials of what to bring along. I had some questions for Kim and she was very thorough and prompt in her response. She has thought of everything!Kim was very patient and helpful, going out of her way to meet mum at a more convenient location and making sure that she was well looked after during the day. On meeting in the morning, they had a shopping pre-consultation about what she wanted to buy before they departed for Shenzhen. Kim offered to help mum with all the formalities, including the visa-on-arrival process, guiding her through every step of the way. Given the day trip that we did to Shenzhen on our own last year and coming back mostly empty handed, I wasn't sure what to expect. However Kim certainly didn't disappoint! My mother returned back from her day trip with a suitcase of purchases (including the suitcase!) and a very nice designer handbag, all at fantastic prices.Mum said that Kim was very knowledgeable and knew many of the suppliers well, so she was able to source products at different price points to suit all budgets. Most importantly, my mum returned with a huge smile on her face and just loved her day in Shenzhen! She is still raving about the trip, saying it was one of the best days that she's ever had shopping. For a seasoned shopper, that's certainly saying something!I can highly recommend this tour for anyone interested in shopping in Shenzhen while in Hong Kong. A wonderful and patient host that went above and beyond, providing personalised recommendations, demonstrating excellent knowledge of products and suppliers, this tour will delight even the most fastidious of shoppers."

Food was fantastic and in places we never would have visited on our own as we would've been too intimidated by there only being locals inside. A side note- there was a 'Debbie downer' type on our tour who didn't eat fish or pork or any meat. If you are a vegan or a vegetarian, this isn't the tour for you. Only so many accommodations can be made on a food tour of locale foods that include those specific foods. The tour guides did everything they could and ordered special food for her, but it became a joke amongst the others in the group about what this poor girl would t be able to eat at the next stop on the tour. It's really not worth the money of the tour for a vegan or a vegetarian. Can't wait to go back to some of those restaurants!"

As one of our group commented, it let you go into areas of the city and shops you might not otherwise feel comfortable going in. None of the food was new to me, but the experience of walking the streets and hearing Michael's stories about the history of Hong Kong and what all the various mecicinal items were used for was unbeatable. All the food was delicious and interesting. Went with my 15 year old son and we had a ball!"

I wanted to get the most of our time there and didn't want to stumble around just seeing the main attractions and getting lost. I researched and found that hiring a guide would be a good choice for us. After emailing a couple guides, (some who never responded) Lauria was very prompt in responding back. She asked our interest, how long we wanted to go and if there was anything definite we wanted to see. Not knowing much myself I kind of left it up to Lauria. I did ask for a 5 hour tour which was plenty long enough. She meet us at out hotel in Kowloon and from there we went all over the place, and I mean everywhere. Absolutely amazing!! We seen some main attractions and some places that we never would of visited on our own, we ate at a tiny bbq restaurant that I would not have looked twice at in passing if on our own. She showed us how to figure the train, we rode boats, trams, trolleys and walked. Then she suggest options for us of things to do on our second day and wrote out complete details of how to do them....trains to take, buses to ride, stops to get on and off. We actually got around very easily and didn't get too lost which is something to be said for 4 people from Idaho in a city of over 7 million people. I highly recommend Lauria and Hello Hong Kong. An awesome way to acquaint yourself with the city and area. We all loved our tour.....thank you Lauria."

That place was amazing - I didn't think I liked Tofu that much but this place changed my mind! Laura left us to explore on our own but suggested a great bar to finish off our day. As others have said, going out with Laura was not like most guided tours I have done before, more like a day out with a friend.

Again, a unique location with an interesting back story - and delicious shrimp or beef version of the meal.A quick stop at a Milk Tea shop is truly a treat, and then it was a trolley ride (bring small change, 2.30HKD for the trolley) to the next stop on the tour where we enjoyed Roast Pork and Duck.The final food stop included a traditional egg tart.

Reasons to book - small groups; awesome and informed guide; every food you'll try is delicious (husband is still talking about the char sui); and none of it you'll be able to find on your own. Laura also gave us tips on where to visit during the rest of our stay, which we ended up using. Everyone else seemed to love tour also. Book this tour right away!"

From the minute we contacted \"Hello Hong Kong\" they could not have been more helpful and that was before we had even booked. Nathan was prompt in his arrival and was really informative without being boring. Really nice guy to spend the time with. The tour was tailored to what we wanted and we finished with a visit to a great Dim Sum restraunt which we will be going back to. Even after the tour finished Nathan still sent us extra information so we could find our own way to things. Would highly reccomend. Thanks Nathan for a great day."

It was amber? and if it turned red?, the tour would have been cancelled. I must admit we got very wet but that did not deter the 10 or so intrepid searchers following their guide for food into places we did not know existed. There is a world of life and food behind the fa\u00e7ade that us visitors think is Hong Kong. Restaurants full of locals in places where restaurants should not exist. Up tiny lifts to the 8th floor of a building in the back streets of Hong Kong. Absolutely fabulous. For the life of me I cannot remember the name of our guide. He was American from memory and had a good rapport with the locals. We could not have asked for better. A word of advice, just do it, don't think about it, book it and do it. You wont be sorry."

We pre booked our private tour with Laura before travelling for the first time to Hong Kong, where we stayed for three days. The tour is an amazing way to see some of the most interesting areas of the city,which otherwise we would never have known about let alone found! We bolted on an extra 2 hours to make it a 6 hour food, culture and sightseeing tour, which might have been hard work in the heat and humidity but it was not. Laura has an easy going manner and is a fountain of knowledge which was really excellent, and whilst we did cover some miles, it was interspersed with food stops, shade and stopping to talk about where we were and the local culture.For anyone who wants not just to see the usual tourist trap places, but also to get to feel the culture, this is a brilliant way to do it. You get to see the contrasts of the architecture, the contrasts of the rich and poor districts, and the contrasts of the old and of the new.Oh, and you also get to try out some amazing food in great local spots that you would otherwise never have experienced.At the end of the tour when we explained that we wanted to go up to The Peak the following day for the great views of the city and bay below, Laura also gave us some great advice on the best way to get there, and not only that but also how to see the BEST view, which is not where most tourists go!And the great thing was, she e mailed us all the details of what to do and where to go, which was not even part of the tour we had paid for.Thanks Laura, and we know you make many tourists really appreciate the city with your expert guidance!"

Kim went to extra effort to arrange the tour in advance via email and met us at a prearranged meeting spot. Kim was so pleasant and thoughtful. We had arranged a tour of both the art village and Lu Wo shopping center - and had a wonderful time at both. We were able to purchase original art at very reasonable prices in the art village. The Lu Wo center would have been very confusing if it weren't for Kim's expertise. We were able to purchase all our \"wish fors\" on our shopping lists. Kim was very patient with us carefully choosing within our budgets, and we had a fantastic time browsing for gifts for friends and family. Would definitely recommend Kim, and looking forward to touring with Kim again in the future - it is definitely worth Kim's expertise to purchase quality goods at reasonable prices. My fellas were beyond impressed with the designer watches they received as gifts. I highly recommend Kim Collett as a personal designer shopper."

            "review": "Lovely food and very knowledgeable guide. A very enjoyable food tour on a very hot an humid day in Hong Kong. Our guide was Ben, a young American actor who'd been living in the city for three years. He was very well-informed, answering all questions from whether the fruit in the markets was locally grown (courtesy of my 9 year old son - the answer is no, by the way), to whether all words in written chinese can be equally understood by mandarin or cantonese speakers, and so on. It is suitable for children aged 9 and up, I'd say, any younger kids would struggle with walking in the heat (it was around 30 degrees, the day we went). You do walk for about a mile and a half at a leisurely pace through the central district, then hop onto one of the Hong Kong trams through the centre of the city for the final two food stops (beware, these only take exact change, but are insanely cheap - the journey cost HK$7 for four of us, about 57p UK or 90 cents US) Ben did have plenty of change for those scrabbling around for coins. Bear in mind that the tour features cantonese cuisine - mild, savoury with lots of prawn, pork and sweet dishes. If you're expecting spicy food, you may be disappointed, but there is something for everyone on this tour. So, those food stops *The Dim Sum place- old school. Chinese ladies with trollies piled high with steaming baskets. Ben was kind enough to run round and find some dim sum doughnuts for my son, who was being fussy and wouldn't eat anything. My daughter loved the sticky rice and the dumplings. We also got to try dim sum we would never have tried otherwise - like the sweet one made from lotus. Laura also popped in to say hello. * The Won Ton soup place- I liked this, my family less so. A subtly-flavoured broth with a prawn wonton dumpling covered in thin rice noodles. Again, son no1 wouldn't eat it. (sigh). * The Milk tea place. Sounds revolting. Tea + condensed milk brewed to within an inch of it's life, filtered through tights (yes, pantyhose, american friends). We drank it over ice. Whoa, what a caffeine hit. Mega strong. It has to be tried once. * The Roast pork place. The place was packed, fantastic, the staff gave Ben (and us) a very warm welcome and a huge portion of chinese roast pork was brought to the table. Son no.1 came into his own here. It was wolfed down. Lovely veg with oyster sauce too. * The custard tarts place. Meh. Kinda like the custard tarts you get at Greggs (an English bakery chain), except a bit more eggy. All in all, a really good tour - the good thing about these is that you go to restaurants you would never normally find, and you learn a lot about the city you're in (example: why abalone is regarded as lucky by chinese people), and a little bit about the customs and the culture of the place you're visiting. Very good value for money. The only thing I'd change is the final stop at the custard tart shop - could this be replaced by something more interesting?"

Hello Hong Kong was an exceptional experience for my first few days in this exciting city.For me the idea of strolling around a new place, learning new things about the culture and eating my way through the day was an enticing prospect, so I booked the tour before my arrival. We met our guide Laura in the morning and proceeded to spend most of the day exploring a mixture of the old and the new parts of the city, tasting local delicacies along the way. A highlight was visiting the legendary Lin Heung, a classic yum cha spot with ladies serving brilliant dim sum from their wooden trolleys. This place was excellent with copious amounts of food for the table. We visited a bustling BBQ meat place full of locals on their lunch break and had some of the best char sui and other roasted meats I've tasted, visited a number of markets (some specialising in dried seafood and medicinal herbs), drank traditional HK tea and ate Michelin-starred wonton noodle soup.Laura was our charming guide and was super attentive and friendly. What I really appreciated was that as well as focusing in on the food as advertised, Laura gave us a really insightful view of HK culture along the way and I feel like I learn a lot about the place.

There was rarely a moment where I did not learn a new fact about Hong Kong. Not only that, she was friendly and made sure that everyone in the tour group feel involved and not left out. The food was magnificent. I won't spoil too much so that there's still some surprise left in the tour. With that said, the char siu I had was the absolute best I've ever tasted. I've yet to find any place that's anywhere close to the awesome char siu I had on this tour. Now could one replicate the tour without Laura? Yes. But would it be anywhere near as fun, efficient (in the best of ways I mean), or great as a tour with Laura? That's a resounding no! This tour is definitely one to take if you want a quick crash course in Hong Kong and Hong Kong food."

My 10 year old who started out skeptical of the whole thing was delighted at the end of the tour. Not only did he have a good time but he actually ate and tried a number of things at the restaurants we were taken to.This is a must if you are visiting Hong Kong because we also learned about the culture, history of the island and we even got to ride the double tram bus!!We all had a great time. It is also important to note that Laura is a very friendly and outgoing person and keeps the tour group small so we felt like we were on our own personalized tour."

She gave us a general overview of the city as well as some hidden gems we wouldn't have found on our own. Her love of Hong Kong was obvious and helped us fall in love with it as well. After the tour she followed up with the pictures she took as well as multiple itineraries for the rest of our stay, complete with directions and pictures. She is the best!!!"

Kim our guide was great company and we had a lot of smiles during the day. My husband and I took our 13 year old son and we all loved the trip. ( would have been better if I could have spent all day for me) Be advised you will probably need to buy another suitcase. Kim arranged a driver so we were able to do the trip in comfort, although I believe the train is far cheaper which is also optional. Kim had reliable contacts which meant the day ran smoothly, and moments that we will never forget. The day is totally flexible and you are taken to different shopping centres depending on what you want to see and buy. Our guide had the patience of a Saint and very calm when put to the test"

Having found out about Hello Hong Kong via Tripadvisor, we booked a bespoke 5 hour walking tour before we left the UK.What can I say! Laura was the perfect tour guide and took us to places we would never have gone to without her. Her enthusiasm for Hong Kong is obvious and it was a real pleasure to spend time with her! We went on the ferry, MTR and the trams and covered everything from Chinese medicine shops to the fish market, temples to the antique district. We ate in a tiny backstreet caf\u00e9 and saw the real Hong Kong. The 5 hours went by very quickly and Laura was very considerate and gave us choices along the way. Her anecdotes and information were both useful and funny and her advice about what to do for the rest of our time in HK was very helpful. She sent numerous emails with hints and tips and suggested routes.Laura is very likable and we parted as friends. If you have limited time in Hong Kong then book a tour with Hello Tours and let Laura or her colleagues show you round!"

When we booked our tour, they asked what things we where interested in seeing. This enabled them to customise a tour to suit our needs and interests.Our tour guide Ben met us at our hotel to begin the tour. Ben was very pleasent and knowledgeable throughout our tour and always took the time to answer any questions we had. Ben took us to some wonderful places based on what our interests were. We were able to see the real HK and things we wouldn't have seen exploring HK ourselves.The tour was very interesting and informative and Ben delivered the tour in a fun, relaxed and enjoyable way. He was very knowledgeable and had plenty of information to share.Before our tour ended, we told Ben about a few other places we were going to explore over the next few days. Later that night, Ben very kindly sent a detailed email outlining how to get there, other things to see and do and even the best way to do this to avoid queues etc. This was a huge help.If visiting HK, booking this tour is a must to enjoy seeing and experiencing the real HK with excellent tour guides.Gail Ogilvie"

We were traveling with our two daughters, ages 16 and 8. I was born in HK, but had not been back in 20 years. It was a first time visit for my husband and two daughters. Laura was excellent! She was super personable, friendly, and even made the tour fun and interesting for our youngest. Five hours seemed like a long time, but it flew by quickly. The best part of the tour was visiting neighborhoods that we might not have ventured into on our own. The day we scheduled the tour was one of the hottest in HK. It could have easily become pretty miserable with everyone melting in the heat. Laura made sure we had plenty of water stops, and ducked into places with AC when it was possible. At the end of the tour we didn't get any complaints from the kids. Everyone had a great time! After the tour, Laura was kind enough to send us some extensive emails with suggestions on other areas to visit, and some family pictures she had snapped during our tour. Our entire family thought it was one of the highlights of our trip and we would not hesitate to book another tour the next time we are in HK. Thank you Laura!!!"

Hey, I'm Cantonese and so the food on this tour was not anything new to me, but I thought this would be a different way to see Hong Kong. Let me tell you, that this tour is totally worth doing. The commentary from our guide Ben made everywhere we went way more interesting than if I had just walked and went to these places myself. We got to ride on the double decker bus, which was way cool and fun, I would not have attempted to do it on my own. The food was all good and Ben was flexible to accommodate everyone's tastes and preferences, so you weren't left out if you, for example, like me, didn't want to eat an egg custard tart, I got to try something else from the bakery. I really liked walking to see the produce mart, the stories about the history of the places we ate at and it was nice to feel like someone had done all the research so that we didn't have to, we could eat and enjoy knowing it was some of Hong Kong's best. My boyfriend totally loved the char sieu (roasted pork) and he is a great fan of it, so he would know good char sieu!You really get to see a lot of Hong Kong on the tour, you will totally be stuffed from all the food and it really felt like an insider's tour. Don't miss this tour!"

Even though we had spend two day on our own, Ben was able to show us parts of Hong Kong we were not able to see on our own. He introduced us to the subway system..the tram...the escalators...and walked us all over town as well The neighborhood tours were especially informative. Ben knew the answers to all the questions we asked and gave us insights we had missed while touring on our own. He had us stop for two delicious food adventures...Snake Soup at one stop and Roasted Pork and Duck at another. Both spots were clearly not the usual tourist stops and were a real treat from traditional Chinese food. Laura did a great job of communicating in a timely manner and gave us all kinds of information and ideas for seeing Hong Kong before our day with Ben. We especially enjoyed the insights for visiting Victoria Peak. Ben also followed up our day with additional information we requested. All in all, Hello Hong Kong was a very professional and enjoyable way to experience Hong Kong."

Ben took us on a tour around a number of neighborhoods in Hong Kong, including a number of local neighborhoods and markets designed to give a more intimate understanding of how people live in the city. While he also took us to some well-known points of interest, he was able to show us hidden little nuances of these places that we otherwise wouldn't be aware of. His guidance also helped us gain familiarity with the MTR, which we put to good use in subsequent trips of our own.Throughout the tour, Ben combined the detailed knowledge of a local with an ability to clearly communicate in-depth stories and descriptions to us along our tour, which is not something that we got in other private tours we took in our trip to Asia. He showed an ability to customize our itinerary on the fly, and even helped us find some additional attractions to visit after the tour ended."

We are a group of expats who have just moved to Hong Kong so arranged a private group tour. In the lead up Laura was easy to reach by e-mail and responded quickly to organise the booking. She even suggested the best time of day to make the most of the experience for us- we started at 11am and our tour took us through to 3pm so it was brunch and lunch all rolled into one. First stop was Yum Cha and we were definitely the only westerns in the restaurant- there was no way we would have found this place on our own. Laura ordered a selection of must try dishes and we grabbed a few extras as we went past. Next we wandered through Sheung Wan and looked at all the different dried seafoods and Chinese medicines before reaching Central for a bowl of wanton noodle soup. We had a look through the wet markets, tried some milk tea and jumped on a tram to Wan Chai for some AMAZING BBQ Pork and Peking Duck. Last but not least was dessert of egg tarts. Laura was so knowledgable about Hong Kong food, culture and life. She clearly knows her stuff and you could see she has a great relationship with the restaurant staff by how she was greeted at every stop. I would recommend this tour to anyone- whether they are just visiting HK for a few days as you get to see so much in just a short amount of time or if you are like us and living here it was great to try some excellent food right on our doorstep!"

When my husband & I expressed our interest in doing some shopping in Shenzhen to another tour guide in Kong Kong Hello Hong Kong Tours was highly recommended to us. So we made contact with Kim and from the very beginning Kim was extremely professional, friendly & well prepared to make our shopping in Shenzhen an experience of a life time. We felt extremely safe and the day was stress free and totally enjoyable plus our amazing purchases would not have been possible without Kim contacts & experience with the shop owners. This tour is well worth every cent you pay as you will save so much more on great bargains and you will only be surprised at what you could possibly buy. We are still buzzing with our awesome buys. Thank you Kim for a fabulous day shopping."

Found Hello Kong on Trip Advisor and booked a walking tour with Laura for the first of the two days, which turned out to be an excellent decision. From the first email query until after the tour, Laura was efficient, friendly and informative. A private tour for two people is always going to be expensive, but Laura was able to provide advice on what to do on our second day, how to get from the airport to the hotel, where to eat etc, etc. So all up, pretty good value.We let Laura decide on the itinerary for the tour itself, but could have chosen to go to some specific places if we had wanted to. Our only requirement was that it included some good local food. We had an amazing yum cha breakfast at a place full of locals that we never would have found ourselves and a delicious lunch of roast meats. In between, we walked (a lot) and caught trains, trams and the ferry so covered a lot of ground and saw many different neighbourhoods. Laura knows a lot about HK's history and culture and was very informative as well as friendly and engaging. It was a tour of real contrasts \u2013 old and new, east and west, rich and poor, local and touristy. All in all, a great day out and a fabulous introduction to Hong Kong. Her advice for our second day, including detailed instructions for local transport, also turned out to be spot on."

She even took us for a dim sum lunch at a very local establishment filled with the locals enjoying their day with families. I had arranged with her via email months before we went and, everything came off as she had said it would. I just wish we had more time as 6 hours was a full day (lots of walking so wear comfy shoes) but there is so much to see. She left us with instructions to the taxi driver in his native language to get us to Victoria Peak for dinner and directions back to our hotel via a photo of her cell phone with native language instructions for the return taxi driver. She was an awesome guide and the tour was great!"

Drank fresh milk tea, ate at the famous Mak's Noodle, Peking duck, mouthwatering pork, and a custard egg tart. Yum. I was let down a bit by the Peking since the skin wasn't not crispy at all and it was only served with rice. No pancake with sauce and veggies to make true Peking duck wraps. Walked a bit through the city learned about different neighborhoods, Chinese medicines, culture, architecture and a few more city highlights. The cost is very reasonable too. Highly recommended"

We agreed that the most memorable part of our trip was the private tour with Laura from Hello Hong Kong. Laura, a very sweet, personable and extremely knowledgeable British young lady, met us at our hotel and proceeded to take us on a spectacular 6 hour walking tour of the areas of Hong Kong that most tourists do not see. We started with a ride on the MTR to Sham Shui Po, the poorest district in Hong Kong. We visited the electronics market, jade market, wet market and snake shop. Be sure to try the famous Hong Kong egg tart! We then went by Star Ferry to Central, by taxi to Sheung Wan, had delicious lunch at tea house, walked through the Cat Street Market, and took a tram (ding ding). Laura was extremely informative about the history, economic situation, political issues, and just about anything you could imagine about Hong Kong. We never felt rushed (as you sometimes do on a group tour), and the cost of the tour was very reasonable. You do need to pay a nominal amount for extras, such as Octopus card (MTR) and food. Also be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes, as there is ALOT of walking including up and down stairs. Laura will customize the tour to include any special areas that you wish to see. We did not choose to see the \"tourist spots\" because we had seen those attractions during our previous trip to Hong Kong. We highly recommend this tour--Laura is truly amazing!"

I really enjoyed the opportunity to explore the little narrow lanes and backstreets which hold some of the real gems of eateries which appear as unassuming facades but that are rich in family history,with food that is simple in nature but each mouthful is an experience of beautiful tastes and textures that leaves you wanting more.

After all that walking we went for a great foot massage recommended by Laura which was wonderful. Laura's tour is a must if you want to see the real Hong Kong and would thoroughly recommend her."

She was happy to accommodate our request to wander \"off the beaten path\" and helped us to experience a Hong Kong we would not otherwise have found on our own including having fortunes read at the amazing temple in Wong Tai Sin, and eating the most delicious noodles in HK. Our two daughters instantly bonded with Laura and her easy-going, enthusiastic personality. We appreciated her insightful knowledge of the city, it's people, food, and culture. After the tour we were significantly more confident navigating the local transportation and neighborhoods.Thank you for an incredible 5 hours, truly the highlight of our trip!"

Laura was not only very knowledgeable about the Cantonese food we sampled but also incorporated some interesting historical facts. She has obviously built up a great relationship with the local restaurant owners who were very pleased to see her and welcomed all members of her tour. I would thoroughly recommend folk to do this tour. Make sure you really go hungry as the food offered is of a great standard, variety and masses of it."

Tour Guide: LAURA BLACKHALL www.hellohongkong.com.hkOur trip to Honk Kong in February 2015 was the front end of a 17 day Crystal Cruise from HK to Singapore. We arrived several days early, in part to recover from jet lag (the 16 hour time zone difference from Los Angeles to HK), and also to wander and do some shopping.We decided to hire a private tour guide for our first day. We found Laura Blackhall via recommendations on TripAdvisor. Ahead of arrival she asked, via email, about our interests (tourist sites, shopping, wandering back alleys, etc.) and them presented us several options.Laura met us at Mr. Sams on Nathan Road, following a morning tailoring appointment. We spent five hours with Laura wandering Central and Kowloon by foot, ferry boat, trams, and the metro. Based on the email correspondence prior to arrival, she mapped out a tour for us that offered a taste and the backstories for many parts of Hong Kong, from the High Tea Service at the Peninsula Hotel to the entrepreneurial street markets in Central and the \u201cMansions\u201d that provide low cost retail stalls and hostel beds for recent immigrants to HK. Our deem sum lunch in Central was at a second floor venue populated by locals: we seemed to be the only (Western) tourists in the place. Laura was exceptional: warm, engaging, and informative. The five hours with Laura was an easy conversation with a new, local friend as opposed to a stiff and formal presentation on a bus or limo tour. She asked questions about us in order to tailor to the continuing conversation to our interests, in and beyond our HK trip. Additionally, she sent us extensive follow-up notes with detailed directions and photos for other places for us to visit during our remaining time in HK. She left us well-informed and well-prepared for wandering HK on our own.So should you be thinking about a tour guide for your first (or next) trip to HK, we would absolutely recommend Laura Blackhall. ENJOY!"

Even though there was quite a lot of walking between food stops, the stops themselves were well worth the walk. Laura is an extremely engaging guide, and did an excellent job of putting HK's best loved foods into a cultural context. She's funny too. This tour will definitely take you to places that you would never just stumble upon."

Laura, Hello Hong Kong, was available and she agreed to help me with some shopping and touring the city. I booked 5 hours with Laura. Co-worker in tow, Laura took us to the Jade Market to buy pearls and helped me find a watch in the Ladies market. But most of all, we saw the backdoor and the front door sides of Kowloon and Hong Kong. We saw temples, small parks, food markets, quaint alleyways and learned some history. There was so much to see and so little time! Laura maximized our time because she knows the area well and helped us use the MTR subway to quickly move through the city. Laura is quick witted, charismatic, engaging and fun. You will certainly enjoy your day with Laura and if I ever go to Hong Kong again, without a second thought, would book with Laura a second time. I highly suggest a 6 hour tour or a bit more. My skeptical co-worker who initially didn't want to participate in a walking tour LOVED it and told everyone about Laura and Hello Hong Kong at each business we met with during our trip! Thank you Laura for a wonderful day!!Sheila (and Tim)"

My family was very happy with the experience, I had been to HK several times before and I never learned of the inside story of the place as much as with Laura. Your will go to see the extremes of HK, from the very rich and fancy to the not-so-rich areas of the city, all in the company of a lovely lady.

I recently went on Laura's food tour with 2 other couples and cannot recommend this highly enough - think a combination of trying authentic local food and a personalized tour of several areas of Hong Kong. Our group size was perfect and we could visit our stops without looking like a \"tour\". We first met at a local coffee shop to meet each other and Laura provided a welcoming orientation about our day. Minutes later we were off to a local tea house for Dim Sum. Immediately realized that this was the real deal! This was a a very popular restaurant with regular patrons and obviously not a tourist destination. No problem for us as Laura had arranged a table for us and the Dim Sum carts were circulating and we were able to sample several local delicacies. Afterwards, back out on the streets and we visited some local markets to view many different exotic type of food such as mushrooms, abalone and many that I didn't know existed! I just want to give a glimpse of the tour here so that I do not give away the many surprises that you will enjoy as I did throughout the day that included tea, noodle soup and tarts. The pace of the tour was perfect and you will not be overwhelmed by the amount of tastings so that you can truly enjoy each stop.

If you come to Hong Kong with food on your mind you will be assaulted by the mind boggling number and array of choices to eat traditional Chinese food and every other type of cuisine - in a single block. Extend that to a whole city of 7 million people, and about the same number of places to eat, and you might be tempted to throw up your hands in resignation and take the first place you see. Or settle for Pizza Hut. Well....No. Instead, simply book a tour with Laura at Hello Hong Kong Food Tours and put your stomach in her hands. Or something like that. She will take you to the Best places in town for all the traditional basics like wonton noodle soup, yum cha, milk tea, etc. Ever been to a Michelin star restaurant, for instance? Laura is an outstanding tour guide. She has done the \"hard work\" of uncovering the truly best places out of an impossibly huge range of options, all of which can look alike to the uninitiated. She really knows Hong Kong so she can put the food culture into an historical and social context, explain variations of traditional foods, and keep you entertained along the way. She has developed good relationships with the restaurants and cafes you visit so you always feel welcome. In fact, this tour is like having a good friend showing you around her favorite city. The tour takes in some street markets, too, which can be eye-opening to say the least, but this IS the real Hong Kong, and you will want to go back to all the places she takes you. A word of warning, though. DO NOT EAT BREAKFAST before you take this tour. You will be well fed, take my word for it. This is a five star tour and I recommend it unconditionally. And say \"ni hao\" to Laura for me."

I knew I did not want a big mass tour but wanted to see as much as I could. I saw Laura's webpage and contacted her to discuss possibilities. She replied immediately and gave me a list of suggestions as to what we could do on her tour. Laura met me at the airport and helped me exchange money and get my octopus card. From there we went on an amazing walking tour through many different parts of the city. She was very informative and took me to areas that would not be on a regular group tour. We had a fantastic local dim sum lunch and I felt like we covered everything that I wanted to see and more. She also gave me suggestions as to other things I could do by myself for later in the day or if I can back again. She was easy and friendly and it was such a nice way to spend the day with a new friend. I would highly recommend her tour. I just need to go back so I can do the foodie tour next . Thanks for a wonderful Hong Kong experience Laura! Sincerely, Michelle C. Canada"

As we were going to be in Hong Kong for 3 more days, I wanted to get a good initial city tour, so we would feel more comfortable to go out on our own, on the following 3 days. After HK, we were heading on to China for a couple of weeks.Laura is a transplanted Brit, who met us promptly as prearranged, in our hotel lobby. We left the itinerary up to Laura, but asked to see some of the places and sites, that the typical tourist tours don't hit. We visited everything using the fantastic HK subway system, and by walking. Our tour included a visit to to Wong Tai Sin by MTR to see the council housing and the temple complex. Then by MTR to Sham Shui Po, the poorest of the 18 districts of Hong Kong. Lowest average monthly household income. Highest % of elderly of all districts. Laura took us to the She Wong Sin snake shop to try snake soup. Tasted like Chicken!Then stopped at the very old Kung Wo Soybean Products shop (yummy!), and visited the electronics market and the indoor wet-market. Then back on the MTR back to Tsim Sha Tsui (TST), and a stop at the famous Peninsula Hotel.We saw the old Marine Police Headquarters (Hullett House) with the noon day gun and Time Ball Tower to the old Clock Tower.Then took the famously cheap Star Ferry to Central, and went through the IFC building and down onto the streetcar tram. By tram to Sheung Wan, and walked around the back streets to look at the dried seafood and sharks fins. Had a quick visit to the old Chinese medicine shop on Wing Lok Street.Up to the Cat Street market on Upper Lascar Row to see the mammoth ivory on Hollywood RoadThen along Hollywood Road past the PMQ (Police Married Quarters) and up onto the Escalator at SoHo. (Why don't more cities implement these free escalators?).Walked down and around the back of the old Victoria Prison, and down onto Wyndham Street (art galleries and bars), then through Lan Kwai Fong (LKF) to Central Station and then back to our hotel by MTR.Laura had a lot of background and facts for all the places we visited. Very impressive.After our tour, Laura sent me a few emails, with detailed suggestions, and directions for other things we could do and see. Using her suggestions, we ended up going to see the Giant Buddha and Po Lin Monestary via the Ngong Ping 360 sky tram. We then went to see the old fishing village of Tai O.Again, using detailed directions that Laura provided, we went to Stanley Village and Repulse Bay, and Deep Water Bay. Ended up in Aberdeen to go to the Jumbo Floating restaurant.Laura can customize your tour based on your interests and available time and budget. Highly recommended."

I didn't know what to expect & was pleasantly surprised! Ben, our guide was right on time at our designated meeting spot & we headed off to our first stop, traditional Chinese Dim Sum. I am a massive Dim Sum fan, and wasn't disappointed!Next we walked through the streets of Shueng Wan past the many Chinese Medcine shops. Such an eye opener! Ben knew his stuff when it came to what they were all selling, and even helped one of the other tour guests make a purchase. Mak's noodles was up next for the BEST Dumpling Noodle Soup. All others Soups are now ruined for me as they wont ever compare! I will return before I leave HK.Short stroll through the wet markets and then some famous HK milk tea. I must say I wasn't looking forward to this as its not usually my thing, but I think I have a new Fav drink. Had the Yin Yang (1/2 tea 1/2 coffee). Will be back here also.Jumped on a tram next off to Wan Chai. Roast meat was on the menu at a tiny, extremely crowded restaurant. Luckily we got priority seating! I am a massive fan of Char Sui (Pork) back home. This eclipsed anything I have ever had. The flavor was amazing and the garlic sauce that it was served with was divine.Short walk to the last stop for an Egg Tart. I was also surprised by this. The pastry was flaky and the Filling just sweet enough. Such a great few hours. Ben was extremely knowledgable about Hong Kong and answered every question the group threw at him. The tour had a really great atmosphere, and I think this was down to Ben being extremely personable & genuinely interested in the group enjoying their time.Ben also sent a follow up e mail with some tips on the things I had mentioned I was doing on the rest of my stay. Very much appreciated! Highly recommended to all visitors to HK (even those that don't usually 'Do' tours)"

Places we never had found. I think one of the best atributes on Laura is, that she adapted to you. Your speed, your interest and your personalty.

Both had previously visited the city though I had not before even left the continent (Europe). This did leave me feeling a little apprehensive about the trip, given their wealth of knowledge and experience of having already been.We had ourselves a city-tour booked with Laura a week into our trip and due to already having seen the major 'touristy' attractions and sites, we opted for a less than usual tour, which Laura was very happy to cater for.Starting in the Wong Tai Sin temple, Laura told us of the stark differences between the lives of those living in Hong Kong. We took part in Kau Cim and had our fortunes told based on this, something I certainly wouldn't have had the confidence to do had Laura not been there to guide us. Me and my fiance were also able to 'tie the red string of fate', another Chinese tradition involving 'tying onself' to their hopeful future partner, (here's hoping our strings were already bound!) We moved on to compare the differences between the Peninsula Hotel and Chunking Mansions, (two vastly different places, so close in proximity to one another). A short star ferry across the harbor followed where we would stop in Central to get some food; delicious Dim Sum at a fantastic price, in a place that I feel only those local to Hong Kong would know about. To finish up, Laura walked us through the markets and pointed out to us the best spice and tea shops on the island.Laura's knowledge and delivery was perfect, keeping a solid balance of enthusiasm and pace so as to keep us interested at all times. To say that I felt at one with Hong Kong is an understatement. All of us, with our differing levels of experience with the city learned a great deal and thoroughly enjoyed our tour. I would wholeheartedly recommend a tour with Laura and when we return, I hope that we can re-book another route around the city."

Spending the day with Laura was like exploring with an old friend. We wandered really interesting alley ways with Laura sharing her extensive knowledge of buildings, shops, markets and food that we would have otherwise walked right by. As an expat living in Hong Kong, she clearly loves the city and has educated herself well on every nook and cranny. We allowed Laura to design the day for us (7 hours) and she was completely flexible even on the day, when we proclaimed early on we were hungry and in search of the best Yum Cha the city had to offer. Laura \u2013 and the Yum Cha \u2013 did not disappoint. We were keen, too, when she asked if we wanted to swing by the protest area in Admiralty. It was then across to Kowloon, drinks at the Eyebar rooftop bar and a ferry ride back to Central. Not only did she arrange our Oyster card for us, but she sent through detailed information after the tour on other bars, restaurants and things to do and see.Because we covered so much on the first day, we felt we had a really good grasp of the city layout, making our next two days quite relaxed. We recommend Laura highly if you are seeking a personalised way to see the city.

HK has more restaurants than any city we have visited or lived in before and to be able to find just the right ones to highlight the best of a range of Cantonese cuisine takes a lot of trial and effort. The blend of foods was excellent starting with Yum Cha at a traditional Tea House, then Wonton Noodle Soup, Milk Tea (we had a mix of iced tea and coffee) which helped with the heat, Roasted Meats and finally an Egg Tart.

I booked in when i had a couple of friends visiting from out of town and we had had the best day out! Laura took us not only to some brilliant sights but also to parts of HK that I had never even heard of let alone visited and we had such a great day. Lunch was a really local experience but by far the highlight for me was walking around the temple and having it all explained to me. I cannot recommend the experience highly enough and will definitely book in with her again next time I have visitors because more than anything else she made the day such fun."

I am very familiar with cantonese food having grown up in Vancouver and had been to HK several times - this tour was still worth it! I learned a lot about the food that i already love and learned some new and fabulous places to have these favourite dishes, including dimsum, wonton soup, milk tea, BBQ meat and egg tarts. It was interesting to learn the history of the food and how it evolved to how we know it today. I learned not only about the food, history and secret ingredients that i never knew about as well as information regarding the various parts of town we ventured throughout the tour - it was a food with a bit of city tour rolled into one. You could even order as much as you wanted of anything along the way - though you do have to be careful to pace yourself - you will most definitely be full by teh end of the tour! Laura made this very enjoyable with her knowledge and carefully selected restaurants along the way, all supporting local businesses. I would recommend this tour to any of my friends that like to try new food as well as those that are already very familiar with cantonese food."

The tour is so well thought out - it makes great use of the time, you get to try a wide variety of Hong Kong specialties and learn about Hong Kong's history and culture on the way. The food stop choices were all fantastic and you get to visit some great hole-in-the-wall places that you probably would not venture into if you were a tourist on your own (let alone know what to order). The yin-yang tea stop especially surprised us! Laura also provided us with some great tips and recommendations for the rest of our stay.

Armed with that info she set about an amazing 'bespoke' tour for Angela and I taking in the old part of Hong Kong and places to eat (we are foodies) where we would never had gone....food was amazing. Laura was amazing...she is so knowledgeable about HK and delivers it with such passion. She also booked us into a restaurant for Dinner for Angela's birthday (Aqua) which was truly amazing experience.From the moment Laura met us in the lobby at The Mira, she organised us with our Octopus cards for travelling on the MTR and within minutes she was our new best friend. I would state to anyone considering HK as a holiday that you make contact with this company (Laura) to explore HK, by an absolute mile the best tour guide we had hoped for and more....thankyou Laura you made Angela's day a truly special one and we have already recommended to you to a couple of our friends soon travelling!!!"

Laura provides a comprehensive guide to some of Hong Kong's favourite dishes and has clearly spent time researching the restaurants/shops that provide the most delicious examples of these dishes. The places you visit on this tour are authentic, local food providers - off the tourist track - so you are able to experience some of the delights of Hong Kong's fascinating food culture. Not only is the food delicious but Laura's relaxed and friendly personality made me feel very comfortable and her professional approach to the service she provides filled me with confidence about the genuine nature of this tour. Laura provided clear instructions about where to meet her, the nature of the tour, what to bring etc. You do need to be able to walk in the heat (in summer) but there are ample stopping points in air conditioned eateries to make the trip comfortable. The personalised nature of Laura's tour made it more enjoyable than a large group tour, as it gave ample opportunity to ask questions and Laura was able to accommodate certain interests we had e.g. my wish to buy genuine Chinese tea and Moon cakes.I thoroughly recommend this tour. This is not a high end gourmet dining experience but more an everyday, local eateries one. It is worth the cost (gets cheaper the more people in your group - we had two and it was HK$1400 each) because Laura is able to provide such a succinct, culturally authentic snapshot of delicious Hong Kong cuisine."

Before even taking the walk, Laura was very helpful giving lots of information, taking time to tailor our walking tour to suit our personal interests (culture, history, local living, arts, cats, foods, etc) and giving exact prices with regards to transport. We had a wonderful four and a half hour walking tour through all the back streets of Hong Kong, taking in the culture and discovering how the local people of Hong Kong live. We explored the fascinating dried foods\u2019 areas, (amongst others shark fins, birds nests, abalone!! the wet market, which was colourful and interesting, the tea-shop (we even tried a panty-hose evaporated milk tea, which was refreshing and a pick-me-up during the humid day), through the shopping districts, temples, taking escalators, trams, taxis, ferries and meeting some streets artists. We took the ferry with the locals to visit Kowloon: amongst others we visited the Peninsula Hotel and went to the Chungking Mansions (from the sublime to the ridiculous!!!), saw the old Marine Police Headquarters Police building and back on the ferry. At the end of the tour, Laura took us right to the Number 6 bus to take ourselves to Stanley, even adding which side of the bus to sit for the best view for photographs! Throughout the walk Laura was always very concise with her information, adding loads of fascinating history tidbits and observations and giving a thorough overall fascinating impression of what it is like to live in Hong Kong. Laura is also very keen to get to know her guests so one is immediately put at ease and having Laura as a guide, is like a good friend showing you around Hong Kong!By the end of the day we felt we had really explored Hong Kong and discovered how both wealthy alongside poor live. For the rest of our stay, Laura gave us lots of tips of where else to go, what to see and how to get there. Additional emails were sent with all the necessary information as well as an email giving a list of what we had done and seen in the four hours to go with our photographs.

The tour was amazing and Laura's level of service was excellent! Not only did she show me some of Hong Kong's fantastic sites and attractions, she also provided information on their backgrounds and histories as well. Laura definitely opened my eyes to a remarkable side of Hong Kong I never knew existed! She is an excellent tour guide, extremely knowledgeable, and I'm so glad I booked her for this fantastic journey through the cities and districts of Hong Kong! I will definitely be back again, but this time with my parents and brother so they get to soak in the amazing experience Hong Kong has to offer!"

From the initial point of contact we knew that we would choose Hello Hong Kong. Laura\u2019s response was so friendly and helpful and more importantly she assured us that the tours could be flexible to accommodate our specific requests. This was not the case with some of the other Tour companies (some didn\u2019t even reply and one was even quite rude with his reply to us!). She advised us that getting around Hong Kong is so easy and that it would be beneficial and more financially efficient for us to do the big tourist attractions on our own. We took her advice and arranged to do a 4 hour tour and asked to incorporate some of the lesser-known attractions to see the local side of Hong Kong and some authentic food places. When we met Laura in person she was so bubbly and friendly. Her knowledge of Hong Kong history and facts was very impressive and she managed to pass on information in an interesting way rather than in a boring and mind-numbing manner like some tours we have done in the past. We enjoyed Dim-Sum (Yum-Cha) in a restaurant where we were the only westerners. She showed us some of the local traditions such as washing all crockery and eating utensils with the tea provided. Not only did she introduce us to some other local delicacies such as Won Ton Noodle Soup, Milk Tea and Egg Tarts but she also incorporated a visit to a Wet Market near to where she lives which is where the locals go to buy all their food supplies (no such thing as a Woollies or Coles in this area!). We also visited a Temple that was so beautiful and yet we had not read about in any of our research. Our 4 hours was so enjoyable and we gained so much appreciation and knowledge about Hong Kong. Laura was also able to advise us on other places to visit during our time in the exciting city and she took the time to send us emails containing valuable information on the best way to get there and any special points to consider and help us to get the most out of our visit. We also asked her where to go to get a great massage and we concluded our tour with her taking us to a very authentic Chinese Massage Therapy Clinic (Gao\u2019s Foot Massage) where we enjoyed amazing full body massages and reflexology for such an affordable price. Do not hesitate to book a tour with Laura \u2013 you will gain so much from your time with her. When we return to Hong Kong we will book another tour with Laura to explore the city even more!"

On the day Laura showed us how to use the subway, trams, ferries, buses and taxi so we felt like locals tripping out the ladies markets and other sights. She also provided us with indepth guides on how to get to many places of interests.The food was so good we went back for egg tarts each night for the rest of our trip and went back to the roast meat place for dinner another night! If you do one of Laura's tours make sure you take her advice and visit the roof top bar for cocktails we went for 1 and stayed for 4, the views were amazing!Thanks again Laura for the most amazing tour, we loved it!"

She even manages to make you forget the grey sky while showing you the hidden beauty of this unique city.A scooter accident in the Taroko Gorge in Taiwan left me with a twisted ankle and limited capacity to walk around. Not really the best condition to start a busy trip around Asia. A day before arriving in Hong Kong I imagined myself depressed in my hotel room unable to do anything. This was before finding Hello Hong Kong Tour. Less than 24 hours before arriving at destination, I dropped a message explaining my situation and my wish to visit Hong Kong in any case. Quickly I received a warm reply, asking me questions on my main points of interest and what I was less motivated to do and see. As I saw the day after, this was not a marketing trick, Laura organized a tour that was above my expectations, demonstrating a real pleasure in sharing her experience of the city with a professional commitment to quality service.Laura came to pick me up at the hotel, ready to face the challenge of a walking tour with someone hardly moving with crutches. Pragmatically, we decided to take a wheelchair so I could survive the longer distances. She adapted the visit to my ability always trying to show me the most interesting and unexpected aspects of Hong Kong.We moved around Sheung Wan and along Wing Lok street through Cat Street (the market area) and then up onto Hollywood road to the Man Mo temple on Hollywood Road. After we took a taxi to Aberdeen where we went through the wholesale fish market and took a boat ride to Jumbo, the floating restaurant in the Jackie Chan films. Last but not least we grabbed another taxi to TST (Tsim Sha Tsui) from where we enjoyed the amazing skyscrapers view taking the ferry back, definitely a must in Hong Kong. Not bad for a wheelchair tour, all this with a smile and detailed explanations that gave me the impression of becoming an Hong Kong\u2019s insider.In summary, if you want to have a contrasted and lively vision of the city, if you want to discover unusual views and learn more about what makes Hong Kong so special, if you are ready to take your time to see more than just postcard views, you can trust Hello Hong Kong Tour to meet the challenge of responding to your wishes."

Despite that, Laura met us at our hotel reception, showed us how to buy and use our Octopus cards at the MTR and we were off to a superb mix of places, some essential for any tour, like the Star Ferry and the 'ding ding' and others off the tourist beaten track, such as the Wong Tai Sin temple and the fortune tellers. We packed in a lot of sights in Kowloon and HK Island and Laura gave us really helpful advice and tips on other places to go and how to travel during our remaining time in the city.The tour wasn't cheap, but the insights and advice we got from Laura were worth it and the confidence her tour gave us to travel on the fantastic public transport system probably saved us a small fortune during the week.Our trip overall was wonderful and Laura's tour, which was tailored to suit us, was a fantastic introduction to HK.

She was very flexible regarding what to see and managed to explain some of the things I'd been seeing and wondering about while I had been traveling around on my own. We went to the oldest Dim Sum and Tea house in HK which is actually Michelin rated (!) which was very good, visited an ancient Temple where people still worship, and she even indulged me in going to spots to finish my shopping for friends and family.

All of the restaurants were packed with local residents, but I don't recall seeing any other obvious foreigners at any of them.Laura's very knowledgable about Hong Kong, so within the context of food we also learned a lot about the city.

We are a family with a 2 year old and 7 year old and chose the 6 hour walking tour. We debated on using a car service tour due to our children's ages since we had never been to Hong Kong and did not know which was best with children, especially with a stroller. The walking tour was perfect. I have zero regrets on choosing that method. Hong Kong has so many forms of transportation (ferry, cable car, taxi, bus) that it made the tour easy. But what really made it enjoyable was having Laura as our guide. She just made everything easy and hassle-free. She is a positive person with a smile who was so helpful and comfortable to be around. We saw much more of Hong Kong with her as our guide than we could have ever seen by ourselves in a day. Since we only had one full day in the city, there was no waiting and deciding or map reading and frustration which would have occurred if we had done it ourselves, especially with kids. I booked her a few days ahead and she asked what our goals were and created an itinerary that ran smoothly and perfectly timed. She met us in our hotel lobby and escorted us everywhere. She even attempted to escort us all the way back to the hotel on the Kowloon side despite being over the 6 hour tour. We declined since it was an easy commute, but she was very willing to help us in anyway she could and ensure we had a wonderful experience. She doesn't make it feel like a business but rather like she's giving a friend a tour. I have to add that she's not overly familiar just very personable, friendly and easy to be around.Our day was overcast so Victoria Peak was not an option. However, for our 6 hour tour, we saw the following: Kowloon historic sites, took the Star Ferry to the Hong Kong side and walked some streets (Wing Lok and Cat street) to see the local culture. We went to the Man Mo temple on Hollywood Road and rode some of the midlevel escalators. Then we boarded a bus to Stanley Plaza which I highly recommend. It was fantastic bus trip to see the hills and beach (Repulse Bay) on the other side of Hong Kong. We saw the Blake Pier and Murray House. We then took a taxi to Aberdeen fish market and then a boat to have lunch at the Jumbo Restaurant (surprisingly good for a tourist spot). After lunch, we took a taxi through the tunnel back to the city center to board the Star Ferry to the hotel. We had a great day. The kids both had a great day too. (very important) Laura is very knowledgeable about Hong Kong history and answered all our questions with confidence. I highly recommend her service."

One of us fell ill enroute to Hong Kong from Cebu City, Philippines and Laura was able to re-schedule for us. We were glad she could and did, but we are sure her schedule may soon be so full that may not be so accomodating!She met us at the Intercontinental Grand Stafford in Kowloon and we taxied to the Wong Tai Sin temple in the area of Hong Kong with the same name. (We were impressed that she had enough Cantonese at her disposial to get the cab to the correct place!). There she explained the meaning of the temple and for whom it was named. She had fluent understanding of the deities and the worship we observed, She also was able to put the neighbor in context (it is the site of numerous public housing high rises) and helped us understand the socioeconomic and political situation of the neighborhood in which we were.We then jumped on the MTR (metro) to the TST area of Kowloon where we saw the spectacular Peninsula Hotel where she explained the important events that occurred there. She nicely contrasted this with the neighborting Cheung King Mansions, a vertiable ghetto nicely contained in the city and home of immigrants from many nations who come to Hong Kong to buy cheap goods to sell at profit in their home countries. They also live in very small rooms here. The patchwork of jerryrigged utilites to serve the inhabitants is frightening! Contrast indeed--but helped it us understand the many faces of trade in Hong Kong.From there we tookk the storied Star Ferry to Central where we taxied to Sheung Wan where we had Dim Sum (not the best but not bad and served in a realistic and authentic setting) at the historical Lin Heung Kui teahouse on Des Veoux Road West.On Wing Lok street we viewed the shops selling dried fungus, dired seafood, and chinese herbal products including bird's nests and shark fins. Interestingly, she had a workable understanding of these products and their uses (not bad for a woman from Chester, England!). She even had a nice enough relationship with one of the shop owneres to arrange for a book in English and Cantonese of the various remedies and their uses. I particulay appreciated that. We continued to wander through the neighborhood viewing antique stores, seafood (wet) markets, and the like. We visited the Man Mo temple; we also had milk tea and ying-yang (ask her)We visited the escalators to the mid levels of Hong Kong. She led us back to the Central Piers where continued out tour on the Big Bus Green line to Abderdeen and Stanley (the best of the three lines n our opinion. We then took a taxi to Vicotria Peak (much easier than the long line for the trams (thank you Laura!).Laura is engaged, knowledgable, personable and prices her tours fairly. We absolutely enjoyed our time with her and can confidently recommend her to you. She is a knowledgable British ex-pat who knows and loves this city."

She was so responsive from the beginning and created a custom tour based on my preferences and my limited time in HK. The tour and Laura exceeded my expectations-- she's very friendly and easy to be with. It was great to see Hong Kong through the eyes of someone who lives there and knows so much about the city, culture and food! We started with a fantastic dim sum and traveled to different parts of HK. I saw some beautiful temples, luxury hotels, took a ferry ride, explored different neighborhoods and markets. I went on to do some shopping after the tour and she was so professional and well organized that she provided me with very detailed directions and tips on where to go and what to do. I enjoyed myself so much that I booked another tour for my return trip through Hong Kong. We spent another fantastic afternoon seeing some beautiful and non-touristy sites and eating fantastic food. I would highly recommend Laura and can't wait to go back and see her again!"

That being said as an American whose first time in HK it was very overwhelming....Never fear...Laura to the rescue! I found her via Trip Advisor and she promptly responded to my email and had an opening for a 5 hour personal tour on one of my days off. She was over-communicative (not a bad thing at all) and was through in terms of ensuring everything I wanted to accomplish was being handled. In the days leading up to the tour I had actually done quite a bit of sightseeing on my own and she was very good about changing the tour around to accommodate where I had already been. She arrived promptly on time at my hotel and we were off for 5 hours of what turned out to be the best day of my time in HK. Laura is highly engaging and knowledgable. We went into the \"very non-tourist areas\" (per my request and she was an expert on so many different tidbits of information is was amazing. She knows the streets of HK like there is a GPS implanted in her head and everywhere we went she was a wealth of information. She also was kind enough to send me some additional detailed itineraries of things to do on my own if time allowed. Can't wait to come back with my family and introduce them to HK via Laura's expert guidance. If you want THE best tour guide in Hong Kong than there is only one choice...Hello Hong-Kong and Laura!!!"

It was fantastic.I was accompanying a group of 7 blokes aged between 30 - 55 on a sales trip to Hong Kong and i wanted to show them the real Hong Kong, not the tourist edited version. We were not disappointed, actually the guys couldn't stop raving about what a great guide she was for the rest of the 7 day trip.The food was amazing and in places we never would have looked and Laura was very informative about the city and its culture. Furthermore it's the little things, she helped me to find a restaurant to eat at that night and sent through heaps of instructions of where else to go. She also changed the tour slightly so we could look at some markets for costumes to the 7s the following day.Laura - I hope that your business continues to blossoms. You are an amazing guide and it was a great tour. I will def. be recommending it to everyone!"

Also the bird and flower market where Laura took us was great finding out about the origins of Feng Sui.At the end of the tour Laura took me back to my hotel and sent a nice email saying what we had seen.

She's done quite a bit of homework and legwork and has put together a wonderful event that is lots of fun. She was able to show us places that we would most likely never find ourselves or if we did, would not be able to navigate due to language and customs barriers.

We are both vegetarian and while we enjoy trying new foods, we don't have a hard-core adventurous palate. That said, we felt right at home with the food that Laura introduced us to while on this tour. We appreciate that there is not a set menu at each restaurant/food stop, so you can pick and choose what suits you best. The restaurants/locations she took us to were a great cross-section of HK food (neither too high brow nor street food). Our personal highlight was eating the best bowl of won ton soup we have ever had (from a Michelin-rated hole-in-the-wall noodle shop).While on the tour, Laura does a great job of providing context--the history of different dining customs, the history of the restaurant and shop owners, the neighborhoods in which we walked, etc. The tour itself is well-paced, not too meandering or too hurried/strenuous. Laura really knows her stuff and clearly loves what she does. Her energy is infectious, and at the end of the trip, we felt much more connected to and comfortable in HK than we would have if we had not taken this tour."

Boy was i wrong! Myself and two friends were amongst about 20 other people, tourists and residents, some of whom have since remained friends. The vintage, open top tram navigates its way through the electric city as the lovely ladies keep you topped up with drinks. The music was thumping and they played a great variety, there's definately something for everyone. The stops along the way get you tasting a huge variety of food which is needed. You get to have a real taste of everything the city can throw at you. After the 3 hour trip, everyone knew everyone. I saw the organiser making sure even the people who were there on their own were having a great time. When it came to a stop a private bus picked us up and dropped us into Hong Kong's party land. The clubs were great, girls were in for free and got free vodka drinks and the guys got buy one get one free. This is a class night and i will definately do it again on my return to HK!"

We were a little doubtful to start as my husband is fussy on what and where he eats! We gave it a go. Wow, what a great time we had, and it has helped my husband on being more adventurous when trying new types of foods..this a walking tour with a short tram ride thrown in. The dim sum breakfast was great start to the tour, off to the dried fish markets then Sheung Wan medicinal market, I found this very interesting and learnt a lot. The tour continued with different stops sampling meats, Milk tea and noodle soup! To my husbands delight we finished with Egg tarts!I would highly recommend this tour even if ( like us) you have visited Hong Kong many times before.Our tour guide Laura was excellent and made every step on the way a knowledgable one!"

I have to admit I'm not normally one to take a tour, I'm usually working my way through the darkest little corners in search of some adventure but I decided instead to try a tour, and it was well worth it! Normally in foreign climbs we tend to wonder around the most obvious and accessible places but in Laura's capable navigation I sampled many delights in some of the most unusual of places, the wet market being a particularly good memory of the experience! I cannot recommend strongly enough that if you find yourself in Hong Kong with some time on your hands you treat yourself to meeting Laura and a cacophony of food that you would otherwise be none the wiser to!"

            "review": "A selection of tours put together by a tour guide who clearly loves HK. In the run up to Christmas I was looking for cool things to do to entertain my parents who were visiting from the UK. My mum is a HK native who emigrated to the UK, my dad is a true Brit through and through. We tried the food tour, put on by our wonderful tour guide Laura. Laura is originally from the UK, having moved to HK several years ago. She LOVES HK, and her passion and knowledge for the city has resulted in the most fabulous tour. It was fun, interesting, and not only revealed some off the beaten track foodie hotspots, but managed to satisfy my mums more adventurous local palette, and my dads rather more British and 'safe' palette! Both parents wanted to go again!I've been raving about the tour ever since, and have some some friends visiting from Manchester this weekend, who I'm scheduling in a tram tour and foodie tour for. If you want to see HK through the eyes of a local, experience some AMAZING food, and discover parts of HK you'd not usually stumble across, then I'd urge you to try one of Laura's tours. You will not find a better tour guide."

The tour started with an authentic Hong Kong dim sum breakfast followed by an insightful and interesting tour of the dried fish and medicinal markets of sheung wan. We then went on to the amazing wet markets in Central where we tasted wonton noodle soup and Hong kong's famous milk tea. After a short tram ride we ate lunch at an extremely popular and delicious BBQ meat restaurant after which we finished with some traditional Hong Kong egg tarts.The whole experience was amazing! Even for my slightly western taste buds the food was just authentic enough without being outside my comfort zone. Delicious! I recommend this to anyone who wishes to experience the food and history that Hong Kong has to offer."

            "review": "Hello Hong Kong Tour. The Hello Hong Kong Tour is a gastronomic and cultural experience that is not to be missed! My wife and I have sampled many different kinds of Chinese and Pan Asian cuisine. From Chinatown in New York City to the Asian neighborhoods in San Francisco and Montreal, we felt that we had tried many of the signature dishes that make this food so enjoyable. During our recent trip to Hong Kong, we had the good fortune to go on the Hello Hong Kong Tour, and it was a real eye opener. At First, my wife and I were a bit reluctant to try some of the local dishes, but our guide was very patient, and she told us where we were going and what they would serve, so we always felt comfortable and there were no disappointments. Some of the places we visited were coffee shops and bakeries, but the owners and waiters took pride in what they offered and they couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming, encouraging us to sample their specialties. In addition to the restaurants, we visited a traditional Chinese medicine shop where we observed the dispensing of many natural products including herbs and roots that have been in use for thousands of years. Many of these treatments have just begun to gain acceptance in the West, and it was interesting to observe how ailments are treated using one of the world\u2019s oldest forms of alternative medicine. We also spent some time visiting a few different parts of the city, and our guide was very knowledgeable, explaining the history of Hong Kong and pointing out how the old city and the new metropolis coexist while the city is continually reinventing itself. I would recommend Laura\u2019s service to anyone who wants to experience a truly amazing cultural immersion."

The historical part of the tour which focused on medicinal food in Hong Kong's culture was a personal highlight, as was Dim Sum in the Lin Heung Tea House. Would totally recommend this for any tourist or group but it was particularly helpful for me because, as a newcomer, I definitely needed a helping hand with what to do/see in this fantastic place."

I went with a friend and we loved the fact that we could take in some of the sights and sounds of the city whilst in a party mood. Drinks, music and good company made for an awesome night. Cost was never an issue, Laura the guide was brilliantly keen to make sure everyone was having a good time. If you want to enjoy HK by night, and want the party to come to you jump on the Tram Party."

I was in Hong Kong for only three days and got it recommended by a friend and it was just everything I could have wished for. Laura the tour guide is originally from the UK but was extremely knowledgeable about Hong Kong, its culture and history. What was really nice was that it felt more like a friend showing us their favourite sights and food spots in their city than some tired tour guide who did this thousands of times and just told us what they had learned by heart and told so many times.The sightseeing was a lot of fun and all the food was just amazing. I was especially amazed by the egg tarts we got for dessert. I have never been a big fan of asian egg custards (or any egg custards for that matter), but this one was simply heavenly and we even got the recipe for this famous hong kong dish. Can't wait to try this one out at home!"

The guide was really kind and explained us really slowly and clearly. Even she taught us some vocaburalies :) We tried Dim Sum, Jasmin Tea,Steamed chicken and mushroom wrapped in bean curd,Rice noodle rolls with BBQ pork,Steamed sticky rice wrapped in Lotus Leaf with minced meat etc etc and Egg tart was my favorite!!!! We could get a recipe of the tart too!!! We are gonna try to bake it in Japan !! We also went to an old chinese medicinal shop and it was first time for us to know about traditional medicine. It was interesting. The city view was great. It was different from Tokyo. We are really surprised that the guide knows a lot about history and the great place to go!!! We were very satisfied with this tour and we highly recommended to people who wants to learn English :) The guide will help you to explain with easy words and easy expression!!!"

We now have a great all round experience of traditional local cuisine and a lot of information along the way about local culture and history. We started with breakfast in a dim sum restaurant in Sheung Wan, tasting and trying several types of dim sum, both savoury and sweet, pastry, dumplings and crispy sweetness,all so interesting and contrasting. Between tastes of food and drink we visited markets, Chinese medicine stores, old and new, sitting down again for a wanton noodle soup taste combination, delicious. A little more walking and then came the surprising experience of milk tea and yin yang - I couldn't have imagined the tea tasting so good, but it did, lovely and strong and hot. The coffee and tea mix was also good, just very different. A short tram ride away and our next foodie treat was roast meat, quickly turned around in a noisy and crowded ground floor street cafe, ushered in by smiling faces and a very warm welcome, the barbecue meat just melted in the mouth and had so many delicious flavours my brain couldn't keep up. An experience in itself not to be missed. Coming to the end of the tour we went into the popular Tai Cheong bakery for the famous warm egg custard tart, which we ate in the sunshine on a roof top of a restored tenement block now called the Pawn. Every step of the tour was full of cultural and historical information, all absolutely fascinating. This is a tour for anyone who wants to experience unabridged Hong Kong living, rather than a tourist edit."

            "review": "Hong Kong tram tour/party. I recently visited Hong Kong for a holiday with some friends to visit my older brother who's living out there. He couldn't put us all up but the hostel we stayed in was ok and had some posters up advertising this tour. 3 hours music & free flow booze, old tram ride around Hong Kong. A bit different!So one night when he was stuck at work us boys decided to give it a go. It seemed a bit expensive at first (590 HKD, about 45-50 quid) as we were all on a budget, but unless you manage to hit all the happy hour bars in a row then drinking in Hong Kong isn't exactly cheap anyway, so we figured we would get our money's worth! Plus it was a different way to see all the buildings lit up (the tour was an evening thing, 7-10pm) which we never would have done otherwise but was very cool. It's a really crazy city at night! Also we got discounts at a bar in Lang Kwai Fong after it all finished so it was actually really good value in the end.The two girls that ran it were really nice, had lots of booze (beers, wines, spirits etc.) and there was a good bunch of people on board. Good way to meet people actually.... we had a great night out after with a few of them!!I'd definitely recommend this if you're visiting Hong Kong and have a free night. One thing to mention, no toilet on board but we stopped a couple of times so no real issue"

We had as much booze as we could handle and the music was pumping! The other party in LKF was so much fun too - we partied into the early hours. Very well organised, our guide was great fun too. All round good night and value for money. We would recommend to anyone who is in town for a few nights and wants to see and make the most of the nightlife. Thanks Hello Hong Kong!!"

We have lived in HK for 3 years but had never done a Night Bus/Tour, as it was a bit cold for Junk season and as we had friends in town we decided to it would be a good way to show them HK (and have a few drinks in the process).Tour was great, our mates were really impressed. It started just before 7, our hosts (Laura I think and another girl), was great fun, pointed out things that we didn't know about HKDrinks were free flowing and a really good selection (as it was cold, stuck mainly to wine and spirits).After about 3hrs ended back at the starting point in the Western District. Minibus took as all to LKF, had work the next day unfortunately, grabbed my free drink and then had to head home.We actually left our friends out, i think they crawled in about 5, so i reckon they had a pretty good time"
