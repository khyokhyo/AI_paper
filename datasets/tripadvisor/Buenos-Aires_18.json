The frames on their paintings are of equal beauty. A definite must see. Be careful not to cross the marked lines in front of the paintings as you will be reminded by the guards..."

If you're walking down around the Recoleta area and you have a few moments to spare, check out this free (a word you'll hear often in Buenos Aires) gallery with some interesting art. It lacks information in other languages, but it should be fine. Great for a quick visit and a place to sit down for a while."

If you go on Sunday afternoon, walk through the crafts fair in Plaza Francia, which is the park adjacent to Recoleta Cemetery, then right across the street to this large, coral-colored museum.After going up the stairs or ramp and entering the museum, immediately turn right and enter the galleries with priceless paintings and statues.The museum of free, but consult the Internet for hours. Their gift shop is closed on Sundays. I would go back to Buenos Aires just to wander around the first floor again!Two amusing things: A male guard slept in a chair next to the Zubaran painting. A different guard sat playing with his phone all the time! Security anyone?"

I went with my husband and his family after we walked around the Recoleta cemetery. Entry into the museum is free, which is always a great thing. The first floor housed paintings, sculptures, and decorative pieces from multiple centuries. A whole room was devoted to French Impressionists. They even had a private collection which had even more French impressionist paintings! We also enjoyed seeing art from Argentinian artists, as well as a special exhibit with optical illusions. All in all, I would highly recommend visiting this museum if you are in Buenos Aires!"

The museum houses artwork--mostly paintings with some sculpture--from the 14th century onward. The collection is arranged in a temporal pattern and by simply walking from room to room one is walking through time, able to see the changes in patterns and fashions of painting. As the collection enters the 19th and 20th century, there's a growing representation of art from Argentinian artists, which makes and interesting contrast to the artists I've been more familiar with (as a US citizen, much of the art I've been exposed to has been of European or US origin). Some highlights for me include a number of fascinating pieces by Rodin, some good examples of Impressionism, and several of the more modern pieces that reflect the tension between figurative and abstract art that played out in the 20th century. Also, the museum is free!"

It was one of the best collections of impressionist and romantic works that I've come across since returning from Europe, and outside of the main gallery, there's one room specifically dedicated to Goya. While the museum focuses a good deal on European work, they're currently housing an exhibition on the political framework of Latin America (the works of Rivera, Sisquiero, and Orozco). Not only is it free, but I personally found it more alluring than MALBA. You could spend all day inside and not feel like you saw everything."

All in all, I really enjoyed the museum. And a great plus is that the museum is free! PS - It took me about 2 hours to go through the whole museum - it is a fairly large collection."

While the tour did move slowly spending quite a bit of time at each piece of art, he did a fine job discussing select pieces of argentine art in the gallery and gave us a strong sense of the factors influencing argentine art over the years. Good option for a rainy day. The important European pieces in the gallery are few. There is an interesting room of modern art. The museum building is lovely and well maintained.

It free to enter and the collection is amazing of both Argentinian artists and international artists. I think it requires more than one visit and I'm goin back soon. There's no cafe in the museum but a couple of great restaurants behind."

At least this place is well air conditioned in a city which can be very humid.The works of art may not be top class, but there's enough choice to spend one or two hours and admire the very fair cross section of world Art. Many of the works could have been improved in their presentation by better lighting, but do not despair the trip here, in a very central but un crowded part of the City was worth while"

No plans of the museum were available, and so visiting the galleries was very hit or miss. We'd been there before and were still puzzled. Worth a visit just for the battle paintings by Camilio Lopez, who lost an arm in the wars of the late 19th century but managed to convey with paint what war is like. (To the right in the entrance hall) - Warning - in the area there are thieves who specialize in squirting you with salad dressing or the like and then offering to help you clean up, allowing them to steal your belongings. Even though we knew about this for years it happened ot us today. Just pay attention as you walk in tourist areas and don't let anyone get very close to you, even if you have to stop cold and make them go past."

By the 3rd room, I was bug eyed as every single painting was done by a painter I recognized. Furthermore, entire rooms were credited to private collections, donated upon the death of the patron. Several Rodin sculptures graced one room and here I saw my first 2 \"live\" Bouguereau.

Almost all of the Impressionists are represented (Van Gogh, Pizzaro, Cassat, Monet, Renoir,Manet, etc). Miro, Picasso, Kline,Klee, and Jackson Pollock head up numerous cubists and neo modernist painters. Gauguin's Tahitian ladies stand out too!! Rodin and other famous sculptor artists are well represented. Italian and Flemish artists from 1300s up to 1600s are in the mix of painters, including famous Rennaisance artists such as Raphael. There is a very large roomful collection of Peter Paul Rubens. Rembrandts and Van Halls among others have some fine works here. There are many Goyas. Degas here along with Millet, Corot and Leger. There is also a large collection of Argentine artists shown particularly on the third floor. We saw over 100 Robert Plate paintings. I am going strictly on memory here and no doubt I have left out some very famous artists (Modigliani and Rousseau just came to mind)."

(Plus, the air conditioning was a warm welcome!)I'll be the first to admit that I'm no art connoisseur. For me, this museum had a wonderful array of European and Argentinian artists, ranging from the 19th century (per museum literature; downstairs) to modern art (upstairs).I found the collection a good refresh and brush up on history, particularly on Argentina's own past, which I did not know about. There's a very interesting room of old Spanish/Argentinian \"how to\" diagrams ... depicting everything ranging from how to ford a river to how to catch ducks whilst riding a horse and using a stick with a noose. Due to other plans, we only spent an hour there which was too rushed. I think 2 to 2.5 would be more comfortable. Signing is predominantly only in Spanish (which is fair enough)."

A beautiful Rodin statue welcomed us to one room, a Van Gogh windmill I've never seen before, a colorful Cezanne girl, elegant Degas ballerinas and some beautiful historical and detailed work by Argentinian artists. Take your time, sit down and enjoy this museum, at least two hours. Within walkable distance from many Recoleta hotels, near cemetary."

If you are on the painful Hop on/off bus, get off at the Flower stop (stop 15) and walk across the park to the Museum. This will save you having to do all the stops until you get to the Museum (stop 23) - so a good 45 minutes would be saved, Definitely, worth a visit.!"

The collection is a fraction of the quantity and quality of any of the major European art museums (Rijksmuseum, Louvre, Prado, the Vatican, etc), but it would be unfair to expect and hold this museum to such an international standard.This is a free museum that is definitely worth a quick stroll through, to see if you find a work or two from your favorite artist, or maybe discover a new artist that catches your eye.

Modern art is also adequately represented. A well organized and very good museum that recognizes its important cultural role by having free admissions.

It is middle-sized, so the complete tour can be made in a single (long) visit and it is well organized, with human sized rooms each with its own topic. The Museum covers an extensive diversity of periods and styles from European 16th Century to Argentinian recent works. Explanations are succinct but to the point and not pretentious, additional information is available via your smartphone for a number of items. The first floor is mostly European with works from all great artists from Rembrandt to Picasso and from Monet to Rothko (admittedly only one or two of each and not their masterworks but still an impressive coverage). Rodin is also present with a number of sculptures. The second, and small third, floors are mostly Argentinian, with works of various interest but still quite educative. We loved the unstressed atmosphere and pleasant visit: this an excellent stop in Buenos Aires. Entry is free, a nice restaurant is on the back (sponsored by a German carmaker!)"

First, I admit I've been fortunate to visit some extraordinary art museums in the U.S. And Europe, so my perspective may be skewed. There are many nice paintings by unfamiliar Renaissance and 19th century painters. There are some excellent sculptures by Rodin as well. However, the museums organization can be confusing as one gallery does not necessarily flow logically into another and several \"dead end\" small galleries have radically different types of art from the large galleries to which they are attached. I did enjoy the Pueyrron gallery with works by a native-son of Argentina. Bottomline: don't expect a world class collection but enjoy it for what it is."

The second floor contained a temporary photography exhibit. Things are presented in chronological order. The museum is well laid out and presented. Lighting is beautiful.There is no/limited air conditioning, so the interior can be very warm. The day we were there it was in the 80's (at least).There is not as much South American art as we had hoped but what is there is very nice and interesting.If this review is helpful then please indicate so below."

I reported last year on this, the most important of BA museums, but wanted to write now again to alert you to a couple of special museum exhibitions that I am sure you would enjoy. The special exhibitions are on till the end of February to the middle of March [see below]. When you plan your visit, please note that the museum will be closed from February 3 till February 13 [inclusive], to complete some unexpected maintenance work. While the purpose is to highlight the special exhibits, no write up on the museum is complete without at least a few words about the permanent collection which is simply excellent. In addition to works by such prominent painters as Manet, Monet, Pissarro, Picasso, Gauguin, Giudici, Van gogh, Gola, Goya, el Greco, modigliani, S\u00edvori, XUL Solar and many others, there are also collections of the work of the famous Argentinean artists Prilidiano Pueyrred\u00f3n and Antonio Berni. The permanent collection in the third hall, Sala 3, was graciously donated by the descendants of Mr. Alfredo Hirsch and his wife Mrs. Lisa Gottschalk de Hirsch. The art work is primarily European from the 16th and 17th Century. Many items are absolutely fabulous [including a magnificent cabinet]. The collection also includes two portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Hirsch. I always start by visiting Sala 3 and move on to Sala 10, the French art of the XIX century, and Federico Leloir\u2019s \u201cLa Toilette de Venus\u201d. Then I find myself drawn to Sala 11, Italian art of the XIX century, and Giacomo Favretto\u2019s \u201cM\u00fasicos Ambulantes\u201d, Emilio Gola\u2019s \u201cEl Naviglio de Mil\u00e1n\u201d and \u201cI Giusti\u201d by Augusto Ferrari. In Sala 16, the European art of the XIX century there is Jean Jacque Henner\u2019s \u201cPaysanne\u201d. Last, but not least, in Sala 24, the Argentinean art of the XIX century is exhibited among which are two haunting paintings; Ernesto de la C\u00e1rcova\u2019s \u201cSin Pan Y Sin Trabajo\u201d and Reynaldo Giuici\u2019s \u201cLa Sopa de los Pobres\u201d. In addition to the permanent collection, the museum will typically have at any time two to three special exhibitions. At this time, the museum has the following three exhibitions that are really worth visiting.The first exhibition is of work by \u201cEl Greco\u201d on the occasion of the 400 anniversary of the death of the painter and is very worth seeing. If you prefer, you can also book yourself on a guided visit [guided visits are on from Tuesday to Sunday at 4pm]. The exhibits are found in halls 5, 7, 15 and 21. There is also a short TV program \u201cEl Greco \u2013 Painter of the invisible\u201d in Sala 7. The treasure of this collection is the \u201cthe tears of San Pedro\u201d lent by the museum of Toledo in Spain. The exhibition finishes March 1, 2015.The second exhibition is a collection of art work entitled \u201cThe Fatal Seduction \u2013 erotic imaginations from the XIX century\u201d. Despite the provocative nature of the topic, the exhibition curator [Laura Malosetti Costa] tastefully put the exhibition together such that at no time did one feel offended. There are over 65 paintings and sculptures in addition to many engravings by European and Argentinean artists. Much of the work was exhibited in this museum and other works were borrowed from other museums in Argentina to complete the exhibition. The works are arranged under different categories such as erotica and violence, nudes, fatal seducers and others; allowing the visitor an overall view of the western erotica. The exhibition is meant to throw a different light on the subject matter and to help the visitor to judge and appreciate the topic in general and the collection in particular. The exhibition finishes March 15, 2015. WELL DONE!! You may also be interested to learn that the general topic of \u201cAmor\u201d is presented in a couple of other museums. In particular the exhibition in the \u201cCasa Nacional Del Bicentinario\u201d [on Riobamba Street] under the name \u201cEnamorar, el amor en movimiento\u201d exhibits and covers all kinds of love. This includes love for God, the country, the family, the party, of food, marriage, reproduction, seduction, erotic love and others. It is actually quite comprehensive. You may want to visit it while the Art Museum is being maintained. Or you can wait for my report on it over the next couple of weeks. The Third exhibition is a collection of pictures entitled \u201cLATINOAM\u00c9RICA, Galer\u00eda de Im\u00e1genes\u201d and donated to the museum by Sara Facio, an Argentine photographer, known for her photographs of various cultural Argentine figures including Argentine writers Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Mar\u00eda Elena Walsh and others. She was born in 1932, and currently lives in San Isidro outside Buenos Aires. This collection of photographs is her collection over the past 50 years. There are 172 pictures some of which are quite interesting. Please do not forget that the museum will be closed till February 13, opening February 14. And that the special exhibitions will end early March as mentioned above. Enjoy!"

You really need to focus only on the ground floor that is quite well laid out and easy to follow with a guide map; nothing useful in English is available. The overall quality of the collection is not that expected of a great city, but it is a cut above what you will see in the provincial cities of major European countries, and covers many periods and styles of European art quite effectively. Best represented are the French Impressionists (some superb Sisleys, Manets and Degas canvasses); Post-impressionists (notably Gauguin and Cezanne); the Spanish School (Zurbaran, Goya and Ribera, but a special exhibition devoted to El Greco included 2 brilliant works in the museum\u2019s own collection); and some impressive sculptures by Rodin (spread over several rooms and not easy to locate) and Bourdelle. There is little of note from the Italian Renaissance, Germany, or Britain ( apart from a Raeburn portrait), and of the great Dutch and Flemish masters, I recall only a single rather dubious painting by Rembrandt and Rubens whose authentication I would worry about. One wing, and a kind of mezzanine ascended by a small staircase, carry a great many Argentinian paintings that I did not find of great interest; merely fashionable and competent, and nowhere near the fresh artistic insights to be seen among the country\u2019s contemporary painters as evident in the MALBA . The furniture and craft works displayed in parallel seemed to me to offer more interest and national identity. Photography and administration take up most of the floor above, so that 90 \u2013 120 minutes should see you through, and one of the attractions is that admission is free."

Dutch and Flemish masters, like Rembrandt and his students, Rubbens, Frans Hals, and modern painters like Pissarro, Van Gogh (earlier work), Sisley, Monet, Toulouse Lautrec, Degas, Renoir, and Gauguin are on display. Opposing European masters, the museum displays many Latin-American artists. Paintings of Angel Della Valle, like the La vuelta del mal\u00f3n from 1892 stood out for us in January 2015. Mastering the Spanish language is necessary because the museum provides almost no English translation. The photography on the second level is interesting."

Our opinion is that the Argentinian artists are the most interesting pieces though there is a big El Greco exhibit that is pretty special. Much of the museum is arrange by donor, so all the pieces that were donated by a single individual or family are together and that is a little odd as the works tend to be all over the map in terms of style, artist, era. There is one VanGogh that would have made the trip worthwhile. I've never seen it or any like it before."

What a treat! From the gorgeous traveling exhibit of original sculptures by Rodin (including, much to our surprise, his world-famous \"The Kiss\"), to an eclectic and prodigious formerly-private-collection of European, Argentinian and Chinese pieces (look for the photos of the art as it originally was displayed in the family's home), to more recent Argentine art, this museum kept the attention of our party of five (three adults and two kids ages) for over two hours.Despite the rain, or perhaps because of it, the museum was mostly empty. We were able to see known-and-lesser-known works by some of the impressionist masters without having to jostle elbows with other visitors. Our 15 year old daughter was thrilled with the room dedicated to Degas, and our 11 year old son spent a good amount of time peering in to the almost-side-scroll-comic-book-like military history paintings by Argentine artist Candido Lopez.The second floor happened to be closed today (maybe all of this month?), so we found that the museum was just the right size. Weekend non-winter hours are 9:30 AM to 8:30 PM. It's free of charge. There's an English language tour on Tuesdays at 1 PM."

Quite frankly, while this was a good museum, it was significantly less impressive than some of the recent museums I have visited such as the ones in Detroit and Chicago. However, this is still quite a nice place and the fact that it was free made it a worthwhile stop.The paintings were fairly limited as they were mostly European impressionist works. But there were several renowned artists represented such as Manet, Degas, Van Gogh and others. There were some lovely decorative arts on display as well and a small room on the upper level dedicated to graphic arts. I was especially intrigued with the display of local artists, many of which were quite good. This display of Argentinian artists was of particular note because it was something unlikely to be seen anywhere else.Overall, my assessment was that this was a very good museum and is definitely worth visiting if you are an art aficionado. But I don't think it lived up to the ceremonious build-up I saw, especially in the quantity and variety of works on display. If you are just a casual art fan, it might not be worth going out of the way. Still, I thought it was a pleasant two or three hours of browsing. It's worth noting that the building itself was also impressive and one might appreciate the architecture as much as the art work inside."

I spend a month once a year in Buenos Aires and I always visit the Museum of fine Arts, to greet once more my favourite pictures. International visitors should not expect to find the utmost expressions of Impressionism in this Museum or in any other in Latin America, the best Impressionists are at the Quai d'Orsay, and the most famous museums in Europe and the States. The small Impressionists collection owned by the Museo de Bellas Artes is a bequest from the Santamarinas, argentinian collectors. As private collectors they didn't possess the most famous specimens. It's more convenient to see the argentinian painters and the temporary exhibitions. Last time I went there was one from Pio Collivadino, he was the first \"urban painter\" in the country, it is very moving to see the way he has depicted poor neighbourhoods and poor people. There is no fee for this attraction but it would be nice to buy some Bonos Contribuci\u00f3n. There is an elevator but when I was there it didn't work (it might happen), anyway, the Museum has only two levels."

This museum houses a nice international collection with works by Rubens, Van Gogh, Rodin, Goya, Rembrandt, Monet and others. The collection of works by Argentinian painters was, based on my expectations, very limited - I was definitely hoping for more and was a bit disappointed in the relatively small collection. I have many opportunities to see the great European painters and was looking forward to the Argentinian works. Do manage your expectations if you visit. It is a lovely museum and the works are well displayed. Additionally, and much appreciated, there is a great deal of information about the history of the museum and the collections."

On a reasonably nice day in April, the place was stifling and I worry that the art is going to suffer over time. They have one room of ancient art which is air conditioned and closed off with glass doors so they know that temperature is a factor. Why they leave the other art to the elements I can't understand. Well worth seeing are the fabulous Argentinian ladies' hair combs, many tortoise shell and some the size of peacock tails."

They are right to say it's free (a plus), a bit hard to find, and that the supply of info - both printed and via the museo personnel - is rather scanty. They're also right that the Euro collection (mostly Hirsch collection, I think) is - especially by Latin American standards - good and varied: from Renaissance thru to C19, including Goya, Van Gogh, etc. Also the Rodin. And, right now, a special exhibition of some fairly awful (recent) pictures of the heroes of Latin American Independence, chiefly notable for the sheer quantity of multi-coloured oil paint piled onto the canvas. But when we visited (Sept. 2013) the whole Argentine art section, which is what we most wanted to see, was closed ('for renovation'); and, while the big placard out front of the museo made some upbeat ref. to improvement being undertaken by the state, etc.., the timetable there did not conform to what the rather gloomy guide told us (and we speak Spanish, so no misunderstanding seems likely), i.e., that the 'renovation' had been going on, and wd go on, for some time (years, I think). Yet some recent visitor claims to have seen the Argentine art section in the last few weeks . . At any rate, it's worth a visit for the Euro collection, but comparisons with the NY Met or London National Gallery are wildly flattering."

A note on its location (as some foreign visitors complain that the museum is not easy to find): on 1473 Libertador Avenue, just opposite Plaza Francia (Francia Square). Floralis Generica is on the left handside of the entry to the museum. On the official website, the explanations of how to get to the museum are clear. Now for the treasures you can enjoy: Italian and Flemish renaissance collections to the Impressionist works by Manet, Gaugin, Renoir, Degas, Goya oils, Rembrandt, Monet, Vincent Van Gogh, Antonio Berni, Benito Quinquela Mart\u00edn, Antonio Segu\u00ed, Rodin sculptures (including \"The Kiss\"). What else can you ask? Absolutely breathtaking!Sometimes temporarily expositions are available. However, the real treasure is the permanent collection.I agree with a previous reviewer that reviewing art is highly subjective. However, the quality of the works in the museum is undeniable. Excellent to have a first-hand appreciation of some Art masters. Should be included in the \u201cmust see\u201d list. Spacious, with well laid out halls and a modern looking rear area.Guided tours: information on the official website.I would definitely recommend it. Superb!Free. The timing hours are not that convenient. The museum should revise this.

The Latin American art was also not all that interesting -- up through around the late 1800s. It was fine, but I don't think this is a must-see (MALBA and Museo de Artes Plasticas de Sorvini fall into that category, for me)."

As someone else here mentioned, it's not all that easy to find and is kind of tucked away. I actually ended up at the University Law School building, an imposing Greco-Roman edifice nearby, thinking it was the museum. After finally getting my bearings, I was pressed for time and thought I would just take a brief walk through. Wow, what a mistake. As one who majored in Art History, I was blown away by the quality of the work housed in this museum. A room full of Goya oils was absolutely breathtaking. The quality of the works, from the Italian and Flemish renaissance collections to the Impressionist works by Manet, Gaugin, Renoir, Degas, etc was unsurpassed and worthy of an entire day of appreciation. There were so many important pieces that I had studied and to see them firsthand was inspiring. I would have never thought this was a \"must see\" museum, but I would definitely recommend it now and urge anyone travelling to Buenos Aires to stop and experience its offerings."

I don't get the opportunity to experience international art very often so was looking forward to the Rembrandts, Monet, Corot and Manet . the art didn't disappoint me. The Argentinian collection was very interesting. My main issue was the frustration with the museum itself. There were no maps, visitor guides or guided tours. We thought we might've come through a back entrance as no signage or assistance from the staff we asked. The only time we got any response from the staff was when my husband leaned to close to an artwork. I still recommend going but hope others experience isn't as frustrating and confusing."

If you are looking for a museum full of Argentinian artists, this is not the place to visit, but there are plenty of others in the city. This museum, while not covering my favorite period of history, is nevertheless excellent, especially if you are fond of 18-19 century European art. We've been twice already and may go back before we leave BA (the fact that it is free factor in, but I think it has more than Malba, even though Malba covers some of my favorite periods somewhat).It has work beginning at about 16th C forward. It is very well laid out to take you through their collection. They have some amazing pieces that I just sit and stare at for while. My one complaint, which is the reason for 4 stars rather than 5, is that it is poorly lit in some areas, making it hard to fully appreciate certain works."

Religious artifacts (that we personally do not care about) along with El Greco and other works of fantastic art. They have at least a few works of every master: from Rembrandt (given that it was attributed to him) to Van Gogh. Room after room on the first floor awaited surprise after surprise. We loved our almost 2 hours in this small museum. Upstairs was a photographic exhibit which honestly we did not care about and the Botero exhibit was fine too. But the real treasure is their permanent collection and how they exhibit it. Also, the entrance is free. They open at 12:30 PM. Yes, it is Argentina after all. And they remain open till 8 PM."

The place is very big compared other national art museums, (I love the Smithsonian Art Galleries), but it is worth it for those who enjoy art.

Even so, if you have been to any of the major art museums in Europe or NYC, do not bother with this unless you have time to kill. The rooms are poorly lit and ventilated (especially in summer), and do not do justice to the handful of masters that are in display. It's possible I visited at a bad time, when they were preparing for some temporary exhibitions upstairs - but that is pure speculation on my part, since there was no information available."

Those massive tapestries/carpets hanging from the walls are amazing - just how did they make them? For those more familiar with art many of the artists will be familiar. But even we recognised both the style and the names of the likes of Manet, Monet, Rodin, Toulouse Lautrec, Vincent Van Gogh & Gauguin. In a large separate hall was a photographic exhibition depicting Buenos Aires life across the ages. Very interesting and it gave a great feel for times gone by. Check your coat - the museum was like a sauna it was so hot."

Full to the brim with exquisite Rodin sculptures, French impressionists known and less familiar, Italian and South American artists, this is a must. A beautiful collection-well set out with the added and interesting challenge of translating the Spanish commentaries ( surely not too much to ask for any culture and art lover-get to know the country you are visiting!) you will not go wrong here. I am frankly amazed at some of the comments I have read-depressing to reawhile the flower of so much of all we revere is so easily discounted. Fellow reviewers, get a grip and visit, having spent an hour or so in the fantastic cemetery nearby."

The only minus I would give the museum is that the space provided for many of the European paintings was not afforded for the Argentinian and Spanish paintings. It felt rather cramped seeing them bunched together in places. Overall this a wonderful museum and how can you beat the price?"

From here you move into the 'contemporary' art section featuring optical illusion works and electrically powered gizmos from the 1920's to 70's. Light interference patterns, giant lenses etc were all here. If you like lava lamps, this is the kind of place you will enjoy. Two quick tips: you need a passport or photo Id to get the English audio guide- we missed out on account of this.

I was actually amazed at the breadth and depth of the collection. It was presented in a very standard, professional museum way typical for an art museum. We, however, were less than impressed by the attention given to visitor services. We were not warmly welcomed, a guard barely nodded in our direction and made a directive about no photographs in the museum. There was no map of the museum so we already felt lost. We were finally pointed to the beginning point and once there discovered that many of the labels had the headphone sign that usually means an audio tour. My partner went looking for it, since all of the labels were in Spanish only and we wanted to know more about the collection. Instead of having an area set up in the lobby to handle this, he had to search through the museum until he finally found a \"gift shop\" area where he could rent them. It was cheap and it was well worth the hunt! The audio guide is well done for most of the galleries. However, at the end, they have made some changes to their exhibitions and have not updated the audio guide - so it was a bit confusing. Another thing we noted was that most of the secuity personnel hovered in dark corners, did not smile and in some cases were sleeping instead of engaging with the visitors (there were a number of school children there). All that being said, it was a fantastic museum with a fine collection of Masters from around the world."

The Rodin sculptures were breathtaking nor did we expect to see a Van Gough so far from home, to name but a few delights of this museum. We stumbled upon the fact they had audio support which we paid to experience and glad we had. Our only initial disappointment was the minimal amount of South American art but sadly we discovered after the fact that it was all on the second level. Unfortunately we are not Spanish speakers and if there was any complaint of this museum is the fact that there is not enough information of what is on offer in languages other than Spanish.Great gift shop which was a nice little bonus."

I can't get enough of the paintings and the history of Latin America. Of course you can go to the city for some shopping, but should never forget culture. The place is very well organized within its three floors ( second is closed 'till July 2012). It's collection of Argentinian painters is something not to be missed as well as its Gauguin, Renoir and other masters.One of my favorites is Ernesto de la C\u00e1rcov's painting called \" Sin pan y sin trabajo\". Its sad, strong and portraits despair, but its unique. Don't miss it."

Despite the size of the building, the collection is small enough to fully absorb without being overwhelmed. The museum can be rather warm during the heat of the day, so if you are there during the summer, you may want to visit in the morning. There is no fee to visit."

They have a spanish and an English version of it. It is beautifully illustrated and it is a nice souvenir of your visit. They ask you to leave your bag at the door but I can guarantee you that I've had no problem whatsoever. I had money, cards, a camera in there and nothing went missing. The collection is astounding. Renoir, Rembrand,Corot,Modigliani, L\u00e9ger,Rouault,El Greco,Degas, Pissaro,Gauguin,Fantin-Latour,Courbet.....There is also Argentinian art of the early 20 th century. On the second floor they have Argentinian and international photography and a sculpture terrace. A wonderful place to see if you are an art lover. And don't miss Plaza Francia across the street with it's beautiful trees and wonderful sculpture."

In all my travels through 5 continents and many museums, I have NEVER been asked to leave my PURSE anywhere. In my opinion, this is equivalent to asking for a man's wallet! We thought this was unreasonable and left rather than risk losing any of our valuables. So, if you visit this museum, don't bring your purse/bag or ensure all your valuables can fit in your pockets. I don't know if they'd force you to check in your jacket too."

Since it's free you can't really complain. The trip for us however ended up costing $60. When we entered the Museum we had to check our bags at the security desk, I made of mistake of leaving some of our bigger ($250 Pesos) in the bag. Our money didn't get stolen outright, it would've been better if it had been. The \"security\" desk swapped our cash (which was from the ATM) with fake currency! We tried to pay a cab fare with it immediately after the Museum and we were denied, we checked the currency with local businesses not really understanding the cab driver and they told us the same thing. With our limited spanish we really couldn't do much so we just chalked it up as a loss! ...In conclusion, visit the Museum but be careful about what you check at the security desk."

Having been to Paris and Berlin for my last two big trips, I thought that I would let my normally busy art-mind rest here in BA. After a week of urban life, however, I was ready to get some art in and settle myself a bit. Taking a taxi here from Palermo took only a few minutes, about $5 USD. Entering the museum and starting with the galleries to the right, I was immediately impressed. Here you will see works by all of the usual European masters, but you have not seen these works, before. Also, the painting are hung very well in well design galleries. I spent two hours here, on a Sunday morning, and had the place largely to myself. It was an excellent experience!  Afterwards, I walked just a couple of blocks to the craft fair at Plaza San Martin de Tours, which I also enjoyed very much. Good quality crafts here and a good place to buy a gift or two. The park was filled with locals enjoy themselves, cafes nearby, street performers. Another block brought me to the cemetery, also good. Really a great little outing, before catching the 10 bus back to the zoo. All relaxed and sane, very nice. Enthusiastically, I recommend this museum!"

I started off on the first floor and saw the impressionist European masters. My advice is, if you've been to Europe or the US and have seen Monet, Degas, Van Gogh before - move quickly upstairs to the work of the Argentinian masters. There are many wonderful landscape paintings and portraits from previous centuries, but the Modern art section of the museum is truly not to be missed. Even if you are not generally \"in to\" modern art, I felt that viewing the works gave me a sense of the political and social issues that are important in Argentina today. Huge, excellent, intriguing, works."

Entrance is free, although an audio guide is available at the book store in the center of the museum on the ground floor for 35 Argentine pesos.The collection is roughly divided into two sections: a collection of Western/European art on the ground floor spanning five Centuries and including many Old Masters such as Rembrandt (or his workshop), Matisse, van Gogh, Monet, Rodin, etc. All of these are covered on the audio guide. Highlights for me were the Rodin sculptures (personally donated by Rodin himself) and the Hirsch collection.I didn't fly 6,000 miles on a first trip to South America to just see European paintings, so I was happy to find the 2nd floor dedicated to Argentine and South American artists, including a whole room with pre-historic Columbian art. This was the highpoint of the experience for me as I was introduced to a whole group of artists previously unknown to myself. There seemed to be a bit of construction on the second floor as well, making the tour incomplete with several missing selections on the audio guide but this didn't detract from the overall experience.Definitely recommended for art fans."

            "review": "Rare Chance to view the19th & 20thC Argentine Masters. For art lovers, the Museo National des Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires houses a first rate collection. There are a surprising number of great impressionist works by Cezanne, Degas, Renoir, Monet and Gaugin among others, but works by these masters can been viewed in museums around the world. This is not to say that one should not also enjoy the European works on display at the MNBA, but the unique offering of this fine museum is the rare opportunity to see the work of great Argentine artists who are sparsely represented, if at all, in collections outside of Argentina. I was particularly impressed with the work of the late 19thC artists in gallery 105A, sala 33 on the Primer Piso. Take a good look at the three paintings by Angel Della Valle, La veulta del mal\u00f3n\u2014an extraordinarily powerful painting representing the desire of the native Indians of South America to take back their culture from the Christianizing Europeans. Notice the fierce visage of the leader on his charging horse holding high a captured crucifix, while on his right, one of his warriors has a captured white woman and on his left a warrior carries what looks like a captured briefcase from their white oppressors. This is an absolutely wonderful, unforgettable painting which attempts, through art, to bear witness to the rage of the indigenous peoples of the New World in their struggle for survival. Della Valle\u2019s other two paintings in this room are also inspired: the Gauchos a caballo c. 1900 with it suffused red composition and stark placement of men and horses is beautiful as is the El juego del pato, another scene of men and horses which Della Valle excels at depicting. While you are in sala 33, make sure to look carefully at the Eduardo Sivori paintings too, particularly the El despertar de la criada (Waking of the Maid). This is a masterpiece of light and shade. My wife particularly liked the Costurera, 1906, by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Terry which is also in sala 33.I would also suggest that you take a careful look too at the Bemberg Collection in sala 32 which contains the work of the Uruguayan painter, Pedro Figari. These are marvelous paintings from a true master. In addition, check out the Quiros gallery 105C, sala 35 for the Series \u201cLos Gauchos\u201d by Ces\u00e1reo Bernaldo De Quiros.You will come away from your experience of MNBA truly enriched with a real sense of the power, the beauty and wonder of Argentine painting at its best in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This museum offers so much that more than one trip is justified.If you love painting, take this rare opportunity to see the work of masters little known outside of South America. I assure you, you\u2019ll be rewarded."

It is a large collection that is open to the public. In October of 2008 the admission was free. This museum has several paintings from all over the world. Several paintings were from very well known artists. It takes a couple of hours to see the museum.Location:The museum is located in La Recoleta neighborhood within about a 10 minute walk from the cemetary. It is on the edge of the large park blocks where large green open recreational areas are located. Behind the museum to the side is a large pedestrian bridge over the highway and part of the university of BA.My Opinion:If you love or even just like art, it is well worth your 2 hours to see it. Leave a donation if possible."
