It's simply sidewalk art, accessible to those walking along the Danube on the Pest side, south of the parliament building.Even if you're not in the frame of mind to contemplate man's inhumanity to man, it's an interesting piece of art, which makes for a nice photo or two overlooking the river and the Buda skyline."

Budapest is a city filled with charming little statues, statues to local poets and foreign leaders and movie stars (like Reagan and Colombo) and every day people (like policemen). There are also large statues, like the St. Stephen's statue at Fishermen's Bastion and the huge statues at Hero Square. Several controversial monuments commemorate the time of WWII, most recently the Monument to the Victims of the German Invasion, which whitewashes the role of Hungary in the war. I felt that the inscription at the shoe monument was also vague, not referring to the Jews as the victims, and Hungarian members of the Arrow Cross as perpetrators. But of all the Monuments, this simple collection of bronze shoes by the river was the most touching we encountered. It really brings home the horror of the murder of innocent men, women and children in the gruesome way of shooting them by the side of the river in 1944-45. Well worth the visit to pay your respects. The monument is easy to find, just walk along the river between the Parliament and the Chain bridge and you can't miss it. Be careful not to cross the two lane highway right in front of the monument but at the light a little ways up the street."

Even some mothers were murdered with their sons.When the militants of Arrow Cross pulled the trigger, all the social class bubbles were bursted and tortured bodies fell into the Danube.

I could find it on no tourist maps, no tour books, there are no directional signs, and no one in authority whom I asked could direct me to it.

When you leave the Houses of Parliament go to the river and head towards down town (towards the Chain Bridge). After about a 1/8 of a mile you will come upon the shoes. They are bronzed and placed in a row. You will find a woman's shoes, a child's shoes and various other shoes. When I came to the family group I was deeply touched. There were the boots of a man, the shoes of a grown woman, the smaller boots of a young boy and the tiny shoes of a little girl. This is when it hit home. This was a real crime against real people. I recommend you take the time to see this. If we are to learn from the past and not repeat the injustice and inhumanity of this type of crime we need to see these types of memorials.

It commemorates the summary execution of Jews on the banks of the Danube in the closing months of World War II as Soviet Armies fought the Nazis for control of Budapest. It is worth having a good travel guide to completely comprehend the brutal and savage acts which this memorial commemorates. Apparently, the skeletons of those summarily executed here were discovered only recently during reconstruction and/or repair work on one of the Danube bridges. It took some time for forensic specialists to identify the bones and connect them to events in Budapest near the end of World War II. It is no place for selfies or a place to have your picture taken. It is a place to understand better the inhuman savagery of World War II and the Nazi regime and resolve to never let such things happen again."

As the Nazi retreated to the Buda side in advance of the Russian liberation, the Arrow Cross rounded up mainly Jews along the bank of the Danube and shot them point blank in the back of their heads so they'd fall forward into the Danube and wash away downstream. As the Memorial is close to many major hotels, near the Parliament, and takes a few moments of introspection, it should not be missed."

The victims were lined up and shot into the Danube River. They had to take their shoes off, since shoes were valuable belongings at the time.The memorial was created by Gyula Pauer, Hungarian sculptor, and his friend Can Togay in 2005. It contains 60 pairs of iron shoes, forming a row along the Danube. Each pair of shoes was modeled after an original 1940's pair. For more of an insight read 'One of Budapest's Most Moving Memorials: Shoes on The Danube'.The memorial is between the Parliament Building and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, by the Danube."

We just googled the history - This world-famous composition, which comprises 60 pairs of metal shoes set in concrete on the Danube embankment, was set up in the year 2005. It commemorates the Hungarian Jewish victims of the killings committed by the Arrow Cross militiamen, the pro-German, anti-Semitic, national socialist party members of Hungary in 1944-1945. The killings usually took place en masse - the victims were lined up at the embankment, and shot into the Danube, execution-style. At three separate places of the memorial, cast iron signs read in Hungarian, English and Hebrew: \"To the memory of victims shot into the Danube by Arrow Cross militiamen in 1944-45\". This is a very simple but very moving memorial."

The shoes are there in memory of them and the horrific acts that took place. Its just a bit further down the river front on the right hand side of the parliament (as you look at the front of it).

When it became evident that the Third Reich had lost control in Europe, Jews not sent to Death Camps were lined along the Danube and shot, their bodies summarily tossed into the river. The \u201cshoes\u201d are symbolic. True, those facing firing squads were forced to remove their shoes, but teeth were pulled for the gold fillings. Rings that couldn\u2019t be removed caused fingers to be lopped off, the bodies mutilated\u2014no dignity in death. Located along the Pest side of the Danube, between Chain Bridge and the incredible Parliament palace, these metal shoe replicas also reflect the genius of the sculptor. That person knew that the metal would rust, the patina suggesting the color of old leather. Erected on April 16, 2005 (depicted in the accompanying photo), these \u201cshoes\u201d appear to be of the style and age of the mid-1940s. There is description of what this memorial represents, other than a brief overview. It's necessary to research the symbolism and the atrocities of the Nazis' attempt at Jewish genocide to truly appreciate this memorial.Budapest is filled with outdoor art and sculptures. Take time to reflect on what this sculpture represents, and appreciate the beauty of the artistic representation of something so symbolic."

This is a simple but very effective memorial artwork, which I understand remembers Jews slaughtered in Budapest during the war and then thrown into the river (but their shows were not).It's a haunting and provoking image. It doesn't take long to look at but lasts with you for much longer. Makes you think about how easy it is to scapegoat foreigners or immigrants or those who are just different, and to dwell on the hidden darkness within humanity that comes out in dark twisted forms in unpredictable times and places. And to ponder how the easy cowardice of going with the herd allows this to happen. Sadly still seem all too relevant today.I wish they had some sort of information by it to mark its significance and explain the backdrop to those who do not know. It would be all too easy for people to stumble on this and mock it without knowing that, and its power to reach out is diminished as a result.I'd also warn parents with kids that this stretch of river promenade across from the Parliament area could be really dangerous. There are no barriers or railings to prevent people tripping into the deep, wide Danube. And if you did, the current is strong, there are no lifebuoys to throw in, and there are no or few steps to get out."

The majority were rounded up and sent to death camps or killed by other Hungarians - the arrow men militia. We were unaware of Hungarian history during the war and hadn't realised that they started out as nazi collaborators before changing sides as the end of the war approached. Hungary today still seems to want this part of their history put in the shadows, if not completely hidden. The shoes are a very simple but effective reminder of what humans can do to each other. We sat on the banks of the Danube surrounded by beautiful buildings with the shoes making a sunny day somber."

For a short stretch of about 50 yards on the bank of the Danube there are boots and shoes made of metal set into the concrete they are many sizes representing men ,women and children. They are symbolic of the action of the Nazis in WW2. Until 1944 Hungary had been allies of the Nazis, as Russian troops advanced Hungary switched sides or at least tried too. The result was that German troops invaded and took over the country and immediately started to transport mainly the Jews to the concentration camps such as Auschwitz on at least one occasion when Eichmann could not get enough trains they simply lined up men, women and children on the edge of the river bank and shot them so that they fell into the Danube. Thus we have a telling memorial to the horrors of war. It should make everyone pause for thought."

On the night of January 8 1945, dozens of Jews were lined up on the Eastern bank of the Danube and executed: there bodies fell or were dumped into the river. IN 2005, sculptor Gyula Pauer composed this monument, consisting of 60 pairs of shoes, made of iron and placed on the banks of the Danube at the approximate site of this horrendous event."

Before the Russians arrived at the end of WWII, many Jews were rounded up from their \"safe homes\" and marched to the edge of the Danube to be shot and thrown in. Some were not shot, but tied to those who were and pushed in to drown in an ice cold river to drown. During the time, the Duna's image changed for those who were left to live in the crumbling city. Instead of a place of beauty and pleasure, it was a place of death and immense sadness. I think to come on a cold cloudy day at dusk (most of the murders were done in the night) and stand among the shoes can help you connect a little with the starkness and tragedy of this time."

Dozens of pairs of bronze shoes (modeled after actual shoes from that time) are lined up along the Danube. It looks like the owners just stepped out of them. People come from all over the world to put flowers or light candles at the memorial. It is one of the most heart wrenching memorials of the war that I have seen.

The marker reads, \"To the memory of the victims shot into the Danube by arrow cross militiamen in 1944-45.\" Raises more questions than it answers, to my mind. What makes this installation particularly poignant is that people have added ribbons to the bronze shoes and surrounded some of the pieces with candles that obviously have been lit. This is a small but clearly impactful piece of public art. BUT BE WARNED! Getting there is NOT EASY and straight forward! If you don't go to the horse and rider statue that stands just below (south of) the Parliament Building and cross at the light there, you will risk having to cross a very dangerous road with no safety precautions for a long distance in each direction. This is not an easily accessible place - plan ahead."

The shoes are displayed along the Pest bank of the Danube River between the Chain Bridge and the Hungarian Parliament. There is a plaque on the floor stating what the shoes represent. The whole memorial is to represent those killed during the Arrow Cross Militiamen who were told to remove their shoes before being shot with their bodies to be taken by the Danube. Lots of thought has gone into this memorial and they have done it justice. I recommend seeing this memorial at dusk or in the evening as less people around and its hauntingly quiet."

It is hypocritical to allow the memorial and not mention Hungary 's own stake in the holocaust with the absence of the word \"jews\" on the plaque.

Erected 16 April 2005.\"The composition of the great Hungarian artist, Gyula Pauer, gives remembrance to the people shot into the Danube during the time of the Arrow Cross terror in 1945. The sculptor created sixty pairs of shoes out of iron. The Hungarian Jews were ordered to take off their shoes at the edge of the Danube and were shot into the water. It's very important to remember and to remind a dark period of our history to avoid similar periods in the future. Nowadays, the very right wing ideologies and parties get sronger worldwide, so it's more imortant to remind the result of this way. Nothing can be so strong memento like a great artwork! This monument is a shocking artwork. The artist, Gyula Pauer died in 2012. Walking on this Danube Promenade I remember him too."

When I was there, I noticed many people tried to take artistic photographs of the shoes. However, we should never forget the actual significant of those shoes. They are reminders that mankind could be so atrocious and cruel by taking innocent lives. We should be reminded that all men and women are equal and no one is above all.I also feel that the Hungarian Government should put up a notice or plaque near the display of shoes as reminder of the pain and suffering of the Jews."

This particular memorial, however, is heartbreakingly moving as it represents Jews who weren't \"lucky\" enough to make it onto a transport to one of the concentration camps (remember, few really knew what was in store for them at the end of these horrific train rides) because the Nazi's and Arrow Cross Party could not transport them fast enough due to the volume of people being forced out of Hungary. Instead, they marched these innocents to the bank of the Danube River, made them strip off their clothing and shoes and summarily shot them in the backs so as to push themselves into the river. The atrocities are horrifying and heartbreaking, and this quiet little monument will leave an indelible mark on one's memory. This monument is directly across the street from the enormous Parliament building along the bank of the Danube. So small it can be missed if you don't pay close attention.

The Shoes on the Danube memorial is a 5 minute walk from the house of parliament towards Chain bridge, and I actually visited prior to going on a tour of parliament which I also highly recommend. Once at the memorial you can expect to see 60 pairs of rusted period shoes cast out of iron in various styles and sizes representing those victims of the arrow cross militia (Hungarian Nazis), who in 1944-1945 were lined up by the Danube and were executed by firing squad so that they fell into the river and were washed away. A very moving memorial to these Holocaust atrocities, and definately worth stopping at these shoes to reflect on what was a dark part of human history."

It's 60 pairs of shoes, cast in iron, lined up along the river.It recognizes the horrible behavior of a Hungarian Nazi-sympathizer group that lined up thousands of Jews toward the end of World War II on the banks of the Danube, and shot them. Sometimes they tied people together and shot only one, so that they saved bullets but all three fell into the river. The site is immediately next to the Parliament building and requires only a 3-4 minute walk from the Parliament to see. It's a wonderful/moving example of how art can convey and produce deep emotion. I strongly recommend this monument. My only slight quibble is that there is not much of an explanation of what happened. You can go to various websites to learn more about what happened. TA prefers not to include links - but if you do a google search for Shoes on the Danube Memorial, you'll find several short, helpful discussions. Taking 3-5 minutes to one or more of these brief explanations. I'd urge people to visit this along with memorials to people who HELPED SAVE Jews, which you can find in the formerly Jewish ghetto district."

If you go to Szabadsag Ter ( Liberty Square), only a few hundred meters away, you will see the monument put up by the present Hungarian government blaming the Nazis for the persecution of the Jews, but also the people's protest to this rewriting and sanitising of Hungarian history, when it was the Fascist Horthy government which collaborated with the Nazis in deporting Jews to the concentration camps. The mementos to loved ones here are even more moving."

Seeing it for the first time in its entirety from Tram #2 as it passed Parliament Building, touched us to the core immediately. I had tears in my eyes imagining the final moments of those (mostly Jews) who were killed there. The memorial is profoundly haunting in its simplicity. Shoes were more valuable than human life, hence the taking off of the shoes. We walked along the promenade for a closer look and stood for a moment in silent prayer for those who lost their lives here. In my opinion, it is a memorial worth seeing both from a distance (as from Tram #2, sitting on the side with the Danube on your right) and up close and personal. From a distance, the whole haunting image of the memorial is captured. One can easily imagine the people who stood there because the shoes look so real at this distance. Close-up, you can see the detail of the shoes of that era and how visitors to this memorial have 'interacted' with it by placing candles and little knickknacks as tributes to those who lost their lives during the Nazi era in Budapest. A definite must!"

It is stark in its simplicity and effective in making one think of what happened here in 1944 and 1945. It does not, as one reviewer said, commemorate the suicides of people jumping off of the bridge, but rather the fact that the Jewish victims were required to strip naked and take their shoes off before being shot in the back of the head and pushed into the Danube. When you are with a child of a Holocaust survivor, it makes the experience more emotional and surreal. Along with the wonderful pastries and sights of Budapest, this stands in sharp contrast to other sites in Europe which have seemingly made the Holocaust a tourist attraction. It is spare and absolutely worth the short time it takes to visit."

I looked in a few book stores to read more but nothing was there. 300,000 Hungarian soldiers and more than 600,000 civilians died during World War II, including among them at least 450,000 Jews and 28,000 Roma- but apart from this memorial and visiting the synagogue the passing traveller would be none the wiser."

Many Jews were forced to strip naked on the banks of the Danube and face the river; a firing squad then shot the prisoners at close range in the back so that they fell into the river to be washed away. This was a common practice that occurred during 1944-1945. This memorial is in front of the Parliament building on the edge of the river. There are 60 pairs of rusted cast iron shoes. Different sizes and styles reflect how nobody was spared from the brutality of the Arrow Cross militia, including men, women and children. Behind the sculpture there is a stone bench where at three points are cast iron signs, with the following text in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew: \"To the memory of the victims shot into the Danube by Arrow Cross militiamen in 1944\u201345.

According to the guide on the Jewish History walk, they were selected from the Jewish Ghetto for extermination, told to strip (to assure that the men were Jewish) and tied in threes. They were then ordered to take off their shoes, and were shot at the edge of the water. To save bullets, only one person in each group was shot, and when he fell the others also fell into the river and were carried away. The sculpture represents their shoes left behind on the bank. It helps to know this story when viewing the memorial, otherwise, the significance may be lost. There is little explanation at the site itself."

In front of the grand Parliament building it was a small and somehow very personal memorial."

During WWII the authoritarian Arrow Cross guards took some of the Jews to the waterfront, ordered them to take their shoes off, fired at them and let their bodies fall into the river and float away. The interesting thing about these shoes is that they appear to be very real and belonging to the 1940,s.There are plaques, near the Shoes, stating,\"To the memory of the victims shot into the Danube by Arrow Cross militiamen in 1944\u201345.

Sixty pairs of iron cast shoes laid along a memorial promenade. The shoes representing Jewish people murdered by the Arrow Cross militiamen in Budapest between 1944-45. Told to take off their shoes, they were shot and left to float down the river. The promenade is near the Hungarian Science Academy on the Peat side along the river. It was erected on 16 April 2005 and was inspired by film director Can Togay and artistically sculpted by Gyula Pauer. It made me sad that genocide is still going on today as I write this review."

The shoes are expertly placed to replicate this act and it's a powerful statement.

I read about this memorial and heard about it from a number of our tour guides, as well as from tour books, but being there was incredibly moving. Many people have placed memorial candles in the shoes, as well as pebbles or stones in the shoes, as one does on a memorial stone. The shoes of the children were especially upsetting, thinking of the fear these young children had to experience waiting to be shot, or watching their parents, siblings and friends die. Make time to visit this quiet place and remember those who could not walk away.There is no signage telling you what you are seeing or the meaning of these bronze shoes, they tell their own story."

The memorial represents their shoes left behind on the bank. Its a must see for all people, especially visitors like us to get an understanding of the city's atmosphere 50 years ago"

This is one of the most moving Holocaust memorials in Europe. When in Budapest, in addition to the weeping willow tree memorial at the Doheny Synagogue it is a \"must see\".

The shoe sculptures on the bank \"Pest\" represent what was left as a memorial of this terrible crime....very moving."

Some are filled with flowers and stones.The memorial is unmarked, but there is a respectful ,reflective atmosphere and a few seats for those who want to stay a bit longer and remember."

To me, it evokes irresistibly those other heaps of shoes, spectacles, suitcases and all the other detritus of human misery that marked the Death Camps. The monument is located slightly down-stream from the parliament building beside the No2 tramtrack. It deserves a moment or two of silence and \"the passing tribute of a sigh.\""

The shoes demand reflection, however, and I realized that silent contemplation is more important, sometimes, than getting the shot to remember. The day we visited, a couple with a young child was accompanying an elderly man. He began to sob as they walked along the row of shoes. That is our important memory of the Shoes on the Danube.

I would have liked some more information, I'm not sure all of the visitors appreciated what it was and were not overly respectful, but with more detail to appreciate the horror of what the shoes represent that may not be the case."

Anyone who decides to walk along the edge of the Danube from the Chain Bridge up towards the Parliament Building, will come upon it, and as others have rightly commented, there are 3 paving stones written one in English, one in Hungarian and one in Hebrew explaining what one is seeing. As others have rightly commented, it was very moving to see 60 pairs of shoes, representing men, women and children mounted in the pavers permanently set into the pavers along the edge of the Danube..........\"60 pairs of period shoes cast out of iron. Different sizes and styles reflect how nobody was spared from the brutality of the Arrow Cross militia (the shoes depict children, women, businessmen, sportsmen etc.). Behind the sculpture lies a 40 metre long, 70 cm high stone bench where at three points are cast iron signs, with the following text in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew: \"To the memory of the victims shot into the Danube by Arrow Cross militiamen in 1944\u201345. Erected 16 April 2005.\"This is a quote from 'Shoes on The Danube by Phil Watkins.\"We visited in August, and there were no floral tributes, or anything around the shoes whatsoever, so it may be that others who commented in May, would have had the remnants of tributes left on the anniversary of the event?If you are in Budapest, on the Pest side....take 1/2 an hour and walk along the Danube and contemplate on the moving tribute to those Jews cruelly murdered over 70 yrs ago. It is one of the few tourist attractions that will cost you nothing, but leave you with an unforgettable poignant memory from your visit to Budapest!"

It's not a coincidence that the memorial was inspired by a film director, Can Togay, who, together with the sculptor Gyula Pauer created this complex to - as it's written on 3 plaques in Hungarian, English & Hebrew - the memory of the victims shot into the Danube by Arrow Cross militiamen in 1944-45. The details of this sad story are above imagination. They gathered the Jews, ordered them to remove their clothes and their shoes and stand at the edge of the Danube bank. Then they were taking shoestrings or ropes and tied them, two or three together. They were shooting and killing one, who fell immediately into the water together with the living ones. In case someone was still alive, they were using him as a live target! The Danube River turned red and sometimes it was called the Jewish cemetery. The memorial was erected in 2005. There are always a lot of flowers and lit candles around the shoes. Men's shoes, women's shoes, children's shoes.. Inevitably you imagine the owners of these shoes. How they looked like, what kind of profession they had. What kind of dreams they had. As a humble homage to them, you close your eyes and make a promise. Whatever your religion is, whatever your nationality is, whatever your social status is, as long as you live, you won't let this happen again, if you feel that you belong to the human and civilized species of this planet.At least this is my way to honour the anonymous innocent victims everywhere on this earth."

This memorial remembers the Hungarian Jews who were killed during World War 2 by a local paramilitary group who collaborated with the Nazi occupiers. The victims were made to remove their shoes before being shot, their bodies inevitably falling into the murky waters of the Danube River and swept away. The memorial captures a poignant moment when all that's left behind at the scene of the killings are the shoes the men and women had been wearing. Rather avant garde but rather effective at evoking the horror of the times. The memorial is located roughly midway between Parliament House and Chain Bridge. If walking here from the Parliament building or from Kossuth Lajos ter station, be careful when crossing the road facing the memorial as traffic, while not necessarily heavy, can come flying around the nearby bend."

I have visited this spot when I want to be reminded that I live in what was the epicenter of a horrific war. You can be taken back to that time, too, especially if you are in the right frame of mind when visiting it. Look around you at the river and the elegant bridges which span it. Now picture it with bridges destroyed and with them the hopes and dreams of hundreds of thousands of people trapped in the hell of occupation and war.It is a worthwhile addition to your travel experience to Budapest and your memory bank.

It's a very simple and well thought out memorial to the Jews killed on this spot.Before walking in to the memorial my boyfriend and I were chatting and as soon as we saw the shoes we fell silent and took it in. It was thought provoking and interesting. There was no information at the site that I could see to tell you the background to the memorial which may be good for some people who do not know what happened."

The memorial honors Jews who were made to strip and then shot into the Danube, killed during the Holocaust. The memorial is incredibly touching and beautiful. In any season, the Danube and the beautiful sights such as the castle on the other side of the river offer a pretty backdrop to this horrifying yet also very still scene. Sadly, the markers are not at all obvious so some people who happen upon the shoes think them more amusing than anything else, not recognizing their meaning and significance. That is perhaps the one downside of the site, it is so nicely embedded in its surroundings that you can almost miss it and not appreciate it for what it is.The area is a bit hard to access, but worth the trouble. I recommend approaching it from the south near the Hungarian Academy of Sciences at the Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n t\u00e9r. At the north end of that square near the tram stop (Tram #2, very convenient for accessing this area) along the Danube, you can take a crosswalk over to the river bank and walk north. The tricky part about approaching the memorial from the north near the Parliament is that there is not such an obvious spot to cross the street and walk south."

There are sixty pairs of shoes made out of iron in the style of the 1940's. Some are men's, women's and children's shoes with messages, votive candles and flowers tucked inside the shoes. The memorial is to the Hungarian Jews who were shot in the winter of 1944-1945 by members of the Arrow Cross Party. During that time, the Germans terrorized the Jewish people. Shooting the Jewish people by the river occured so there would be no evidence. Sometimes the victims were told to remove their shoes before they died. It is a moving memorial"

This memorial is very simple, just some bronze shoes (men's, women's, and children's) seemingly randomly placed along the waterfront, but it was probably the most creative and moving 're-enactment', if that is the right word for it, of one of the many, many tragic events committed against the Jews during World War 2, that I have experienced in my travels. There are a multitude of memorials now, in Germany and other countries where Jews were persecuted and systematically murdered, and they all are powerful and unique in their own ways. And, of course, a visit to Auschwitz or the other death camps, or the Prague ghetto, among others, is a very painful reminder of the criminal and inhumane treatment of Jews that sadly continues today. Other reviewers have done a great job of describing the shoes and the setting along the Danube, so no need to repeat it, but I can't stress enough how vital it is for EVERYONE to experience it. Hopefully it will change you for the better."

The shoes on the Danube was definitely on my list of things to see while in Budapest - literally stumbled across them while waking along the side of the Danube. I was surprised that there was no signs or anything to tell you any information but luckily I had researched before I visited Budapest. It's a really unique memorial and quite moving to see candles, ribbons and wreaths amongst the metal shoes and to think about the Jews who were lined up and killed there. Definitely worth a visit"

Shoes on the Danube Bank is a memorial dedicated to the victims of fascist hungarian war criminals who threw innocent Jews in the deadly cold river of Danube, in the last years of the Second World War. The monument itself consists of metallic shoes 'left' on the banks of the Danube river, as a remembrance to those who were thrown directly into watery death. The sight of it is very difficult to describe, because you are overwhelmed with negative emotions and the dreadfull image of people who suffered with no reason.One appeal to foregin tourists, please don't throw coins into shoes, because it's really inappropriate and disrespectful to the victims."

Sixty pairs of period-correct, mens and women's shoes line the promenade, a display that might be described as \"beautiful,\" if not for the horrific story backstory: During WWII, members of the Arrow Cross Militia marched Jews from their homes to the banks of the Danube; forced them to remove their shoes; and shot them in the back of the head. Their bodies fell into the river and were swept away in its current.When you're in Budapest, near the Chain Bridge, be sure to take a few minutes to stop here.

During their time, thousands of people (many of them Jews) were murdered and many thousands more were sent to their deaths in Auschwitz. The memorial of iron shoes fastened to the Danube's embankment near Parliament House commemorates the people who were murdered at this spot. They were first ordered to take off their shoes before being shot and their bodies swept away by the Danube's fast current.The memorial is simple but moving and we sat near the site for a time to contemplate how terrible it must have been for those knowing what was about to happen."

It is interesting to contrast this with the current memorial at the construction site of the controversial new War Memorial in Budapest, where local people continue to add photos, candles and testimonies to those deported or murdered, not by Germans but by Hungarians. Both memorials are incredibly moving and within easy walking distance of one another.

The memorial turned out to be behind the Parliament building, where we had already been!The display was quite emotional for my husband and I. Somehow I expected it to be bigger (more shoes? more prominence?) given what the shoes represent (the brutal murder of Hungarian citizens because they happened to be Jewish). However, perhaps the size is appropriate. The shoes seem so ordinary, in contrast to what they represent. They were strewn about in a disheveled manner, likely mimicking what had happened in life. I liked seeing candles and flowers placed there as tribute. It would have been nice to have an upright statue or sign in addition to the plaques placed in the ground, so that the memorial would be more visible from further away.

We wondered about the connection; a relative of one of the victim's, an apology from someone, or condolence?The monument is reached best by leaving the visitor center adjacent to the Parliament Building. Exit the center on the Danube side and turn left and you will arrive at the monument in 3-4 minutes of walking. The busy street is on one side and the river (with no fence or rail) on the other. Be aware of this if you have children since there is a drop off of several feet to the rocks along the river. We left with a different perspective of the history associated with this monument."

During Nazi occupation in WW2 and with the complicity of the then Hungarian puppet government many of the 200,000 Jews of Budapest were persecuted, rounded up in the Jewish ghettoes, had their property confiscated and in the worst cases were slaughtered or sent to concentration camps as part of the holocaust \"Final Solition\". This memorial on the banks of the Danube, quietly,elegantly portrays that awful time when Jews were lined up in the Danube's edge, shot and their bodies thrown into the river.

The metal shoes on the bank of the Danube are to remind us of this - there are mens, women's and children's shoes. Some have candles in them. A very poignant reminder of those days. We stood there on the riverbank for some time trying to imagine the horror these people must have felt knowing their fate as they removed their shoes.

It gave me a chance to talk to them about the millions of people who had lost their lives during the Holocaust and helped my kids focus on the individual victims. Each pair of shoes is a different size, shape, and style -- just like each of the victims was unique. Sometimes kids are overwhelmed when they learn about the incredible atrocities committed during the Holocaust and they lose sight of the impact on individuals and families. This memorial made all of this feel very personal, an experience I'm sure they won't ever forget. I know that I won't."

One such incident is the shooting of innocent people who fell victim to the anti-semitic atrocities of the Arrow Cross execution brigade - it is this incident which has been so poignantly captured through the \"shoes on the Danube\".60 innocent people were forced to take off their shoes and face the Danube on one cold winter in 1994 when the barbaric fascists then shot them in cold blood - forcing them all to fall dead in the Danube - while all that was left behind of them were their shoes on the river banks.The art installation on the Pest side of the Danube river on the promenade lies between the Parliament building and the Chain bridge - its not that well marked or lit - so you can miss it if you aren't actually looking out for it. For people taking the number 2 tram line its a short walk from the Chain bridge stop - or otherwise from the Kosuth Metro station as well.The shoes made in bronze/iron - look like real worn out shoes and serve as a sad reminder of the times, it also is a moving tale of the fact that how so many of us complain about the banalities of life when in all fairness we should be thankful for every single moment of joy we can afford - not many have had that luxury either.Its a must see just to relive the horror of those times and to remind ourselves that come what may we should never stoop to such levels again."

The Shoes on the Danube is an installation to commemorate the extermination of Jews snatched from a Wallenberg safe house in Budapest by the Hungarian Nazis (Arrow Cross) towards the end of WWII. The simple memorial sits at the point where they were lined up along the Danube, made to remove their shoes, then shot in the back of their heads to fall into the river. While the 60 pairs of period shoes, cast in bronze and including a child's pair of boots, are very moving, the two commemorative plaques are embedded in the ground and set back from the memorial so easy to miss (they look like drain covers). They also don't mention that the 'victims' were Jewish. Why ever not? Without clear signage/explanation, lots of tourists thought they were just a fun art installation and it was disturbing to see them 'trying on' the shoes and posing for holiday snaps."

That was a very touching moment for me, a bunch of different emotions. Symbolism that I see in this memorial... you don't have to actually walk in someone else's shoes to feel compassion for his pain and misery but these shoes can be timeless reminder that all people are the same and that everyone should be treated with equal respect, regardless of nationality and religion (or gender, education, sexual affiliation, age...) :("

You have to read up on the history first, because as many reviewers mentioned, there is a basic plaque, which I actually think is a perfect compliment. It forces you to learn about it before or after, either way, to use your curiosity.

This is, as other reviewers have noted, an outstanding piece of sculpture designed to commemorate the 100,000 Jews tied together and shot on the banks of the Danube by Hungarian fascists called the Arrow Cross AFTER the Nazis had fled the city. It is Hungary's own antidote to the denial it routinely practises, and to present-day antisemitism. Yet it is so positioned that unless you happen to walk for several kilometres along the banks of the Danube, you have to take your life in your hands and cross two two-lane highways to reach it. (An accident? I wonder...) That's what we did with our local guide, and it was worth the risk. Others have lost far more. We stood in silence and contemplated the bronze shoes, frozen in time, but bearing testimony to Hungary's grim and often distorted history."

After touring the Parliament Building on Sunday 5/11, my wife & I walked south, back to our hotel along the east bank of the Danube, specifically to visit the Shoes sculpture. The cool, rainy weather seemed to add to the mood of the artwork. It's hard to describe one's emotional reaction to the many types of sculpted shoes - men & women, young & old, rich & poor - that cumulatively evoked harrowing images of countless Jews who were shot & dumped in the river during the Holocaust.By all means take a few moments to visit this singular piece of searing, provocative art."

The shoes are placed so you can imagine people stepping out of them and then falling/jumping into the Danube. The shoes range from workbooks to dress shoes to tiny children's shoes. Some people have taken to placing tiny stones into the shoes in tribute. There is a simple plaque (in several languages) that explains the memorial, although while we were visiting some people seemed to be completely unaware what they were viewing and were taking tourist shots posing next to the shoes. Hungary is still coming to terms with the war and the fate of the Jews. Across town, there is a proposed memorial about the fall of Budapest to Hitler that has attracted quite a bit of controversy, as some feel that Hungarians were quite complicit with the Nazis. There are many homemade tributes, photos, shoes, eyeglasses, and protest letters that have sprung up there to remind people about the fate of their loved ones who were killed/transported to camps. As the generation that was alive and remembers slowly dies out, you feel the sense of urgency that they have to make sure that the history is remembered accurately."

I am not sure that \"attraction\" is the correct description for this very special place in Budapest.Some have made note of the fact there is very little information located at the site and as such they provided lower ratings. Personally I think this is one of the more sobering and touching memorials to the history of the Jewish population in Eastern Europe that I have seen. The beauty of the memorial is its simplicity and when you stand there, looking over the beauty of the Danube and the city beyond, and see those shoes, it makes you stop and quietly think about what those people endured and what ultimately happened to them. Hopefully the memorial serves as never ending call to not forget what happened here."

There were initially 60 pair of iron shoes from the the 40s. There were children's shoes to workman's boots, to a woman's worn heels to one sling back shoe. According to the story, the political party Arrow Cross came into power in 1944. This group made nightly raids grabbing Jews and political adversaries. 10,000 to 15,000 victims were marched to the rivers edge, forced to remove their shoes because the shoes were valuable, then shot and pushed or tumbled into the river. This memorial is so touching because the shoes were more valuable to the Arrow Cross party then human life. It makes one think both at the memorial site and later on in quiet moments."

The Shoes are located between the Chain Bridge and the Parliament on the Pest side. If you walk from the Chain Bridge, the Shoes are located about 5 - 10 minutes, right before you reach the Parliament. Having found it, the Shoes were sad and thought provoking. The saddest part way seeing women's shoes next to a pair of small child's shoes. There were other children's shoes there, they appeared to be about 10 - 12 years old. It was definitely worth the effort to find this and pay my respect to the innocent people who lost their lives through no fault of their own. There is also a place to sit behind the shoes and take in the Buda side stunning views."

The foot path was paved for the most part. Be aware that in places it is loose sand and dirt; if there is a significant wind and you are wearing contacts, you will need to protect your eyes. The highlight of the walk was the shoes on the Danube. We understood that it was a memorial to Jews (and perhaps others) who were killed and thrown in the river during World War II. We were sad for those thoughts but were glad to be able to pay our respects to those who perished. As some other reviewers have noted, no signs are posted, explaining the significance of the shoes. I think that signs, information, etc. would actually have been distracting; better to let the place and the shoes speak for themselves. In any event, we knew what to expect from having read some reviews of things to see before we left for Budapest. So do not miss the promenade and, especially, the shoes."

A great way of doing this is creating something extraordinary from meaningful events like the film director that thought of materializing the Shoes on the Danube Promenade in Budapest. A lot of tourists like me had their pictures taken on the shoes displayed on the edge of the bank. The shoes were a symbol of the Jews who were brutally shot during the war by a mad man. It was touching that people offered flowers on the shows and some said silent prayers on the bank to bid farewell to those that have suffered. I did the same thing as I was deeply saddened by the facts about the beautiful artwork. My friend and companion during that trip was my tour guide as well and she let me in on the story behind the Shoes on the Danude Promenade."

It was a time of reflection of such senselessness and and respect for those who lose their lives in this horrific fashion.

It is a harsh reminder of evil, cruelty, abuse of power to which desperate people can fall. That it has such a prominent place in this historical city is testimony to human resilience."

It's very close to the Parliament, but it's not easy to get to if that's the direction you're coming from - you have to sort of cross a busy almost dual carriageway type road and hop over a barrier to reach it. It's easier if you're coming along the river from the centre of Pest towards the Parliament. I found this to be incredibly touching - the sight of the shoes, from men's work boots, to women's heels to, worst of all, children's shoes, makes more of an impact than a fifty foot memorial and list of names ever could. The victims were shot on the bank of the Danube and thrown into the river, after first being made to take off their shoes. I visited this memorial twice: once in the afternoon, when there were a lot of people there, and once at 7.30am on a Saturday morning, when it was deserted. I'd recommend viewing it during quieter hours, if possible, it really is the sort of thing to make your throat ache."

They are beautifully made and have an air of such pathos, juxtaposing the horrors of racism against a backdrop of beautful architeccture and a city full of charm.Notmuch has changed, sadly, and recently a Jobbik (neo\u00e9Nazi) memeber of parliament asked for alistof all Jews in Hungary, since he asserted that they are a threat to National safety!"

The history and reality of WW2 is evident in so many places, but for me the historical journey started here. I have to thank tripadvisor for leading me here, as I researched for things to do and this came up. I had 3 failed attempts at finding this site. Hot tip if you reach the Danube from Pest old town, turn right and keep walking along the bank towards parliament just past the Chain Bridge. This was a film makers tribute to the Hungarian Jews that were forced to take off their shoes (a commodity in that time, worth more than innocent peoples lives.) before being shot nto the river. That's heart breaking to gasp. You don't need a tourist \"guide\", billboard or the like. Just stand here and remember how lucky you are to live in a time when you are not forced to face a fateful death at the hands of one mans insane ideals."

The Jews were insignificant to the Nazis, but since their shoes had second hand value (as they could be sold in the market) they were made to remove their shoes before they were shot into the river.The memorial has dozens of pairs of shoes made in cast metal shown as if discarded by the river. It is a very touching tribute and since there are no plaques / sign boards to explain the same, it is recommended to read a little before visiting.The views of the place are amazing, especially in the evening when the Parliament building lights up and both the bridges light up as well."

We visited the Shoes on the Danube after we'd been to the Synagogue and Jewish museum where our guide had explained to us about the shooting of local Jews who were marched to the waterfront, shot and their bodies left to float down the Danube. Whilst their lives had no value to the Arrow Cross (the local Nazi party) who killed them, their shoes had second-hand worth and so they were made to remove their shoes before they were shot. The Shoes on the Danube memorial commemorates the river bank killings with dozens of pairs of cast metal shoes standing as if discarded on the river side.As memorials go it's quietly understated. You won't find big plaques explaining what happened, just a small one inset into the pathway written in Hebrew. Some of the shoes have pebbles inside, the traditional way in which people mark a visit to a Jewish grave. Others have wilted flowers placed inside them. You can find the shoes on the river bank just to the south of the Parliament building."

The victims had to take their shoes off, since shoes were valuable at the time. Our guide said that Jews were tied together with a long rope and every 4th person was shot and the rest pushed into the Danube to drown. This is never taught in the Hungarian schools. No Hungarian Government apology has been made. Monuments to wartime Hungarian fascist leaders are being built today."

Worth a visit to contemplate the history when in the area visiting. It's not a big sculpture, or even grand, but does leave a lasting memory when you think of the people that might have worn them and how and why they died."

Nevertheless it is less a monument set on the Danube promenade for (Jewish) Holocaust victims than a reminder of the Hungarian hypocrisy in regard to its longest surviving fascist \"Weltanschauung\" and political movement in Europe and the world: Horty, then Arrow Cross and now Jobbik ...The monument was placed on a site that is easily accessible only for young athletes, elite commando soldiers and suicide candidates. It really is set as isolated as a ghetto, separated from rest of the world by a heavy traffic transit road with no opportunities to cross it in a safe way for at least 1/4 of a mile, both to the right and to the left.Don't tell me it wasn't done on purpose ...And then: on the site were only JEWS murdered. But the writing at the monument only talks of \"the victims\" (no nationality, religion, etc.) mentioned. Quote: \"The sculptor created sixty pairs of period-appropriate shoes out of iron. The shoes are attached to the stone embankment, and behind them lies a 40 meter long, 70 cm high stone bench. At three points are cast iron signs, with the following text in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew: \"To the memory of the victims shot into the Danube by Arrow Cross militiamen in 1944\u201345\"\" Something that makes people with lesser historical background to simply miss the direct and exclusive link to Hungarian fascist murdering Jews. One could believe that some militiamen of indefinite origin (German? Soviet? Hungarian) belonging to an \"Arrow Cross\" have shot some Hungarians \"into the Danube\".Me, I visited and left the site with very mixed feelings. Thanks to the artist team, but full of resentment for the official Hungarian hypocrisy under MP Orban and his Jobbik helpers. And harsh criticism Budapest and Hungary officials for the poor accessibility & visibility of the memorial."

My wife and I walked from our Viking Cruise ship to the site of the shoes...almost immediately we were unable to speak as we focused on the shoes and thought of those who were slaughtered at this point...the whole setting is one of beauty with some of the great buildings of Budapest visible in every direction...did they weep as they witnessed the unspeakable horror that took place on the beautiful Danube? We prayed that such evil will one day be only a remembrance and that all implements of war and torture will be beat into instruments of peace that better the human condition...idealism? Perhaps! Yet, still our prayed for reality."

There are small rocks in some of the shoes that have been placed there in memory, as well as some small candles. It is very sad to think about the circumstances these people were in; it is a terrible example of the inhumanity to man during WWII, and shows the struggle the Hungarian Jews had during the war. Please be respectful if you visit, and know why the shoes are there. Some people that were there, I don't think knew about it's story, and were laughing and putting their feet alongside some of the shoes and taking photos; VERY disrespectful I thought.

As other reviewers have mentioned, there is no safe access - no bridge nor pedestrian crossing. Just take your life in your own hands, run across a busy roadway and jump over a metal barrier. A safer but longer approach is walk from the road near the Four Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace. It's about 400 metres from there.The metal shoes look so real, as if people had just removed them and left them there. We sat down on the bench nearby to take the whole scene in. Trying to imagine the victims and the horror of the event.I hope the city government improves the access to the monument. When visitors have to risk their own lives to pay tribute to the lives of others, it detracts from the importance and significance of the memorial."

It's one of the few references to WWII and its Jewish victims that you'll find in Budapest, which tends to focus much more on the city's Soviet occupation. The memorial is small, but encourages you to spend time with and contemplate it. The shoes of children were particularly touching, as they remind you that no person was exempt from Nazi terror."

But to me this is the most moving monument in this fine city to victims of the Holocaust. In this case it commemorates those who were slaughtered at the hands of the Arrow Cross (the Hungarian Fascist movement) towards the end of WW2. They simply lined the people up on the bridges, forced them to strip, shot them and let the Danube carry the bodies, dead and alive, away. The majority were Jewish women and children, the men having been conscripted to work as slaves to aid the Nazi war effort. The reason why they were not taken to the camps were because at the ending of the war there were no trains to transport them. Ironically after the war the Communists recruited many members of the Arrow Cross into their state security apparatus and other roles though some were prosecuted and executed for war crimes. I must admit, knowing the story beforehand, I was moved to tears when i saw the shoes."

If visiting after dark, as we were, even more so as English speaking policemen and others at the Parliament building amazingly did not know what we were talking about and we had to find it on our own. The only safe way is to walk up from the Chain Bridge and even then watch out for uneven ground at dusk and later - 2 of our party tripped! Once there the sculpture is moving and does make you think about the inhumanity of it all and how anyone could carry out such monstrous acts even under orders.

Luckily in Budapest, drivers are friendly and stop for pedestrians (for the most part).

This memorial remembers those who were ordered to take off their shoes on the river bank before being shot. The shoes are so detailed and skilfully made, they look so real. It was very poignant and personal, I felt moved to tears. We have all seen memorials and statues relating to this terrible period in history, but this makes it very 'real' and human. I would urge people to see this and take a few moments to reflect. There were, of course, tourists there from all over the world taking countless pictures (why?) and even some who took off their own shoes and were jokingly pointing at them for photos... i found this a bit distasteful and hope that perhaps they didn't realise what the memorial was."

This was after a long period of searching for an easy, safe way to get there -- so perhaps we're missing something, but it wasn't easy.There are memorial plaquest in the concrete next to the shoes. I don't know what the Hungarian says, but the Hebrew mentioned the fact that it was Jews who were killed on this spot, and the English just mentioned the people who were killed. It was hard not to get a bad feeling from that.We were surprised that there isn't any railing to stop people from falling into the Danube from the walkway alongside it, including where the shoes are.

Growing up, my parents told me about the horrors of the Holocaust. They described to me how many of the Jews were murdered at the end of the war. Apparently, they were running out of bullets, so the Nazi's would tie people together, shoot one in the head; then throw them into the water.What upset me was how hard this memorial was to find. My husband and I walked for over and hour until we came upon the shoes. It's a very touching sight. But, it hurts me to see that one has to go out of their way to find this important memorial."

It is located just behind the main Parliament building which is a beautiful building adjacent to the Danube. The shoes represent the many Jewish families who were shot into the Danube during the Nazi regime. There is a little plaque on the ground nearby outlining this. The sight of the shoes is so powerful -- more powerful than any holocaust museum . The shoes are in all shapes and sizes, for males and females.The ones that affected me most were those of the little children. I could not leave for quite some time and it was nice to see visitors of all ages coming along, looking, obviously thinking, taking photos and staying awhile.

During WWII, the infamous Arrow Cross Party, an anti-semitic organization operating in Budapest, executed thousands of Jews in Budapest, many of whom were shot along the river, after being ordered to remove their shoes which were left behind as the bodies fell into the water.When trying to understand a country and its history, sometimes it's necessary to learn about the sad and difficult chapters and not only the glorious ones. This memorial is not for the faint-hearted. It will bring tears to your eyes, and many visitors will reflect on this sad and terrible era in the history of the world. The memorial itself is very simple, and a very fitting tribute to the innocent people who lost their lives for doing nothing more than being who they were. I would recommend this for people interested in history, and not afraid to confront one of the more sobering and horrifying chapters of European history."

I explained that the militia probably opened fire before that person removed the other shoeTo me this taught her more about nazism than every book in her schoolA very touching memorial"

There is no entrance from the Kossuth Lajos Utca tram stop and unless you are comfortable crossing a busy road (which we did), would recommend that you get off one stop earlier (from the Chain Bridge) and walk down towards the parliament from there."

A friend of mine from Budapest told me that I had to be sure to see the \"shoes memorial.\" I was shocked to find that in a city of huge buildings and statuary, this remembrance is paltry and practically inaccessible. The memorial consists of about 50 bronzed shoes (of the era, not traced to actual victims) which represent the Hungarian Jews lined up at the river, bound, shot, and pushed in to the Danube literally as Allied forces advanced on the city. These atrocities were committed by Hungarian nationals who felt compelled to continue to round up and kill as many Jews as possible even though Nazi defeat was certain. There is no question of \"not knowing\" and there is eyewitness proof of both complicity and enthusiasm for the task. A sad chapter in Hungarian history, and a sad monument to recount it. As one of the other reviewers said, it's like they don't want to remember the Holocaust.There is NO signage from the road alerting travelers of the existence of the memorial. The monument itself is located on a small stretch along the banks of the Pest side (opposite the Parliament building), and it is literally inaccessible, unless you are already walking along that stretch of riverfront on that side. To access the memorial you have to cross a busy two lane highway with active tram track and then hop over a divider. If you manage to get there in one piece, you will find a memorial that, while moving, completely fails to demonstrate the scope of the atrocities.Better than nothing? Barely. It's a token."

Knowing something of the history of the City in the 1940's we feared the worst, and our worst fears were confirmed by a young woman who had a guidebook.

After a bit of an adventure (which involved jaywalking), I found the section of the promenade. It's location, between Sz\u00e9chenyi Lanchid (Chain Bridge) and Orszaghaz (Parliament) on the banks of the Danube, highlights its poignancy. The tragedy suffered by the Hungarian Jews is very much a part of this city's history as its beautiful architecture. I appreciated the simplicity of the memorial: the lack of signage, plaques telling the stories, and even directions to it allows one to experience this memorial. One story I heard before I came to this memorial was that the Arrow Cross didn't have enough bullets, so they tied people together and only shot one, so that the other person ended up drowning in the Danube. I remembered this story as I contemplated the bronzed shoes. I would've stayed there longer if it wasn't such a windy, frigid day. I saw that people had left flowers and tea lights among the shoes. It might be worthwhile to stob by this memorial at twilight. How to find it: Don't do what I did (jaywalk across a busy highway to the embankment from the Attila Jozsef statue). Instead, walk towards the Sz\u00e9chenyi rakpart stop for Tram 2, which is near the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Cross the tram tracks and you will see a path towards the embankment. Head away from the Chain Bridge towards Parliament. It's about a 10 minute walk. I hope your day is more conducive, weather-wise, for reflections. There are park benches facing Buda nearby."

As I came to this area with the shoes, there was a group of about 8 older folks (maybe late 60s) taking pictures. I asked one of the ladies about what the shoes meant. She explained that she was Jewish and that this memorial was for the Jews killed by the Arrow Cross Militiamen. They were lined up, shot and allowed to fall into the Danube. The shoes represent them falling into the river. As she is relating this story to me and the impact of the Holocaust on the Hungarian Jews, she starts tearing up as I do. So her and I - two strangers - stood on the banks of the Danube by 60 pairs of cement shoes, crying and mourning the cruelty of humanity to each other. Very moving and powerful. A must-see."

Unfortunately when i was there, there were 2 Chinese tourists trying to fit their feet into the shoes and taking photos holding their noses as if there was a bad smell which I found vile."

The artist found a superb manner to represent the facts without words, without signs, simply placing the shoes as they are. I had read about it before going to Budapest, and was willing to see them but it wasn't easy to find: for some reason, no one talks about it in the city.......It's not mentioned in any of the sightseeing tours......... and when I asked the guides about, we felt as if they didn't want to say much about it. I had the sensation that people in Budapest try to hide this lovely memorial from the tourists. But I could finally find it and it was wonderful. Different from anything else I had ever seen. Don't miss it!"

In Budapest, they murdered about 15000 people, mostly Jews, and deported another 80000 to the death camps. Many Jews were taken from the Ghetto to the banks of the Danube, where they were forced to undress. Several were tied together and some were shot, falling into the freezing river and dragging those tied to them into the river to drown. A more horrific sight is hard to imagine. In memory of the victims of this terrible crime, the Shoes on the Danube Promenade memorial was erected. It simply consists of about 50 pairs of shoes embedded in the concrete at the edge of the river. The simplicity of the memorial conveys a powerful emotional message, as this is all that remains of the victims after they were murdered on this site. If anyone needs a reminder of the depths of human cruelty and human suffering, I can't think of a more appropriate memorial."

Even our 5 star hotel would have preferred we not dwell on this sad part of Hungary's past. Do not let them dissuade you from going, however!! We should all take a moment in our busy lives to contemplate, remember and be saddened by what went before. There are a line of beautifully crafted shoes, about fifty pairs, possibly in bronze on the shore. Men's shoes with laces broken, ladies fashionable sandals, kiddies shoes worn and scuffed all seemingly kicked off and left haphazardly on the edge of the Danube just near Parliament House. It commemorates the shooting of Hungarian Jews by the Hungarian Arrow Cross Militia in 1944/45 on this spot before their bodies were thrown into the river. This is an easy walk from the Chain Bridge. I strongly recommend you take it. A wonderful and touching memorial that will move your soul told in the simplest and most moving way possible."

Three plaques in different languages, including one in Hebrew are installed into the ground nearby. Walk 10 minutes or so along a sandy path north (in the direction of the Parliament) from the Chain Bridge. Take photos, sit on the low marble wall and contemplate.

I'm not big into visiting holocaust memorials, but this one was worth seeking out. To get there, walk along the Pest side of the Danube northward from the Chain Bridge to get there.
