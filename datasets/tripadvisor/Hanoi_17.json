I recommend doing it through a walking tour as you can ask question to your vietnamese guide. You could in theory just read everything that is written on the walls and watch the videos, but there is something more to get from sharing this moment with a local. Even if our guide wasn't born when all of this happened and that she probably did the tour thousands of time, the emotions that were transpiring from her were something else. Of all the things in Hanoi, this is my favorite tourist sight."

The four year just walked along but wasn't interested, which worked out because it was hard enough explaining what a political prisoner is to the other two."

I knew nothing of the history of Vietnamese patriots, so that focus of this site was of great interest.My issue is in the obvious untruths being told throughout regarding treatment of foreign prisoners. (Isn't the point of preserving historical sites to understand and reflect on what actually happened, learning from our successes AND failures?) Though we live in Hanoi, we rarely feel that this is a Communist country (in the way you do in other Communist places), but you will definitely see political rhetoric on full display here.Is it worth a tour? If you are in this area, sure. It's a quick 45-minute jaunt and costs 30,000 VND (roughly 15USD). However, as other reviewers have noted, there are a ton of things to do in Ha Noi, and you could easily miss this stop and not feel that you've missed much.Either way, we love Vietnam! Enjoy your visit!"

I have been to Germany to see their WW prison camps and they could display the truth in all of its ugliness after all it was war with a mission but not here. Either we have been fed a lie here or their is a lot of false propoganda to make it sound like it really was the Hanoi Hilton in the sense of being a hotel....Unless you have a personal reason/link to go, I would probably skip it.as their is so much other things to visit."

Secondly what there is (eg the condemned cells) has been moved around - and when you're talking about concrete you might as well say 'rebuilt'. The result is that you are left wondering if anything is original. Thirdly the level of misinformation, from the trivial (Guilotane wasn't a doctor who invented the guillotine) to the patriotic to the propaganda rhetoric, is quite distorting. Even with a good knowledge of the truth it's hard to wade through all the rubbish and see the underlying reality. It's interesting to see some of the stuff but it's barely worth the effort. At least the entry price is cheap. In the end it's one of those places you have to be able to say you've been to, but it's a disappointment."

The presentation is however quite one-sided, describing the French in the worst way possible, and praising the time when the Vietnamese run the prison with outmost respect for the prisoners (even though different sources claim that the time there wasn't so great).Then again, you get a feeling of the nationalism of the Vietnamese, presenting the history in this matter. That was actually quite interesting, but at some expense of the history. "

This museum is intresting not from the point of how prisoners lived in this place but how Vietnamese government still lies about how americans were held in Hoa Lo. I don't support American invasion to Vietnam but it's well known that American prisoners were not happy being held in \"Hanoi Hilton\" and do non regret about not staying there one more year. But Vietnamese still say that. Not 30 years ago but in 2016. Great lies of propaganda!"

It is thought provoking but more because of the conditions people were kept in rather than the social struggle that was taking place.It is a very one sided view of the war against the Imperialist aggression of the US.

Yes, you should be prepared for a fair amount of propaganda. But did you expect them to show the real conditions for the US Airmen who were detained there? The level of propaganda is no more that the propaganda you get from my neck of the woods, at the Old North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts or the Bunker Hill Monument in Charlestown.

I had a really great impression of the museum as I walked through the parts which tell you about the French occupation and the beginning of the Vietnam war. Then there are the two rooms about the American POWs (Prisoner of War) and the Hoa Lo Prison, which is known as the notorious torture prison, is pictured as paradise for the American pilots.After having seen that propaganda, I couldn't help but feel doubts about the rest of the museum and leave with a very fishy feeling. The Vietnamese government would do itself a favour it would start to be real about what happened in the war and admit the own misdoings."

There were many derogatory references to Americans and French people and governments that were unnecessary in the telling of history as well as a strict adherence to the stories that American prisoners were all treated well, despite the accounts of torture and other inhumane activities that occurred at the prison. It was very informative to see the living conditions of the prisoners there, however, and I did think they did a good job of preserving what remains of the site.

They charged different prices for each of my friends - I paid 50k dong (2.25 US) to get in. Some of my friends only paid 30k. Welcome to Vietnam?!? Anyway, they have a nice booklet that explains (using Vietnamese propaganda) what the prison is all about. Get the booklet. If nothing else it will crack you up (or really disturb you). The museum includes an explanation about the use of the prison under the French and the use of the prison to hold US pilots. As you can imagine, they explain that the pilots were well taken care of. There's a memorial room for Vietnamese who died in the prison under the French. Visit it. It's interesting. The prison was a worthwhile visit for the money. Don't expect a fair explanation of what went on there. After all, the winners get to explain history."

It's part of the old prison compkex for political prisoners and American pilots shot down over Hanoi and other cities. You can walk the narrow halls and gaze at the exhibits, among which a French guillotine and the immaculately preserved uniform of Airman and later presidential candidate John McCain, who was also shot down over Hanoi. Even more impressive, and eerie, are the many life-size puppets of prisoners chained to their bunks and on death row. Signposts are of course patriotic along orthodox communist lines. A sobering and somber experience, visiting this place, but it brings the struggle and pain of the Vietnamese resistance and wars real close."

The section on the Vietnamese struggle against the French presents the French as barbaric whereas in the section on the Vietnam War, it presents the Vietnamese as very civilised towards their American prisoners. If you take some of this \"history\" with a grain of salt, it is an interesting experience to see this style of museum. I would recommend checking it out if you have a day or two in Hanoi and are looking for things to do."

It's mostly indoors, so good for a hot summer day. The not-so-good things: it's (obviously) very biased towards Vietnamese politics so read the signs with a liberal dose of salt, it's small and will take only an hour at most to stroll around and see everything (but that might be a good thing for some people), the shop is in US$ and ridiculously overpriced. Bizarrely they were selling copies of \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\". Go figure. The museum is only part of the old prison, which was demolished to build the hotel next door (I heard it was once the Hanoi Hilton, ironically). Overall it was a great little museum, and I'd recommend anyone with even a passing interest in Asian politics and history, or military history, to go. Worth the 30k dong entry."

I have read many books about the war and several have been about this prison, so know more than they probably thought most people knew. We weren't allowed upstairs where the prisons were kept, there were a couple of cells down where the people are allowed. It was insulting to me the pictures they show of prisoners playing volleyball and pool! I'm sure none of the pow's would remember that happening!

The period of French occupation and the Vietnam (\"American War\"). We whizzed through the French occupation period as this wasn't of huge interest to us and I have little knowledge of this chapter in Vietnamese history. The period covering the American War was interesting but is clearly written with political intent and amounted to propaganda!! Even a Brit could see this! The stats just didn't add up. The museum wants to paint a picture that the incarcerated American pilots were well looked after compared with Vietnamese population of the time and that the war was totally unjust and the Vietnamese were victims. The legends on the photos stated that 'thousands of American war planes' were shot down and 'thousands of Americans' were imprisoned there. These stats are simply exaggerated and not correct!These criticisms aside it was an interesting visit and it's worth a visit when you've done everything else you wanted to in Hanoi."

Fee to get in is 30,000 VND which is like $1.50 USD.Before entering, our guide was very good about saying \"I know you are American and have your thoughts/beliefs, and with me being Vietnamese, mine are different so while we are inside I won't say much and let you read for yourself.\" That was very refreshing because he could have very well firehosed us with propaganda... though the prison did that well enough. Most of what is left is dedicated to how poorly the French treated the VIetnamese who were imprisoned there. There are quite a few artifacts and pictures. It was very interesting. Then there are two small rooms dedicated to the treatment of American pilots who were held there during the war. It was interesting, yet frustrating, to see the blatant propaganda of how well the American's were treated... to see the pictures of the \"smiling, happy, Christmas celebrating soldiers.\" A very interesting take on history. It just makes me curious as to what do the VIetnamese really think?you will also see what they claim is John McCains flightsuit, boots, helmet and parachute. Seeing the cells only made me wonder how the prisoners endure living there for so many years. I highly recommend seeing this sight if in Hanoi!"

It was really interesting to read and hear the local story. At first I was slightly shocked to listen to our guide state how well the American POWs were treated during their imprisonment, and to see the displays of smiling US airmen playing basketball and preparing a Thanksgiving feast for visitors. This was at odds with the stories the airmen, particularly Senator John McCain, had told upon their release. It brought home to me how each side has its own stories and recollections and that there is no one history to be heard. I felt a great deal of sympathy for the Vietnamese people who suffered terribly during the war and how they are now building a vibrant and rich new Vietnam. This museum made me think - I can't imagine not being moved by a visit."

The interior building has A/C so the visit can help you take a break from the outside humidity. The jail was used by French, Japanese then by North Vietnamese army to detain the US air forces during Vietnam war in 1967. There are pictures & propaganda videos of US air forces detainment during Vietnam war in one of the exhibits. Overall, I would put this visit as the last on the list. Too many sad stories in the prison exhibits."

Deplorable conditions for both female and male prisoners, it's pretty disgusting to think it was within use in the last century. There was even a guillotine for death row prisoners which is pretty medieval for the place and time! One thing I've noticed about all the museums we've visited it they're all very biased against any colonials \"Americans, French etc.\" which is probably justly so, but I'm sure some of the inmates probably committed criminal acts. NOT to say the French had any business in Vietnam colonizing, as they really didn't have any rightAnyways overall it was a very interesting museum with lots of information that I had otherwise been ignorant about.

It tells the story of the prison from its initiation under the French to the time of the US war. Most of it focuses from its early days through to the war of independence from the French with a well presented portion near the end about the US pilots. The government rhetoric is kept to a minimum (although some of it was a bit much). Some of the photos are priceless as many of us remember so much of this it is really interesting to see actual photos from some of these times. Seeing John McCain's flight suit kind of brought it to reality. The cell block was eerie. So was the guillotine. If you go, spend some time reading and viewing much of the information presented. It will give you a better sense of the history during the colonial era and US war. Only part of the original Prison has been preserved but what has been is worth seeing."

Firstly, the grim conditions preserved to show off the prison in French colonial times to hold the Vietnamese revolutionaries. Secondly, how the Americans were supposedly treated if captured as POW's in the Vietnam War. Extremely contrasting in their depiction here and it was a little lopsided. The conditions the Americans were subject to I highly doubt were as good as mentioned here.However, a very interesting prison/museum. Only costs a few dollars and is on the southern outskirts of the Old quarter. Certainly well worth visiting."

There was also a drain where some convicts escaped through the sewers.During the war with America, the prison was used to house American pilots and other prisoners of war.

The `Prison' is not very far from my hostel but the streets in the Old Quarters resembled a maze and it took me a much longer time to reach my destination than I earlier thought. The front fa\u00e7ade of the Prison has a very French architectural look. It was constructed by the French colonialists who were in Indo-China to exploit the resources. The Prison appears very well-maintained and clean. The area is not big and is in fact a prison museum with very informative and illustrative exhibition panels, video clips and artifact displays of prison life during the colonial days and in the decades of the Vietnam War. The French built this prison and used it as a chamber of torture to weaken the will of the revolutionary movement. Many hardcore revolutionaries arrested were thrown into this prison and suffered inhumane treatment and eventually perished under impoverished conditions though some managed to escape. It was interesting to note that an Almond Tree within the prison compound testified to the miseries suffered by the revolutionaries and nourished the heroes with her leaves and fruits. The aged old tree must be a witness to the historical fact. I do not think there is any propaganda to blemish the French colonialists. It is historically factual that they were repressive and cruel in their treatment of the Vietnamese revolutionaries. In their futile attempt to hold on to powers, the French colonialists think that the best way is to exterminate those who dared to challenge their rule. It was silly to try to reverse the wheels of history when the locals learn to be masters of their own fate. The second part of the exhibition related to the treatment of US POWs. In the name of democracy and freedom, the Americans dumped millions of explosives and bombs into Vietnam. Some of the imprisoned US pilots were confined to this prison but were treated with proper medical care and lived in humane conditions unlike the cruel way the French colonialists tortured the revolutionaries. The imprisoned pilots were also immediately released to the US government when the communists took over power. From the many photos shown, the US POWs enjoyed recreational activities and received regular and proper medical check-ups and care. Was this political propaganda or facts? Maybe those POWs who survived could answer to this question.I looked at the aged old almond tree that still survived to this day. It must have seen much of the misery in the Prison. If you are in Hanoi, you should not miss this Prison."

When you got to the American prisoner section then everything changed. They showed how wonderfully they treated the POWs and had them pose for photos to prove it. I think that everyone knows that that was not totally how it was. However it was still very interesting to see and I would recommend that you go but keep and open mind."

A token entrance fee (30,000 VND each), followed by interesting yet somewhat politically slanted insights primarily about the oppressed lives of Communist patriots against the French in 1930-45....also \"humane\" treatment of American POW'S (including John McCain) at \"Hanoi Hilton\" in the 1960's.

Half of the prison is no longer there and has been replaced by a hotel. There is a small fee to enter and you are asked if you would like a tourist book at the time of paying although she didn't tell us we had to pay for it - allbeit pence in our money however this is not the point. Our fellow travellers told us they had their book for free. So should have been 60 VND for 2 persons we paid 80 VND.There are a lot of boards with photos once inside and some glass boxes containing remnants and relics of the days the prison had \"guests\". As I said \"not my thing\" at all and quite honestly found the whole experience rather depressing and a bit creepy. Photos of heads in baskets, the actual guillotine on show, the dark dingy cells and a tatty old bed which American soldiers used to sleep upon - all rather awful.I wished I'd stayed outside whilst my husband walked around - there were several long faces sat in the courtyard looking subdued after the experience, it is the history, it shouldn't be forgotten however maybe it should also come with a warning too before entering."

So upon arriving here we wanted to see at least one of the history museums. With the help of trip advisor, and the great reviews, we chose this one. And we were not disappointed.The whole museum takes around 2 hours to walk around but most definitely worth it. We used our student cards so got tickets half price at 15,000 dong. We learned a lot about the wars with both the French and the us, and even got to see inside the cell blocks and dungeons. Half of the original prison has been knocked down, but what's left is still very interesting (and upsetting) to see. There are plenty of signs written in Vietnamese, English and French, so hopefully you will understand a tleast one of them. Take the time to listen to the audio devices and to watch the short videos. They were some of the best bits. Don't miss the upstairs exhibitions (we almost did).One of our favourite things to do in Hanoi and a great start to our trip!"

I was a bit shocked that people were taking 'snaps' - even using a flash - when looking at tableau of severed heads in baskets, people being tortured. This is a serious place telling a serious story of hardship, determination and the eventual overthrow of tyrannical European masters. This is where the Vietnamese Communist Party was born, in the north. Ho Chi Minh was a prisoner here, he taught his disciples here, in secret. You'll learn a lot about torture and being fettled.There's a more contemporary exhibition of the time Hoa Lo housed American airmen shot down during the Vietnam War; they referred to it as the Hanoi Hilton. John Cain the US senator was held here and they still have his fliying suit. There are photographs of the generosity of the north Vietnamese who gave gifts to the airmen before they were eventually released. If you want to learn more about Vietnam, you should travel south to Saigon/Ho Chi Minh City where the citizens weren't so pleased at being overthrown by the north and having Communism imposed upon them. Northern citizens are considered careful, hard-working and they save money for the future. They consider the citizens of the south to be wastrels and pleasure-seekers, non-savers who don't plan for the future. "

It is mostly preserved buildings, so you can get a real feel for what it was like when it was operational. The only thing that you need to do is take the propaganda with a grain of salt. The prison displays are roughly divided into two parts - the French occupation and the American war. The prison was built during the French Colonial era, and was used by the French to imprison political dissidents and anyone else causing trouble for their regime. The bulk of the prison displays and information are more historical and focussed on this era of Vietnam's history. It starts with a description of the people who were displaced by the French in order to build the prison, and ends with a visit to the guillotine room, complete with one of the originals! The rest of the displays are from the Vietnam war era, (the American war as it is referred to here). A common flavour throughout the prison displays relates to Vietnams' struggle through history with being occupied at various times and their struggles against their oppressors, culminating in their ultimate victory. You develop a real understanding and sympathy for them here, although as I said earlier you can't take everything literally. Overall though, I would definitely say that no visit to Hanoi is complete without 2-3 hours at the Hanoi Hilton."

Whilst it's certainly acceptable to contest historical narratives, and indeed, for nations that have suffered under colonialism and invasion, it's essential, the portrayal of the Vietnamese as nothing more than heroic and innocent victims of historical misfortune, who themselves took no part in atrocities, is astounding, hypocritical, and wholly lacking in credibility. The majority of what's left of the prison (rather ironically, the remainder is now a plush 25 story serviced apartment building), is dedicated to the horrendous treatment of Vietnamese dissidents by the French colonialists. This is all done in an unnecessarily hyperbolic manner, that detracts from rather than emphasising the cruelties endured by the prisoners. There is then a large section celebrating the leadership and heroism of the leaders of the CPV who were imprisoned at Hoa Lo, but a lack of similar recognition for any of the more everyday people who entered and never returned. Without wishing to deny or diminish the role of these revolutionaries, narratives of the ordinary fighters involved in the struggle (or even those who were falsely imprisoned), would've added a far more interesting and palpable strata to the museum. The small section dedicated to the female prisoners goes someway to address this, but generally, the tone is very one dimensional, didactic, and context free - nothing is ever put into perspective - a huge failing for a place of remembrance. This second section is quite simply unconscionable propaganda. I'm not American, but I left feeling extremely angry at the manner in which the infamous 'Hanoi Hilton' was presented as a model prison, where the prisoners were treated with great kindness by their hosts, and even educated as to the ways of Vietnamese culture, as they spent their days playing chess, cooking, and whiling away the hours until they could head back home. It seemed surreal, a joke, which I kept expecting to be revealed as comparing the then propaganda against contemporary accounts. But the punchline never came, and the American POWs still face the indignity of not having their experience represented with any degree of accuracy at a monument purporting to be there as an act of remembrance for all of its victims.The final section is perhaps the most interesting part because it doesn't exist: how the CPV treated its dissident prisoners in Hoa Lo right up until the mid-80s."

Our guide was fine but as a youngster she was able to give a versionAcceptable to the party when it came to the treatment of US airman including John McCain. The reasons for their treatment whilst imprisoned was down to the indiscriminate bombing of North Vietnam. The sentence uttered \"if you are in prison you cannot expect to be treated well\", gave a true understanding of what went on. It is ironic therefore that the heavy criticism of the French was not evident in their own treatment of the U.S. Prisoners.

The Hoa Lo Prison was built by the French in the early 1900s to imprison Vietnamese revolutionaries, so about 90% of the prison is dedicated to their struggle. There is 1 room dedicated to the Americans there during the Vietnam War. I have done significant research and study on the American POWs in the Hoa Lo Prison, and unfortunately the Prison does not reflect ANY of the hardships the POWs faced. Granted, these hardships were in the hands of the Vietnamese. I understand that the prison is going to show the Vietnamese point of view, but the way they articulated and displayed the American experience in the Hanoi Hilton made it look as though they spent 7 years in a Vietnamese themed Disneyland. All that to say--make sure you do your homework before you go so that you know what is the truth about what happened there during the Vietnam War, as you will be misled if your only source of information is from the exhibits."

Part of the original prison had been torn down, but the remaining portion had been rehabilitated into a prison museum depicting its history during the French occupation and then the Vietnam War. We honestly had low expectations but found it to be educational and interesting. There's a definite bias against the Imperial aggressors here in the museum descriptions, but we expected that (note that angry/happy music choices in the different rooms). That doesn't mean anything though, as the front desk was incredibly pleasant letting two of us aggressors in.

Th French built the prison (known as maison centrale) for political prisoners and when you see the pictures and the story told you see the torture inflicted on the inmates. The mobile guillotine is still there. The prison became a breeding ground for the Communist party - at least 5 general secretaries of the party spent time in the maison centrale. The Norh Vietnamese used the prison for US POWs and it became known as the Hanoi Hilton. The American experience - compared to the colonial part - is shown as barracks which may not reflect the horror that was experienced by those who were kept there. If you are after first hand experience: John McCain spent 6 years there, he talks about his experience in his book 'Faith of my Fathers'. He was treated so badly that he was not expected to surcvive the experience. I left with the feeling that the colonial experience was depicted in all its brutality while the subsequent use during the Vietnam War was seen as a place less harsh. It is impressive, a large part was demolished to make space for the Hanoi Towers. There is a small courtyard to sit in the shade and to reflect. It was on my itinerary on the basis that the Vietnam War was the first war which I followed as a current event, not something I read about as history."

While there isn't an audio device offered at the museum, you can buy a small booklet that details the museum exhibits and watch some of the video stories being played out in different sections. The museum also was home to American soldiers for over a year till the treaty for their handover was signed post the war -- their living conditions being far better and humane than the living conditions for the Vietnamese in the same jail. This place oddly reminds me of Dachau -- the latter being scarier and creeping me out completely with its almost eerie silence and dampness. Would certainly recommend a visit to Hoa Lo, if not for touristic inquisitiveness but to honour those who gave up their lives in war and after."

Much is (rightly) made of the atrocities committed by French gaolers and American bombers, but it's resoundingly silent on any ill-treatment of American pilot POWs. Indeed, all photos are of the American pilots playing volleyball, having Christmas dinner, several of John \"I was beaten so badly in Hoa Lo that I can no longer raise my arms\" McCain looking perfectly content. Worth visiting, but research both sides of the story before going."

It was used extensively by the French powers to hold captured and arrested Vietnamese nationalist leading up to the eventual withdrawal of the French in 1954. Subsequently it was also used to house American prisioner of war during the Vietnam War. The displays are quite graphic and aside fromthe scenes of torture, the descriptions of the daring escapes are amazing.The message of the rise of the nationalist movement and the politics of communism come through strongly with many of the early activist being imprisioned yet still spreading the message and achieving solidarity within the confines of the prison.The real guoilletine display is a harrowing reminder of those harsh days.Its a great tribute to the rise of todays independent Vietnam."

Just grab a taxi, go there and spend at least 1 hour. You might end up staying there for almost two if you want to read all the explanations.The Museum is well explained in English as well and there are many materials to read.Recommended going there prepared. The old movie \"Hanoi Hilton\" is not a masterpiece and is not for sensitive people, yet it gives you an idea (from the US perspective) about how US prisoners used to live there. Before the US prisoners, the Vietnam dissidents to the French rulers were hosted here."

It is an cheap museum to visit and offers a long walk through the old prison (original built by the French colonizers and later turned into prisons or schools as the current times demanded).

Advisable for students to bring along their student passes so that they can get the discounted price (yes, international student passes are acceptable). I found the Hoa Lo Prison a very informative attraction. Very detailed explanations of its functions when Vietnam was a French colony, and when the Vietnam War happened. The cells were preserved very well, and you get the eerie and gloomy feeling when you walk into them, especially the death row cells. I learnt quite a bit about what happened in Hoa Lo Prison during the Vietnam War from the documentaries, though some info was framed in a one-sided manner.

Visiting this prison provides a valuable insight into the history of Vietnam both during the rule of the French and during the Vietnam War era of the 60's. Although the information may have bias to it many aspects of the prison provide a valuable insight as to how the French treated the local revolutionaries. It is interesting to hear the other side of the Hanoi Hilton as the US POW\"s referred to Hoa Lo Prison. In all probability the truth lies somewhere between the two sides versions. What is informative is the presentation of prisoners in chains, in cells that were overcrowded, etc. The presence of the guillotine and its use in decapitation provides the gruesome reality that befell many of the prisoners under the French. Although the prison is only a fraction of its original size it provides a more than adequate insight into the conditions that prevailed when it was in use. The murals in the courtyard are very interesting artworks. Well worth a visit."

The early rooms depict the horrific treatment of the early prisoners (Vietnamese, captured by the French who were shackled and guillotined). Following those rooms are the rooms devoted to American POW's during the Vietnam war. As usual there is a one-sided perspective to a multi-dimensional issue. The museum takes great pains to document what excellent treatment American prisoners received in this prison, being given cigarettes, Christmas celebrations, ample recreational opportunities, medical treatment etc--almost like a vacation!. They do actually have photos of some of this...so it reminds us there are 2 sides to every story and this is theirs."

As many official tourist sites in Vietnam, you have to try not to get irritated by the propagandistic style. If you manage to do that, a visit to the Maison Centrale, built by the French at the end of the 19th century, is well worth it. The exhibitions are done much better than simlar ones say 20 years ago. Information is in English and French and an informative booklet is available. The information gives a good idea about what life was like here for the Vietnamese revolutinary fighters. It is interesting how they managed to continue their communist teachings inside and apparently managed to keep up their spirits, despite the harsh conditions. Some managed to escape through the sewage system, but many died or were executed. When you have lived in Hanoi for some years, like I have, it is very interesting to see the pictures and read the stories about all the men (and some women) that have streets named after them, not only in Hanoi, but in all cities of Vietnam.There is much less information about the time the Viet Cong held Americans prison here during the Vietnam war (which the Vietnamese call the American war!). Although the Americans might not have lived under such a harsh regime as the Vietnamese did under the French, the short film about their 'happy' life in the 'Hanoi Hilton' seems very unlikely. A more realistic impression would have added to the otherwise interesting visit."

Hoa Lo Prison was built by French to arrest and capture the revolutionist lead by Ho Chi Minh President. Even Women and Children were there, i felt so bad when i go there and bursted into tears when I saw that.

For that reason, it probably helps to have read an outline of Vietnamese history in the 20th century first. The exhibits are well set out and with English captions. The large detention room filled with life-size models of shackled prisoners was particularly effective in dramatising the conditions that the prisoners endured. The section dealing with the prison's use for holding American prisoners of war is relatively small and, as other reviewers have noted, is put over in a somewhat different light, but is still fascinating for all that."

The prison has been reduced to about 1/8 of what it originally was (with the remaining area now a shopping mall!) but it's still a very interesting place to visit. What will be most interesting to North Americans is how the history of the war and the prisoners is depicted, even today. We were told how the American POWs were so happy to be in this prison and how they were treated so well they didn't want to leave. We heard how the brave Vietnamese people fought on and never gave up even as they lay dying they were fighting. Of course this flies directly in the face of the pictures of shackled prisoners and the stories of moldy food and sickness everywhere. If you go thinking you'll see the actual cell where Sen. John McCain was held, it's not there. That area of the prison is where the shopping mall was built. But there is plenty more to see. It's definitely worth visiting."

Most of the exhibits are dedicated to the time when the prison was owned by the French and the terrible times the Vietnamese revolutionaries suffered there. They are keen to point out that while incarcerated the communist prisoners never lost their resolve, despite the harsh treatment they received and were, of course, eventually victorious. A few rooms towards the end deal with the treatment of the American POWs that were housed there, some for as long as 6 years. These exhibits try to explain how well the American soldiers were treated and how many of them had come around to the Vietnamese (communist) way of thinking before they left (a stark contrast to the reports of torture and extreme hardship from the POWs themselves). Worth a visit but don't expect an even-sided treatment of events here."

Decades later, American war prisoners suffered at Hoa Lo, including later senator John McCaine and Pete Peterson, who came back to Hanoi i 1995 as the first US Ambassador to postwar Vietnam.Though, somewhat propagandistic, definitely worth a two hour visit, with many unique photos from the French as well as the American era."

I had expected bars with beer and wine, not iron bars across windows....Joking apart, the French history was fascinating, with a guilotine that said it all. The simple displays acted as an excellent backdrop to all the things that went on here over the years, culminating in the American Chapter at the end.Very interesting to overhear Americans who thought this would all be about the Viet War. Er no, there was much more history than the period 1965-1975!A must see for a couple of hours. I would say enjoy, but that would be totally crass."

I had read several reviews so knew what to to expect. I was pleasantly surprised on the amount of information in each room there was to read. It was rather chilling in places and I knew there information on the Americans staying there was rather limited and painted a rather different picture from the information on various internet sites. Some of the Audio headphones didnt work which was a shame as the information on the one we did use was informative. The entrance is off the main road so we did miss it to begin with, so be aware if following Google maps."

It was very hot walking around you can buy drinks but there's not a cafe on the site. The museum itself is very interesting to walk around, and with life size human dummies looks a bit eerie.

Some of the prison that existed in the past has been demolished but what remains of this old colonial building has now been turned into a museum. Most of what is on display documents not its use for American captives but rather its use by the French colonists who imprisoned, tortured and executed many Vietnamese during its long history. Inside many of the rooms are presented as they would have been in colonial times with waxwork prisoners bringing the story to life. The horrors of the prison in those times is well portrayed and documented. Many appalling instruments of torture are on display and the reproductions of the give a chilling insight into the Prison's past.In contrast, the section displaying the part where the American pilots were kept goes out of its way to show how well they were treated with old photos of the prisoners smiling and playing games. I am sure it was not all fun and games but there is a stark contrast between the Vietnamese treatment of the Americans and the French treatment of the Vietnamese.Overall, the prison is well worth the visit and is very well presented."

Much of it has been maintained in it's original condition which adds to the experience. Of particular interest is the section dedicated to the American aircrew that were held here in the \"Hanoi Hilton\". There are some artefacts from their stay and even the airsuit and plane parts from John McCain's plane that was shot down in a nearby lake.Like all visits in Hanoi it's not expensive, about 100VND (\u00a33).Well worth a visit and recommended."

In 1913 it was extended to hold 600 prisoners but at times up to 2,000 prisoners were held there. Many well known Vietnamese political figures spent time here during the 30's and 40's and the conditions were pretty appalling.The displays show the architecture of the buildings, how prisoners were held, the isolation cells, torture and execution tools as well as sewer pipes used as escape routes.The Vietnamese used the prison during the Vietnam war to hold POW's. What is interesting here are the displays of this era where propaganda has kept in showing a happy and comfortable environment. The truth lies somewhere in the middle of what both sides depicted.Only a small part of the prison remains today but it is well worth a visit. It is within easy walking distance of the Old and French Quarters. Entry fee is VND30,000."

So you will still find new things in this museum.What I really like is the main entrance of this museum - \"Maison Centrale\" and you really need to take a good picture at this entrance - as there's no good photo object at the museum (unless you want to take a photo of the readings).

That in no way takes away from the worth of Hoa Lo, and we feel the couple of hours we spent here were thoroughly well spent. Approximately 80% of the exhibits are given over to the time during which the French used the prison to hold those elements of the local population who were pushing for change, with the remaining 20% given over to the period following independence when the term Hanoi Hilton was coined and American airmen were held here as POW's. Whilst all the exhibits have captions in Vietnamese, English and French there are a number of documents from the period of French rule which are presented in their original French form and only translated into Vietnamese. This is something of a shame as the little French we know hinted at some interesting content, the bulk of which was lost on us. We Googled the 'Hanoi poison plot' and also read up on the perspective of American airmen regards their treatment at the prison over a coffee immediately after leaving.

As we have found with similar places in Vietnam, they assume a prior knowledge of the whole event and focus instead on smallest details (lists of names of prisoners who died, specifics on places that were held etc) without first giving an overview of the war or event it belongs to. English audio stations were all broken and a lot of the sources were displayed only in their original French, and Vietnamese translation with no English. However it is fairly visual and therefore thought provoking to walk around. Go if you are at a loose end, and maybe read up on it before-hand. Entry 30,000VND or 15,000VND with valid student card"

It's literally around the corner from the Vietnamese Women's museum so you can combine both in a morning or afternoon. The history behind the prison is incredible. First of all is was predominantly used to imprison Vietnamese inmates when the French invaded and tried to overrule the Country, then later it was utilised to house U.S and soldiers Vietnamese traitors captured in the American war. It's barely changed from those days of torture and the despicable conditions prisoners were subjected to and were forced to endure. Architecturally itself, the prison is impressive, you get a real sense of menace and if the walls could talk!!! There's a lot of information about the history of the prison and how it's changed through the years, along with sculptures, photos and manuscripts that will leave you fascinated. It's a must see place to visit in Hanoi and only a \u00a31 entry fee, you'd be doing the City a disservice by not making the time."

It may appear unbalanced but one suspects that the Vietnamese may harbour similar feelings about the traditional western view. That there is a different view and it is presented clearly and without much attempt to soften the message simply makes the difference more stark. And that is no bad thing as it challenges you to understand that all peoples in conflict have their own beliefs and desires. The museum makes good use of the remaining prison layout and buildings with the story being told from the building of the prison through to the present day. It is a bit shabby in places and some more details would be useful but the meaning is clear in most cases. Take a slow stroll round and you'll spend an hour or two gaining some understanding of what the local people feel they have been through. And some of the evidence is pretty clear, some less obvious. This is a museum for people who want to be given something to think about and worth it for that alone."

Fascinating though. But maybe arrange to meet those members of your party less interested in 20th century history somewhere afterwards."

As with Uncle Ho's mausoleum, a huge reason for its interest is the presentation of the content which talks a lot of the suffering of patriotic Vietnamese against the cunning and atrocious enemy (the French). Much of the museum focuses on the treatment of the Vietnamese at the hand of the French and the glorious resistance of men who went onto become leading lights of the Communist Party. Captions are in Vietnamese and English, so you get a detailed if wholly non objectives reflection on the war.The museum then takes a turn and has two rooms which document how well American troops were treated during the war. It seems that the statements Americans made under torture (which praised the treatment the NVA were providing them with) have been used as the foundation for this part of the exhibition. Because of this, alongside seeing some of the appalling conditions, Hoa Lo is well worth a visit. As with much of Hanoi's politically infused tourism, watch out for the propaganda, but use this to get more insight into the North Vietnamese mentality."

I was really looking forward to visiting this prison and seeing first hand the things I'd learned about that took place during the Vietnam war. About 90% of this museum is focused on how badly Feench Colonists treated Vietnamese prisoners. Only two rooms were dedicated to the U.S. POWs who were kept there for years on end, and almost all of the displays were propaganda that Vietnam put out during the war to showcase how comfortable and happy the US pilots were while there. Do your research on how the US POWs were actually treated before you go. Otherwise, it was well laid out and lots of well written English signage to read. The guillotine and the cells where death row prisoners were held were really macabre. Worth a visit, but do your research first."

A notable prisoner from it's latter use was John McCain (US Republican Presidential Candidate - lost to Obama first time round) whose flying suit is on display - he crash landed in the Hoan Kiem lake close by.

It's easier to breath if you are from Western countries but with Asians, sometimes it is really touched our hearts. I mean it. You will started to understand some parts of the very complicated war named Viet Nam.People often skip the upper level where located the list of all the people were imprisoned here, many of them after free from Hoa Lo held important positions in the Communist Government (some until present). There are limited services for food and drink but that's not a problem with a city like Hanoi, easy to find somewhere around. Interpreters are available or you can simply use the headphones at exhibitions place. Advise to spend around 2 hours and you can visit the Indochina Court nearby where people were judged (with no lawyers) before being put in prison during Colonial time (now is building of Supreme Court of Vietnam)"

Very good history of the prison, and they've kept the old buildings and cells which give it a real feel. Some funny fake people on display, and not much information in English but you get by. Very interesting display on the American soldiers staying there from 1968 onwards. By the information that is presented you'd say the soldiers had a great time and were treated like royalty, but other sources and accounts suggest that they were horribly tortured and mistreated. Overall a good visit and worth a few hours."

We hired a tour guide (highly recommend that one does this) who was able to give a thorough historical account of the prison that was originally built by the French to imprison the Vietnamese. It was then converted to imprison Americans during the Vietnam War. Seeing pictures of people such as Senator John McCain when he was first captured as a POW was powerful. The area is not that large-one level- and a self-guided tour is easy to do because there are several things to read. Having a guide with us allowed us to asked questions and for there to be a give-and-take exchange of the history of Vietnam and the cost of the occupations (by the French and the Americans) on the people of Vietnam."

Deeper inside the cell, there is a guillotine with a rusty, yet sharp blade, the only shiny item in this hell-on-earth. Standing in front of the guillotine, one cannot resist but to imagine the numbers of lives it had claimed in its \"heyday\", the blood split and the intense screaming in fear and agony associated with this men-made beast of death. Yet, it gets to out-live most of its \"old residents\". Today, it is still sitting there, intact, in the dark of Hoa Lo, mocking the visitors, startled, nervous and \"creeped-out\".

While the prison has a long history, including the internment of the Vietnamese by the French, the depictions of the US war ( as it is called in Vietnam) are completely bias and pure propaganda. Only a portion of the prison remains as most has been demolished for a new development, but the remaining portion appears to be representative depiction of the prison. Only two rooms are associated with the US war. One is a collection of photographs and news articles depicting demonstrations against the war from around the world and the second room includes photographs of US prisoners that show the prison as if it were a summer camp. There are pictures of men playing cards, playing volleyball and decorating a Christmas tree. All of which is totally propaganda and untrue."

But they takeaway the facts of what American soldiers endured in the prison, saying they recieved \"great\" treatment from the Vietnamese. Even the flightsuit of John McCain is fake said so by himself. Overall this was a waste of my 30,000 dong and hour.

Otherwise known as the \"Hanoi Hilton\" to Americans, the vast majority of this prison tour is dedicated to the oppression of the Vietnamese people by the French, who shockingly crushed the Vietnamese people, and in doing so, created the Communist movement that ultimately defeated the French and kicked them out of Vietnam. Some of the museum is dedicated to what Americans are familiar with -- the place where numerous POW's were held during the Vietnam war. It is interesting to see the treatment of the POW's from the Vietnamese perspective, which is basically that, considering that the captured pilots were looked at as mass murderers of the innocent Vietnamese, who just wanted to have their own country after years of colonial oppression, the pilots were treated very well. We know the other side of the coin, i.e., that the POW's were NOT treated well, and were kept in very bad conditions, but looking at it from the Vietnamese perspective, they feel that the POW's were lucky to be alive, considering what they were doing to the Vietnamese people. We came away from it realizing the skewed version, but having a new understanding of the Vietnamese perspective."

There is a real gruesome element to the prison's history that it doesn't quite capitalise upon, despite the presence of a guillotine. The exhibits rely on a lot of reading so perhaps an audio guide would be useful which would free visitors to walk around more. If you have the time to visit it whilst in Hanoi, definitely do so. It is a window into a world of which I had little knowledge."

Therefore, it's interesting to consider the motives and how that frames what you're seeing. This is true for anything, but especially museums and cultural institutions (and ads, but that's a different story). The prison museum here is presented for local and foreign tourists by the government of Vietnam. As a result, it unsurprisingly speaks from a pro-Vietnamese perspective, especially in support of the current political system and leadership. Again, not necessarily a negative thing and certainly not unusual for an institution to speak through the lens of its own country / company / mission. However, it's important to keep in mind as the messaging of the museum is two-fold:1. Vietnamese political prisoners were treated horribly by the French but were able to prevail anyway2. American POWs were treated well in spite of the awful war waged against Vietnam(And recognize the word choice used throughout the museum: imperialist, comrade, etc - not neutral language choices that are tied to specific perspectives)I'm not going to argue anything in regards to the validity of the French, Vietnamese, or American ideologies or actions. But I think it's good to remember these exhibits are all presented with a purpose and it isn't an objective analysis of what happened. Plus, from a historical perspective, there are a number of differences between the French / Vietnamese political prisoner situation and the American POW situation. One is time and numbers. The earlier (French political prisoners) was a much large quantity of people and earlier in time for a longer period of time, so inevitably that affected the resources and quality of life standards compared with housing less POWs in a more modern era. Second is that the French were actively in power in Vietnam at that time and were persecuting local threats to their power -- which explains (not excuses) the harsher standards. On the other hand, the Americans were imprisoned while the Vietnamese held power, and they were highly visible in terms of being known about to an outside world. They were an important political tool for Vietnamese and US relations, and it benefitted the Vietnamese government to treat them moderately well and especially to create photo ops to use to show their benevolence towards the American prisoners to their Vietnamese citizenry as well as the world. However, it's important to remember (as we should all well know given our almost universal individual experience nowadays to stage and take photos) that pictures aren't reality. Thinking about who took it and why is as important as what's in the photo. So it's definitely worth a visit as well as a reminder to think critically about what we see (and don't see), and to question the messaging we've heard before -- recognizing that every story has multiple perspectives and just as many versions of the truth. If you're suspicious or critical of this presentation of history, keep that in mind the next time you read something you agree with and remember that others may find it just as biased."

No wonder the French were held in less than favourable regard by the locals."

The prison is much more than a place where American servicemen were held. The French colonial power does not come off well in this place. Barbaric, uncivilised behaviour cannot be justified and I take my hat off to the strength of the Vietnamese people. The section on the American prisoners is also very interesting too albeit a little sanitised I feel. Well worth a visit."

In the history of Vietnam this was just a short brutal incursion by invaders who failed to observe the provisions of the Geneva conventions while the Vietnamese did.... It's good to see history written by the victors and very sad to see some very brave Americans trying to come to terms with the horror the bombing campaign and the use of chemical warfare agents did and continues to do.....

But the museum is very well organized, the exhibits are good and it is important to see for oneself the suffering of this piece of history--not only the American POWs who nicknamed it Hanoi Hilton, but also the Vietnamese revolutionaries who suffered so much under the French and were imprisoned here. Their bravery and persistence really come through. It is also so moving to see that first one group and then another could repeat cruelty. It gives good perspective that a casual tourist could miss on the long struggle of this country. My young adult daughter really found it eye opening."

I enjoyed thoroughly how the exhibition tried to bring out the fighting spirit of the Vietnam people when they were jailed and abused by the french people. And how they turn the tide around by making the jail a school of ideological teaching. This greatly aid in the revolution and independence of the country from the foreign forces. It gave insights into the life they were being treated and how they felt even when being sentenced to death. Eventually, it showed the people were pleased when they took it over from the french.The second part of the exhibition showcase the vietnamese using the same prison but this time, to put the American soldiers in it. They have justified that their retaliation was based on well founded need purely to respond to the threat of the U.S. They showed how they have cared for these pilots who were kept in this jail and how they treat them with kindness despite what they have done.Two things worth thinking about: One, how did the Vietnamese that were placed in the jail kept the spirit going despite the apparent oppression in jail by the guards. And two, how true is their point of view in comparison to the story the American have shared on their end about their soldiers. Before jumping into conclusion that it is propaganda, it is important to review the various articles and documents again. And this is something I'm looking to do. :)"

They've preserved only a portion of the original prison, but what is there gives you a good sense of what the prison was like under both French and Vietnamese control. It's not large -- an hour or so should be enough time unless you really want to soak it in. Words really do fail me when I try to describe the haunting experience of actually walking through the prison. If you've been to Alcatraz you can relate, but this was deeper for me. There is an artistic touch to how some of the cells are arranged (including some with \"manikin\" prisoners), and for the most part it enhances the experience without feeling artificial.Be warned - the storytelling is rich with propaganda: the French were nothing but blindly cruel, the American POWs were treated with nothing but kindness, and photos of POWs \"enjoying\" the generosity of their hosts are painful -- you can see the fearful forced smiles on their gaunt faces in the photographs. But even that aspect enriches the experience. My teenage daughter who is interested in world history found that to be the most interesting part. That said, do a little research before you go, so you can balance out the various versions of history.John McCain's flightsuit being proudly displayed - with stories of how his captors saved him and provided excellent medical care - caps off the experience."

The sign over the main entrance is the very same used in the 19th century and the guillotine can still be seen in one of the galleries. Tiny solitary confinement cells have been preserved as has the courtyard where American prisoners were allowed to take fresh air during their confinement. They jokingly referred to this prison as the Hanoi Hilton, and according to the propaganda machine, they were treated relatively well.

The men in shackles on small beds, torture chambers and even a guillotine from the French coonial days werre on display to curb anyones thoughts of breaking the law while visiting Vietnam. There was a small display dedicated to the women prisoners and I found the stories about these women very intriguing. The most interesting and somber part of the tour was the prtion of the prison dedicated to the captured American pilots during the Vietnam War. One of these POWs was John McCain and his uniform is on display. The Americans were said to be treated very well. This was astonishing, given the destruction and casualties depicted in the horredous video being played. There was no anti-American sentiment at this museum. I have heard other war museums are different in this regard, and that is why we opted to avoid those places. But the Hoa Lo Prison is an excellent stop and our favorite part of the Hanoi City Tour."

We love touring old prisons and something we have done a lot of back home in Australia so we jumped at the chance to visit the Hanoi Hilton - we attended with a guide from Hanoi Free Walking Tours which was a great addition to the tour. He was able to provide us further information beyond what was on all the signs etc. and was truly passionate about sharing Vietnam's history. It is unforunate that a large portion of the prison was destroyed to make way for modern buildings but what is left is certainly worth seeing for the history, living conditions and treatment of prisoners. It is also cheap to visit only 30,000vd per person which is great. Well worth a visit for anyone in the area!"

The darkness of what it once was can be relieved and there was a bit of a foreboding nature to it not unlike any other ex prison turned tourist attraction especially at the room that houses the death row inmates. It helped though that there were pictures of its former occupants and their letters and other mementos of what life was like back then coupled with a brief write up of them. I have the admit the English translation here is much better than those found in the Army museum.The only thing a bit jarring is the fact that there is a souvenir shop in between the cells that we were checking out. It'd be best if the souvenir shop is up front after all the cells are done."

The most interesting thing here is the propaganda video they show featuring the airmen's time spent in the prison. It's fascinating after 40 years they are still showing this and keeping the propaganda going. If you were a local visiting, and if you were of the mindset that communism was the nest thing for the country, then I have no doubt you would believe the video's story. Hopefully with the internet availability these days, even locals would do some research to realise the video is merely an interesting part of history and far from the actual truth.The prison can be viewed easily within 30 mins or less if you are in a hurry. You don't need to buy an english guide as all the signs on the displays feature both vietnamese and english on them. The bulk of the museum covers the late 19th century when Vietnam was still part of French Indochina. It was a gruesome place to say the least."

For example, if you look closelyat the pictures of them eating or playing chess, you can see that their uniforms are rather too large so you know they were not fed well and had lost weight.

The French and the Americans have left many fingerprints on Vietnam and this venue presents many of them. It tends to focus more on the French-Vietnamese history than on the American war. Truly, the prison must have been a dark and hopeless place for the male and female prisoners there. I felt the \"Hanoi Hilton\" part of the walk-through was presented quite clinically and sterile from the horrid stories I have read in the past but then I also recognize that government perspectives on its conduct is inherently misleading too. The architecture was interesting. The prison is now situated in what seemed to be a thriving part of Hanoi. Very happy I took the time to visit Hoa Lo Prison."

It took us a while to find the entrance as we had been given a poor map. The tickets were very cheap. Inside the prison there were arrows to direct you along the suggested tour route and information boards are in Vietnamese, English and French. All of the information boards were easy to read and very useful and both me and my boyfriend learnt so so much and the atmosphere really touched us.

The sections on the cruelties inflicted upon the Vietnamese by the French colonials were sobering and the courage of Vietnamese freedom fighters was inspiring. By contrast, the section chronicling the incarceration of American POWs was, by turns, a helpful reminder that America has inflicted real suffering on other peoples \u201cin the cause of freedom and liberty\", and yet, the same displays comically overlook the same cruelties that the Vietnamese captors inflicted on the POWs. The photos of American POWs gleefully opening their Red Cross packages, or engaging in healthy productive activities like playing basketball and growing their own chickens, are so obviously staged and long debunked by the prisoners themselves. And yet, it is a good educational experience to see how history is recast and manipulated, and well worth the price of entry if kids learn to ask if our own country doesn\u2019t do the same with its history."

Most of the exhibitions are based on how the French treated the Vietnamese, and in particular the revolutionaries, but there is one room dedicated to the U.S, pilots that were held there \"in the best possible conditions\" according to the information board!

While the treatment of American prisoners seems to be too good, the pictures and film showing the destruction of Hanoi and the casualties to innocent residents from the American bombings does merit watching. Draw your own conclusions. The Vietnamese people have definitely moved on.

Then we walk in and see the horrible treatment by the French of Vietnamese political prisoners. They go into detail how the French mistreated them. Then miraculously, the prison became a Holiday Inn as American prisoners were there. American prisoners were treated to their favorite sporting events such as basketball, volleyball etc... They even allowed them to play chess and make Thanksgiving and Christmas turkey. How nice the Vietnamese were to our American GI's right? Ask John McCain if he was treated so respectably. They have his pictures and uniform as trophies. They are sick! Then you are treated to a nasty little video again filled with such lies. Aren't Vietnamese people embarrassed by this distortion of the truth? A little child can easily see how horribly they present their lies. I'm ashamed I went there!"

Americans naturally think of it as the prison that held a group of American pilots during the Vietnam War. Its role as a site of gruesome torture and execution by the French of native partisans during the time of French rule may be less familiar and is far stronger stuff. As a commentary on the arrogance of colonialism and the grit that drove the native population to struggle for freedom and independence, it's important to visit. It will make you think about history and the current day as well. For me the most incongruous note - bizarre and jarring - was the mat at the front door that said \"Welcome\" in English. If it had been there in the past, and I'm sure it wasn't, it would have been the last emotion that would have entered the mind of a prisoner condemned to enter. Go here. It's important that you do."

You don't need a guide, it's all in English. I didn't buy the guide book and don't feel I lost out on anything. Would thoroughly recommend when you're here."

You can breath what went on there in the past. The stories are controversial and the Vietnamese claim they have the facts right. For sure the stories are great to listen to and one can make up there own mind what really happened there. The Mc Caine flightsuit is an attraction to most Americans. Its is for sure worth a visit and easy to reach by foot from the old quarters of Hanoi."

They have done a great job making the site engaging, I learnt a lot and would definitely recommend a visit whilst in Hanoi.

We were on a cycling excursion seeking history facts for a team competition. However when entering here, our feeling of competitiveness no longer survived because of so truthful the reality. In front of us were historical artifacts of both Vietnamese and American people. They were so reflective and obsessive about our national war, our national human and magnanimous tradition of fighting and protecting our country against invaders in the 20th century. What impressed me the most was images of life of Vietnamese prisoners which is manifested by statues locked in sllavery unable to move but sit all day. While the colonial empire made all efforts to diminish human's will by torture and punishment, our national heroes never gave up but followed Ho Chi Minh's ideology driven by absolute independence and human rights protection. Thanks for introduction of some tour guide that we followed during searching artifacts' images for our competition we had gained deeper understanding of history and its manifestation in here Hoa Lo prison. Some of my friends even got obsessed by the image of a guillotine. Anyway, we had learned alot and felt more proud of our people. Just wanna say thank you for everything!"

There is an exhibition space that features videos, artifacts and photos of the American War and the POWs. History buffs, including those researching peace movements or contemporary US-VN relations will find the display fascinating. Not least because visitors can see first hand what many western Cold War scholars often refer to as \"communist propaganda\".People who have marched against the recent Iraq and Afghan wars may find some of the photos of the international anti-war demonstrations fascinating.

What I learned was a great deal more! These people were subjected to the worst conditions imaginable by the French colonists in the late 1800's including torture, beatings, inhumane conditions beyond belief, starvation and beheadings. On display is the actual guillotine used in these horrific punishments! They also had on display, relics, memorabilia, artifacts, letters from the prisoners, uniforms, and more to view. Many Vietnamese political opponents were placed here as well. This place is well worth the visit if you are interested in prisons, the Vietnam War and viewing the conditions these unfortunate people were placed in.  Be forewarned, you will be viewing what the POLITICAL PARTY in Vietnam wants you to see. There are films running in place, depicting war film footage of American troops bombing their country. Newspapers from all over the world showing different nationalities protesting our occupation in Vietnam, including our own people. It also states that our prisoners were treated fairly and shows pics of them playing basketball, playing chess and smiling, etc. Not really reality, from testimonials from our own prisoners who stayed there.

Many of the political prisoners turned out to be leaders in the Communist government which won freedom from the French in 1954.There is a section if the museum telling the story of the war with America and treatment of downed pilots housed in the prison. The first part of the exhibit provided insight as to the perspective of Vietnam. The second half portrayed the \"excellent\" treatment of the pilots by their captors. The exhibit portrayed life in the prison for those men as fun, relaxing and educational.

In contrast, the two rooms that represent the American POWs are much brighter. The history is presented in a very Vietnamese light and all recounts are positive and almost lighthearted. If you forgot where you were visiting, you may believe the Americans were staying in a hotel dedicated to the Vietnamese culture and history. This representation is interesting in itself. It is a reminder that history is merely a recount of events that can be presented in very different ways. In addition, it is interesting to see the photographs and uniforms of the POW staying in the prison and to imagine how their experiences differ from the stories offered in the prison."

The displays are static (not surprising in a prison) and rather unexciting. A guillotine used by the French is on display and grisly. The courtyard is eerily like that at Kilmainham in Dublin. I found this an interesting site in its very genuine feeling about the treatment of inmates who were, depending on the time and the viewer, revolutionaries or terrorists, liberators or invaders.

Like most prison visits the Hoa Lo visits leaves you with an very eerie feeling, The somber music, claustrophobic cells, and in particular the recent use (1970's) of this as a prison brings home to you what prison life was like from colonial times right up to the Vietnam war. Conditions were very poor so some of the explanations can be distressing to people. During the Vietnam War, the prison complex was sarcastically nicknamed the \"Hanoi Hilton\" by the American POWs, in reference to the well-known Hilton Hotel chain probably why the Hilton Hotel in Hanoi goes by a different name!! This is my third time to visit hanoi but my first time here . Some of the areas in the Prison and some of the photographs are not suitable for small children. It's very reasonable to get in , children are free and if u don't have a guide with you buy the guide book at the ticket booth it's only 20000 dong ( about \u20ac.78 cent) .USA Senator John McCain was held here when he crashed in a lake in hanoi during the Vietnam war, his flight suit and parachute are on display. All the artefacts on display and any aurally have English and French translations . Worth the visit, behind the Somerset Grand Suites and close to old quarter so add it to your to do list for Hanoi."

There are places where it was a little interactive, and quite dark and spooky. I'm not a big fan osf actually seeing the seclusion facilities, but you can go into them, and you also get to see the sewer in which vietnamese escaped from this prison, when the french had colonised Viet Nam. I wouldn't call this place kid friendly, or disabled friendly. And it has a nice little garden you can sit in, to contemplate about the prisoners that died there. I would recommend in so far as to get a perspective on vietnamese history, but personally for me, prisons aren't my thing."

Only one room in the prison was dedicated to displays relating to the American pilots who were held there from 1964 to 1973. The displays included pictures of the prisoners (including John McCain) writing and reading letters, decorating a Christmas tree, playing ping pong, etc. It was much more of a propaganda display than a historically accurate museum.

It's hard to know how much of what they say abut how the French treated prisoners is true given the absurdest propaganda used to describe the treatment of the American prisoners.

In general I found the museum informative and somewhat depressing, clearly horrible things happened here, but overall the displays felt more interested in presenting a war-era one-sided propagandistic view of events instead of an even-handed view of history (i.e. were the political prisoners imprisoned for killing people which would justify their sentences? what were their 'crimes'?)."

What remains of it is interesting enough, with some interesting exhibits of preserved artifacts, such as the original guillotine used by the French. The models and artwork are also worth seeing. Be prepared for propaganda however. Personally I found that the museum oversells the suffering of the \u201cpatriotic revolutionaries\u201d whom the French had imprisoned and severely downplays the same treatment given to the captured American airmen. The prison would have you believe that the pilots named it the \u201cHilton\u201d in reference to luxury, rather than sarcastically in the midst of daily torture."

It seemed a given to go to Hoa Lo Prison on a visit to Hanoi. While I thought they did a good job of turning what has been salvaged of Hoa Lo Prison into a museum--it's clean, easy to follow, the signs are written in English--the bias regarding when the prison was used to house American POWs during the Vietnam War/2nd Indochina War shown in the photos and written on the placards was uproariously laughable. And yet that's what ended up being the most appealing aspect of the museum to me. I have learned quite a bit about the Vietnam War over the years from the education system in the States and my desire to seek out more knowledge and info about it through history books, shows, documentaries, a specific Vietnam class in college, etc. And, being an American, I've always seen it from the American perspective, which I'm sure is biased, but the bias here was just comical. Apparently the French colonists who imprisoned the Vietnamese revolutionaries (prior to the Vietnam War) were extremely cruel, and brutally tortured the Vietnamese prisoners and sometimes executed them. However, when it was the Vietnamese's turn to imprison American pilots who had been shot down, they were as sweet as pie. I am in no way suggesting that the Vietnamese prisoners were not treated cruelly and horribly, as I've no doubt that's exactly the case, but then to say the Vietnamese held American POWs in the way they described and provided \"evidence\" of was just crazy. There are several photos showing the American POWs playing volleyball, basketball and checkers, eating a veritable Christmas day feast, and watching movies. They portray the American prisoners as having a downright jolly time, as if they chose to be there and were treated like distinguished guests in someone's home. Interesting that a number of them later wrote about the horrors they faced and the cruelty that was thrust upon them during the years they were kept there. The photos, words and videos shown in the museum would make someone who doesn't know a) anything from the American prisoners' side and b) the horrors that are part and parcel of both war and POW camps would surely think the Americans all but fought tooth and nail and begged and pleaded to not be released in 1973 and instead live forever in the most glorious living situation complete with all the fun and games one would want and the friendliest, kindest service around. Again, having never seen a war museum from \"the other side\" and so blatantly from the other side, I found it really interesting. I guess whoever is writing history can, well, write the history."

This purpose-built prison was originally constructed in the late 1800's to house Vietnamese dissident political prisoners, and often torture them. Many of those dissidents went on to later become Vietnam political leaders after the french departed. Then it became important symbolically to the Vietnamese, and it was used was as an educational center for dissident indoctrination/training. During the war with America, it was used again as a prison, this time for shot-down and captured American pilots. The propaganda today at the prison is syruppy with many references to how well the Americans were treated during their captivity...something that clashes sharply with reports from those pilots released later. Nevertheless, this prison is an important piece of Vietnamese history and should be part of your visit to Hanoi."

I guess I had a bias (much like the prison itself) when going to the Hoa Lo Prison. After endeavors at the Killing Fields and S-21 in Cambodia a few weeks ago, from the hype I was hearing, I was expecting something hard hitting. Not the case. Seeing an old prison is neat in itself, but a good portion of it was sold or blocked off. The museum plays up the torture elements a lot more than what it appears as. The prison was used by French colonialists and this prison really is just like any other French prison during that time period. It's really nothing new or shocking that their prisons were notoriously uncomfortable and well beyond humane standards. Read the novel Papillion. But the prison really tries to paint a picture about the evil Frenchman targeting Vietnamese people. I don't think anyone condones the French attempts in colonizing Vietnam and imprisoning those who wanted independence, but something about it felt exaggerated and heavy on the propaganda. Once you get deeper into the war between Vietnam and the US, it becomes more prevalent. As a US citizen, it was an interesting experience seeing the war from the other side. It was humbling and embarrassing at the same time, but an experience worth going through. But then you get to the propaganda elements. They portrayed themselves as humane captors when imprisoning US soldiers, and they show footage of soldiers playing volleyball and just having a great time. They ignore the fact that John McCain has become somewhat popular for being a tortured Vietnam war vet who ran from president. As well, it doesn't take much research to see how many accounts there are about US soldiers being beaten and tortured at this prison. It's a little inaccurate on how they present the situation; near humorous. Overall, it was interesting to see, be it a little underwhelming. I wish it was a little more historically accurate and not a painted picture."

Despite being small, it does give a bit of the feeling of how it must have been there. We found it very interesting to visit. Parts of the story are explained by pictures and photographs and artefacts. Some prison cells are rebuild.A rather creepy part of the museum is the room with the guillotine used to behead many prisoners. The last part of the museum describes the times of the American \"guests\". This part of the story is obviously a bit coloured but interesting to see.For us, unfortunately, it was on the end of our tour and we did not have to much time. I could have spend between 1 and 2 hours to visit this small but very interesting museum. In my opinion a \"must see\" in Hanoi."

A quick look at photo's of the America POW's obviously \"enjoying\" themselves playing chess and putting up Xmas decorations and receiving first class medical care puts things into perspective. But once you start filtering and accept it for what it is , this is a fascinating place. There is no doubt that the Vietnamese suffered much during the Vietnam war years, and I don't want to get into a who was right who was wrong debate, but this in my opinion is a must see place.

Interesting enough to see, but way too much information on how the French ill treated the ' revolutionary patriotic' Vietnamese 'freedom fighters' during the Indochina period, and not enough unbiased information on how the American servicemen imprisoned were treated.According to this account, the USA service men were probably better off in this prison than with their families in the USA. Great food, football in the court yard, decorating christmas trees and having a generally having a great time. I think not. Time this display was updated to show how they were really treated in prison.Wiki states this:'The Hanoi Hilton was one site used by the North Vietnamese Army to house, torture and interrogate captured servicemen, mostly American pilots shot down during bombing raids. Although North Vietnam was a signatory of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949, which demanded \"decent and humane treatment\" of prisoners of war, severe torture methods were employed, such as rope bindings, irons, beatings, and prolonged solitary confinement. The aim of the torture was usually not acquiring military information; rather, it was to break the will of the prisoners, both individually and as a group. The goal of the North Vietnamese was to get written or recorded statements from the prisoners that criticized U.S. conduct of the war and praised how the North Vietnamese treated them. Such POW statements would be viewed as a propaganda victory in the battle to sway world and U.S. domestic opinion against the U.S. war effort. In the end, North Vietnamese torture was sufficiently brutal and prolonged that virtually every American POW so subjected made a statement of some kind at some time. (As one later wrote of finally being forced to make an anti-American statement: \"I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine.\") Realizing this, the Americans' aim became to absorb as much torture as they could before giving in; one later described the internal code the POWs developed and instructed new arrivals on as: \"Take physical torture until you are right at the edge of losing your ability to be rational. At that point, lie, do, or say whatever you must do to survive. But you first must take physical torture.\"'This is the message that should be shown at this prison - not the current propaganda, which is a disgrace to the memory of the USA POW's who served time here."

Although it had been a prison, renowned for the tortures perpetrated on its inhabitants, for many years under French rule, I think most people remember it as the home for jailed captured US and allied fliers. Through exhibits-a guillotine, for example, and use of actual prison facilities, cruelty, hardship, and deprivation are depicted in the prison's early days. Journals, photos, and artwork show causes of death, notorious inmates, and the change in prison life through time. Much space is devoted to demonstrating how well allied airmen were treated during their stay. They are shown eating vast quantities of food, decorating Christmas trees, and exchanging gifts with prison officials. Official documents proclaim that US airmen were treated better than the Vietnamese people in general. Not so subtly, a common theme-one with which many of us, to this day, agree- permeates that section of the museum: allied airmen should never have been there in the first place."

Completely built by the French to use against Vietnamese political prisoners, there are small death row cells, awful torture devices (including an oil barrel with a gasoline can sitting next to it), and something that looked like a bamboo torture rack. Seeing the guillotine there, knowing that it had actually been operational, was ghastly. (The lighting in the room casts an eery shadow onto the ceiling.) In several places, carefully molded statues depicted the Vietnamese prisoners. In one room, they lay together on a wooden platform with their feet locked in place by shackles. Only two rooms were about the \"American War.\" John McCain's flight suit is hanging in a glass case in one of them. Looped videos in both rooms play scenes from the better (latter) days of the war, when the guards let the prisoners raise chickens for food, play games, and celebrate holidays. The display can tempt you to disbelieve the stories of torture reported by returning veterans that actually reflect conditions in the early years of the war. There is a serene memorial upstairs to hundreds of Vietnamese political prisoners killed by the French between 1908 and 1954. For each one, the full name (if known), year of death, place of origin, and year of death are listed on large golden tablets."

A dark disturbing place but a MUST visit for any historians and anyone that opposed the Vietnam War during the 1960's. The feelings evoked are how cruel human beings are to other human beings. Go do something uplifting after your visit here."

This is not the whole prison, but just a corner of what was a larger complex. Thematically it is divided into three concepts: one outlining what a ghastly place this was for the brave freedom fighters for fifty years leading up to the expulsion of the French, next outlining what a wonderful place this was for the American aviators who stayed as honored guests during the American war, and finally a shrine to all the heroes of the revolution. Frankly, I cannot speak to the third concept, but the first two are interesting for their use of and manipulation of real history to fit the regime's rhetoric.The French, true to the traditions of European colonialism, were certainly brutal when it came to insurrections. I would not want to be incarcerated in the the conditions I saw there. In all the photos of the guard corps, only the very top echelon were European.I would also not want to have been incarcerated there as an American, no matter how humane it was. Or wasn't. Information boards tell of how men who had only ever been taught to rain destruction were given new, valuable skills like cutting hair, or possibly sweeping courtyards, and how they left with gifts and goodwill.There is no nuance in the story told by the prison, so it comes off as a one-dimensional narration, or more simply, propaganda. It is still worth seeing to appreciate what all the prisoners went through in as much it can be interpreted. The prison could be much more effective if the narrative were changed a bit, without becoming apologetic to the French or the Americans."

Examples of the ancient pottery tradition were on display. A lot of different angles are explored in the museum, although most of the physical prison is gone. We were especially interested to see where McCain was held but only his pilot uniform was on display. A few examples of the torture devices used by the French on Vietnamese anti-colonists. Very sad portrayal of the political prisoners' plight from that time. The slant on the US POWs made it look like they were having fun at a Hilton (playing basketball, chess, smiling). Yeah, we'll, John McCain and Ernie Brace's accounts, it actually was not a heck of a lot of fun. Excellent National Geographic video on the web provides an excellent insight into what it was like for American POWs. The death row cells were pretty scary for our 11 year-old. Inadvisable place for young children.If you want to get a deeper understanding of the prisoners' plight in the 1960s and 70s in Vietnam, visit the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. It's excellent but loads of horrible images and torture devices so probably want to skip with young children. Phu Quoc Prison, in the island of that name off the southern tip of Vietnam is really good. Also scary for young children. Very graphic."

The women's section of the prison was tiny as was the area where prisoners were kept prior to execution. There's even a guillotine in the prison which was used to behead prisoners.During the Vietnamese war the prison was used to house US pilots shot down. A number of US airmen were kept in the prison leading them to call it the \"Hanoi Hotel\".

Before you go however do take the time to read a little about the prisoners stories on line, as it is very hard to witness people exclaiming how well the american airman lived their lives here. Remember the information being displayed has been curated by the Vietnamese so you are doing a dis service to the previous inmates by only seeing one side. You can easily google John MaCain which should lead you to other stories."

We had the added benefit of a local guide who was both fluent in English and excited to share its history with us. History, that is, as it is taught in Vietnamese schools today. Our guide was a 25 year old young lady who couldn't have been more proud of her country. Rightfully so, but unaware of the true history of Hoa Lo under NVA administration during the Vietnam conflict. I held my tongue during our tour and simply absorbed all it had to offer. Even with the misrepresentations of American prisoners quality of life, it was a tour worth taking. Senator John McCain had been in Hanoi the week before our arrival. I'd sure love to hear his thoughts. Not sure if he's been back to Hoa Lo since his first 'visit', but his memories may not parallel the history presented today."

The outdoor memorial walls with sculptures are worth a visit, too. In short, if you are interested in history, this is a must see placeFor Americans, this might be a hard place for them since the two last rooms displaying American pilots ' daily activities in the prison and a board of information and a documentary movie about \" imperialist American\" bombing North Vietnam.

The Hoa Lo Prison was an interesting visit that got me away from the temples and museums.I am an American and felt that I should definitely visit this place. I was not disappointed. It is a major part of rather recent American history that does not get taught in our schools. All prisons are creepy and this one is no different. To see how the prison was first used by the French to house Vietnamese dissidents was eye opening. The conditions were deplorable. They have several rooms set up with life sized prison statues in cells and shackles so you really get a sense of the horror of this prison.After the French left Vietnam the prison was used in the American War (Vietnam War). The Vietnamese don't call the war the Vietnam War, they call it the American War. The artifacts that I saw that really brought the prison home were the pictures of John McCain and his flight suit. John McCain was shot down near Hanoi in 1968 and spent several years here.The museum paints a picture that life was pretty good for the Americans inside. They raised their own chickens and cooked their own meals. Played basketball and volleyball. Got to celebrate Christmas. I am not sure if the American soldiers that were held captive here would agree.All in all, you should check this place out if you have the time, especially if you are American, French, or a history buff.There is one review here by Pisith that says, \"You will understand why Vietnamese Hate Americans.\" He could NOT be further from the truth. I felt nothing but love from the Vietnamese from HCMC to Hanoi. It is uncanny how friendly they were to me. I could easily understand it if they were hateful towards me, but that was not the case at all. I spent a month there and loved every single minute of it. My favorite thing about Vietnam is the people and the constant smiles they have on their face."

Hoa Lo Prison, more \"affectionately\" known as the Hanoi Hilton, resonates with Americans as the place where John McCain and other US prisoners were held during the Vietnam War, but the prison was \"home\" to Vietnamese incarcerated by the French as well as by the Vietnam government. The various exhibits show how prisoners were treated and often tortured by their captives - guillotined in some cases by the French, chained in narrow quarters with other prisoners, with no toilet facilities or ability to move around. It seemed as though American prisoners of war may have faired better than others - playing games, exercising in the courtyard, and generally living in better conditions than others. Our guide talked about how his mother was incarcerated here, while he was fighting on the Ho Chi Minh Trail for the country. Authorities thought she might have hidden money and wanted her to reveal where. Exhibits are well done and give a good picture of the suffering different prisoners had to endure at different times in Vietnamese history. As you walk through different rooms, read the stories and watch videos and visual exhibits you cannot help but be moved. This is definitely a must for visitors."

If you are an American with a connection to the Viet Nam war era, interested in military history or the events that shaped Viet Nam, you should come here.Known to Americans as \"The Hanoi Hilton\", the place where U.S. fighter pilots were brutally imprisoned, the Hoa Lo Prison is now set up as a museum to what the Vietnamese call \"The American War.\" The museum features a collection of historic artifacts from the war era, photographs with explanatory text in Vietnamese and English as well as some archival footage. The slant of the narrative is clearly pro-Vietnamese/anti-American, giving you a perspective of the war that most Americans lack, that of the Vietnamese defending their land against an American invasion. Dioramas recreate the conditions for a prisoner; they look pretty brutal, down to the irons on the ankles. For me, the high point - an emotional punch to the gut - was seeing U.S. Senator John McCain's flight suit behind glass.The experience is definitely no-frills/low budget, but powerful at the same time."

I felt a bit cheated that I had paid money to visit a place which can so shamelessly lie to it's audience. How they can expect anyone to believe their version of how they treated American POWs is beyond me. I think the sole use for this museum must be for the Vietnamese to 'teach' their own about how they have suffered through the hands of various invaders through the years, but this surely shouldn't be for outside visitors to see. I guess it's interesting to see propaganda up so close and personal, that is about the level of the experience. I really wouldn't recommend this so-called 'museum'."

Signposting is a little vague, but you get there in the end.99% of the visitors were westerners when we visited, apart from a uniformed contingent, who came into the American War room and pushed to the front. The privileges of rank I guess. The vast majority of this museum is not related to the American war (there are two rooms on that). There is quite a bit with information boards in English, but not all of it. If you've been to the War Remnants museum in HCMC, (to which it does NOT compare at all) then you'll recognize a lot of the photos too.We spent the majority of the time in the two American rooms, which talk mostly about the life of leisure that captured American POW's had during their stay in the Hanoi Hilton. You'll also get to see John McCains flight suit and lots of photo's of the great time they all had, plus several propaganda videos.Overall, I'm glad we visited, but feel disappointed with the \"that's it?\" feeling.

Hoa Lo Prison has played a significant part in Vietnam's history, both in the French colonial period and during the war with the US. I found the prison a little difficult to find, but that was maybe just a consequence of my poor map reading skills. There was a small fee to enter, 15,000 Dong (about \u00a35 or $7), and I spent about an hour and a half going through the part of the prison that remains, and found it an interesting, and at times moving, experience. Two sights particularly stuck in my mind: The gruesome guillotine used to behead Vietnamese revolutionaries during the French colonial period; and Senator John McCain's pilot suit and parachute. The latter's memoirs give a different version of events regarding the treatment of the US prisoners, as their treatment was portrayed to resemble life in a real 'Hanoi Hilton', the ironic term used by the US inhabitants of the prison then. However, if a pinch of salt is taken, then this is still an important place to visit while in Hanoi where much can be learnt about the difficult history of the city and the country. One impression I took away from my visit was the Vietnamese do not feel that they have been defeated in either of these two struggles.

Some of the cells have been preserved and they emphasise the inhumanity of the French prison masters and contrast this with the hospitality extended to US POW's. It was amazing to see pics of McCain, and his air force jump suit is on display. Also quite blood chilling to encounter a fully functional guillotine !! Allow two hours and do visit."

The impression that you are given is that the prison was built by the French for the suffering of the Vietnamese, and I have no doubt that it was a hellish place. The bit that I found a wee bit irksome was the almost small-print-like part of \"oh, and we had a couple of Americans here but we made it a bit of a holiday camp for them!\" I get that there are always two sides to a story, and somewhere in the middle is the truth, but when you have seen pictures of when the pilots were captured, in comparison to when they were released, there is no doubt whatsoever that they haven't been having as great a time as the propaganda photographs would have you believe. I think what I am saying is this - go on YouTube and watch a few documentaries about the Hanoi Hilton, then when you visit the place, trust me, read between the lines and it makes for an even eerier experience."

However in the last half they spoke about how bad American soldiers were for bombing Hanoi but how well they were treated while kept in Hoa Lo Prison. This is far from the truth as they were kept in the same cells and bound in the same foot shackles as the Vietnamese did all those years earlier.

A diorama in the prison shows how the prisoners were usually shackled to the floor where they could easily be beaten by guards. Vietnamese prisoners were also executed here by use of a guillotine which is displayed near the prison\u2019s infamous dungeon. The prison was later used for American POWs, usually pilots caught when their planes went down. Most of the prison was demolished in the mid-1990s for commercial use. Only part of the prison exists today as a museum. The displays mainly show the prison during the French colonial period, including the guillotine room, still with original equipment, and the quarters for men and women Vietnamese political prisoners.

The French were brutal to them and the Vietnamese were model jailers to the American POWs. Suspect accuracy notwithstanding, it is undeniable that the French treated their colony with an iron fist. It is also pretty amazing how much of the American POWs was preserved. Even what they claim is John McCain's flight suit is there.

Interesting in a number of ways. Firstly the set up is more like a city prison, which of course it is, but it seems like a relatively small prison whilst it covers many more conflicts in Hanoi's history beyond the American War. Secondly the building layout is intriguing. There's not so much a run of cells as opposed to various areas for different activities and as such the display areas and information do a great job of describing what went on when the prison was active. The other interesting issue here was for me to compare how the prison describes the treatment of its prisoners, particularly the American prisoners, with that of the prison we visited on Phu Quoc Island. Hoa Lo Prison was a north Vietnamese prison and so held, amongst many others, American prisoners. Phu Quoc was south Vietnam and held North Vietnamese prisoners. Now I fully appreciate that no one really knows what went on in these places unless you were there and I also am sensible enough to know that what is depicted in the west is also not necessarily true, but the contrast in how prisoners were treat from the north and south of this wonderful country, even with an open mind, is hard to believe. In Phu Quoc the North Vietnamese prisoners were caged and tortured as we are told whilst here they celebrated Christmas if we believe the messages and pictures on show. I find this hard to believe in both instances. Not necessarily turning this around the other way, but certainly not to the extent that the north Vietnamese are portraying themselves as being victims in one sense and humble peaceful guards in another. I don't know the truth with these places and nor will I ever find out. I am not for or against either side but would wish to have a little more equality in what is presented to me. A view maybe from both sides, something which I also found difficult to comprehend with the museums in Saigon. Still, this is an interesting place nevertheless and I enjoyed it really."

It's quite an interesting place to visit. I suggested all visitors came with an open mind. Grasp as much info as you can and filled in the void with other extras research or reading on your own. After the visit, I'm sure you'll have a little bit more knowledge about the prison and the history before you stepped inside the prison. Again, visit with an open mind :)"

            "review": "Please Spare Time to Visit. First of all, I want to acknowledge the reviews that says there is propaganda in many of the displays and captions. I love history and the only reason many people don't swallow the ones here as easy is because it's not at all subtle especially in stark contrast of what is being taught in the Western Schools. Yes, there is propaganda but I have no doubt there were some too in every school's history books so visit this place, read and absorb everything here with a pinch of salt because really unless you've lived it no one really knows the truth. Come here to learn about what the Vietnamese had to go through during the French Colonization and American-Vietnamese War.This museum is located behind Somerset Grand Hanoi - in fact Somerset Grand Hanoi stands on where more than half of the prison used to be. I've never found a clarification of where this part of the prison was intentionally taken down or otherwise.Upon entrance you turn right and you will be greeted by photos of the building during different periods, a map and a diorama. The original prison door is on display in one of the earlier rooms. Next is items during the daily lives of the prisoners, clothes, bowls, shoes, etc and the next room is where they kept the prisoners - two stages on either side of the room where the prisoners would sit and their ankles would be in chain. The toilet is at the end of the room - on a stage too. It wouldn't have been very pleasant for them. Outside there is the sewer doors on display, the prisoners went through this to escape - it is tiiiiiiny, probably about 20cm by 35 cm.Right after the souvenir shop is where I think where you can start to question the objectivity of the museum, they display photos from around the world where demonstrations were help in opposition of the war. After a couple more exhibition space it gets a little bit graphic where the guillotine is displayed.This is a very interesting museum to visit, I think it's a little pricier than other places of interest in Hanoi (we paid VND 100,000 per person, about $5) but I reckon this place is well looked after. It's a strong reminder that war never benefits anyone."

It was also a shame as there was no real explanation as to why Vietnamese political prisoners were imprisoned here. The prison itself was great and is located in a lovely old building that has that colonial charm. For me the highlight were the cells for the condemned, I had stopped reading the propaganda signs by this time however I still found this part of the prison was really creepy.

Irrespective of your belief of this, it is still interesting to see the story told in this way.The atmosphere feels 'heavy' particularly in the large cells where there were prisoners shackled together & there are some other exhibits of smaller cells which may make you feel somewhat claustrophobic.

The place was a fascinating reminder of the suffering, and both mental and physical torture during Vietnam's long history. Executions were rather common (the guilotine gave me the creeps). The H\u1ecfa L\u00f2 Prison was built by the French colonists in Vietnam at the end of the 19th century to hold their Vietnamese political prisoners who were agitating for independence. The French called the place Maison Centrale or Central House, a euphemism for prisons in France. When first built in 1896, its maximum capacity was meant to be 460 inmates but by the time the French colonists left in 1954, conditions in the prison had become so miserable that more than 2,000 people were held under inhumane conditions. During the Vietnam War, North Vietnam imprisoned the American POWs in the same building. Maybe the conditions were no longer as appalling as during the French colonial times but definitely, there were still torture, indoctrination, poor food and unsanitary living conditions. When I was walking along the corridors of this museum, I had to remind myself that propaganda was still very much alive in Vietnam today. After all, the Vietnamese were the ones that had chased out the French in 1954 and won the American War in 1975, and that was all that mattered to them."

There's no denying that this historic prison was the site of brutal mistreatment and oppression - the atmosphere feels heavy - particularly when walking through the dark communal rooms where prisoners were shackled together & the smaller areas that feature claustrophobic cells. Be aware that there is a guillotine, some graphic photos, and it's quite dark and \"creepy\" feeling in some parts. It's worth visiting because you get to walk throughout these rooms- and see some of the artifacts used during the French era & American-Vietnam war era. The descriptions are written in French and English, but they're short and don't give a lot of background information other than stating what each item was used for. As mentioned in previous reviews, you should also be aware that there is, unsurprisingly, a lot of propaganda, particularly when depicting the very humane treatment of American POWs. You will see black and white photos of them decorating a christmas tree, smiling as they send letters home, and being examined by doctors when ill. One of the most 'interesting' pieces was one POW's christmas artwork featuring santa clause on some sort of christmas train... if you've ever seen Vietnamese drawings, this piece matches the same very specific style of drawing most Vietnamese students are taught to draw in school. Overall, if you're in Hanoi and debating about going to the prison, I believe it's worth the visit. It's very close to the Old Quarter, historically significant, and it's certainly interesting. Other info: It's cheap ($2), air-conditioned (a sweet, sweet escape from the stifling heat), and it took us about 1 hour to go through (but could be done in 30 min.)"

Focuses more on displaying a collection of random artifacts than it does on giving an understandable chronological history of what happened at the prison over the course of history (Other than the fact that it was generally a terrible place to visit at any point in time including the present). Half the displays at the prison show artifacts indicating the horrors of the French colonial period, and then the next exhibit is memorabilia from the Vietnam war and celebrates the French as moral allies and supporters against the US. No explanation of how things changed. I would read up on your history before coming here otherwise you will find it just as boring, depressing and confusing as I did. There are much better ways to spend your time in Hanoi."

Pull aside the curtain of propaganda, and the visit of Hoa Lo is more than interesting. The building is well-preserved and one can get a feel of history in it. The prison is big and full of narrow alleys, a big courtyard and an upper floor. The guillotine is better preserved than the one at the Conciergerie in Paris.

What was once a pottery-making community turned into a prison where the French imprisoned and tortured the Vietnamese during their colonization. While only a fourth of the actual building remains, the prison has been turned into a visually-engaging museum of what life was like for prisoners. 3D dioramas of prisoners, torture tools (including a guillotine), and other remnants of the prison's horrific past are on display. While plaques are located near all exhibits describing what you're seeing, you walk away with more questions than the museum answers. Some exhibits seem a bit propagandist, but with reason. A portion of the museum describes its use during the Vietnam-American War, when American B-52 bombers were shot down and their pilots were imprisoned. Nearly all American prisoners made it out alive, and were treated far better than the French treated the Vietnamese. Images of elaborate Christmas dinners and American pilots enjoying hobbies in the prison grounds make sure to point this out. Give yourself an hour here. For under <$2, it's certainly worth a visit. Reading the plaques and the way information is presented gives you an eye into the Vietnamese perspective on both French occupation and the Vietnam-American war, so spend some time doing so. A guidebook is available for about a dollar, which might be worthwhile in providing the background I felt the museum was missing."

The \"documentaries\" that are shown in this section describes how humane they were to the US airman that were unlucky enough to be captured in North Vietnam. According to the documentaries, it was just like being in a holiday camp. Hence the name given to it by the US servicemen - \"The Hanoi Hilton\".

Photos, letters and clothing worn by John McCain (US Senator) after being shot down and rescued from the West Lake before spending time in the prison. The photographic exhibits would indicate the US soldiers were treated much better than the locals caught fighting against the French colonial rule.

It was interesting to learn of the history of the prison before it became famous for Americans as the \"Hanoi Hilton\". As expected, the \"history\" of the prison, vis-a-vi its American POWs was a complete and utter sham. Expect lots of propaganda and bashing of the American \"Imperialists\" and \"Invaders'. On display is what is supposed to be Senator John McCain's flight suit that he was wearing when he was shot down and dragged to the prison, where he stayed for over five years. Only it is a fake, according to Senator McCain. Also, the constant claims that the American POWs were treated humanely and not tortured flies in the face of much evidence to the contrary. The POWs all claim they were systematically tortured and many have scars to prove it. While the museum claims that the French indeed tortured Vietnamese prisoners, they claim it was a regular \"picnic\" for the American POWs. They have staged photos of the POWs playing basketball and even decorating a Christmas tree. An online website review of the prison is recommended as it is a pretty accurate description. At $1/person, the entry fee is well worth it, in spite of the laughable propaganda job. As the saying goes, \"History is always told from the perspective of the victor.\""

POW is a good read to study how these men suffered terrible torture and hardship. How Senator Cain came out so tolerant is amazing. Check out his signature in the visitors book.All prisons are tragic places but this one is very important for many.What is amazing is that they did not shoot the downed pilots out of hand and that they are so welcoming to all westerners today.I honour the Vietnamese fir their tenacity in the face of horrible bombing and destruction but I also honour the suffering of all the political prisoners that suffered in the Maison Central.:-("

Had high hopes for this place and it was just ok. Dont go out of your way to see it but if you are knocking around the area its worth 15 minutes of your time"

You really feel bad for the people who lived and died in this prison. The presentations are very informative and pretty biased in their \"explanations\" of their version of history. However, it is sort of expected.They did have pictures of U.S. pilots who where shot down and kept in the prison and even had pictures of those same U.S. pilots enjoying their time at the prison playing basketball and playing cards... yeah right! As mentioned, I was part of a private tour and I actually become frustrated by our guides \"version\" of OUR aggression and invasion of their country and how they were victorious against the U.S. She actually went out of her way to state that \"our\" agent orange was still causing birth defects to this present day. Needless to say.. no tip for her!This is a must see if you are in Hanoi, simply because of the history here.I advise to avoid if you have small children."

In Europe and the USA we probably know Hoa Lo Prison by the nickname 'Hanoi Hilton' coined while it was used from 1964-1973 to imprison US pilots captured during the Vietnam War. The prison was originally built at the end of the 19th century by French colonialists on the site of a craft village renowned for the quality of its earthenware. Some of these pots, dishes and kettles are on display. You'll also see the guillotine imported from France and the original entrance door with its huge locks and bolts which were also specially imported. I defy anyone not to be moved almost to tears by the sight of rows of shackled prisoners in one of the large detention rooms. These figures have been crafted so finely that they appear almost lifelike. The French reckoned the prison was the most secure in Indochina but even so 100 political prisoners escaped over six nights in 1945 and you'll see sections of the sewer through which they got away. Also on display is the flight suit worn by pilot Major John McCain (a future Senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee). Photographs give the impression that captured US pilots enjoyed a comfortable incarceration so if you want an inmate's view of life inside the 'Hanoi Hilton' I suggest you search out McCain's memoir to read when you get home. There is an informative guidebook and plenty of information panels throughout the building, obviously written from a Vietnamese point of view. Putting the propaganda aside, a visit to this place is a stark reminder of man's inhumanity to man and I'd highly recommend it. Entrance is 20,000 dong (1 US dollar) and opening hours are 8am to 5pm every day including weekends and holidays."

While both of us have a strong anti-war sentiment, the dose of Vietnamese propaganda was repulsive, ie. their displays of \"kindness to POW's\" \"we the Vietnamese treated our uninvited guests well\". Whatever happened to the fact it was \"the Vietnamese against the Americans\" it was also the North against the South Vietnam? I went back to our hotel and read Senator John McCain's writing about his reality of time as a POW in Hoa Lo. If they are going to post so many photos of him in the Prison and his jump suit and personal effects on full display, he deserves to be able to share about his torture at their hands, no? Nothing is good about war, but I can't get over how Vietnam is so comfortable still spewing what is obviously Communist lies and propaganda. I regret spending money for the entrance fee."

This prison, maybe more well known as \"Hanoi Hilton\" or \"Maison Centrale\" bears testimony of the colonial years when Vietnam was a part of the French colony of Indochine. And it shows that life was pretty hard in the colony, I guess that is nothing special for Indochine, but was pretty standard for all colonies.Not the whole prison has been kept but a part of it. Here you'll find authentic prison cells and photos from the time when the prison was in full operation. There is a guillotine on display and also stories of prisoners actually making the escape. As most of the history in Vietnam seem to be about the US war it is actually interesting to find a piece of history from another time!Please visit!"

The museum is mostly to showcase torture/brutality of the Vietnamese political prisoners by the French, including a guillotine. A very small room is dedicated to the American POWs and shows games of basketball and happy Christmas celebrations. We were even told that the prison was a place to keep the POWs fed and healthy for the duration of the war. Having read a number of accounts written by these POWs which detail instances of serious brutality and torture, something does not jive. Those inaccuracies (which then led us to question the accuracy of the rest of the museum), coupled with the small size / dim lighting (it was a prison, so not surprising), I wouldn't say that this is a must visit in Hanoi. However, entrance fee is minimal, approximately 1 USD equivalent, and it's easy to get through in under an hour."

The large and gloomy prison, for which there IS now a small entry fee, was used by the French to imprison uncooperative Vietnamese in the colonial period and then its second incarnation to imprison shot down American pits in the Vietnam War. While I have every sympathy for the Vietnamese because their history of being invaded and abused by a wide variety of foreigners, the propaganda here is a bit blatant. Yes, I have no doubt the French treated prisoners here badly ( a fact brought to life by the array of life-size dummies in the cells and the looming threat of the guillotine in a room nearby) , but to contrast this with the alleged model treatment of American pilots is, well, just propaganda. One may well understand the anger felt towards these pilots but the so-called model treatment of these pilots was just for show- you only have to ask Senator John McCain, former presidential candidate, who had both his arms deliberately broken here. But the whole place gets its message of man's humanity to man across quite effectively nevertheless. And the extensive photography and collection of objects assists this well."

The museum does a decent job of showcasing the devastating effects of the American air assault over Hanoi and other places in the country and then the use of the prison to keep captured American soldiers, John McCain being one of them.I think they gloss over their treatment of the American prisoners a bit too much, although it is still a good place to visit and get some perspective on the fight for independence for the Vietnamese people.

Only about 1/4 of the actual prison remains however, so the displays are few in number. But that doesn't take away from the historical value when it comes to talking about the revolution during the French occupation, where a number of Vietnamese patriots were imprisoned and/or executed here (this section saved me from giving only 1 star). The section about American pilots during the war is extremely laden with propaganda. They have a video playing showing and talking about how the prisoners were very luck to have been here (as opposed to other prisons). Saying things such as they were treated with the utmost respect and fed very well (while the normal Vietnamese citizen didn't have half the food, as they point out). Having read a few books on the war this is a load of crap and simply disinformation/propaganda. The video playing showing the prisoners eating large meals, playing volleyball, smoking, watching films, & listening to the guards play music for them was essentially shot in one day...then the malnutrition, beatings, & torture resumed. This was unfortunate knowing that a large number of people didn't have 1/10th of the knowledge of the war as I did and would go away from there thinking \"hey, these guys were pretty lucky\". As William Tecumseh Sherman put it, \"war is hell\" and these guys were not treated with a lick of respect or anything for that matter...The Vietnamese frequently pointed out that the Americans were committing war crimes but failed to tell the truth about the atrocities. I wouldn't waste my time here unless you personally knew someone imprisoned or are a military history freak like me."

The photos on display had been carefully chosen, part of the propaganda. The guillotine was on display and it was a little eerie standing there beside it and the casket beside it.I'm glad my friend took me there as I doubt I would have visited it myself.

Not surprisingly, the seeds of communist uprising were planted here, ultimately leading to the end of French Indochina.The present location is an exercise in irony. I already knew that most of the original French-built prison was knocked down to make way for the gleaming beacon to capitalism known as Hanoi Towers, a nondescript tall office building that could be in any city in the world. I also knew that its more recent history as a prison for captured Americans during the Vietnam War was highly idealized. And on that note it did not disappoint. After viewing the exhibits on the top notch treatment American POWs received, it's no wonder some decided* to stay for 4 or 5 years. (*Like the prison, my post is also written in irony.)I would not put this at the top (or middle) of the list of places to visit if you have limited time in Ha Noi. There are far more interesting historical and cultural places that you can only see in this city (citadel, Temple of Literature, countless museums). The presentation of Vietnam's more recent history can, on the other hand, be found throughout the country. (War Museum in Saigon, for example.) However, if you have 2 hours to spare this is worth a visit if for no other reason than to see how differently history is interpreted."

A large part of the museum is dedicated to the prison when it was built and used by the French (always referred as \"french colonialists\"). In short, the French were brutal, but could not break the Vietnamese patriots' spirit. On the contrary, they passed the time by helping and teaching each other politics, reinforcing their determination.In another part of the prison, you will see how the US prisoners who were imprisoned there lived. And you will wonder why they left after the war as they had everything they could dream of. The pictures show happy people well fed, doing sport, making a Christmas tree, etc. The propaganda is so incredibly naive, it's \"funny\" in a way (certainly not for the prisoners who had to play along). At the end of the day, you won't learn too much in this museum as you can question the credibility of pretty much everything you see. But it's nevertheless interesting, one of the few times you will remember that Vietnam is still a \"socialist republic\".The entry fee was 20,000 DNG - that's 0.8\u20ac or so and the visit won't take more than 30/45 minutes max."

A living document of modern history showing how every race, no matter how sophisticated or not, can sink to the depths. History shows this time and again and it can be seen and almost felt here. There is quiet a lot of communist propaganda in some of the narratives given, much similar to the present American stance on Guantanamo and rendition but this does not detract from 2 hours of a very interesting visit to a site that looks as though it has kept it's authenticity."

It was built by the French to imprison Vietnamese agitators seeking to take back their country from the horrible and criminal French occupation, aka colonialism. The methods of torture the French inflicted on the Vietnamese people is well documented here, and breathtakingly heartbreaking to read about.This museum was created for the people of Vietnam, to understand their own history and only of their own struggles for the reacquisition of independence which was rightfully theirs to begin with. The fact that some Americans were held here during that terrible part of Vietnamese history is almost secondary. Go with open eyes, and come away with an inspired appreciation for the unwavering determination of a people to remain free and independent of foreign power, and also a deepened respect for the suffering they endured doing so."

It seems a lot of political prisoners were held their- it has photos of inmates etc.Loads of figurines/ models of people locked up and in cells (I found it very creepy but it adds to the effect I guess). You're able to see the male area of the prison, female area of the prison, and where the death inmates were held(they also have the guillotine the french used to execute them) . Theres also information on American soldiers who were kept as prisoners of war- lots of photos of them celebrating Christmas, playing games, and a video of them getting ready to be released.Loved the museum- would highly recommend it! I think it was something like 20,000 VD, which is a good price."

Built by the French to jail Vietnamese Nationals, it shows what it took to drive out the French, and the United States. It was truly inspiring. I entered into Hoa Lo Prison during a violent monsoon downpour and actually had to remove my shoes due to the depth of the water at the entrance. When seeing me standing without shoes, a wonderful generous employee actually gave me his sandals, as he saw me walking gingerly in my bare feet. After a comfortable walk throughout the prison, on leaving I tried to tip that staff member, but he smiled and refused my money."

The Maison Centrale was a prison used by the French colonists for political prisoners. Only the gatehouse is really left from the entire prison and it serves as the museum. Guillotine room, still with original equipment, is the remnant of the French era. There is a bit of political propaganda predictably on exhibit and that leaves at times wrong impression. During the Vietnam war era the prison housed American prisoners of war."

It has had several generations of incarcerations, all of them harrowing, as evidenced by the presence of a Guillotine and basket for catching the severed head. This place seeks to explain and educate about the struggle of the People to throw of the yoke of Colonialism and of Oppression. It is not possible to walk through the exhibits and be unmoved. Some experience shame, others recoil in horror at the confrontation, but it is rare to remain unmoved. On the other hand the presentation and exhibits do not sensationalize or offer any gratuitous material. Instead they speak of the darkness of events and evoke an inkling of what it may have been that kept hope alive. There are publications that can be purchased that are probably not available elsewhere. They are written in a polemic style that doesn't sit easily with the Western aesthetic, but important to read, nonetheless. Although the visuals re-create the awfulness, the oppressive heat of the place is relieved with air conditioning and lots of fans. You will emerge with lots of questions and troubling feelings from this place, if you didn't already have them."

Sorry, but we can't believe that the Americans ate chicken regularly, nor their \"Christmas dinner\" photographs. Their poor diet was very evident from the way their clothes hung off their skeletal frames on the day they were liberated. Still..... an interesting visit."

The museum tends to focus on the prison's use under colonial French rule, which admittedly was horrific, and certainly down plays its use as an American POW prison. The French part of the prison museum was brilliantly, almost dramatically, configured and made the cells seem very real, if not haunting. The part of the museum that does acknowledge the more contemporary use as a POW facility is essentially modern government propaganda, which I found equally interesting. If you read up on the \"Hanoi Hilton\", apparently the American inmates were coerced and tortured by the North Vietnamese prison guards in order to obtain letters saying how much the inmates enjoyed their stay with the Vietnamese and photos of inmates undertaking recreational activities etc. These such exhibits (the letters and photos of \"enjoyment\") are proudly displayed, with taglines in Vietnamese and English explaining that American soldiers appreciated the kind treatment of the North Vietnamese.

Much of the museum is devoted to the story of Vietnamese detainees incarcerated and tortured by the French from 1900 to 1954. The accounts of what took place here were rather disturbing.A couple of rooms are devoted to the story of American prisoners detained here in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The displays emphasis how well-treated the Americans were and how they regretted their part in the war, etc. Not a balanced portrayal of what happened in this place based on first-hand accounts of those who were prisoners here. Makes you question the overall accuracy of what was portrayed."

The prison's purpose was to house Vietnamese political persons so most of the history here is focused on the French and their occupation of Vietnam, torture of the prisoners, and executions using the Guillotine (which is on display along with other devices used for torture.)Much of the land the prison was built on was a small village that specialized in ceramics. The prison formerly occupied quite a bit of land, but most has been returned to residential status now and all that remains is the museum which is maybe one tenth of the original prison.Don't be too surprised if you come here looking for information about the American War (Vietnam War) and find that it is limited - only two rooms are dedicated to this. They do show a very friendly point of view, with Christmas meals and inmates playing games or building guitars. In 1984 Orwell wrote something about how the power who has control gets to write the history books!"

I was glad we did - this was probably the most educational place we visited in Hanoi, and one of the most worthwhile. Definitely worth a visit.The prison itself dates from the French colonial times. Be prepared for a very one-sided view of things here, and take it with a pinch of salt - all of the exhibits aim to illustrate how poorly the French colonialists treated the Vietnamese imprisoned here and how well the Vietnamese later treated the US POWs held in the complex (when it was known as the \"Hanoi Hilton\". If you stay aware of the bias, though, there's lots to learn here and I got far more out of it than the Ho Chin Museum. It's still not up to the level of many other museums from a labeling perspective - descriptions are short and don't go into much detail - but it's fascinating to go around the prison and imagine the misery of the people held here. The cells for people with death sentences - and the guillotine itself - are must-see elements, as is the relatively new US exhibit which has an interesting video.Set aside between an hour (if you're in a hurry) and two hours for a more in-depth visit."

We came to see the \"Hanoi Hilton\" and were fascinated to find that the prison was used to house Vietnamese prisoners by the French for far longer than the site was used to hold American Prisoners of war. The museum was very inexpensive and well done. The museum is full of interesting displays and artifacts from its long history including an actual Guillotine used at the prison. There are cells to view and walk into as well as information plaques translates into several languages including English. There are a few rooms dedicated to the Vietnam War era that include John McCain's actual flight suit and lots of pictures of prison life (albeit from a Vietnamese propaganda perspective). The museum is a must see."

Hoa Lo Prison (aka the Hanoi Hilton) is absolutely fascinating to visit and well worth seeing.Much of the prison complex has long been demolished and replaced by a high-rise commercial building, but what remains is thoroughly interesting to see. Most of the exhibits are dedicated to the history of the prison from construction to the end of the French-occupation of Vietnam.The hall dedicated to the American War is small, but has some interesting accounts and footage. Never let it pass that the history of Hoa Lo during the American/Vietnam War has very much been re-written and the accounts inside the museum are very much at odds with POW accounts following their release (John McCain for one)."

In my opinion Hanoi is more an 'experience' rather than a 'specific destination' sort of city, but I think it is well worth dropping in to see the small remaining part of Hoa Lo prison. I generally like visiting old prisons as they can be imposing, thought provoking for the conditions that people must have endured and have a real sense of history. The displays are simple but interesting and tell the story from a Vietnamese point of view, but thats OK. There were displays showing how people were detained, and even an old guillotine. We enjoyed the visit and are glad we dropped in while wandering around the city, but don't expect a large and flashy attraction. Probably about half hour to an hour to wander around."

The Vietnamese people have a fighting spirit that is to be respected. But oh my. Hoa Lo Prison is something else and most definitely not for the faint hearted.The prison opens up many of the cells prisoners were kept in, famously including US Senator John McCaine. Torture chambers are also open. So much of the signage is clearly propaganda, although respectfully you can see where the Vietnamese' grievances come from.As fate would have it, during my visit a group of Australian war veterans who had POWs at Hoa Lo were there. For most, it was their first visit to the site since their liberation. It was an extremely moving experience to wander through the prison and see the mixtures of relief, sadness and pure anger at the propaganda, that came from these men.If you want to share an appreciation of the many years of war that have somewhat defined this country (and indeed much of the West and Asia since), I recommend visiting Hoa Lo Prison. It is not a happy experience, but a necessary one."

There is a nice mix of photos and physical items and you can actual walk through the rooms in which prisoners were held and look into detainment cells which really brings home the suffering of those held here. One negative point was the tour guides who were letting children sit in the stocks for photo opportunities. Many people suffered and probably died in those stocks and I think letting tourists do this is highly disrespectful. I have been to many museums where history has been rewritten to portray one side in a favourable light but this museum took this to a whole new level. When you reach the section which covers the holding of US prisoners during the Vietnam War it becomes a little ridiculous and insulting that they honestly think we would believe what they're showing us. According to this museum it was a holiday camp for US soldiers, who received presents and were allowed to socialise and enjoy themselves. They are pictures of soldiers laughing, playing cards and generally having a good time which goes against every single account given by these soldiers after the war. Definately visit the museum (it only costs \u00a31 to get in) but take some of the accounts with a very large pinch of salt."

I don't doubt everything the museum reports that the French did really happened, but some of the language is rather 'one dimensional' for my taste....I found the representation of the treatment of the US POWs a bit facile....it was all hearty meals, ping pong tournaments and dressing the xmas tree (I kid you not) the way the museum tells it. No one would have criticised the Vietnamese had they given the POWs a minimum of human rights, so why dress it up and make it unbelievable? All in all, the museum has good content, but the hugely heavy handed propaganda ruined it for me. We visited Tuol Sleng in Phnom Penh several years ago, and the handling of a horrific prison couldn't be more different. In Phnom Penh, the simple facts are laid out and you make your own mind up. Here at the Hanoi Hilton you are told what to think with a very heavy hand and it switched me right off. Take it with a pinch of salt and it's ok......"

From what I had read up previously about the infamous prison, the modernity and brightness of the museum created an atmosphere which detracted from the story of suffering of the people who were incarcerated there, although I suppose many of the Vietnamese political prisoners are held up as heroes so maybe I've taken things the wrong way. The most striking moment is seeing the guillotine which was used, but otherwise this is something of a photo museum with occasional large exhibits. You can see some of the cells too. Although almost everything is labelled in Vietnamese and English, there are papers and documents from French colonial times which are only translated into Vietnamese, which is a shame since you end up skipping large parts if you're not bilingual (I have some basic French, but too basic for these documents). Maybe this is why I think the atmosphere is all wrong, because of the bright lights and a quick walkthrough. As you should expect, the propaganda and rhetoric is heavy in places and inappropriately amusing at times.

Its quite propagandist but these people have put up with so much in the past, who can blame them.Theres a signposted guided tour which takes you thru the area where the tiger cages were with quite a few photos on the subject, passing various instruments of punishment including a guillotine & incorporating a visit to the cells. We made this the first stop of a walk around the various museums, so if your based in the Old Quarter it is probably easy walking distance, & u can also take in other sites like Vietnam Military Museum, Ho Chi Minh Museaum, mausoleum & One Pillar Pagoda.

And I don't blame them a bit, but you don't go there looking for beauty. You go there looking for history. And after seeing the cells and \"pit\", you go to the 'main' attraction. Americans, and John McCain's gear when he was caught. And they have it. Up until then, they do a good job of showing what seems an unbiased job of history. Why else go to a museum?Then after seeing McCains flight suit and other military gear, you see a video. This is a puzzle.It shows happy American POWS playings cards, chess, celebrating Christmas, and doing all other kinds of leisurly activities while the citizens of Hanoi are being bombed and maimed. Now I am sure that the people of Hanoi (and other places in Vietnam) suffered during this period, and that the American Air Force did it, It's that they showed those POWS playing around during it. Something that anyone who knows anything about history knows isn't true. They were tortured and beaten and kept in solitary until the cameras were there.Come on Vietnam. I've never been to a country that I've been treated nicer in and thank you for that. You won a long time ago. Bury that video."

Granted its not the complete prison remaining, but there are still a lot of interesting rooms, cells and courtyards to wander through. The prison was used by the French to house Vietnamese, then later used by the Vietnamese to house US prisoners of war. There is a certain amount of propaganda regarding these two uses, so I'd advise taking some of the propaganda with a healthy pinch of salt.One highlight was John McCains flight suit on show, after the parachuted into Truc Bach lake, nearly drowned but was dragged out and beaten by the locals before becoming a POW.Other highlights are the dirty and depressing cells, and an original guillotine used by the French. There's also a nicely stocked souvenir shop, I normally avoid these places but they had some interesting stuff and I ended up spending about $100"

As a U.S. citizen, the propoganda was hard to swallow, and the pictures of smiling American POWs very misleading. In reality, POW survivors recoumted how badly they were treated and how they were forced to pose for propoganda pictures. But this is a Communist country, folks, and you should expect to get a \"different\" view of history. It comes with the territory. And to walk those corridors and ponder about the people who suffered here is very powerful. Personally, reading how the Communist government regards the war and their role is quite fascinating, not only at this museum, but across Hanoi. Sites commemorating the bravery of the Vietnamese people in the face of American imperialism are all over the place. The patriot in me is offended, but the insight quite enlightening."

If I'm honest, I'm not entirely sure what I expected but when the guidebook reminds you that previous American prisoners' memories are very different to those reported in the museum, you know to expect a serious amount of propaganda. For those people who believe what they read - the French treated the Vietnamese horrifically, whilst the American POWs had a relatively comfortable stay where they could decorate christmas trees and sing carols around a fireplace that had been drawn on the wall. The photos show those situations, so they happened but there are very few other pictures of the prisoners at any time during their stay. Who knows what is actually true, and I'd imagine that you couldn't put a lot of it in a family museum, but I was shocked by what I read. It was a skewed version of reality with carefully selected photos and no memoirs of POWs. It's worth a visit if you're nearby, but don't take what you read at face value - which I think probably goes for most of Hanoi's museums."

There is a small room displaying information on the American POW's held here, but there is too much propaganda on how well the Americans were treated which is laughable.As paying tourists, we find the North Vietnamese rude and inhospitable, I can only imagine how they would have treated the enemy.

Secondly, you can also witness how thousands of innocent Vietnamese were routinely imprisoned, tortured, murdered and executed in the most inhuman ways by the French. Most of the Vietnamese imprisoned during the French rule were innocent victims and in this prison, you can see how the French tortured the Vietnamese in the most unthinkable ways. The prisoners were treated worst than any animal. The musuem also has documented records of prisoners being subjected to daily beatings, even the women and children, the old and sick - something which the French were proud to admit during those times and the aim was to create a sense of superiority over the Vietnamese. The heads of the beheaded prisoners were displayed publicly and left to rot under the sun and all these were done to instill fear amongst the Vietnamese. You should visit this place if you are in Hanoi and you can witness how the evil the French were when they illegally occupied Vietnam."

The displays were mostly above average and were visually engaging. We took one of the tricycle bike taxi's to and from this location, which was well worth it. The slower ride and the view from the front of the trike made the ride to and from equally as entertaining (although never forget to negotiate the price BEFORE you get in the trike). All in all, it was an interesting museum. There is also a very nice restaurant only a few blocks away that serves from a menu but has a cafeteria style offering of all sorts of Vietnamese food.

As well as this there is a small section to do with American pilots shot down during the Vietnamese civil war (yes, the war started before american involvement, and ended years after America left, and no I am not American)What I honestly found the most interesting, is the bias involved in the displays. For the French occupation sections there is constant mention of the imprisonment of 'communist patriots' and details about how many died in captivity, but there is no mention of anyone else who could have been imprisoned for other reasons.And for the American section there is a long list of American pilots that had been released, but no mention of the ones who died. There is also a stark contrast with the uniform worn by the 'Americans imperialists', which looks like it was freshly ironed, in comparison to the uniforms worn by 'communist patriots' which looks like it was dragged across a dirty floor before being displayed.And while there is mention of harsh treatment of the Vietnamese at the hands of the French, there is no mention of the torture suffered by the Americans (to this day the Vietnamese government denies there was torture performed there)It was a very interesting experience, and the idea of what could have happened there through out the prisons life is appalling. But keep in mind that it is a government sponsored exhibit and the truth written down is not necessarily entirely accurate."

I could imagine how hard it was to spend time in this prison, especially during winter - it was very cold when I was there!!Again, as some reviewers mentioned, there are a lot of propaganda, and the things are not presented objectively or some made-ups included, but come on, you know you are in Vietnam -- all museums and places, especially when it comes to past wars, are highly biased towards the current regime. You need to know this and do the discount by yourself, but this place still worth a visit."

The photograph exhibit depicted happy healthy US soldiers making it appear as if they were merely \"hanging out\" until the war was over instead of being tortured as we've come to learn was the case here. Even a smiling photograph of John McCain leads you to believe that his time here was equivalent to being in a country club. I doubt the shots of US soldiers playing basketball, celebrating Christmas and dining together was the norm. Overall though, still worth seeing."

It mainly focuses on the time the French controlled the prison (1880's until 1954) an how poorly Vietnamese political prisoners were treated. Even displaying the guillotine they used. The area covering the \"American War\" continues the war time propaganda about how well the American flyers were treated. What's left of the prison definitely makes an impression and deserves an hour or so."

You can see the old cells, complete with leg irons, the guillotine and many exhibits showing what the prisoners wore and ate, etc. There is also a memorial garden at the rear of the prison. Two thirds of the prison were demolished in 1993, so you are only seeing the SE corner of the original site."

They show photos,of American prisoners playing volleyball, having singalongs, etc., which were demonstrations done for the rare Red Cross visits. Still, if you can stomach the lies and propaganda, it is still,an interesting place to go.

Any one executed by the French for crimes were freedom fighters. There is very little by way of explanations or reasons why. I had to go on the Internet to see the reasons why some of the so called hero's had been placed there in the first place. Usually for trying to poison the local French garrison etc. The American section is small, not much to it at all. There are whole sections dedicated to the puppet government of the souths prisons and how cruel they were. So it seems a big propaganda declaration about the goodness of the the Communist North and the evils of the Southern Government. Section of how badly the women were treated again in the south Vietnam prisons with the usual drawings of starving figures which are in contrast to the actual photos which show them actually well fed. The conditions that people had to live in we're not nice in this prison but it would be better to present a more rounded presentation of life and history of the place rather than the propagander monument that it actually is.

It is broken up into two parts, French and American. The French portion shows the brutality that colonialism seemed to bring out. You see the areas where Vietnamese prisoners were kept and even the guillotine used for death sentences. The American portion highlights the fact that POWs were treated nicely (I'm sure a POW would disagree) even though they brought death and destruction to North Vietnam (Vietnamese viewpoint). Both the French and American portions contain the Vietnamese slant/version and as expected is bias towards the government view. But if you look through all that, you can get a feel of what life was like for prisoners (Vietnamese and Americans). We went here with a tour guide who explained many of the exhibits but in my opinion you don't need a tour guide as there is English explanations throughout the prison."

The buildings are well-preserved and the history is well-explained. A visit does leave you with a sense that nations can be awfully slow to give up what is not rightly theirs. That so many people need to be imprisoned, tortured or even killed in the pursuit of independence is beyond our understanding. Do spend at least half an hour here.

I also really enjoyed the artifacts from the Vietnam or the 'American' War, including the suit John McCain wore when his plane was shot down and when he was taken prisoner.

Some of the exhibits were eerie, understandably with the number of Vietnamese that were tortured and killed there, and it is a credit to them that they have preserved a small portion of the prison to illustrate their struggle, where a lot of the land has been sold to commercial business. However, where the information about what the French did to the Vietnamese was at the 'hard sell' end of information, and I have no doubt and am not doubting that atrocities were committed there, the small part of the museum dedicated to the detention of American pilots seemed to be a lot more sugarcoated and slightly at odds to most of what I had read about their detention prior to my visit.

However, this prison was used during French rule to lock up Vietnamese opponents of the French. Most of the complex is demolished and given over to development (A modern high rise hotel is situated close by). The propaganda bit surfaces because the terrible bad treatment of the Vietnamese prisoners by the French was emphasized (Don't get me wrong. I believe this treatment was really bad), contrasted to the relatively good treatment the American pilots had (according to pictures shown in the museum). Impressive is the way Vietnamese prisoners escaped through the sewer system, even after this system was equipped with bars. Part of the sewer system with sawn-trough bars is on display. Also terrible are the death-row cells and the guillotine, used to execute the Vietnamese convicts (See photo). Upstairs are rooms, dedicated to the American pilots, taken prisoner, with as interesting part a picture of the rescue of John McCain, who was shot down into West Lake (See photo). Generally a place where you touch the history of the French rule and the battle of communist North Vietnam against the Americans in the South. (We all know how it ended, though)"

There isn't much to see here mostly some pictures and bizarrely quite few shackled Vietnamese 'prisoner' mannequins smiling and looking proudly defiant. The plaques which contain most of the history about the prison reveal very little information but do offer a lot of historical inaccuracies. Basically they tell a story of how peaceful Vietnamese were just living their lives working in the fields then the French invaded turned them all into slaves, imprisoning and torturing all who opposed them. They imply that their was the foundation of a communist rebel party which constantly waged a guerrilla war campaign against the French Imperialist occupation. Then after the Vietnamese defeated the French and drove them from the land the American's (who had used deception to convince the South to attack the North, invaded. Then there is a whole two walls talking about female prisoners who were captured and tortured by Americans at some other prison South of the DMZ. The rest of the exhibit talks about how American's used barbaric torture techniques while the North Vietnamese not only didn't torture their prisoners, they actually treated them really well and bought them gifts, kept them well fed, etc. Of course this is where John McCain was held (who has described his torture in great detail) but there is only one photo of him. The exhibit ends with a wall of photos of all the countries who rallied against the US and sided with the North Vietnamese. Strangely France was North Vietnam's biggest ally in the anti-ward movement even though they were the early Imperialists and still hold vast interests in the country. I loved Vietnam, the country and its people and I felt that this exhibit was a blight on my experience and portrays the country in a bad light. I had always grown up opposed to the American's involvement in the war, I left the exhibit feeling sorry that they lost."

John McCains flight suit is also there from when his plane was shot down. Of course, there was propoganda in the museum which everyone expects to see, but if you take the information you read with a pinch of salt and look at the real, true history of the prison then it is very sad and sombre. It is not a huge prison, so it depends what you expect to see when you visit, but for me it was very interesting paticularly Reading about the people who fought against the war whilst in the prison and how the prison has been used over time."

Hoa Lo is known by Americans as the Hanoi Hilton, where John McCain and other POW\u2019s, particularly pilots, were held. At the end of the trip, I was not sure I wanted another kick in the gut, and sure enough this visit dredged up the emotions felt at Tuol Seng and Cheoung Ek in Cambodia. Most of the tour is devoted to the time that the prison was built, expanded, and operated by the French and housed Vietnamese men and women being held as political prisoners. The visit spares no punches against the French, with writings by women prisoners about the horrid conditions and the nasty meals, records of the deaths in the prison from dysentery and other illnesses, stone figures in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s prison depicting people shackled by one leg in a rigid metal brace that forced them to sit naked side-by-side, bare dungeons and death cells, a guillotine and pictures of executed prisoners, and tributes to the prisoners who escaped. The latter part of the visit, conversely, seeks to depict the conditions for American POW\u2019s as humane and hotel-like, with photographs of smiling Americans playing basketball, chess, cards, and engaging in other entertaining past-times. Our young boys commented, \"I guess it wasn't so bad here,\" but I also reminded them that there is always another view, particularly with respect to the conditions for American POW\u2019s. Winners write history. I was grateful when our visit was cut short by the 5:00 closing time. Not because this is an uninteresting place--to the contrary--but because I did not wish to endure further another kick in the gut.

The section about the North Vietnamese treating the US PoWs fairly is pure propoganda material dating back to the war. Also I'm not sure if some of the images of the female PoWs under French rule are authentic as they appear in the War Remants museum in Saigon as images of PoWs under US occupation of Con Dao.

I must say it was very well and strongly built!It housed women and children as well as male political prisoners.There were also cells where prisoners were held for very long periods in solitary confinement with legs shackled leading to many deaths from torture and conditions as well as disease and poor diet. Later on it was used by the Vietnamese to house American pilots that were captured on bombing raids and also even has the American senator John Mc Cain's flying suit on display.Well worth two or three hours but conditions not as bad as the S21 camp in Cambodia.

GPS coordinates are N 21 01.516, E 105 50.789 Admission fee is 20,000 Dong ($1 USD).Approximately 90% of the displays are dedicated to the prison\u2019s construction history, its role during French colonization, and 10% highlight the American War (known as the Vietnam War in the US). Since history is written by the victors, all displays are presented from the Vietnamese perspective. Special emphasis was placed on the brutality of the French against the Vietnamese political prisoners, to include torture, solitary confinement and capital punishment. Several displays specifically highlighted the role of Vietnamese female prisoners. All displays regarding the American prisoners either highlighted protests against the Vietnam War in the US and other countries or how well the Americans were treated during their captivity. Photos included holiday celebrations, special meals, Americans exercising or playing board games, and the release of the prisoners at the war\u2019s end. My American perspective of the prison\u2019s history based on first-hand POW accounts, history books, and independent documentaries, the prison\u2019s displays could best be described as propaganda. Most of the 30+ Western visitors, who were visiting at the same time, also seemed most interested in this part of the prison\u2019s history.Since my visit, I have spent some time researching specific individuals and events mentioned in their displays. At the very least, it has helped me to visualize the conditions experienced by the American POWs. Overall, it has added to my knowledge of the Vietnam War, so it was a worthwhile experience."

We knew there was an area concerning American prisoners held here, but it was very hard to find and we would have missed it if we hadn't known to look for it. There were photos of many of the American prisoners and while some of them showed celebrations, it was clearly obvious that no one imprisoned here would be in a celebratory mood.

Especially the exhibition part is not objective at all and mostly pointed against the americans (not surprisingly though, but still too much for a museum in my opinion). One example: They state that \"Hanoi Hilton\" (name given by American POW) should reflect the good treatment of the prisoners. Hanoi Hilton was de facto given ironically because of all the torturing and mistreatment (which is documented).So, inform yourself in advance and don't be misled by videos and pictures in the exhibition.But alltogether a must see in Hanoi, it's intense and gives you food for thought."

It shows how awful the French treated the Vietnamese nationalist prisons, and how wonderful the Vietnamese treated the American POWs (seriously). The pictures of John McCain are interesting - as long as you keep your cool and dont get riled up about the propaganda. In fact I suggest reading his autobiography or checking out the internet to find the true story of the beatings he took while a guest at the Hanoi Hilton. But that was 50 years ago and thankfully we (the USA and VN) have moved on. The entire visit is only 30 minutes and well worth the time."

Make sure to look up when you first walk in to see the top edge of the prison lined with broken glass bottles to prevent esapes. Would recommend this for people 13 years and up depending on maturity level as there are quite graphic stories which would probably be best appreciated by older audiences. Well worth a visit.

When it comes to the French occupation, they cover the French crimes very well...but they gloss over their treatment of the Americans, and actually show all the images of all the fun and games the Americans had while being captive; it is right on par with how the Nazi's had a photographer come in and take pictures of the great conditions that the Jews were living in. So, take everything with a grain of salt, and realise that the government that held the Americans there is still in power."

Only two small rooms are devoted to the American POWs (John McCain's flight suit is on display), and there are lots of pictures of American pilots smiling and playing chess. To hear the Vietnamese tell it, the Americans were treated well, never tortured, and generally had a grand old time as guests of the Vietcong until the war ended.

Americans better know Hoa Lo Prison as the \"Hanoi Hilton\", the infamous POW prison where American pilots, including John McCain, were held during the Vietnam War. The prison actually has a much deeper and darker history than just that, as a prison used by the French to house Vietnamese nationalists, and what's left of the prison is largely a museum commemorating this period.There is only a small part of the original prison still standing, the rest having been claimed by a high rise development. There is a nice model of the original prison and layout inside one of the display rooms. Most of the displays center around the treatment of Vietnamese prisoners by the French, including depictions of how prisoners were kept in leg irons, the old \"death row\" section, and even the guillotine used to carry out death sentences.Perhaps in a nod to John McCain's recent celebrity as a presidential candidate, there are two rooms dedicated to Hoa Lo's time as a POW camp, including a display of McCain's flight suit. These areas are pretty heavy on propaganda, making it sound like the POWs were at Club Med rather than a notorious torture center. But the propaganda is interesting in its own right, and this is one of the few well-maintained Vietnam War sites we found. It's an interesting place to stop for the American visitor, even if you won't get any real sense of what the prison was like during that period.Overall I'd recommend this attraction. It's quick and easy to get to, and like most attractions in Hanoi it's very inexpensive to visit. An hour would let you explore the complex pretty thoroughly,"

The winners really do write the history books. One aspect of the tour focuses on the Vietnamese's struggle against the French. It's essentially just a tirade of how evil the French were. The other half talks about how much the Americans loved being POW's in the 'Hanoi Hilton'. I particularly loved the photo's entitled 'Americans cooking Christmas lunch' and 'Vietnamese patriot giving present to leaving American soldier;. I was waiting to see a picture of an American crying with the label \"American soldier upset at concept of leaving prison behind to return to country\". This propaganda is pretty stock standard for Vietnam (particularly in Saigon in it's Cu Chi Tunnels and war museum) so you just have to sit back and laugh. The structure of the prison itself is OK. It's quite small which isn't necessarily a bad thing and it has numerous displays and information which I feel was very good value for the small admission price. It's proximity from old quarter and other sites means you can walk here and this makes for a cheap day. It was also very interesting to see John McCain's pilot suit. I wonder what he thinks of this place now?CONCLUSIONWorth a look due to it's proximity to old quarter and minimal entry fee. Try not to take the propaganda too seriously."

I normally have a thing for prisons - just really enjoy visiting and hearing the tales of famous prisoners and relevant conflicts. But Hoa Lo Prison (better known as the \"Hanoi Hilton\" in the West) was a bit of a letdown.Just to be clear: I don't have a problem at all with the Vietnamese take on history, although I could imagine some patriotic Americans getting upset. Most of the prison is dedicated to talking about the horrors undergone by Vietnamese freedom fighters at the hands of their French colonial masters in the prison. However, after independence we are told that the gaolers suddenly became considerably more enlightened in their sensitive and caring treatment of American GIs during that unfortunate period of conflict. I fully expected that, and usually hearing the \"other\" side of things makes it more interesting, not less.But it is still a poor tour. Firstly, the majority of the prison was torn down to make way for the massive Hanoi Towers next door (which, on the plus side, makes it easy to find...). So you only really get to tour about a quarter of the old prison. Secondly, the tour is massively random - you just keep circling back over yourself in a demented figure of eight. It really did feel like following breadcrumbs back and forth. Lastly, there isn't very much to it. It is small - there are very few relics left from olden times, and you are hard pressed to spend more than half an hour there.Most of the tour focuses (understandably) on the Vietnamese war of independence. Only two rooms are really dedicated to the \"American war\". Perhaps not surprising, those two rooms were fairly full of American tourists absolutely absorbed, and the rest of the tour was sparsely populated. Then at the end of the tour, if you want to visit the gift shop, you have to work your way back across the prison, but, unfortunately, it is filled with very banal standard Vietnam tourist souvenirs - generic T-shirts, carvings and paintings. Absolutely nothing specific to the prison (I have a friend who knew people who were incarcerated in the prison during the conflict, and I wanted to bring back something for him - but there is absolutely nothing specific to the site - not even a key chain, far less an amusing \"I survived the Hanoi Hilton\" T-shirt - I guess it is all still a bit raw for the Vietnamese).To be completely fair, it is only 10,000 Dong (US$0.50), so it is still a place I would suggest people pop in and visit. But for me overall it was a bit of a disappointment."

A trip to Ha Noi needs at least a visit to the Ha Noi Hilton (or Hoa Lo - which roughly translates to 'furnace' or 'stove'). We were pleasantly surprised at the entry price of 10,000VND each (about 50c AUD). The whole place is just a portion of what was the original Hoa Lo Prison during the Indochina period and thence the Vietnam war. We were amazed that what looks like a small tourist site was actually quite large and well kept. You will take your own language guide (predominately Vietnamese, French then English - in that order) and wander the route through the prison. The sparse displays are purposefully so. That said - the sparseness with a key element on display adds to the feeling of desperation and hopelessness the prisoners would have felt in this place. You need to remember that after the French Indochina period (with its political prisoners and the associated torture and killings) the Vietnam War saw numbers of US soldiers held POW here. The range of displays in the French inspired prison buildings (shutters, tall windows, high ceilings, concrete rendering and lots of archways) take you through each part of the history of Hoa Lo, and you leave actually feeling you've learned something of the region's history.I am pretty apolitical, and towards the end I felt a bit of the 'socialist good' theme starting to be delivered (ie: about the modern Vietnam). We decided that we had enjoyed what we had seen and decided to go. Set aside about 2-3 hours to have a look around. You will be surprised how interesting this place is."

I especially loved the shop there which sold items at VERY cheap prices, no haggling, and the stubby coolers were our best buy. Our favourite was the one from the BBC programm called Top Gear when they did a show while travelling through Vietnam some time ago.

Signs lead you through whats left of the prison in an orderly fashion, one of the other visitors had a private tour guide and I'd probably recommend that as they were getting a lot of facts that we were trying to listen to.When you first look in, look up and you can see the top of the walls are edged with broke bottles to keep prisoners from climbing out, as well as electrical wire.The photos and cells were interest to look at and feel, the museum had some mannequins replicating how the prisoners were kept, and some good information on the walls. Some of the artifacts brought the place to life, especially the guillotine.The trip to the prison made me feel a little heavy hearted reading about the vietnamese political prisoners and American POW's, at the end they play a video showing the Vietnamese side of the story (Vietnam war), and it's a bit of propaganda mixed in but it certainly shows you another side to the events.Afterward, don't forget to try Quan An Ngon close by, on 18 Phan Boi Chau.

            "review": "A lesson in Propaganda. This was the first thing on our \"things to see in Hanoi\" list. It was 10,000D admission and worth every dong! The majority of the museum is devoted to the imprisonment of the Viet communists by the colonial French from 1896-1945. The suffering was obviously awful and this is explained in clear detail. Contrast this with the capture and imprisonment of US airmen during the bombing campaigns in the 1960s and early 70s - they were treated like royalty! Photos of them playing basketball and preparing and eating Christmas dinner look real enough - perhaps ther was some coersion!There are two sides to every story and some of this should be taken with a pinch of salt but it was certainly a good place to see. There are photographs of captured US airmen (including Senator John McCain and Geoff(?) Patterson (the first US ambassador to Vietnam in 1995) being marched in front of a Viet female farm worker half his size) but none of the iconic images of the war we have seen in the west. Perhaps the authorities should get in touch with the US to obtain photos from the B52 bombers of the devastation caused by Operation Rolling Thunder and Operation Linebacker.Still - a great place to visit in Hanoi."

The Americans held here were actually treated very well, although the Vietnamise held by the French decades earlier were certainly not. There isn't as much to see as at the war museum in Saigon, but it is certainly less depressing."

Then there's the part about the American pilots. As one wanders through the dark, damp cells, he can only ponder what went through the minds of those who were interned here. Whether Vietnamese or American, it wasn't a pleasant place to be. Then, all of a sudden, there it is - the guillotine. I had read about it during the French Revolution but had never seen one. It is certainly one of the most interesting parts of the museum. According to the information in the museum, the French used it often during their colonial stay in the country. This prison and museum is one of the most interesting and fascinating places that I have visited in Hanoi."

Unfortunately, about 2/3 of the original prison has been torn down to make way for a 5-star hotel, but what is left is greatly preserved. Before entering, our guide was very good about saying \"I know you are American and have your thoughts/beliefs, and with me being Vietnamese, mine are different so while we are inside I won't say much and let you read for yourself.\" That was very refreshing because he could have very well firehosed us with propaganda... though the prison did that well enough. Most of what is left is dedicated to how poorly the French treated the VIetnamese who were imprisoned there. There are quite a few artifacts and pictures. It was very interesting. Then there are two small rooms dedicated to the treatment of American pilots who were held there during the war. It was interesting, yet frustrating, to see the blatant propaganda of how well the American's were treated... to see the pictures of the \"smiling, happy, Christmas celebrating soldiers.\" A very interesting take on history. It just makes me curious as to what do the VIetnamese really think?!?!?! I highly recommend seeing this sight if in Hanoi!"

This is worth a visit - I was there last week To go round the place only takes about an hour or so as there is not very much left however what is there gives a pretty good idea of what life must have been like behind bars in a French Colonial Jail.Of course this place is most famous for holding the american pilots that were shot down over Vietnam - there is a small section devoted to them.Typically as with other sites in Vietnam one must overlook the attempts at propaganda at every turn - the usual things, How bad the french were, how bad the americans were and how great the Vietnam government is/was....etc etcIt's worth a visit and the VND10,000 for a \"guidebook\"......"
