The exterior of the building is quite impressive, so even if you do not want to go inside then there is a lot going on outside - even the view back to the city is nice.I went inside as well, which was very enjoyable, but it requires a lot of time to spend. It was Friday around 14:20 when I visited the place. The administrator said that I could wait 40min to get in for free ( apparently they have this kind of promotion, but not sure if it works everyday). I would suggest to get in as I did - before 15:00 as there was really no one present inside and after everyone is getting in and it gets too crowded."

Images dating 900 years back and taken from small Catalan churches 100 years ago are exhibited in a very visitor friendly way. The combination of \"Christ in Majesty\" (room 7) end two very fine paintings by Antoni Tapies was an outstanding experience. The Gothic collection and the works of the Thyssen collection (Madrid) is also interesting. Don't miss the portraits by Dali and art from the Civil War on the first floor and visiting the outdoor top floor terrasse with fine Barcelona and Montjuic views. Finally MNAC in the autumn/winter 16/17 has an interesting special exhibition with paintings by Lluisa Vidal."

It is at the base of Montjuic and is one of the most scenic spots in all of Barcelona. Admission gives you a 2-day pass so you don't have to worry about trying to cram everything in one visit. You can also climb the mountain which will allow you to see the Olympic Stadium on the way, as well as the old military fort atop Montjuic. Come at night to watch the Magic Fira show! This is surprisingly fun and seeing the castle lit up at night is just as if not even more impressive than during the day. One of my favourite sites in the entire city! *1-2 hours if not going inside the museum, 3-4 if going inside"

The grounds are nice and the fountains were working when I started my trek to the entrance.Overall, it is nicely divided inside with many nice things to see. I enjoyed the free wifi so I could share pictures with family. One could easily spend several hours there and I did. I would visit it again.I went on a Friday morning so it was fairly quiet inside but I could imagine weekends are busy. Have fun!"

It is not interactiv so you can easely get bored especially the kids, so if you have older kids with you , let's say 8 years and up, you can ask them to look for imps, devils or other such creatures in the paintings, this will make it more fun for them. I didn't like the fact that the art pieces have no english comments or descriptions making it necesary for you to get the audio guide if you want to understand something of the whole lot.There is a big gift shop , a coffee shop and a restaurant inside!"

            "review": "Largest collection of Romanesque art in the world. Here are Romanesque, Gothic and Modernist works from the Catalonian region with some works between the Gothic and 19th century. The entrance floor is divided by the central lobby. The left side houses the Romanesque collection. The Gothic and works to the end of 18th century are displayed in the right hand side of the lobby. The first floor houses works from the 19th century onwards along with a selection from their coin collection.In this museum rescued artefacts from Catalonian churches make up the largest collection of Romanesque art. These are principally frescoes which have been removed from their original locations. To give them their proper context they have been placed as if they were in a church. So for example apse paintings are displayed in a space built to the scale and contours of a rounded apse. Some frescoes show damage but a number are quite striking. In addition there are sculpture, paintings and some liturgical items.On the right side of the lobby in the Gothic section, there are more sculptures and architectural elements. There are also more paintings on panels, as opposed to frescoes. A number of the paintings look very well and show some influence of Netherlandish artists. On this side are also works from later centuries up to the eighteenth and also from other countries. The artistic centres had moved from Barcelona during that time so there is little Catalonian art between the Gothic and 19th Century on display.The top floor has works from the 19th and 20th century. Principally painting and sculpture it also has photography, furniture and stained glass. In terms of quality, the Romanesque and Gothic works are the best in the museum and are more deserving of time. There are some good items on the top floor but it is not as good as those below.Entrance is included with the price of a Barcelona card, which includes special exhibitions.There is a small cafe on the ground floor and a restaurant on the first floor overlooking the hill towards Place d'Espanya."

But there are also escalators outside for those who cannot do the walk. Many steps inside the museum as well. BRING BOTTLED WATER! Put it in your backpack or bag--you'll need it on a hot day. I made the mistake of not taking any and paid the high price for a small bottle once I'd made the climb up. Food there is quite pricey and not worth it. Spend the day, but then walk down to the street to find better food--and less expensive as well. Lovely fountains outside--and superb views from the top. Many photo opportunities!"

            "review": "Beautiful building with some great Catalan art. I had been really looking forward to visiting this museum, despite the fact that my husband has a shirt attention span when it comes to modern art. We got the tube to Espanya and walked up the steps (lots and lots but thankfully there were working escalators in stretches). The museum is a stunning building surrounded by a beautiful park, the botanical gardens and the Olympic stadium, and overlooks Barcelona so there are great views to be admired here. There is also a nice little cafe right outside overlooking the fantastic view and, thankfully on a scorching day, in the shade. We hired an audio guide but apparently some form of identification was required and we were not carrying our passports with us. I asked if we could write the name of our hotel, room number and street, and our names, and they seemed happy with that - we must look trustworthy then! The indvidual tours are separated into Renaissance, modern, etc but I found it quite difficult to negotiate the menu. What would've been very helpful was to have been able to search by the room number. Also, a lot of the religious triptychs, which would've benefitted from further explanation were not listed in the audio guide. In fact the pictures actually on the audio guide were quite limited. The modern art area is upstairs and there was an evening event being planned in the main room which looked like it was going to be a spectacular evening for those attending. There is a lift to the next floor. I loved seeing the Gaudi furniture (as did my husband - he appreciates a fine bit of woodworking) and the work by Fortuny (we are staying in a hotel with a street named after him and a statue of him too) was the first time I had seen his work. The Picasso was interesting and the posters of the civil war years were suitably bold and stirring. There was some Miro but there is a museum devoted to him further into the park. When we returned our audio guides, the staff destroyed the piece of paper we had signed so at least we can be sure we won't be chased for not returning them. A spectacular building but a difficult audio guide to follow. The shop had some nice posters/postcards in it. I was a little disappointed with the Thyssen rooms as I had expected some stonkingly priceless old masters and a lot of it was devoted to \"religious works\", but perhaps I'm just a heathen!"

The main square where cabs and a metro stop can be found is several long, steep flights of stairs down the hill from the museum. Before panic set in, however, we noticed that a whole series of escalators -- not very visible at first -- go all the way down to the big square.

The other part also has its masterpieces but if you are not a gallery type it may become boring (especially after the second hous).

We'd read some mixed reviews of this museum, so relegated the visit to a late Saturday afternoon (post 3 pm), when entry is free.Three hours later, we were trudging solemnly down the steps towards Espanya, annoyed that we'd had no time to see the Modern and Roman sections,The collection is housed in a grand, sometimes architecturally confused but utterly beautiful building constructed for the 1929 International Exposition, near the Monju\u00efc castle, the Olympic Stadium and the botanic gardens - if you're in a group with split interests, those less interested in art won't be stuck for diversions nearby. The permanent exhibits in the Mediaeval and Renaissance section are limited in number but offer a fantastic cross-section of (sometimes tenuously-linked) Catalan art through the ages. Cecco Bravo's 'Eva Temptada', Huguet's 'Mare de Deu' and Goya's 'Allegoria de l'Amor' were each worth the \u20ac12 entry fee (ticket valid for two days).One word of warning - the descriptions are almost exclusively in Catalan and Spanish so, if you have neither, it will almost certainly be worth purchasing an audio tour or guide book. We left disappointed only that we'd left ourselves so little time to spend here. When you go, take your camera - photos are permitted without flash inside, and outside the views are quite spectacular."

To decorate the rooms with some contemporary artefacts would give it all more context.

We visited this museum twice on our trip as there is so much to see, and even then we hadn't seen all we would have liked to see. The first day we went around the collection of medieval frescos preserved in the early twentieth century by peeling them off the walls of churches in Catalonia to avoid them being destroyed. These are partly displayed in areas corresponding to the shapes and sizes of the churches they were taken from so you see them displayed as generations of local people saw them for hundreds of years, the colours are still vibrant.On our second visit we went through the collection of modern art where I particularly enjoyed the furniture and decorative arts from late 19th/early 20th century, including some Gaudi furniture designed for Casa Battlo.The museum is free to visit of Saturday afternoons, otherwise we paid 16.80 for a family ticket (the children were free but this was still less than the price of two adult tickets so some kind of discount applied) and the ticket would have been valid for a subsequent visit on another day. Good gift shop with a range of items reflecting different aspects of the collection, at fair prices, although it's a museum gift shop so on the expensive side."

I visited the Museum on Wednesday, 24th August around 17h and also had a coffee at the coffee shop right by the main entrance outside the Museum. My teen nephew purchased a tiny little bottle of water (0.33l) for 2.70 EUR which is obviously a pure rip off, taking into consideration that you usually purchase 1 L of Water in Spain for 1 EUR. So I brought the bottle back and asked for possible refund which the old coffee shop staff member refused very rudely verbally and physically. When I complained about his unappropriated behavior and asked for the official complaint form (which all shops in Spain have to provide by law to the customer upon request) he refused it and continued being rude. This man has no clue about customer service and should not be allowed to serve any customers, especially in such an important touristic sight like this Museum. Moreover he did not give any cashier receipt of the purchased water which is also against the law. I do not recommend to take anything at that coffee shop if you do not want to be highly overcharged and insulted by the old waiter. What a pity for this great Museum to have a Coffee Shop provider with such horrible staff mistreating their customers."

Magnificent Romanesque frescoes and altarpieces rescued from isolated Pyrenean churches during the early 1900's before they were stolen and spirited out of Catalunya. Many are displayed in recreations of the apses they originally adorned. It is a nearly spiritual journey just standing in front of this history and imagining what effect they had on the original country souls who worshipped them...We then moved on to the upper level of this magnificent building- clearly designed to impress for the 1929 International Exhibition-and the Modern collection.Nicely laid out by periods, the breadth and quality of Catalan art is truly amazing! Although Picasso- not even Catalan- gets all the press; Major works by Miro, Casas, Tapies Etc. are evident around every corner. One morning just grazed the surface- might stop back tomorrow!"

Enjoy a long walk around and then pay a visit to the permanent collections of the museum. If you have time check also the temporary exhibitions. We visited the museum by paying the admission fee but it is free on Sundays after some point of time (check the official site).The exhibits of the museum are well placed, lots of effort has been given to display them in harmony to the building. Different parts may interest you, for me the Medieval period and the modernistic parts were the best. Great paintings of El Greco, Picasso, etc can be found there. One disadvantage could be that there is no English description on the tags of the exhibits (Castellano and Catalan are available, which may be no problem for some of us but I can foresee that for others it could be one- check whether there is an English audio guide instead...). At the end of your tour enjoy the great 360 view from the terrace with a drink! You can see pretty much everything from up there! MNAC is accessible via metro and buses, it may not be suitable for little kids (it depends!).Even on the high season period, the place was not crowdy and you could enjoy your visit!"

There is also a huge old auditorium with elevators to take you to tribunes and on first floor there is a mural done by Miro. There is a restaurant and couple of cafes with lunch buffet, but they may be too expensive. Best part is you don't need ticket to access these parts of building! So I would recommend to those going to Parc de Montjuic (best to get there by bus 55 from Placa Universitata) to visit this place while walking downhill to Placa Espanya.But, if you are an art lover, there is medieval and renaissance art at ground floor and modern art at first floor. Highlights are Picasso's Woman with hat and fur collar and Thyssen-Bornemisza collection and there is also a lot of Ramon Casas's paintings. You will even find two paintings by Dali and three by El Greco. But I suggest skipping medieval art. With ticket, you are also able to visit rooftop by elevator and view of building and hill from there is great."

I strongly suggest you buy both. The view from the rooftop is breathtaking and you also have a paying bar for drinks if you wish. Tickets for both are about 12 euros each.If you love art and even you just like art, you will enjoy this museum. It has different sections that go through different periods of time. Each section is great but I personally preferred the renaissance era.There's also a restaurant there with the same view as the rooftop but it's on the expensive side. You have a cafeteria that's serving affordable food and starting at 1pm, you have the lunch buffet which is the best option if you wish to eat different things."

It is free on Saturdays after 15.00 but is not expensive. You get large and reasonably discrete Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Modern (say after 1880) sections, all of them interesting and of good quality. This IS Catalan art from around , including sculpture and (for the Modern) furniture and you won't see this sort of thing in this sort of profusion outside Spain. The Romanesque - from c1070 - includes frescoes and other wall paintings, taken from the original buildings (churches etc typically) and recreated in that format (eg basilica). There are works by Rubens, El Greco, de Zurburan, de Ribera and Velasquez representing the renaissance/gothic period, amongst others. Collections gifted by Cambo and Thyssen-Bornemisza are shown inact but as part of the general flow of the museum. The Modern collection is particularly Catalan and very interesting in terms of style and subject matter including the Modernista and Civil War periods.My second time here - I think I enjoyed it even more than the first time."

We climbed either through inclined wide paths or escalators lined by shaped greenery and flowering shrubs or stairs to the four pillars. Then we climbed through escalators and stairs to the entrance to the museum. It was enjoyable despite the heat, distance and climb.

The MNAC (Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya) makes its home in the Palau Nacional, which was built for the International Exhibition of 1929 and converted into a museum in 1995. On the ground floor are exhibitions on Romanesque and Gothic art, as well as a smaller section showing Renaissance and Baroque art (mostly paintings). The section of Romanesque art is the most outstanding here, because of the murals of Romanesque churches from the 11th to 13th centuries. These murals are quite numerous and most of them are very big too. On the upper floor there are exhibitions on modern and contemporary art (including modernisme) as well as a small coin collection. The architecture of the Palau Nacional is worth seeing in its own right. Take a closer look at the magnificent entry hall and the huge auditorium in the center of the building. The museum shop is also worth visiting."

If not, then you're saved from getting jelly legs even before you reach the museum's doors by making use of the elevators running up the side of the ginormous multi tiered fountain that makes up part of the museum's spectacular facade. When you get to the top, don't forget to turn around and take in the scene of Barcelona before you- it's a gorgeous scene. The museum is admission free from 3PM onwards on Saturday! There's no fear about missing any part of the exhibition, as all sections of the museum is labelled with banners and are clearly defined. This is a big museum and there are many different art styles/genres/movements housed at the MNAC so most likely you will find something you'll like here. One of my favourite moments was having Picasso's \"Woman in Hat and Fur Collar\" all to myself for a good whole 5 minutes."

The modern art was my favourite. Was amazed by the ancient art as well, many things are hundreds of years old I think! It's amazing to see. The entire building is magnificent, the staff are all really friendly and there are beautiful fountains outside. There are escalaters to help you get up the steps. We walked the long way round through the park from the other side which is a really cool walk if you are into that! We walked miles through the streets, following the signs and looking in local boutiques, and we walked up a steep hill and there were escalaters further up to help you get up the hill if you need a rest!! What a brilliant idea! Then we walked through the park to MNAC. What a lovely park as well, weird vandalism on a sign on entry to the park that said \"Tourists go home! Tourists ruin the city\", which wasn't very welcoming."

It is below Montjuic Castle and Placa Espana. Just in front of it is rage Magic Fountain that operates on weekends at night and is apparently quite a sight. When we were there it did not operate and 1 night it rained so we did not see the fountain. The large building is on a hill and thankfully there are escalators that take you almost, but not wholly, to the top. It was built in early 20th century. The museum has a massive dome and looks a bit like St Pauls Cathedral in London. In different. The museum has a large collection of murals and religious paintings from Catalan and Pyrenese churches. There are a series of Romanesque paintings from 11th to 13th century. There is also a collection of panel paintings. There are also wooden and stone sculptures mostly of religious tinge. There are also collections of Gothic art from the Catalan provinces from 12th to15th centuries and well preserved. There are also paintings from the Renaissance and Baroque periods. There are paintings by El Greco, Tintoretto , valazquez, Titian, Tiepolo, Rubens, Cranach and Goya. There are a few Modern paintings including those of Picasso. Of course there are numerous Catalan artists not known outside of the area but there is a large collection of modern Catalan art. Overall it may not be Prado, Louvre or the National Gallery but this art gallery is well worth a visit."

This would be getting a 5 star rating from me if it wasn't for the awful experience in the cafe and the bathrooms.Firstly, the building itself it gorgeous as is the setting, even if you're not an art fan it's worth visiting the building for the views from the high vantage point over Barcelona and the beautiful architecture. The modern art collection is good, a lot of lesser known Catalan artists but any art lover will enjoy a wander around this gallery. It was free entry on Saturday afternoon after 3pm so we didn't have to pay.However, we stopped at the central cafe in the middle of the museum to grab a coffee and a cake - on top of being exorbitantly priced the rude staff member sneezed into her hand and proceeded to handle my food and coffee right in front of me. When I asked her to change them I was sneered at and told it's just allergies - quite frankly if I hadn't been seriously depleted of caffeine at that point I'd have told her to stick her coffee. The bathrooms resembled something I would expect to see at a dodgy venue at 4am - most of the toilets were backed up and flooding all over the floor, absolutely disgusting and certainly not what you would expect to see at a museum in the afternoon. Such a pity these incidents spoiled an otherwise lovely experience."

I was actually quite excited in coming here on the Night of the Museums, a unique night when one is delighted with the free admission and the extended museum opening hours (until 1 a.m.). If you're walking then it's a quite the walk (and a steep one) from the closest subway at Plaza Espana to the actual museum. The views of Barcelona are splendid though. I expected a lot more than I saw. There is an emphasis on lesser known Catalan artists that is noteworthy but a distinct lack of better known artists such as Miro and Dali (although Miro has one large mural and he has his own foundation/museum). As for me, I saw no Dali and only one Picasso."

This place has a bit of an identity crisis as it's the one of the most photographed buildings in Barcelona, it's lights shine across the city every night, and yet not many people venture inside. We did go inside and straight up to the roof which offers more spectacular views and a Mo\u00ebt lounge which....just has Mo\u00ebt cushions to sit on. No champagne...in fact no bar at all. Seems like a missed opportunity as you could chill there between different exhibits. And they could be making a fortune selling drinks!As for the exhibits we only did the medieval sections and they are clearly directed at locals, not tourists. Nothing labelled in anything else but Spanish and when we purchased our ticket they didn't warn us or offer us an audio guide (you really need one if you don't speak Spanish!). One room was mainly religious sculptures from wood - the other was paintings taken from real churches and transported to the museum for preservation (seems sad they are all there out of their homes). We didn't do the modern section. For only 12 euro it's well worth going inside, having something to eat, spend an hour on the roof (it's quite big), maybe do one or two exhibits then be on your way. There is also a pretty fab theatre in the building so if something is on, that would also be a good way to see the space."

You can then decide what else to see, because there is a lot and quite impressive, no matter the period you are interested in. This is quite an enjoyable visit, and quite close to other must-see attractions like the Miro Foundation or the Ethnological Museum, the Poble Espanyol or the Monjuic castle.

There were a lot of people but it wasn't overwhelming.Personally my favorite part of this was the 2nd half of the modern art section. You get a step by step explanation of art movements from Guadi to almost present day. It specifically looks at these movements through a Catalan lens. You not only get to see how Catalunya fit into Spanish culture but also the world. There are really amazing rooms that give a clear explanation of how Catalunya's art world reacted to the rise of Franco, fascism, the actual civil war itself, and the aftermath. For me this was the most interesting part. It is simply a must."

The museum exhibits paintings from different eras, on the ground floor you find Romanesque (mainly mural paintings) and Gothic art, whereas the first floor is dedicated to Modern Art, including: neoclassical, realist, romantic art. There is also a section about Modernisme and Noucentiste. The museum is very big and it's impossible to take in everything on one day. If you buy a regular ticket (12\u20ac) you can come back within a month. If you have enough time, you could get an audioguide, since most written explanation is only provided in Spanish and Catalan (especially on the ground floor). With the ticket you also get access to the roof terrace which provides you with excellent views of Barcelona."

We don't normally gravitate towards modern art, but liked what we saw here. Each piece is marked with the artist, name of the piece, and date. Don't miss the Cambo Bequest and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection. Cafe is expensive - 3.50 euros for one can of Coke. You can bring in water, but only drink it when you aren't in a gallery. We took a taxi to the entry level from the center area of La Rambla for 8.60 euros and had a short walk to the entrance, but plenty of other public transportation options. Not overly crowded on a weekday. Incredible views of Barcelona! Free for 65 and older with birthdate ID."

Of the moderns, we most appreciated the Spanish Civil War section since it's hard to find these artists or anything focused on the Civil War anywhere (but you need some energy when you get there, not good if tired). Cafe has some good items but very overpriced. Restaurant looked good but their timing & availability didn't work for when we needed to rest.

The Romanesque art collection from the 11th to 15th centuries is arranged in order by dates and it absolutely blew me away. The artists in those times seemed fascinated with torture. I am not well educated in the arts, but by the time I left this museum, I had a hunger for more knowledge (and I am a grandmother)"

The museum have medieval Romanesque Art abou 16 rooms, i have seen a lot of medieval art in Italy so I did not spend much time here. But if you haven't seen this kind of art this is a great place to have a taste of it. I really loved the medieval gothic art areas, i do love renaissance and baroque arts so I really enjoyed the rooms 32,33,34. I liked the Combo Bequest and Thyssen Bornemisza collection. On Sunday or Saturday the museum is free which was GREAT!. They have free wi-fi and a elevator that goes on the roof. There is a nice walk on the roof and the view is stunning, I do advice you see it during sunset.From the top you can see the small arena where around 17.30-18.00 is starting a free dance-theater performance. It is kind of PIna Bausch but i believe it is even better, you can enjoy the performance on the auditorium area. And I really did love it. Ones the Museum closes you can sit outside and listen the fontains rumor. An hour after the museum close there is a Majestic Fountain, fontain and musick and light performance from the top of the museum. This place will really make you fall in love with Barcelona, with the beauty, the theater, the art and the water and muck....It does make you fell grateful and full with love!"

I am always amazed when I come across another one that exceeds my expectations. This museum is definitely one of those. The organization and curation of the exhibits is outstanding. This would be a great place to bring a novice to introduce them to the chronological development of art in this part of Spain, and in fact, in Europe as a whole, from Romanesque to early 20th century. The ground floor areas with Romanesque and Medieval/Renaissance art is absolutely full of interesting and significant pieces. They may not have any particularly famous works, but my personal feeling is that we are bombarded too often with the same images, by the same famous artists. Looking at the work of lesser known artists re-awakens the senses and leads to a realization that talent and originality has existed in many countries and gone by largely unnoticed. The upper floor is wonderfully curated. The mix of media, photography with furniture with paintings and ceramics works very well. The thematic layout, focusing on the self portraits, interiors, exteriors etc helps the viewer see connections and understand cultural themes and ideas. Good caf\u00e9 inside in an enormous hall area, reputed to be one of the largest public spaces in Europe! Also great views from the caf\u00e9 outside. There is a good, up-market restaurant on the first floor that looks like somewhere for a more special lunch!I had to go twice to this museum (one ticket allows two entries within a month) and I still haven't finished.

Some were so interesting and informative I wound up taking picture of the description more than the art.Combined with the great plaza leading down from the Museum and the Olympic park nearby, it made the trip a 'must do' for me.Don't forget to go up to the roof platform. It goes almost all the way around the rooftop. Great unobstructed views.Tip: As with every major attraction in Spain, tickets are sold on a timed entry basis. Absolutely book tix in advance online.

The fountain in front will take you miles away, mainly if you visit in the evening where you have 'The water dance show '. The Museum is fantastic inside and outside, you will spend hours knowing what the most famous Spanish artist left for us to admire. I do recommend you to arrive early and stay till evening for the Fountain water show."

While they do have a very impressive Romanesque and 16th century art exhibit, which includes El Greco by the way, my favorite part of the museum is their \"Art Modern\" display. They recently redone this whole section very successfully to show all the different types of media side by side, allowing the viewer a broader view of 19th-century Catalan visual culture. I was very impressed and highly recommend this museum to any art lover visiting Barcelona.

Admire the frail beauty of Romanesque church murals and their surprisingly vivid colours -- neatly brought back to life by restorers. Interestingly, a number of the murals displayed were carved out from churches scheduled for demolition and painstakingly re-assembled here. When I write re-assembled I mean it in the literal sense -- it's almost as if these churches have been brought back into the flesh. I saw something similar in the Prado in Madrid. This approach probably wouldn't have been pursued today -- the modern conservationist ethic would probaly be not to remove the artworks from their original context. Nevertheless, this is a marvellous collection.I also found the collection of posters from the Spanish Civil War very interesting -- I wish there were more of them exhibited.There's a 180-degree view of the city from the outside, where there's also a small outdoors museum caf\u00e9. I wouldn't recommend anything other than take-away coffee from this place, though. I had an overpriced ham and cheese sandwich that wasn't properly toasted and cold on the inside -- it looked as if it had been pre-toasted. Tables were dirty and had old stains from coffee and milk on them.Free entry on Fridays. The museum website is very informative and has a lot of information available in English."

It covers basically Romanic and medieval art in the first floor and the late XIX and early XX century art in the second floor. The collection of medieval art is amazing. There are also a lot of furniture, paintings and photographs of the \"Gaudi\" period. However the most impressive e part is the Romanic art. They basically took all the frescoe paintings from endangered Romanic churches and broth them, reproducing the original church settings inside the museum. Absolutely unforgettable. In my opinion it is, along with the Sagrada Familia, one of the two unmissable attractions of the city. If you have the money, I t probably has the restaurant with the best views of Barcelona"

We were at Pla\u00e7a d\u2019 Espanya, which is really close, but decided to take bus 150 instead of going all the way up using the stairs and escalators, due to the horrible heat in the summer. It was a good option in the end, since the bus was air-conditioned and it took a route around/behind the museum, going past many other sites, like Poble Espanyol, the Olympic museum, Fundacio Joan Miro and going all the way up to Castell de Montjuic, which we went later on. We had a Barcelona card, so we went in for free and had access to the roof, with a breathtaking view of the city. It was summer, so there was electronic music playing and a bar, from which we got some nice cold beers and took our time admiring the view in the shade of some huge umbrellas. That was really special! As for the works of art, well, I\u2019m no art connoisseur, and having been to the most famous museums in Europe before, it was mildly interesting. I really liked the Modern Art section, though, with the Civil War part. It was really worth going there, though, I loved the building, really, really gorgeous, a gem! I\u2019m the kind of person who usually enjoys the buildings more than the art collections, and that wasn\u2019t a let-down. There are some eating/ drinking options at the museum, but I thought it was really expensive for what it was; the food at the caf\u00e9 was sad-looking. We ended up eating at Fundacio Joan Miro, which is within walking distance."

The old palace is beautiful from afar, although it isn't quite so lovely after the amount of steps you have to take to get there, even with the escalators in place it's quite a tiring walk to the top, by which you are very much out of breath.The museum itself is lovely-relaxing and quiet, with a beautiful view of the Placa de Espana below. There is a also a shopping centre situated on the top right corner of the Placa de Espana from the museum which has quite a few restaurants with a lovely view as well.It's also very close to the Olympic grounds-if you go past the castle and keep walking, you should reach it. Good if you're staying for a couple of days (although I wouldn't recommend this for a one-day trip to Barcelona simply due to the amount of time it takes to view an art gallery.)"

It was truly magnificent and the educational aspects were outstanding. Tip: Get the audioguide. It is excellent and very affordable at 3.50 Euro. In contrast, the modern art collection felt a little more like an afterthought (even with the audioguide which only offered a few commentaries on this collection that spanned the upper floor). Still some excellent work, but it could not compare to the earlier work in the museum. I recommend going when the museum opens and walking the gorgeous stairs to enjoy the majesty of this grand space. Gorgeous views and a wonderful place to take pictures. I understand you can pay a bit more for rooftop access, but I didn't find it necessary as the weather was perfect and the view for pictures spectacular."

For photography enthusiasts note that you CAN take photos in the MNAC, just switch of your camera's flash function.A trip to the roof deck (Patio) to view Barcelona was also worth the short stair climb.

But we decided to at least get up on top of Montjuic and take a look at the views....once there the delightful gathering of local musicians and artists entertained us (as well as the lovely weather) and after devouring some delicious ice cream decided, \"aw what the heck lets go inside even though the Med Sea below, sunshine and aromatic air begs us to stay outside!!\". Because we went in late in the day we only spent about 3 hours there...and WOW, one of the most interesting visits I've ever had. I won't go into further detail but let me state this: whoever curates, collects and then sets up the exhibits, are all to be applauded. We learned so much about Catalonia, about Spain, that made me thankful we went. We were able to see unique pieces of periods of art history that we already enjoy at other museums, that can only be seen here, that we were thankful we went in. And I promise you, we will go back. Sorry for the late review...we were actually there in 2013 in August but I just HAD to submit a review."

If you don't mind a bit of an uphill walk, approaching on foot from the Placa Espanya is definitely the way to take in the magnificent fountains, the architecture, and the people of Barcelona out for a stroll.  Inside the best part of the museum is the collection of Romanesque frescoes and murals, preserved from isolated Pyreenean churches. The exhibits and explanations of the preservation of these amazing works of art are very well-curated, with photos of how they were removed and restored.  The museum is free for those under 16 and over 65. Plan to spend at least half a day here. Then take the rest of the day to explore the Parc de Montjuic, where there are gardens, other museums, an outdoor theatre, a fortress, and, more recently built, the Olympic Stadium."

The art has a Catalonian flavor that you won't find in other parts of Europe, the world or even Spain. I think the museum is an essential stop to get a rounded exposure to the Catalonian culture.

The building itself is so quite interesting.\nDepending on how interested you are in the contents, you could easily spend the best part of a day here.\nEntry is free if you have the Barcelona Card."

I had only seen the exterior an wanted to see also the museum. We liked it a lot and we managed to see almost everything. There are very many items, starting with pieces of stone and wood from Medieval times and finishing with modern art. We spent there about 2h but still there were a few things that needed to be seen. The view from the bistro is also great! More than that we were so lucky as we arrived on a Sunday when we didn't pay the entrance :) Gracias Barca!"

It is a steady climb to start with which gets steeper. You walk passed the Venetian towers, the 4 columns which symbolise Catalunyan freedom and the Magic Fountain. There are some escalators and quite a lot of steps. There is a lovely cascade of water. There is a cafe on the terrace where you can stop and have a drink and take in the marvellous view before entering the museum. It is free entry for the over 65s like us with proof of age. It is an enormous building, There are lockers where you can leave your bags to the right of the entrance. We went to see the mediaeval and Gothic art with beautiful altar pieces and statues and some church plate. All very colourful. Then onwards to Renaissance and baroque art. Next more modern paintings. We then arrived in a huge space under the central dome which we understand used to be an ice skating rink. There is a cafeteria and and restaurant here. We stopped for a coffee and bought a sandwich and a small bottle of water. If you need water - do NOT buy it here they charged \u20ac2.50 for 33 ml - outrageous!! The sandwich was awful too - a soft sweetish bread roll with really tough ham!! Coffee was good though. After our break we went to the coin exhibit which was very interesting with some very ancient Greek, Roman and Visigoth coins. After this we were at the stage that we had seen so much it was impossible to take in any more. A couple of days later we went back to see the Romanesque department. It was stunning. There are Catalunyan church frescos from the 12th and 13th century. There was a danger that these frescoes would be sold abroad. They found a way of removing them without damage. They built replicas of the churches and put them on the walls. Amazing to think that these frescos are so old. They have been cleaned - and the colours are as they would have been the day they were painted. It feels as though you are walking into an ancient church. It is well worth visiting this museum."

We started on the ground floor and worked our way around using a map we were given. We were treated to an enormous exhibition of Romanesque and Medieval art. Upstairs we were treated to works by Picasso, Gaudi, El Greco and many other well know artists. This museum is a must visit if you are in Barcelona. We did not get to all the exhibitions.

The wonderful Palau Nacional houses the museum and they are a perfect match to each other.The museum has several collections from the early 11th century until the present.The most famous, the most notable and the must-see of the outstanding collection is the Romanesque church paintings. There are also panel paintings, wood and stone carvings and precious metalwork.My favourites were the panels came from the grave of Sancho S\u00e1nchez Carrillo and his wife Juana,representing the very rarely found Castilian Gothic style art. They look very old (around 1295) and very modern at the same time. If somebody would tell me to choose something from this museum, that would be my definite choice.In the Gothic art collection I found a few other paintings from which I could hardly break away, but it eventually covers the entire Museum.People who have time and energy to wonder around can find paintings from Goya, Tiepolo, El Greco, Ribera, Tiziano etc. Don\u2019t miss the amazing sculpture of Josep Llimona, the Desolation, and look up the stunning Principal Dome.When you leave, enjoy a bit the waterfalls, and the Magic Fountain-show, or no show.

I spent over four hours here the museum is so packed with fascinating exhibits!Firstly, the Romanesque frescoes - these have been rescued from remote churches all over Catalonia to prevent them from deterioration, pillaging & vandalisation. Apses & arches have been especially built to reconstruct how these frescoes would have looked in situe. Wonderful & amazing. Then there is an extraordinary & extensive collection of Gothic altarpieces. The modern collection is good too introducing me to a number of Catalan artists with whom I was unfamiliar, along with works by Gris, Dali (including some interesting early realist works), Picasso & Utrillo. One of my favourite works is a pun on a Gothic altarpiece by Julio Romarez de Torres entitled \"Tableau of Love\". This altarpiece only has figures of women including two large (in your face) female nudes! The artist has a wonderful sense of humour! ( I wonder how the Church received this work?)The main restaurant was closed for a private function the day I visited but the cafe off the main hall was quite good. The museum is free for those aged over 65 years (proof required). Highly reccommended!"

The displays are carefully arranged into the Romanesque, the Gothic, the Renaissance and the Modern periods. The Romanesque section displays a large number of decorations reclaimed from the naves of some of the more ancient churches in the region that had been abandoned and were in danger of destruction. Many of these pieces are exceptionally lovely, and you'll find yourself congratulating the technicians who reclaimed them. The Gothic period includes many excellent representations of religious art of the period, most by local artisans who employed similar methods of depiction of religious figures and selections of subject matter. It was most interesting to compare the depiction of the same events by different artists. The section representing the Renaissance period goes further afield, including non-Catalan artists such as Tintoretto, Lucas Kranach, and many others. I was particularly taken with the one Canaletto view of Venice, one of his best. Didn't get to the Modern section due to time limitations. For anyone who enjoys art, this is the number one museum in Barcelona."

It's absolutely worth it, so I will just point out our problems on the day.1. If you go up on the bus Route 150, you will get off on C l'Estadi, and there will not be adequate signage to the MNAC: you can't get in from the back, you must go all the way round to the entrance looking over the fountains all the way down to Av. Reina Maria Cristina to Pl. Espanya.2. Food choices are tough: the terrace for coffee and pastry, the very expensive restaurant upstairs, or the cafe/resto in the giant exhibition hall. The cafe has prewashed shrink-wrapped disgusting food, the resto has overpriced not wonderful food. Maybe bring a picnic?3. The frescos rescued from the old churches are amazing, you will feel like you are in the church sometimes. After a while you travel back and get a feel for walking through an almost thousand year old church, very moving. BUT, then comes the overwhelming and confronting repetition of saints being tortured, in the painted alterpieces. Interesting to identify each saint's story by the repeated scenes and type of grisly death depicted, but we become sickened by it and moved on. Presumably, Christians in their local church would get used to only one or two saint-mutilation/death scenes, but in a museum, there are too many to cope with. Ah, religion.5. On the plus side: you get another ticket for a return visit, so you split up the ancient/mediaeval art on one day and come back for the Modern another."

On my map of the Magic Fountain area are marked nine palaces but from a distance like the cable car from the Parallel metro station to Parc de Montjuic, it looks like a castle or a tenth palace. But of course it is an art museum (one covered by the Barcelona Art Passport) and a serious one. We didn't do it justice because we had a pretty packed itinerary for the day but we did spend an hour here admiring the various paintings. Obviously a serious art lover can spend many hours here.I recommend you take the funicular to Parc de Montjuic, then the cable car to the real castle (fortress) then return by the cable car to the Miro Museum which is a short walk from this museum, then walk down the cascading levels by the Magic Fountain to the Espanya metro station. That should occupy much of your day."

We visited Parc de Montjuic which in itself is a truly wonderful outing, and topped it off with a prowl through this beautiful museum. We approached it from the top of the hill after visiting the castle, and had a beautiful walk down through lovely parks and lush greenery. We came upon escalators which we rode to the museum. It was a Saturday so entrance was free from 3p.m. and boy did we avail ourselves of that! No hassle, no queueing to get any sort of ticket. Come 3 p.m., just breeze in. I think you can hire audio phones which I would strongly recommend. We did not have much time so we just rushed through modern art and the renaissance sections, and took tiny peeks at others. The museum is huge and the building itself is so beautiful on the exterior as well as the interior.There is a huge pavilion in it's center which I thought to had been a ballroom seeing as the building is called a \"palau\". It was really splendid with beautiful ceilings and carvings, and I couldn't stop trying to capture every crevice on camera. Later I found out that it isn't a palace at all but an exposition pavilion. Grand!!! Another truly lovely aspect was that there was music and dance teachers willing to teach any one to dance (which further strengthened my conviction of it having been a ballroom).The facade of the building is absolutely lovely. There are huge cascades and fountains in front which lead down to the magic fountain, and to other sections of the Montjuic Parc, and then on to Placa Espanya.Do not miss this lovely musuem!"

All the fountains are turned off at 3 also. The restaurant is average with high prices, but great views. Sad to have missed the museum plus paying an entrance fee to gain admission to the restaurant was extra sad. Of course this was my mistake - the museum looked lovely and we enjoyed wandering through the park. The fountains were on when we arrived so that was very nice.

There's lots to see and I got a bit worn out after 2 hours so I left her to go to the modern section alone. That was a mistake. Thankfully she came back to tell me I had to see it.

Housed in a commanding building perched high upon Montjuic Hill, this palace seems to sprawl and, on first sighting it, you convince yourself you will never see everything. However, whilst we did not, that was because we spent just three hours there. An hour or so longer, and you would see it all. We missed out the Gothic, the Renaissance and the Baroque sections, but saw everything else. My tip is that if you have time for just one section, see the Romanesque exhibits. These largely constitute one-thousand-year-old frescoes rescued from loss or further deterioration by an enlightened Catalonian government from crumbling churches in the Pyrenees last century. These are world-class, and I doubt I have ever seen so many church frescoes of such quality gathered together in one place and displayed so well anywhere in the world, except when in situ. You can also enjoy an interesting trip through the development of art in Catalonia by theme: there are some good artists and sculptors. Look out of the rather mischievous bust of Picasso in unfamiliar mood. If you get chance, get up on the terraced roof for some great views over the city. One downside: the cafe is expensive (4.9 euros for a slice of tart), but that does not detract from this sumptuous gallery of art."

The Museum building is impressive and that's just the building!I visited the section containing modern art as this is what interests me and it was very interesting and informative. Nicely laid out, signs next to the paintings not too far away to see and helpful summaries telling you more about the lives of the artists. The entrance ticket also includes a visit to the roof which is well worth a visit. If nothing else the 360\u00b0 views are amazing. There's also a champagne bar complete with music and of course fantastic views so why not have a sit down and relax for a while. One of the sections you have to walk on the get around the building I thought was a bit scary but a deep breath and making myself look forward and not down got me across without too much trouble, i.e. drama! I did have a water in the self service cafeteria and thought it a little expensive, \u20ac2.45 for a 33cl bottle is a bit steep in my opinion but I soon realised this was about the going rate in Barcelona."

I was lucky enough to visit the MNAC on the National Day of Catalonia and so admission was free but I would have been more than happy to pay! Although a relatively small museum it is easy to spend a good few hours exploring the exhibits, there are some amazing art works and sculptures as you would expect but there were also some surprises such as the collection of Romanesque Art, which featured amazing murals that had been transported from caves and churches throughout Europe. Also, the main Auditorium area is stunning and I found it a welcome break to sit and relax before setting off again on our tour round the building. However, I have to echo other comments to say that a trip to the MNAC would not be complete without a visit to the roof terrace. It is easy to access via the lifts (just be aware you do have to cut through the restaurant which can be a little intimidating when people are eating in there!) however, the views are amazing and it was brilliant to sit and have a few drinks from the pop up bar. I really enjoyed my visit to the MNAC, in fact, that whole area of Barcelona is really beautiful and well worth a visit to see surrounding attractions such as the Olympic stadium and parks. It was also great to see the vista right down to the Fountains which regrettably we didn\u2019t stay to watch as 1.5 million people were descending for the rally but I hope to return again and if so the MNAC will be high on my places to revisit!"

The museum is free to enter on a Saturday after 3pm. The views of the city at the main entrance are incredible, especially on a sunny day. My favourite artwork was the Spanish Civil War propaganda, and it was an unexpected surprise to see the Gaudi displays, as well as a Picasso. The gardens down to the Placa de Catalunya (where the old bull ring has been converted into a shopping mall) is breathtaking. Not usually one for art galleries, but this one is a must if you are visiting Barcelona. Highly recommended!"

When we got off the metro, we could see the museum from the station and it looked impressive from afar with the fountains & waterfall in front of it. We went in the morning when it had cleared up from all the rain, then we got some good pictures over the city from outside the MNAC before heading inside as it started to rain again. There was absolutely no queue and fantastic spots for photos. However the rooftop was shut which was a bit of a shame due to the bad weather.We got in using free entry from the BCN card and the lady explained that the ticket gives you two entries in one month which is good if you don't finish looking at the museum in a day. We spent 2-3 hours in there and we were really bored (mainly because we have no interest in art). We found the tourn\u00e9e de chat noir & some pablo picasso (woman in hat and fur collar). The wood work is interesting as well. We didn't look at half of the museum as we had a lot to fit into our 5 day itinerary but it would be nice to go back some day and finish looking at the rest of it even if i'm not a big fan of art.If you get time, you should go during the day to see the contrast between the day and night of the fountain, as there is a show font magica in the evening on thursday-sunday from 9.30-11.30pm. Its amazing and crowded in the light/water display."

Let me start with the positives: the walk up to the MNAC is lovely, as are the fountains (where were on but not in \"magic\" mode when we walked past). As you can see from the pictures, it involves a bit of a hike up some steps, so those with mobility issues might want to check on that.Great views out over Barcelona from the area just outside the main building, so if you just want to come and stroll around and take photos then great.We had also bought tickets for the actual museum - which is divided into different sections, Roman, Gothic, Modern etc - and I had lashed out on audio guides for us in the hope that they would \"bring the art to life.\"Without wishing to sound a Philistine (and I have watched my share of BBC4 art documentaries) the repetitive sight of solemn Jesuses and Marys surrounded by saints soon began to pall. And the audio guide didn't save the day - pretty dry stuff. So we swiftly moved on to Impressionism and Modern - a bit better, some Gaudi furniture (but you can get a better idea of that at Casa Batila and others), one Picasso which is fine as far as it goes. I was more drawn to the Civil War propaganda posters which were pretty dramatic but our willingness to continue was waning rapidly - even though we were only trying to do the highlights and pretty much had the place to ourselves at about 6pmMaybe we should have done the photography exhibition instead, but about 40 minutes after walking in we were walking back out again.There's nothing \"wrong\" with what's on show here, its just that many cities have many better exhibits and its underwhelming in comparison.So we went to see some art and ended up having nice walk in the sunshine - as others have said, you don't really have to go inside to have a nice time here."

The nice thing is people with disabilities can easily get to the top as well since there are escalators up and down.

It shows the rise of Catalonian \"modernisme\", which in France would have corresponded with \"art nouveau\". We discovered many great painters that we weren't familiar with. Very much worth a trip!"

There is a large exhibition of paintings and there were enough paintings I liked to stop in front of them, return to them for seconds and fill several hours.There is a also a cheap cafeteria and restaurant inside the MNAC where you can buy a decent lunch in addition to a stand outside of the MNAC."

Most of the signage in the Gothic section is in Catalan or Spanish, so a guide would be helpful if you can't read in one of those languages. The Modern art area focus a lot of attention, rightly so, on Gaudi and art that he influenced. A section on propaganda from the Spanish Civil War was unique and interesting.

We were breath taken as soon as we left the station; the exterior is magnificent, placed on a hill in order to further emphasise its glory. After scaling the steps (or cheating and taking the escalators, a nice touch for an especially hot day) you will find an almost panoramic view of the city. If you're not interested in art at least visit for this, as there is nothing quite like it. As an art student I really enjoyed the collection. The style of the Renaissance works is unique, and differs in style from what I have previously seen in Northern European and Italian galleries. The Romanesque work was equally interesting and different. However, my favourite part was the contemporary collection. It's curation was really good and broke down the works into sections. My favourite pieces include the Art Deco works and the 'civilisation' video. I was equally impressed with the gift shop which sold some beautiful items at affordable prices.. I went a bit crazy with postcards!Overall I would definitely recommend this gallery, it is beautiful as well as manageable, and the fact that it was free made it all the more better."

When you climb up to the entrance level, you can see the Magic Fountain and many other landmarks.The museum itself displays many works of art from a wide range of time periods, from Roman times through to modern art.For even more stunning views, I would recommend visiting the rooftop. There is a terrace bar on the roof and a restaurant (Oleum), which also have great views.If you are planning on visiting this and other museums, it may be worth looking into buying an Articket which costs 30 euros, and gives you access to MNAC and 5 others."

There was a bar and souvenir shop just outside its doors who were ready for the crowd of people who gather at sunset for the best views of the city and of the magic fountain show. We took the metro subway train back to our hotel after the fountain show ended and it was so worth it."

My daughter said it was like a mini-version of the New York Metropolitan Museum, and in many ways, I would agree - though she zipped through the three sections of the museum much faster than me and her elder sister. I wished there was more English in the descriptions, but they did have some English descriptions at the beginnings of each section. I spent more time in the Romanesque and Gothic sections than in the modernist sections - the transplanted frescos are just amazing to look at. It is not surprising, I know, but seeing the gradually increasing complexity of painting from 1000AD to 1900AD was, for me, a powerful reminder of man's cultural evolution."

Also good audio visual of the removal and conservation of same. An good collection of Gaudi furniture and furnishings including amazing doors from Casa Batllo. But the rest of the modern galleries are patchy at best and give compelling reasons as to why Picasso and Miro are the regions foremost artists. With one exception for this viewer: Ramon Casas. A fine artist. The building is neo classical grandismo. Seemingly pointless for anything other than pretension. Disability access, always poor in these buildings, is atrocious with many steps and flights of stairs between galleries and levels. On that note, if you are getting public transport get the bus to the base of the grandiose fountain strewn approach avenue, there are escalators all the way up to the gallery, and then a reasonable sloping ramp to the main door.

Audio guide is highly recommended."

Climbing up the steps to the entrance, you get a wonderful view of Placa de Espana and the distant hills. The museum is well-organized with time periods to guide a visitor through a historical perspective of Catalunya art. The early collections of Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque art are truly one of the best in the world. One of the amazing talents we enjoyed is Mariano Fortunys--his work is inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time. And catch Miro's early work--you would not have known he did traditional art.Invest in the audio guide--worth every cent. And take breaks at the cafeteria under the incredible oval roof.We enjoyed ourselves so much we ran out of time. The ticket allows two days of visit but we had to move on from Barcelona...."

The collections of medieval and gothic religious works - from alter triptychs to recovered frescos and paintings by classical artists - was remarkable, and unique in our experience. The modern art section is also impressive. As a whole, they underscore just how the Catalonian region was in generating and promoting European art.The collection is spread out throughout a large (neo-classical) building, so there is adequate space to take hoards of tourists without claustrophobia. There is good description adjacent top many of the works, so novices like us were able to get good information and insights into the artists/craftsmen and their works. We expected to spend two hours there and ended up there the whole day.Thoroughly recommended.The building sits on a hilltop with great city views. There are a couple of good eateries in the building."

The series of fountains leading up to the palatial museum at the top of the hill was stunning. I would have been contented to just walk up the hill and see each segment of these beautiful fountains but my wife was hoping to see the actual museum and artwork too. I am glad she talked me into it because the collection of art here (like so many other museums in Barcelona) was fantastic. As I've said in some other reviews I was blown away by how well preserved/restored even the ancient Gothic art was. The layout of the museum is such that you can see the progression of artistic ability and expression in a seamless sequence. They also had some great examples of Renaissance and even contemporary art, what stands out in my memory was the collection of Civil War art and propaganda.Worth a several hour visit!"

There are just so many great photo opportunities before you even see your first piece of art. The art inside is pretty amazing. There is just so much Christian and historic art with many interesting stories behind them. The museum is expansive and well organized. The end of the museum also has more modern, think WWII, art and really cool war propaganda photos.There is also a restaurant with a stunning view on the 2nd floor. You can also access the roof of the palace. This is placed off to the side and can be easily missed, you definitely need to spend a few minutes standing up there."

Any reason to return to wonderful Barcelona will do, but a big one for us was for more time to visit MNAC after our first visit in 2012. What is there to love?1. MNAC spared no expense to modernize the National Palace. Airy, comfortable, perfectly lit2.Works of art shown at a rewarding and accessible viewing distance, as near or as far as it was intended to be seen.3. Great food from high-end eclectic Catalan restaurant, to low-cost small tapas cafe. Restaurant open late with its own entrance,for lunch and dinner, caf\u00e9 in the center very comfortable, open all day 4.Outside, breathtaking view above the city. 5.Easy to get to by shallow (many) steps and landings or escalators up from street level or winding and strolling indirectly through Parc Montjuic. Or a quick cab ride up from Pla\u00e7a Catalunya or Pla\u00e7a Espana. **One reminder: be sure to take a flashlight/make sure your phone is charged, for lighting your way down if you intend to leave after dark.The only flaw we encountered: Not as brightly illuminated outside as it could be on the way down to the street..And the main attraction:I myself was used to Renaissance art, and not expecting to love this relatively \"primitive\" looking Romanesque work. But I was surprised at how quickly I fell for it-- such mysterious, austere, graceful, and even sophisticated work.Seems like an inspiration for many aspects of 20th century art and design-- use of pattern, illusion, line, shape.  Romanesque art should be looked at slowly and carefully, there is a mysterious order to the placement of color and line. In situ: museum faithfully recreated alcoves, pillars and archways simulating basilica and vaults of churches where these works were originally discovered in the early 20th century in rural Catalonia. Authentic viewing experience of the scale, shape, and position of the art and sculptures as they were meant to be seen.. . The museum also has some odder looking cast-off works from early and middle Spanish Renaissance--the direct opposite of the Romanesque-- ornate, dramatic, somewhst overwrought, heavily decorated with gold, strong colors, and multiple patterns, figures, and layers of angels.. an entertaining counterpoint to the austere earlier Romanesque works."

If you get the Barcelona Card, the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya - MNAC is one of the free museums. It would be worth the price, regardless.The art collection runs from the 13th Century to the mid-20th Century. A huge collection of Gothic paintings, sculptures and altarpieces are what drew me in, but the Modernism collection was wonderful. Of course I've seen many of the styles and themes of Gothic and Renaissance art, but I didn't really have a sense of Modernism.The Museum is really well set up, directing your path from one room to the next. Also, there are explanations at the beginning of the new sections, giving you a sense of what your going to see. In the Modernism area, you'll see not only paintings and sculptures, but quite a bit of furniture. This being Barcelona, they had a lot of pieces from their favorite son, Antoni Gaudi.Besides the collection, the building and it's location are one of a kind. Once you get to the top, you'll have spectacular views of Barcelona below. And on your trip up from Placa Espana, you'll pass the Magic Fountain. We missed it, but the fountain dances to music on some nights. Like many other areas we've visited, there are some talented buskers setting up some nice soundtracks. As we were walking out, a keyboardist was playing \"Eres Tu\" a 1973 hit from the Spanish band Mocedades. The younger crowds, like my kids, remember it from the movie Tommy Boy,All in all, a great experience."

After La Sagrada Familia, I'd put this number 2 on my siteseeing list. The collection of frescoes is very well done. They've reconstructed the inside of many churches to display them. The view from all around the roof is incredible. Everywhere else we went was mobbed with tourists, and perhaps the best part was how quiet this museum is and a wonderful escape from the selfie-stick hordes!"

It sits high up on one of the hills overlooking the city. There was so much to see that we had to make the difficult choice to see only the collection of Romanesque frescoes, alterpieces and wood carvings. Mose of them had been rescued from chapels in the Pyrenees during the 1920s. There was a good display explaining how the process had been carried out. We had a lovely lunch in their restaurant with wide views of Barcelona in the valley below."

Once past the array of fountains, the approach to the museum is still magnificent to experience. There are many, many stairs, or outdoor escalators if preferred, moving up the hill past an enormous waterfall and garden area. From the front of the museum, you can see many miles of Barcelona! The museum itself is grand, a very large, stately building meant to impress when it was built in 1929. We visited the more modern arts second floor, and were very impressed by the pieces created during the Spanish Civil War, which conveyed the solemn spirit of the terrible circumstances of the time. Note: the museum is free for seniors 65 years or older."

We heard great reviews of the museum but did not have enough time - u need two hours plus, so had to regrettably skip it (12 euros pp). You can walk to it from Placa Espanya. Montjuic also has some lovely gardens and hills. The colourful magic fountain starts at 9pm from Thursdays to Weekends and an ideal itinerary would be to reach Montjuic in the afternoon/evening take aome snaps of the exterior and start seeing the museum from 5/6 pm followed by relaxing near the fountain when you come out. We were there during the weekdays and had to miss both."

There was a moment in the baroque when the spiritual gave way to the secular and the artists painted what was around them. Besides the landscapes, people, furniture there is my favourite artist, Juan de Zurbaran's whose works are so filled with latent sexuality that they border on the erotic. Barcelona landscapes look familier because we walk past the same spots depicted on the canvesses . El Greco masterpieces are worth slowing your gait for to check out their serene intricasies, as well as those of Ramon Casas. Its easy to see the progress of the city through those painting, a city that;s always charming. When we have finished craning our necks, we sit on the steps and watch the last light of the day play on the hills beyond and the city of Barcelona below."

Situated on Montjuic, overlooking Barcelona, located in the 1929 World's Fair pavilion, this is indeed, as the publicity says, 'a Museum like you've never seen before'. Including splendid reconstructions of Romanesc churches with carefully preserved frescoes, moving through the Gothic period and giving a whole floor to 'The Birth of the Modern Artist'--from the mid-19th to late-20th century. The signage, in Catalan, Spanish and English, is thoughtful and informative. We kept returning to it (three times in all during our 10-day trip)--this is helped by the fact that it is free to 65+, and even if you are under 65, your ticket is good for two days. The bookstore is a treasure trove; and there are usually several temporary exhibitions as well as the permanent displays. There are two cafes (one inside, one outside) and an upmarket restaurant. It's a lovely place to pause from art to sit on the steps overlooking Barcelona and just enjoy the view."

Get the audio tour for 3,50 Euros. 2. Walk up to the rooftop terrace and take in the view, it is WITHOUT A DOUBT, the best in the city.3. Go to the \"modern art\" wing and pass all the artwork and go to the Gaudi furniture. You will see many items that were once part of Gaudi's buildings and definitely worth the look. Also, there's a fantastic Picasso and a couple Miro's that you will happily see on the way out. 4. When done, walk down the steps and walk back to Plaza Espana as it will offer many views of the ornate building and offers different vantage points and waterfalls and fountains you can only see when walking down. There are escalators if you can't handle all the stairs!So, that's my \"highlights\" review if you are crammed on time. If you have more time allotted, the rest is all gravy!Hope you enjoyed!

If you like art and museums its a must visit. If your not so keen on museums its still an interesting place to escape the rain/heat. I hope to return some day to see the rest of the collection."

The view from this museum is nothing less than spectacular of the city of Barcelona. By itself, it is worth the walk or the cab ride.For the mobility impaired, the museum is well set up with manned lifts at all stair areas. The staff seems to want to help.The museum portions that we were most interested in are on the first floor, primarily religious-related materials. The highlight by far is the 12-14th century church paintings which were obtained from Romanesque churches in the 1920s. The Catalans saw that their old church material was being purchased by dealers and taken from the area and country. The government purchased the frescos, had them carefully removed and transferred to similar walls in the museum, and the rest is a very impressive exhibition. It is as though you are walking into numerous small chapels to see the art. They also have some pieces from the 12th century on the crucifixion which are especially of note. The Madrid Thyssen (sic) museum has a large display of art there as well including works by Cranach the elder, Fra Angelico, Rubens, and, interestingly, Gainsborough.The second floor exhibit area contains more modern pieces.There is a good gift shop and an interior restaurant and cafeteria as well as one that has a the view."

My wife and I walked the short distance from the Placa d'Espanya Metro Station in Barcelona passing through the two tall 'Venetian Tower' pillars along Av.Reina Maria Cristina up to the 'Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya' one sunny Saturday afternoon in April. Whilst you need to climb quite a few steps (there is an escalator for part of the way) to access the 'Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya' you will find that extremely pleasant views of this grand building together with the delightful 'Magic Fountain of Montjuic' which is located in front of this hilltop structure can be seen on your way up, and once you've reached the top of 'Montjuic Hill' you will be rewarded with fine views of the city.As the weather was so nice, we didn't go inside the museum as we wished to remain outdoors so as to enjoy the warm and sunny day - however it was nonetheless a great experience just to have viewed the exterior of this charming building together with its beautiful surroundings, and we were pleased to find that no admission charges were made for entering these lovely grounds. Well worth a visit if you are in this vicinity on a nice day."

We spent three hours because the museum closed and they kicked us out.The collection is unique. It consists mostly of frescos salvaged from small churches in the Pyrenees and replaced on substitute arches and apses. The artistic quality is as high as any Christian art anywhere in the world, and while Gothic art is all over the place (in Europe) Romanesque art like this is rare. There are also wooden sculptures and carved stone capitals that will take your breath away.The museum is in a beautiful site (on Montjuich), is modern and well set up. My wife was in a wheelchair and the staff could not have been more gracious and helpful. Spanish/Catalonian charm at its best. The descriptions are mostly in Spanish and Catalan, so if you can't fake romance languages, you should probably get the English audio-guide."

I enjoyed the more contemporary and modern collection on the upper floors.Very few of the descriptions surrounding the antiquities are in English so get the headset if you're interested in learning.

The walking/arriving at this museum is not for the faint of walking...it is quite a trip just getting to the museum itself (even using the many escalators they provide). However, if you just take your time and enjoy the views along the way, that is all part of the enjoyment. The building and grounds are exquisite. While the exhibits inside were tastefully done and interesting, the real enjoyment for us was the exterior of the building, the waterfalls, and the extraordinary views of Barcelona once you're up there.There were a few \"scammers\" that approached us for \"donations\" when we were sitting outside, but if you just tell them to go away, they do. We didn't feel they were dangerous, just annoying. This is common in any big city, just something to be aware of."

            "review": "Uneven but worthwhile, especially for the Romanesque. The Museu National d'Art de Cataluna is the main art museum in Barcelona, located near the bottom of the Montjuic hill on the Placa Espana side. You can walk easily enough from the Espana metro but it is uphill (you're basically starting your way up Montjuic hill) and there are a lot of stairs and (fortunately) escalators. The area around the gallery is very attractive and has good views of parts of the city. The museum's collection focuses on Spanish and Catalan Art, with the greatest strength arguably being in the mainly fresco-style art brought to the museum from churches of the Catalan Romanesque in the countryside north of Barcelona. They have built wooden mock-ups of the structures that were the frescos' original home so you can see, to the extent possible, how the art would have looked in its original space. (I have no idea how they got this art off the walls off their original homes and into the museum, which is a pretty impressive feat even from the technical point of view.) There is a lot of this stuff, and after a while everything starts to blend into everything else, but there is nevertheless a certain intensity which is impressive in its own right. There is also some non-fresco art, including a memorable (if gruesome) painting depicting the deaths of the saints, which is featured as an influence in Hiroshi Teshigahara's excellent film about Antonio Gaudi.The gothic medieval art doesn't quite make the same impression, but there are some good later pieces and then a very fast transition into the museum's collections of renaissance art, which is made up mainly of non-Catalan art, donations from thee Cambo bequest and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection (the latter's main collection is based in Madrid). These are a mixed bag but include a few characteristic Titians and Tintorettos as well as an equally characteristic El Greco.The museum's second floor is devoted entirely to Catalan art from about 1850 to 1950. I can't say I was blown away by anything in here but there are some pieces that are at least interesting. The annotations on these materials are quite bizarre, written throughout from some kind of Marxist-influenced perspective that tells you somewhat more about the author's politics than the art. This is unfortunate as this isn't really art that speaks for itself, yet it has interest and a good commentary would have been a significant addition to museum experience.The labelling and annotations are bilingual Catalan and Castillian throughout with English translations for some but not all of the annotations. Food options at the museum (including the outdoor terrace near the front entrance) are mediocre though sitting on the terrace with a coffee or a beer or a glass of wine is certainly a pleasant way to while away half an hour or so."

The layout is perfect - very spacious and light. Start with the Romanesque section, which is one of the greatest collections in the world. The Catalans were concerned about the degradation of the frescoes in churches in villages and with great care they removed them and re-installed them here in the form they had in the original church. This remarkable technical feat comes off so that you feel as if you are indeed in an old church when you walk around. Room after room reveals priceless treasures on the walls. As well as frescoes there are perfectly preserved paintings on wooden panels that glow with colour and are full of meaning. You will also find wooden scuptures from the 12th and 13th centuries that are so moving - perhaps the finest is on the descent of Christ from the cross. There are some fine pieces in the Gothic and Renaissance sections of the museum but they mostly do not compete with the incredible riches in the Romanesque part. Upstairs you will find two very large areas devoted to more modern art and to Modernisme, the Catalan equivalent of Art Nouveau. The latter sections are among the finest anywhere: the designs by Gaudi and his contemporaries are so strikingly beautiuful. Again, the displays are top class. What a superbly laid out museum this is! There is a bookshop, a cafe/restaurant and on the upper floor a restaurant with a great view over the city; the latter usually needs to be booked. There is so much to see that one visit is hardly enough, so it is an excellent idea that the ticket you buy allows you to come back free another day within one month."

My one warning would be that dining facilities are limited: the cafe has very limited seating and the day I was there and prepared to spend big to eat in their restaurant the restaurant was entirely booked for some affair or other."

(You can also walk to the nearby Miro museum.) Skip the snack bar out front and go inside where there are both a cafeteria in the back and a fine restaurant upstairs. Overall, MNAC is a spacious museum with an extensive collection of beautiful works by Spanish painters who did not get their due internationally - because of politics? history? Hard to say, but well worth your time now. Also, the building itself is magnificent. Go inside!"

Tickets for paying guests are good for two days during the same month. You will need more than two days to see all what the museum offers. It is wise to visit the excellent web site (http://museunacional.cat/en) to check the hours of winter and summer operation (Mondays closed). Make sure to bring your camera, tablet or phone to take thousands of pictures of an incredible variety of art. Particularly the Medieval Romanesque wing is unique in the world, housing the preserved wall paintings from many churches of the Pyrenees. Then there is the Gothic art wing, which I unfortunately had to rush through, so I missed the Renaissance and Baroque wing all together. And that is only the ground floor! There is also the first floor with modern, contemporary art. Clearly, this museum requires multiple visits to do it justice."

The roof terrace is free to access by going up the numerous interior escalators. There is a supermarket in the basement of the shopping mall, so you can stock up on picnic things prior to going up to the gallery and surrounding attractions.We then took a slow walk up the path between the towers to admire the fountains and Art museum behind.It is a magnificent building amd we whiled away a good couple of hours in the gardens.We didn't pay to go inside as it was too expensive for us on our budget (i was travelling with my 12yr old daughter) and had already stumped up a lot for the Sagrada Familia and other sights. We then had a wander around the Olympic park and stopped for some lunch in the grounds.A pleasant morning spent away from the hustle and bustle of Barce city centre. Definitely worth a visit."

Neither of us are art or history buffs but I wanted to check the place out as I'd heard the area surrounding it was beautiful.We weren't disappointed. As soon as you step off the Metro and look up at the Gallery on the hill you realise it's a beautiful building, and the fountains and area surrounding it do it justice.Even the view from outside the museum, without paying to go inside is excellent, so if you're really doing your holiday on the cheap you could climb the stairs to the museum and check out the view without ever going inside.When you are inside, there are several galleries with seemingly endless rooms of art to check out. I'm sure art buffs would appreciate it more than we did, but even so there were some incredible pieces in there.It might be worth paying for an audio tour though. We didn't, and as a result didn't know much about any of the pieces, as the majority of the signs are in Catalan.Still an enjoyable couple of hours though.Finally, we made our way to the rooftop terrace, where you get some astonishing views of the city. You can pay a few Euro to see the view from the terrace without going into the gallery so again, if you're looking for a cheaper activity, you could just do that.The view is amazing a real photo spot for tourists. Worth the price of admission alone.A great way to spend a morning, and only a short hop on the metro from la Rambla so no problem getting there at all. You could even walk it if you fancy a long stroll."

Each level has a different fountain and provides a wonderful view back to the top. Once you make it back down to street level there are yet more fountains. In the evening, the main fountain is lit up and dances to an array of music. The perfect atmosphere for a calming night, or even a romantic set up with a loved one.

We had gone on a guided tour, so I didn't get to hear a live concert there, but they did play an organ sampling, which was great -- a lot of reverberation throughout the hall.The advantage of the guided tour (get one in your language, and be sure to reserve tix in advance as they will sell out) is that you not only learn about the hall, but you'll see it in the daytime when the light is best. If you go to the concert, on the other hand, you'll visit it as it was intended. Now if you can go to a daytime concert.... :-) !!"

It is on the hill overlooking the city, which is a lovely and peaceful part of town. (Even if you don't go to the museums on the hill, visit it for some relaxation!) I first visited the Miro museum so approached this on the way down the hill to town. One can, in fact, take escalators up past very cool cascading fountains to get there, as well. Back to the museum. It is a grand old building, and represents a very, very long timeline. There was a special contemporary exhibit of a Catalan artist with which I began my visit and enjoyed very much. The rest of the collection was a bit of a rush for me, since it was the end of the day and there was so much to see. It is, quite frankly, a bit overwhelming, so one might be advised to do a bit of research before going. The collection was eclectic and mixed and varied. I needed a few days to process whether I liked it or not and in the end, I think it is worth visiting, especially if you've got the Artticket, which gives one entrance to six museums for one price. Take the time to relax in front of the museum, at least on weekends, when there are musicians playing on the steps in front of the museum. I would have liked to have begun my day earlier there. I think I would have better appreciated the depth and breadth of its holdings. In any case, go there if you've got the Art ticket. It is only a 5-10 minute walk from the Miro exhibit (a must see!) and a nice way to work your way down the hill back to town. Recommended."

Many people stop by this museum just to take pictures of the building alone. The museum is located in a great part of Barcelona as you're next to the old olympic stadium, magic fountain and Montjuic Castle. Even if you don't make it inside the museum, just stop by the area and enjoy all the amazing sites!"

General admission is usually 12 Euros each. So, this was great. We did not have many hours to spare so we got a brochure which showed us the many highlights of the museum and where they were located in the building. Museum is located by PL. Espanya Green Line L3 or Red Line L1. In front of the museum is the Magic Fountain where you can see a beautiful water show at nights complete with music and lights. I believe there are no water shows on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays. At the back of the Museum you can walk to the Olympic Stadium. When you get to PL. Espanya Metro station, look for the 2 tall towers and walk in that direction. You will pass the magic fountain and the Museum is behind. A fair bit of walking, but everything around this area is worth seeing. If you care to you can pay 1E and go up to the top of the Barcelona Arena for a view of the area. The Arena is the huge circular orange building. You cannot miss it as you exist the Metro."

The exhibits are logically organized by chronology, and contain many national treasures that are clearly identified in the visitor guide.Note that seniors (65+) are admitted free. There is a cafeteria/restaurant in the exhibition hall. It makes a nice stop to refresh, but beware, the prices are steep. The gift shop has a very nice selection of gifts.

It is Friday morning in Barcelona and Seamus has awaken me like he believes he is the bloody town crier. \u201cIt is 11:00 AM and you have slept 14 hours!!\u201d Sweet! Because I had been awake since 6:00 AM Wednesday morning Texas time. After spending some time making notes, writing and researching an adventure on Paco, the notepad, we dress and head to the Lobby to hail a cab. Many blocks later and after some hair raising traffic we are deposited on the east side of the Museu Nacional. I will admit that the scene that unfolded before me was a wee bit surreal. There were people lingering about, some walking, and some photographing the view. In the middle of this scene was a man on a chair playing a guitar. It looked like a scene from a 1962 postcard. I was enchanted. As we approached the front entrance there was another guitar player and people seated at tables and chairs drinking coffee. The whole place had the appearance of a sidewalk caf\u00e9 not a museum. Inside we bought a pass for all museums and made our way to the inside caf\u00e9 for a pastry and coffee. The sight that awaited us was beautiful, an arena with peach painted ceiling and friezes with targes adorned with heraldic symbols of every district of Spain in gorgeous color. An enormous pipe organ protected by two angles was the highlight of the room. We grabbed pastries, coffee and seats in the arena and enjoyed a leisurely snack before our excursion into the depths of the museum.We started with Renaissance art and traveled as if by magic into Baroque art which opened into a maze of Gothic art and statuary. Hours flew by in what felt like moments. Through vaguely remembered tales and stories we were introduced again to St.John the Baptist, St. Catherine and her wheel, St. Steven who it seems is always painted with rocks on his bloodied head, St. Lucy with her tray of eyes, and St. Barbara.We have just entered the medieval room when they announce that museum will be closing in 15 minutes. Seamus then recalls that he had been busted and his backpack was confiscated as though he was a common rapscallion (terrorist). They are probably tracking our every move now. We snag back the pack and make our escape to the lemonade stand for a refreshing drink and rest on a park bench as we watch the sun set."

Check your backpacks and any large bags as they will be in your way. (Besides, you don't have a choice.) We stayed just wandering with one stop for a snack, until 3 pm closing. No way to see it all.

But the museum itself has too many repeated pieces, which makes the museum not that great, I would say. If you want to visit it, make sure it is on the first sunday of the month, as the entrance is free."

There is a cafe in a beautiful musical concert hall and good toilet facilities. Don't forget to visit the vaulted underground exhibitions. The most stunning waterfalls, fountains of light and music and the sparkling view at night, is also well worth waiting for at sundown. You can access in wheelchairs but a taxi or bus is recommended to the Gallery otherwise three elevators or steep steps are the other option. There are also some steps in-side the museum to negotiate."

Yet, I'd recommend another path to you that I myself prefer: Take the green-line subway from Las Ramblas (from Liceu or Paral-lel) or simply reach the funicular station to the Parc de Montjuic. When you get off the funicular, turn left (the opposite direction of the cable car station for the castle up ahead). You are on the Miramar Avenue. Walk until you pass the Fundacio Mir\u00f2 and arrive at the intersection. Turn right or simply follow the signs for \"MNAC\". There, you will be walking downwards on the Passeig de Santa Madrona. The path is so nice and quiet. When you finish this Passeig, you'll see MNAC on your lefthand side. The city lies ahead and you'll have one of the most beautiful panoramas with a sight reaching Tibidabo!"

The renaissance gallery seems to go on forever with endless Madonna and child versions... by the time I was through there I felt as if I'd been walking the Louvre without as many staircases to climb. The medieval section on the other hand was fascinating with recreations taken from 12 century Catalan churches... of course, you might not be equally fascinated.I spent near 3 hours overall here. Tickets are good for 2 days if you have time to come back. You have a fine view over the city from the steps in front of the museum. And a chance to grab a snack (soft drinks, coffee, sandwiches) from a stand at the entrance... you might even be able to snare a chair at a table to eat if you wish. Prices are what you'd expect... beyond normal but its about a monopoly situation.From here you can walk to numerous other visit spots.

It's predominantly a place for Gothic, Romanesque and other related Medieval genres with a heavy emphasis on Catholicism and the themes of the Crusades. While the work is amazing to see up close - especially if you love death and gore on gold leaf - much of the collection goes on forever with no deviation. I was sorely disappointed in the measly Baroque and Romanticism collections. Baroque is my favorite of the old styles and it just isn't abundant here. The entire modern art collection was CLOSED FOR THE DAY so I tragically cannot comment on anything there.The greatest feature of this museum is sadly not its art collection, but its location and tranquil grounds. Out front a sweeping view of the city can be reached by climbing some epic hill-sloping staircases, or using some escalators and a few ramps. Once at the top there is a huge fountain and lovely terrace serving a modest range of wine, spirits and casual eats. A Flamenco guitarist was there playing for tips, excellently I might ad. It was an unexpected treat for the day to sit with Mojitos and enjoy a sun soaked panorama of Barcelona all the way to the hills."

Although not unfamiliar with the art of those times, I never experienced such awe and sheer perplexion, not only of the incredible high quality of the pieces shown but of how strongly they present a mental and pictorial world that is so so different from ours. It is a common thing to compare contemporary graphic art to the way of representation in medieval art. It helps just a little. I still felt like visiting another planet.The presentation in the museum is superb: the collection is superrich but it is placed so spacy and so well curated that you never get exhausted by the length of the exhibition path. And how they dealt with the apses in fresco, extending into the exhibition-space, that is so original and refreshing.

They've managed to recreate chapels and churches of Romanesque, Gothic ad Byzantine eras and bring the original frescoes onto the walls in an amazing way. Worth a long visit indeed - make sure you allow plenty of time for this excellent collection of paintings and artifacts. We were sorry the modern collection was closed for renovation but we'll definitely go back next year to the that as well."

I prefer this museum and the neighborhood area more than all the Gaudi's places. As you get out from the station Pl. Espanya, you see the Arena of Barcelona (the inside is now a commercial center), which is also very nice. Then you have to walk about 600-700m to get to the museum which is on the top of the hill, looking down on n the city. The walk to the museum itself is also enjoyable.Inside, they have rather nice collections. The biggest one of them is the antique mural painting collection. After the visit, if it's on the weekend, you can wait till the water show at the Magic Fountain downhill. All these things worth a whole weekend afternoon."

The building itself is beautiful to see. Once inside the museum is well organized and as you enter each section you are guided through the exhibit in a logical manner. Its most famous exhibits are the romanesque collection in which many frescos have been removed from their churches and preserved to avoid them being stolen. The museum has done a fabulous job of recreating the architectural structure of the churches from which the art was taken so that they can be displayed as originally intended. The explanations on the wall do a good job describing the art. There are also a few interactive displays to add more to the visitors experience. We also viewed the modern area of the museum, which is currently a temporary exhibit while the permanent facility undergoes renovation. Though this was a limited display the museum has included some significant pieces from modern artists such as Gaudi (furniture), Dali and Picasso. Overall this museum is well worth a visit. There is a restaurant inside and a little cafe outside selling sandwiches, quiches, ice cream etc..."

The only time I have been more bored in my entire life is when I was forced to count bricks at school ( 2344 ), while I appreciate the time and passion that goes into the painting I failed to appreciate the skill or the feelings the artist was trying to convey. I found most of the patrons observing the art to have a mean age of 406 and the attitude towards the interest of a younger audience is the same as one might expect of a person who has awoken to discover his legs have been eaten off by platypus'. The staff are kind and courteous as one would be to someone who you believe has a mental disability but lacks the curtesy to treat them like a human being. You can't take a backpack into the museum and not can you take a bottle of water as it may be seen as something more interesting than the art. The work by Gaudi is brilliant and the Mural on the ceiling is breathtaking. Go an a Saturday afternoon or on the first Sunday of the month, it's free!"

Some parts of the museum were closed when we were there but thoroughly enjoyed the Roman and Gothic exhibits. Well laid out so we were able to wander through without doubling back etc - just had a natural flow.It was possible to get really close to the works for a close up view most of the time which I appreciated. Sometimes it's nice to see the brushstrokes or the canvas underneath. The wall-mounted info labels for the various art pieces weren't written in English so we were sometimes at a loss as to what we were looking at but it was often self explanatory or we could guess with our knowledge of Spanish (not sure how accurate our guessing was!). Many of the paintings depicted terrible and pretty graphic suffering which was interesting and engrossing in an odd way. There were also some nice painted wooden alters, decorated with metal - not something I've seen much of before.There's a caf\u00e9 inside the middle of the museum but we chose to have a coffee outside with the view. The shop sold postcards (and a huge range of other items) - 10 for \u20ac2 which was a bit of a bargain!It would be an uphill walk, but not far to the Joan Mir\u00f3 Foundation from here but wouldn't suggest the two in one day necessarily - both quite engaging and deserve full attention! (except if some of the exhibits are still closed when you visit)."

There are many good reasons to visit MNAC, put simply it is a spectacular national gallery that opened my knowledge of the art and culture of the region. Some of the good reasons to visit are:1. The stunning view of the MNAC as you arrive from the vantage point of the musical fountain.2. The bird's eye vista of the city when you reach the MNAC.3. The intimate internal architecture as you walk in and throughout the gallery.4. \u20ac12 for an adult was valid for two days and other galleries. 5 There was no long queue to get in compared to other sites.6. The exhibitions were splendid and I learned so much about art of the region.7. There were accessible toilets for people who use wheelchairs. And toilets in each wing.8. The cafeteria was excellent and affordable, or a gorgeous restaurant upstairs.9. The dome was beautiful. 10. The gallery shop was one of the best shops.11. Public transport close by.12.

The free hours started promptly at 3pm and while I was impressed by the excellent collection of Romanesque, Renaissance and Baroque art, I was incredibly disappointed that the sections featuring the modern masters like Picasso and Mir\u00f3 were closed during the free hours. I would have paid for the full ticket if I had known in advance or did some research instead of becoming entranced by the magnificent view. In any case, seeing the El Greco they had was worth the arduous trek up the steep Montju\u00efc via the tastefully concealed escalators leading up the hill from Pla\u00e7a de Espanya to the museum.

            "review": "The setting and view are the best features --- and some practical advice. This would rank about 10th on my list of places to visit in Barcelona. To be honest, I'm not a fan of 900-1800 century art. The temporary small exhibition of their contemporary collection (due to remodeling) is very well done and instructive -- mostly less famous artists (less self-promoting?) than the single works of Dali, Picasso and Miro on display. This collection takes about an hour or less. The other collections will take much longer. (For more Miro, visit the excellent Miro Museum in the park.)As other reviews note, admission is free after 3 pm Saturdays and senior admission is free all the time. I was there on a Saturday afternoon (lunch time) and there was no crowd, although it likely gets busier later.The setting is spectacular with views of the park on the backside and an almost panoramic view of Barcelona on the front. The \"roof\" restaurant is actually only part way to the roof and there are two routes the very top. One is an elevator in the front left side (when you enter) which goes partway up and then two or three stories of stairs. The other elevator, for reasons unknown, is not marked with signs but goes all the way to the top. But to get to it, go through the main hall to the concert hall (with the organ) and head slightly to the right across to the other side where there is a small information table and ask to use the elevator. (The two obvious elevators when you enter the concert hall only go to the restaurant level.) This hidden elevator takes you to the backside of the palace with views of the park. There is new, excellent flooring to stroll around the east end of the roof and eventually to the very front (with a few short stairs involved). If you have limited mobilty, it is a toss-up whether the front or rear elevator is better, since the latter has fewer stairs but more distance to cover.Getting to the Palace can be confusing. Their website only gives general information, such as bus numbers, without any specific map of the route needed to reach the entrance and how much walking is involved. I sent an email asking about the route with least walking and stairs but never got an answer. It turns out there is a parking lot on the right side (facing) where a taxi can drop you off and where the hop on-off Touristic bus stops (but the tickets for that bus are expensive). The route I took involved several escalators starting from the Plaza Espanya -- up escalators on the extreme right of the Magic Fountain and down escalators on the left. First, walk from Plaza toward the palace about 2 city blocks then an escalator to the bridge over a street and a few steps down to a large plaza with trees and small cafes next to the fountain, a pleasant shady place to people watch. Then take another escalator up to the waterfall. At that point, both up and down escalators are now a short block down the sandy road to the right and those take you up to the right side of the palace. You'll see the parking lot and another snack bar. Then walk to the left on the ramp back to the center entrance. If you arrive from the park (back) side by bus or taxi then there appears to be a bit of a walk mostly downhill but no clue on the museum's website about the exact route. The Magic Fountain and other water features really make the whole atmosphere of the Palace special. I highly recommend seeing the Fountian light show (see my review)."

The staff are welcoming, the layout is simple to navigate and they don\u2019t even make you exit through the gift shop, an unusual treat. I still did visit the gift shop! The Oval Hall at the back of the building is huge theatre which hides a little caf\u00e9 where you microwave your own food if you want it heated. My favourite exhibition was a temporary one called Joan Colom Photographs 1957-2010. This collection spans decades of photos taken by Colom and his colleagues chronicling the journey from gritty street photography into photojournalism. It ran until May 25, 2014 and if extended is a must for anyone interested in photography. Even if you are not interested in the exhibitions the site of the MNAC is well worth a visit for its architecture and views alone."

Once at the top there are stone seats for a rest and a little refreshment area . If you then walk behind and up some more escalators you will be on top road and just a short distance from the 1992 Olympic stadium .I don't know if it is worth making a trip to see stadium otherwise but if you are at MNAC you might as well and then if you go past the stadium ie left from MNAC you will soon get to the cable car up to Montjuic castle , then later down funicular to Parallel subway ..... 2 stops and back in Ramblas ...All done in about 2 1/2 hours ."

This museum is so well-curated and brings together so many interesting pieces that I'd highly recommend it even for someone who has no special interest in art. Many of galleries are built to resemble the original churches from which the art on display was brought in. The staff is happy to answer questions (in Spanish or English). The size of the collection is rich but manageable. And the art itself is absolutely gorgeous. The modern collection is currently closed, BUT they just started displaying highlights from that collection in a temporary exhibition, so you won't miss out."

Unfortunately, much of the museum was closed for renovations during my visit, but I was more than satisfied by the Gothic and Romanesque collections. They were the best collection of those time periods that I have ever seen. The state of paint preservation on many of the wooden medieval sculpture was absolutely unequaled. The altarpieces were also HUGE and not split into sections by collectors over the years\u2014as you find in other museums. Like I previously stated, much of the museum was closed but I still managed to become tired, so I took a little rest on the numerous and amazingly cushy chairs that line the central area which links the museum wings. Overall, the atmosphere in this museum is wonderful\u2014welcoming, comfortable, and the art is perfectly curated in spacious gallery rooms, allowing the pieces to connect with guests. I highly recommend! Just one caution: the self-serve cafeteria is downright awful! Unless you want a coffee, I would skip it and its food."

Everything is lit up, it is quiet and you can breathe Barcelona air with a smile on your face. Make sure to walk to the museum, walk up the steps to the very top and sit up there, enjoying the breathtaking views, listening to an old man play spanish guitar, see the pigeons surround every sculpture in the vicinity.

It can be reached conveniently by several modes of public transportation, including the Bus Turistic. The museum could take days to see properly, since it encompasses most of the art history of Catalunya. If you have time to visit only one section, the Romanesque art display is spectacular. It contains many of the actual mosaics removed from remote Romanesque churches in more rural parts of Catalunya, including S. Climent de Taull. The colorful art gives the lie to the phrase, Dark Ages! Barcelona is full of things to love. Besides, there is the spectacular Museu Maritim in the old Drassanes where ships were built for the navy of the kings of Aragon. There is the art and architecture of the Modernists, Domenech i Montaner, Gaudi, and others. There are the wonderful Gothic buildings of the Barri Gotic. And there are the people. The staff at the Hotel Colors in the Horta district were especially kind and helpful to me. I recommend them for a pleasant stay in a modern hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the city."

The display of Romanesque art is amazing. We had been to the Vale de Boi and seen all the signs that we were looking at replicas of paintings and statuary and that the originals had been moved to the MNAC in Barcelona, so it was great to catch up with the originals. But it was just as amazing to learn of the process by which they literally strip the paintings off the walls and move them. The paintings from the churches were displayed as much as possible similarly to the way in which they were originally mounted. The paintings from the churches were wonderful, and of course, some were better preserved than others. I was pretty surprised by some of the altars and paintings on wood. They were so brilliant and the colors so vibrant that I thought they had been restored only to find that they had not. If you are into Romanesque history and art, this museum could easily take more than a day. We went through the Romanesque with such interest that we were pretty worn down for the Gothic and Renaissance. We hope to do the later years more justice on another visit. The only complaint is that much of the signage was only in Catalan and Spanish, I wish more had been translated to English.This is a 3 hour visit per day attraction-not because you can see it all, but because there is just so much you can absorb at once. But it would take several days to see at my pace. Somebody who was not as enthralled as I could probably do a quick once over in a day. The 12 euro fee was not insubstantial, but the visit was worth it."

What an imposing building and surround walking from the Metro, even on a cloudy cool day, fountains blooming, gardens glorious, take the sturdy stairs or escalators, the view out over the City to the hills is priceless.Speaking of priceless, we had discount vouchers from the Barcelona Tourist Bus at the ready, but our entry was free as Seniors, unsure if this is the case everyday, anyway it was a bonus. Even though two galleries are being renovated there was sufficient to see and enjoy, we spent 3-4 hours of enthralled enjoyment"

Its lovely to walk up to the museum from Espanya metro station as you get the full view of the whole building and the magic fountain. There are escalators so you dont have to walk up all of the many steps and once you get to the top the view over Barcelona is gorgeous. The entrance to the museum itself is \u20ac12 which i think would be worth the price normally but when i visited i was disappointed to find that a large portion of it was closed to the public. So i would recommend checking online before you visit to avoid disappointment."

This is not your usual looking at pictures hanging on walls or objects in glass cases. Inside a grand space they have reconstructed several chapel interiors from the twelvth century exactly as they found them in the Pyrnees mountains. Their isolated location saved them from destruction and walking thru them is like a trip back 800 years. We live a few blocks from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC and almost chose not to enter the museum, feeling we have much of this at home. We entered because it was included on our Articket bought to avoid the lines at Picasso and found it to be an excellent museum, and were blown away by this unique exhibit of Romanesque church frescos.

The Gothic art from the end of the 13th through the 15th centuries presented pieces from Catalonia. It also had artists such as Jaume Cascalls, Pere Sanglada, and Jaume Huguet. The last area we visited was the Renaissance and Baroque art, produced in the 16-18th centuries. See famous artists as Titian, Tintoretto and El Greco and Diego Velazquez.

It\u00b4s better to go in the late afternoon to catch the sunset, and Magic Fountain show at the bottom. I went on a Saturday afternoon, when it\u00b4s free after 3 PM."

The photos I posted along with this review show that you can see much of Barcelona sprawled out before you, including Magic Fountain, Placa d'Espanya, La Sagrada Familia, and more. You don't even have to take the stairs to get there, there are escalators! The view alone keeps even locals coming. Around sunset there were people crammed onto the stairs in anticipation of Magic Fountain, lending itself to creating an energetic atmosphere. What more could you want?With that being said, let's get to the museum itself. The grounds are well-manicured and pleasant to stroll through. There are a couple cafes on the way up and one at the entrance of the museum, but I'd say steer clear; they're pretty pricy! We aren't art buffs by any stretch of the imagination, but can still appreciate good art. MNAC certainly has this. We caught it on an evening when entrance was free (a quick Google search shows: \"Free entrance:Saturdays from 3 pm; 1st Sunday of each month,May 18th, International Museum Day\") and did a quick 1-1.5 hours walkthrough of the museum. While I wouldn't say I loved every piece, there were a few that were interesting enough to be worth seeing.________________Bottom Line:Great view of the city, which alone makes the trek worthwhile, plus it's FREE! If the museum is free, I'd say it's certainly worth a quick runthrough if you can spare the time. If it isn't free, it's still only 12 Euro for two-day entrance at most (families, students, seniors, adult groups all get discounts); you art fans will likely appreciate the two days. Whether or not the visit is worth it is up to your taste and time you have at your disposal."

Even if you are not big on spending time in museums, make the time to see the building and ascend to the entrance to see the view of the city from the hill and to enjoy the Magic Fountain. If if you are short on time BCN, you may consider skipping the entry into the museum itself (unless there is something specific that you would like to see), although I found their collection of Romanesque churches of the Pyrenees quite impressive. Although I did not do it, reading the reviews makes me wish that I would have spent some time outdoors to enjoy the view, then scheduled to dine at the restaurant and see the performance of the Magic Fountain from there... oh well, there will be a next time for sure!"

You can walk from placa d'espanya there are escalators and steps.We paid about 15 euros for 2 of us as we had a coupon from the bus company. Don't be embarrassed to use the coupons they expect you to do so. Make sure you visit the main auditorium and admire the organ and the decor.

The art is almost entirely Christian sculptures and art from cathedrals. While beautiful, it all begins to look alike. If you love architecture, be sure to visit the roof! You can get up close to the incredible domes and arched windows. Walk the cat-walk high above the courtyard and enjoy the view of Barcelona. If you go near sunset, snap breathtaking photos of the Olympic spire with the sunset behind it. Also, the moon rising over the domed roofs and the fading sun reflecting on the carved spires make fabulous photos."

The building is massive and beautifully situated overlooking the city of Barcelona. Rick Steve's stated that \"this museum has world class and rare collections of Romanesque art mostly from Catalan villages in the Pyrenees. There was a coin collection that was impressive due to the fact that over 300 of these 16th century coins were found in a jar in an abbey. They truly were in mint condition. There were quite a few paintings by artists I was not familiar with. There were several El Grecos, two Ruebens, a Sisley. Another section had some furniture that was originally in the Casa Battlo. I usually enjoy museums but for me this was not a museum of interest. Research the collection online before you go so you can decide for yourself."

Its a grandiose building, royal, scrumptious, overwhelming with rushing water fountains, high above the city. It was built for the 1929 International Exhibition and then became the most important museum in the city. Walking there from the subway entrance is a wonderful trip in itself! But once inside; again amazing! It houses the greatest display of Romanesque items in the world, with the 12th century frescoes saved from many churches being the highlight. They have done an amazing job of recreating the vaulted ceiling and apses and decorated them with the lovely frescoes. There is also Gothic from Catalonia and all of Spain, modern art and great Spanish artistes, such as Velazquez and E Greco. I was there on the first Saturday of the month and admission was free. I paid for the audio guide (3.50 euro) and it was well worth it! Excellent descriptions and the correct length. There is some English information in each room, but nothing about the specific art so I would highly recommend the audio guide.I've been to Barcelona several times but never thought reaching the MNAC would be easy, but it was. Most cruise ship shuttles drop you off at either end of the Las Rambles; at the top is the direct metro Line L (red) and the ticket instructions and machines are all very easy to understand and use. Just make sure you start off on Line L going in the correct direction and its only about 5 stops. Subway cars clearly indicate upcoming stops, so its very easy. It takes about 15 minutes to get there and as you come out of the subway station, you will see the massive building. Expect to spend at least 2 hours there. Lovely gift shop, indoor and outdoor caf\u00e9, clean bathrooms. What else could you want? Highly recommended!"

The admission price was included in our package deal, so I don't actually know how much it cost to get in, but in my humble opinion, this place was worth it and then some. It's divided up into multiple sections, such as the Gothic and Medieval section and even includes Renaissance and Modern Art. We explored the Gothic and Medieval side during our brief tour and I was super impressed with the sculptures and frescoes that they had on display.Also - don't miss the views of Barcelona from the top of the hill near the museum. It's beyond breath-taking. In addition, the \"grand room\" is literally HUGE and the gift shop was pretty intricate and interesting...It's pretty amazing that they allowed non-flash photography, as well. I would have thought for sure it wouldn't be allowed, but I was wrong! If I'm ever back in Barcelona, this will be one of the first places that I'll have to re-visit."

There are 2 floors, and 5 huges \"rooms\" (Roman // Gothic // Renaissance & Baroque // Modern & Contemporary + Drawings Prints & Posters // Numismatics). And also a temporary photography exposition on the second floor. You receive a handy folder with an overview of the Museum's masterpieces per collection. That would theoretically allow you to do a \"quick visit\" of all the highlights. I only got to see the first floor (Roman / Gothic / Renaissance & Baroque) as I like to take my time to enjoy art. From what I saw, my definite preference went out to the Gothic room. But then again, I did not get to see second floor, which probably housed many gems too.Two small disappointments : - the in-house cafeteria closed at 4:00 pm while the museum was open until 6:00 pm . There was another cafetaria outside, but it was quite cold and windy and not ideal to sit on the terrace.- I planned to combine the MNAC with the Font Magica (absolutely worth the wait!!!) A little inconvenient that the museum closed at 6:00 and the Font Magica only started at 7:00. All visitors from the MNAC waited outside the museum, because the Font Magica is located at the bottom of a set of stairs at the foot of the MNAC. As it wasn't the warmest November night however, the waiting was a bit chilly. Fortunately we were warmed up and entertained by a jazzy band of wonderful street musicians, who played while we waited for the fountain show to start. I would definitely recommend both the MNAC and the Font Magica. (even if I had other expectations from the music that accompanied the fountain show). The Font Magica is like fireworks, except that it's in water. It kept me glued to the spot for well over an hour."

The many unknown artists who did these works merit our thanks, as does the museum for saving them. The museum continues with a super collection of other religious art presented in a way which is very relaxing. Going for either by themselves is worth it. We spent perhaps two hours there and did not even see half the museum. We will return.As senior citizens, there was no fee to enter other than the purchase of the audioguides. Ask. It was not an expensive museum to visit.The building itself is located above the city and has a series of fountains that you pass by on the way up if you come by metro and wish to walk up. There are outside escalators available. You can take a cab which delivers you much closer. For the mobility impaired, there is a lot of waling with some stairs and they do have wheelchair lifts.The view from the museum of the city is about as good as it gets.

Standing at the opening steps of MNAC and you look down over the city and get a great panorama of Barcelona.Enter and you are assaulted by the grandure of the museum and the effort and attention given to presenting it's exhibits.I will admit that I was slightly overwhelmed by the number of frescos and underwhelmed by the slight shortage of seating when inside each viewing area. That being said, 5 hours and I think I only scratched the surface of the exhibits.If you are serious this museum will reward your time - it's worth planning a very full morning, afternoon or day and taking a good time-out on the front terrace for refreshment.Just two stops down on most tour buses is the Miro centre if you want to blow the whole day on art :)"

This museum is filled with treasures you will probably never see anywhere else but in Barcelona. For \"mayores\" (seniors) there is no charge! When entering we received a very helpful brochure that listed all of the museums masterpieces and was color-coded according to the section where they were located. My wife and I spent a few hours in two of the museums six sections \u2013 Romanesque Art and Modern and Contemporary Art. The collection of mural paintings taken from Roman churches in the Pyrenees is unique in the world. There are also many colorful altarpieces from the 11-13th centuries. In the modern section we came across Catalan artists that we were unfamiliar with, but whose artworks were interesting and beautiful. Maria Fortuny was a favorite. The art is housed in the National Palace, a large, striking building on Montjuic. As others have commented, the arrangement is intuitive; it is easy to find your way around. MNAC was definitely worth a visit for its unique focus on Catalonian art."

Located at the top of a hill, it is worth the climb up - about 150 steps to the entry after taking two escalators but the great art inside is worth every step. The exterior is also breath taking - looking very much like a castle and adorned with neo-classical statutes. In addition, there are three waterfalls running from the top down. There is also an unobstructed view of the Plaza de Espanya and the twin Venician Towers. While the outside is older, the inside is as modern as any museum in the world. The collection of Medieval-Gothic art is absolutely first class. Don't miss this if you visit Barcelona. Lastly,unlike the Prado in Madrid, this museum does allow photos and video - No Flash, please. There is a modest entry fee but worth every penny. Free on Sundays."

This museum says it covers 1000 years of Catalonian art, but that did not prepare me for how amazing was its 1000 year-old material and its presentation.It has an amazing collection of Romanesque art saved from about 10 churches in nearby mountain valleys, removed from the walls and transferred to the museum where they are displayed as if in situ. It's like visiting all these churches in about 2 hours. Some of that work, is very beautiful. Some is in fantastic condition to, with really bright colours. And some is very modern in form.There are also numerous paintings by local artists from the 18th century onwards (which we barely had time for) and a whole section of Italian Renaissance works (Spain controlled the area around Naples then) which we did not see at all.Final word - if you're going and you like to learn about what you're seeing, this is a very well laid out gallery with good audioguide. At our pace, needs a whole day and is worth it.It is in a magnificent building with a wonderful restaurant with splendid views (you must book to get a look in there! though there is a modest cafe on another floor).Surprisingly, in this museum you could take photos and I happily took advantage of that."

It closes early on Sundays (3 pm), but during the week it is open until 6 (between October and May). Admission prices (\u20ac12), opening times and all other relevant information can be found on their website under \"visit us\" (http://www.mnac.cat/index.jsp?lan=003).Even if you won't have time to see it from inside, it is worth visiting the outside and the garden on the back anyway. The building is magnificent and the view breathtaking (an almost panoramic view of Barcelona).Also, it is in front of the magic fountain, so if you come for an afternoon you already have a nice plan for the evening. There are some nice restaurants in the area and there's easy access to the metro."

The closest Metro is Placa Espanya, when you get up on street level just look for the 2 enormous columns which mark the start of the Avenue de la Reina that leads past the Magic Fountain ( so well worth a visit Thurs-Sunday 21.00 - 23.00 hrs!) up to the museum.This is a lovely museum with fabulous architecture and views from the roof terrace. There was a 10 euro entrance charge per person and its worth getting the audio guides as very little of the exhibit labels are translated into English.Be warned the food and drink at the front and in the museum is expensive for what you get. I personally would get off the metro, go to the Arena next door, go down to the basement and buy a fabulous baguette and pastry from one of the little units - there is a fabulous artisan bread caf\u00e9 down there!The museum has Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque artwork and artefacts, it also has the largest collection of Catal\u00e1n art in Spain.What is really impressive is the way the old frescos have literally been lifted off of the walls in older churches in the region and relocated here in purpose made arches and walls. Being used to the conservation ethos of the National Trust- this rather brutal process is a bit shocking but it does make for a very impressive exhibit!I was slightly disappointed that the museum is so heavily focused on religious works of art, I was expecting a wide range of artistic styles and subjects and there are a few - but by and large it\u2019s a museum of religious art.We spent a good 3 hours wandering around and taking pics. When we had finished at the museum we walked around the right hand side of the building and wended our way through to the cable car station that took us up to Muntjuic Castle - lovely way to spent the day!!!"

It is a short walk from the Espanya metro station. Just come out the station and look for the hillside covered by the Magic Fountain and the castle (aka the museum) on top. You get to see the Magic Fountain as you walk to the museum. This is an easy walk...there are escalators going all the way from the street to the museum. Actually the escalators continue onto the Fundacio Joan Miro. I would recommend planning your day to see the Fundacio Joan Miro first, and walk back toward the MNAC. Plan on having lunch in the MNAC. Restaurant which has the greatest view of the city of Barcelona. The MNAC provides free admission to seniors (65+). Trust two seniors: you can easily manage the Barcelona metro, the walk (with escalators to avoid climbing stairs or hillsides), free admission and a great view. My only regret is that we ate before the museum. It serves lunch 12 to 5-remember the late evening meals in Spain. Even the restaurant served just dog food, it would be worth a visit for just the view. "

The medieval art in particular is displayed in the way one would view it in the churches from which it came. It was beautiful.

I liked that they had a cloak room where I could put my bag since it was quite a big museum.The ticket allows you to come back for free up to a month after you buy the ticket. I found that very interesting specially because I went back a few days later to pick up a few prints of the paintings they have there.I was touched by the fact that the people of Catalunya fought to keep their mural paintings from the ancient churches in the country (after one was sold to a museum in Chicago). But I found it funny that while they state that catalunyan art must stay in Catalunya they had a few German sculptures on display there. Huh.I loved the modernist collection, too. There's a beautiful selection of art nouveau works (oh, the jewelry!), though I think the furniture would be best showcased in a room \"like it was back then\" rather than on white platforms against a white backdrop.There's free wi-fi, comfy couches here and there, many clean bathrooms scattered around, a few restaurants and a good gift shop (which you can access only with a ticket, however).

The building itself is quite spectacular, although its worth noting you can get in to that part for free if you're visiting one of the restaurants (of which there are three). The poshest of which was fully booked even on a wednesday lunchtime, so book in advance. Avoid the cheapest \"microwave your own food\" restaurant, which is overpriced, given that there's a medium $14 euro set menu next door."

I enjoyed Baroque and Modern the most. While buying the tickets, we took a special deal and bought the tickets for Pablo Espanyol as well. It has given us some saving. They also charge you to enter the upper balcony of the museum. Basicaly the same view actually. No need to spend more I think.

Walking between these columns you can see the Museu straight away, and you simply need to walk towards it! There are escalators to facilitate the hill up to the building, but you'll probably want to spend some time photographing the incredible building before going up them.Once you reach the building, you can see across the whole of Barcelona pretty much. When I visited it was quite busy here with tourists taking photos, but if you want a quieter spot for photos you can walk up a little higher/take the next escalator and enjoy the view from a number of beautiful free-entry gardens. At 10am on a Sunday morning I only came across one or two other people in these gardens!Also, as I visited on the first Sunday of the month I got into the Museu free of charge. I found this to be an added benefit on top of the great views, lovely surroundings, and of course great art inside. I particularly enjoyed the Civil War photography section in the Modern 2 exhibition, but the older sculptures and wall murals were really interesting too."

It is a large collection, so plan your time according to what interests you most. We were there for over two hours and did not see everything, but what we enjoyed the most by far were the fascinating 12th century frescoes from Catalan Pyrenean churches. The slide presentation on how the frescoes were stabilized, removed from the churches and relocated to the museum was extremely interesting and a great testimony to those who worked so painstakingly to ensure these national treasures can be enjoyed for years to come. There is also a very good Modern art collection as well. If the art collection isn't enough, the Palau Nacional where the museum is located is a wonderful structure. After your visit to the museum, stroll around the grounds and then walk down to the Placa d'Espana. The trip down is easy, and there are escalators if you want to go back up but don't want to challenge the stairs. The fountains and waterfalls on the way down, with the Palau as the backdrop, provide some of the best photo ops you'll experience in Barcelona, a city that's full of them. We combined this visit with a trip to the Joan Miro museum further up the mountain, as well as a visit to the 1992 Olympic site. It makes a great day. Take the metro to the funicular to get up the mountain and then and spend a leisurely day descending. There are plenty of other sights to see as well including beautiful parks. The metro lines at Placa d'Espana will get you back to your hotel in no time."

I am not a huge art lover, nor do I support spending vacation time in museums, but MNAC was well worth the time we spent there.You should see how they have removed art from the walls of the medieval churches and put them up in the museum so that the art doesn't get lost or be sold to others. They actually show an elaborate video of how they do that.And seriously some things that you will see there are beyond description.The view of 'Fountain of Magic' and of the city from MNAC is fantastic.My Suggestions:1. Carry water, though you can buy it from the caf\u00e9 inside, its difficult keep going to the caf\u00e9 again and again.2. Please take the audio guide, you will be able to understand the art there a lot more. Though there are printed materials on the walls, which you could read, but audio guide is more elaborate.3. Wear you walking shoes, the gallery is HUGE, so you'll have to walk a lot.4. The restaurant inside is good and moderately priced. You could stop there after you are tired of walking for hours.5. It will easily take 3-5, so plan your itinerary accordingly, if you plan to visit.6. We did not buy tickets to the terrace (posters claim that the Terrace offer a great view), because it would have costed us 5 Euros extra. We didn't think it was needed."

I'm not sure if I'd have felt differently had we paid. It's quite a trek up to the top via escalators and steps but the view is totally worth it.

If you're a couple I am struggling to think of anywhere more romantic than here; classy, beautiful and not stupidly expensive. Dining aside, the collection was \"traditional\". The frescos were mindblowing but for me monotonous. The building itself impressed me as much as the contents and I think they know this as many sofas are scattered for you to gaze at the magnificent ceiling. The \"modern art\" sections had mainly renaissance stuff; if you want to see a good dali you gotta go to Figueres...!"

This makes my fifth visit to BCN and on each of my previous visits I've neglected to take a look inside this magnificent building. The inside is as beautiful and as well maintained as the exterior, and the collection of Gothic art is outstanding. It made for a great contrast to our visit to the Joan Miro Foundation just down the hill from the Museum. If you have time, the National Museum is definitely worth a visit...the walk up from Plaza Espana is special...would love to see it at night when the fountains are on full display."

I first took time to visit this place on my thirs visit to Barcelona, there are so many things to see and enjoy in Barcelona but I am very happy that we came here and spent the day and do highly reccomend it!Came here with my family, kids are 6 and 10. We were lucky enough to se the Antonin Tapies exhibition and really loved it, it was a great inspiration for the kids!The building is a beautiful palace, lockers available, both a cafeteria and restaurant in side (fantastic view!) also a nice gift store not to mention the free wi-fi. The building stands above several stairs leading down to the Magic fountains and Plaza Espanya, I reccomend taking a seat st the top of the stairs after 7 pm and wait for the light show in the Magic fountains. We brought something to eat the and bought cava and slush from the vendor just outside the museum.Also just behind the museum you will find the Olympic Stadium."

From the stunning building to the amazing collection, this museum is a must-seen place.Located in the palau nacional, the MNAC has a vast and well preserved collection organised in different sections: Romanesque art, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque, Modern art and numismatics. As the collection is rich and large I will definitely recommend to spend more time in the Romanesque section which is amazingly beautiful and incredibly interesting. The frescoes removed from old churches in Catalonia are stunning!!! The colours are well preserved and all the works look so modern considering the time they have been made.I also recommend to see the Gothic and the modern art sections with beautiful paintings and furnitures from catalan artists.DON'T MISS IT!!!"

There is some beautiful work on display though not many famous works. A nice place to spend a few hours away from the crowds. Once I had made my way through the collection I had a sit down on one of the enormous armchairs in the middle of the upper floor where there was also free wifi.

I liked the exhibition of the extremely large painting of the battle between the Spanish and Moroccans by Fortuny, with all the history of the painting explained (and Dali made his homage to the painting). Art can be fun."

            "review": "Give yourself a couple days!. One of the great joys of visiting Barcelona is learning more about the Catalan culture and language. Cataluyna suffered under Franco, so it is no surprise the Catalans would retaliate by building this spired cathedral to its art. What a building! And then there is the art. Your ticket is good for two visits--but that is not readily apparent, or at least was not to me. I highly recommend you visit two times. On one of them, make sure you are at the terrace overlooking the magic fountains on Placa d' Espanya at sunset for a drink. If you stay long enough on thursdays-Saturdays (check that), you'll be treated to the magic fountain display. Situated on top of Montjuic, the museum gives you one of the best views over Barcelona. Take the funicular as part of your metro pass up and down the mountain. There's also a cable car that swings over the Med and lands you in Barcelonetta, but the price was too high, I thought, and time too precious to move at a snail's pace down the mountain. Back to the art: It is extensive and can leave you shell-shocked if you do too much. One thing we particularly loved is the museum's extensive collection of painting lifted off the walls of old churches in the region (churches with little life expectancy). We were also interested to learn about the relationship between the Catalan and French Impressionists and their style differences. I heartily recommend joining one of the tours or getting an audio guide, because the place will overwhelm you. We joined many others for a snooze under the central dome! pace yourself, get oriented, and learn. And...don't miss the cafe, situated inside of an arena within the museum. breathtaking view, great food."

What strikes you first is the walk up to the museum, for those not slightly interested in the last 1000 years of art, just the garden and the view of Barcelona is worth the trip there. The museum is very well laid out and opting for the information phone, a cost of 3.50 euro is worth it, otherwise you could find yourself wandering aimlessly along, particularly if you can't read Spanish, as not all is in English. For those with a passion or even a passing curiosity in art it is a great experience. All museums are free to the public on a Sunday, but you need to start early as they close at 3.30, which came as a shock, given Spain doesn't seem to get going until 3pm most days, not so in this instance, so set your alarm!"

Hopefully we can come again for more visits. One huge painting I can remember was a battle scene which was very detailed.The architecture of the museum left quite an impression on me. I loved the beautiful decorative ceilings and pillars. Within the museum is a concert hall, which reminded me of a round skating rink, with a giant organ located at one side. I can imagine beautiful music within this acoustic hall. (I hope it is acoustic.) Outside at the entrance, one gets a splendid view of the city. In short, I would say that the museum building is truly worthy of the art within it, or perhaps it is the other way around, the art collection is worthy of the museum building protecting it."

Let's be clear from the start - this gallery (or rather collection of galleries in one space) is not in the same league as the great national galleries if what you're looking for is a general collection of European Art - it has some gems, but if that's what you want then best aim for the Prado, the Louvre or Britain's National Gallery. But if you have an interest in art and particularly how a national sensibility can shape it then do not miss this place. It's collection of Catalan art - the clue is in the place's title! - is magnificent, wide ranging over the centuries, and we found it fascinating enough to take a whole day to do the visit justice.Just looking at the outside is impressive enough - built as a pavilion for an international exhibition it forms part of the complex on the city's dominating hill, Montjuic. Best approach via Placa D'espanya, when escalators (or steps if you're feeling energetic) will whisk you up past the flights of fountains to the front of the gallery and a magnificent view.Inside the place is divided historically: a \"modern\" section - up to 1920? - is Catalan dominated, but hence has interesting artists you won't have seen before; the Baroque and Gothic sections are obviously dominated by religious works but include some little-known gems; but for me the absolute 'do not miss this place' factor was the Romanesque galleries. Here work from early medieval churches - largely murals, though with a good collection of panels and 3D work - had been laboriously saved and removed from their original, decaying, sites to be displayed here - and wonderfully displayed they are. Mock church interiors have been built which display the works as they were in relation to viewers and each other, so arched paintings are displayed on arches and so on. The Museum is able to, and has, spared a huge amount of exhibition space to show off these works, its speciality - in wonderful settings. Even if you're not religious yourself it will give you some idea of what it must have felt like to be a worshipper in a medieval Catalan church - magnificent!And before you leave, make sure you have a coffee - or a beer - in the cafe in the great arena hall - spectacular!"

There is a lot of walking involved either way, but we enjoyed it. The views of the surrounding area is amazing! You can see La Sagrada Familia as well as Tibidabo on the top of the mountains in the distance. Sitting on the steps while resting and gazing at the city was enjoyable for our family.Both the outside and the inside of the museum building are impressive. There are 4 wings to this museum with different art periods from Gothic to Romanesque to Modern. The art inside is nice and extensive, but after a while it kind of all blended together. We only spent an hour and a half with children, but one could easily spend the entire day. Children 16 and under are free and the museum is closed on Mondays. Enjoy!"

On foot through massive columns in the square below, past many sites and up many steps sits this great museum that the kids also enjoyed.Get the audio guide, and if you only have a few hours, hit the \"highlights\". Get religion and art in a great setting. Bring a bag lunch and sit outside or behind the museum for some peace and quiet.Would highly recommend."

I was impressed by the art that the museum has, the way it is displayed, and most of all by the building which houses the museum, which is in and of itself a work of art that must be seen from the inside. I surpassed my personal 2 hour \"museum limit\" because I was enjoying the visit as much as I did. In addition to the snack bar on the first floor, there is a very good looking restaurant on the second floor which has a beautiful panorama of Barcelona. I cannot comment on the food as I did not partake.It might be noted that I introduced myself to the cashier as a senior (over 65 years of age. Some places request proof and passport or drivers license [with picture] are generally accepted), and so there was no entrance fee.If you have children under 11 years of age, please do not bring them to the museum"

Although it costs 10 Euros to enter at most times, it offers such a large range of art from across Southern Europe. The museum starts with paintings sourced from the walls of Catalonian churches and moves through religious icons to fairly modern artwork. The museum can easily take a few hours out of your day for those who move around Galleries quickly and can take even more time for those who prefer to absorb the atmosphere (or stand there looking closely at the paint strokes to see if the artist has hidden a message in there). I would certainly recommend visiting this gallery as part of trip to Montjuic but do bear in mind that this gallery will take at least a few hours to move round."

Just FYI, once one is up there in Montjuic (take the Metro), it's fun to wander around the park grounds (hilly!) and even grab coffee or a light lunch at the outdoor bar/cafe run by the Miramar, overlooking the city and the port.

We popped into the Gothic/Ren. section, and if this is your thing, you will love it. It's not mine, though I took some interesting pictures of saintly gore. We mistook the restaurant behind the cafe (not taking the elevators to the European 1st floor) for the main restaurant and ordered the 3 course meal. This was the worst meal we've had since landing in Barcelona almost a week ago. The basic street food we got while waiting to check in on day one was better! Avoid this food!

We sat outside and listened to a busker whilst enjoying a beer on a sunny day in Feb. Don't miss this place, it was absolutely gorgeous."

All art enthusiasts should come to this attraction as it houses a vast amount of collections ranging from Romantic, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Modern. Whilst we were there, there was also a temporary exhibit showcasing the findings of uncovering art layer by layer to find false/fake prints compared to the real deal. This was very interesting seeing how technology how evolved today. However as a temporary exhibition, there weren't always English translations to everything.A large building where you can easily spend half the day. It also houses a restaurant and two cafes (which houses good cake!).Unfortunately, I must also state that you must be very careful with your belongings. As we entered the building, a lady had been taking photos of the spectacular view. On returning to the bench where her partner was also taking photos, she discovered her handbag had been taken and was nowhere to be seen. On visiting Barcelona, we were strongly made aware about pickpocketing and petty theft in the city, but on witnessing a lady losing all her possessions made it so more real."

When we were there, the museum had free entry from 3pm-6pm on Saturdays, which was more than enough time to see the Romanesque art that is the heart of the collection. The exhibit show pieces of extraordinary beauty and interest. We've been to many museums throughout Europe, Asia and the USA and saw pieces here unlike any we've seen elsewhere. There is an enormous amount of other material from Catalan artists from various other movements too. The building itself if a showpiece! The only downside is that most of the printed explanations for works are only in Spanish/Catalan, but there are audioguides in English (and other languages) for a few Euros more. The gallery attendants were also happy to explain in English as much as they could (they were often able to explain fully, and even when they couldn't their English was certainly better than my Catalan or Spanish!)."

The palace was built in the twentieth century and the interior spaces have been carefully redesigned to hang a unique collection of art encompassing all periods in the evolution of Catalunya. There are some surprises such as Carmen Bestian by Maria Fortuny and Georgina, Duchess of Devonshire by Thomas Gainsborough. There are a selection of photographs of the Spanish Civil War, which are startling. I was most taken with the Modern Art 2 gallery, which has one of the most compelling collections that I have seen and there is not an unmade bed to be seen anywhere. I returned for a second day to revise and etch the collections into my memory and to enjoy the myriad of masterful interiors again."

There are fine views over Barcelona and the Palace itself, built for the 1929 World Exhibition, is stunning. Inside you find many, many unexpected gems even from periods you may not be particularly interested in. The vibrant colours (made from precious stones) of the 800-900 year old Gothic art are amazing: the Romanesque friezes carefully peeled off church walls are a technical tour-de-force: there is major artwork by artists like Velazquez and Titian as well as a Picasso that is better than most of the stuff in the Picasso Museum elsewhere in the city (he was a worryingly average artist most of the time!!). For us, and it is a question of what grabs you, the highlight was the breathtaking collection of 'modernista' (Art Nouveau to us) art and furniture - we have never, ever seen the like. You must go - and it's on the ArticketBCN, a 30 euro ticket that gives you access (without queuing!!) at 6 other museums, including the Picasso and the Miro, for less than half price. You've got to go !!!"

I headed here anyway on a rainy day and it was definitely worth the visit. While there are large sections of Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque art, there is also a large section of Modernist art where I spent all my time. There were so many gorgeous pieces, and even a couple funny ones that used to decorate a wine cellar. I would allow about 2-3 hours to tackle the modernist section at a casual pace. The audioguide wasn't too useful and is not really necessary here. There is definitely something for everyone, and it's a great place to head to on a rainy day.

It can be nice to go there, look at the surroundings, enjoy the view, have a coffee and relax. A lot of the artwork dates back to the 10th to the 13th century and therefore the figures are simple, in 2D and sometimes the proportions of the human body are off. I found that a recurrent theme was catholic religion and I feel that I saw similar, if not more interesting, artwork in the Cathedral of Barcelona (Bari Gothic) and the church of Santa Maria del Mar (south of the Cathedral). If your time is limited, I would skip this museum and go to those churches and neighbourhoods instead."

The whole area is berautiful; I think we found it from the back as we came from Montjuic and the Olympic Stadium and went down the stairs through Magic fountain as we were leaving.Great art inside too.However, I think I did not get to see half of everything because the exhibitions were in different rooms (granted) but somehow the building didn't flow well and you can easily find yourself going in circles. Also, I don't particularly like the way things have been displayed rather sparsely. Although you known there are a lot of things to see, the museum doesn't feel very full.The paintings are very beautiful, but to be honest I enjoyed the architecture of the building and the scenery of Barcelona from the museum much more"

Only reason I didn't give 5-stars was because I did get a little tired of all of the exhibits from the 1200-1400 era... even for me they began to get a tad monotonous.

MNAC has a very large collection of Romanesque and Gothic art as well as good examples of Renaissance and Baroque works by great masters.

Appreciating landscapes as well as people painted by artists of various talents, I enjoyed the interpretation of nature in the almost silvery-violet light before a storm, detailed countryside r\u00eaveries, hungry beggars contrasted before the Church of the Sacred Family's construction beginnings, rich nobles painted in detail by painters commissioned to please, and still life paintings of situations in people's encounters either on the roads or in town. Spanish religious belief lies deep in some paintings, whereas social responsibility is in others, the refinement of culture being present in most displays. Of course, if one wants to see gold spread out in large quantities, one must see Gothic Art where the priesthood set itself out in its most glorious attire to admiration of the humble peasants and nobles it looked to conquer and impress in its early stages of development. This did not appeal to me, quelling the artists' eyes to the feelings they could describe through their brushes' passing and colours much more deeply than this superficial coating.In the modern art section,one can also enjoy sculptures of the utmost detail, a man riding a horse leaving you breathless before this synergy of understanding between the two, a billowing bow-tie ribbon on the delicate neck of a child, its expression caught as if by a modern-day camera, just to mention the two that will remain in my memory life-long. This museum has no lifts so plan good walking shoes and one or two bottles of water, as well as a sandwich for lunch. A small shop enables one to buy a few painting postcards, still life magnets, just in case your grandmother likes both culture and has a bad memory she wants to arouse on her fridge door."

However, I would have liked more explanations of the actual pictures in English. What there is is in Catalan and Spanish, so not much use to most foreigners. The rest of the collection was not particularly special. At 10 EU we thought the entrance fee was a bit high.

Worth seeing!The whole olympic park takes from half to a whole day to see, depending on how much detail you want to see and how fast you can walk. TIP: for eating, go to the lower levels of the Arena shopping centre instead. Its 2 mins from the Espanya metro stop; about 10 to 15 min walk from MNAC. Large choice of food there. Looks great at night too."

The museum is located above the Magic Fountain which could be a difficult walk up. We had a Metro pass and rode bus 193 to the top and walked down the many stairs afterwards. Before entering the museum, we sat out front with a picnic lunch and drank in the vista spread below us. The museum is a treasure trove of church frescoes uniquely transferred from the upper reaches of Catalunyan and Basque regions. Don't miss the videos explaining the process! This exhibit area displays an expansive collection of work.We visited several more well done exhibit areas. We were allowed to take photos as long as we used no flash. I asked for permission from the staff before doing so. Don't miss the auditorium area, a lovely architectural delight!We did not see everything because we ran out of energy before the museum ran out of exhibits!"

The museum is reached from the Placa d' Espagna metro station and the height is aided with outdoor escalators! Perhaps the most impressive, is the manner in which barrel-vaults were constructed within the museum to display original frescoes removed from a church that was demolished in the Pyrennes of northern Spain. The museum is beautifully laid out. One can experience one time period in the history of art, at a time. There is a lovely outdoor cafe, and a restaurant with a balcony. How civilized is that?"

In order to avoid their theft or destruction, several institutions pooled resources to have the murals removed and reconstructed at MNAC, and apparently it's the largest collection of its kind in the world. Worth a visit just for that, but there is some great stuff in the other collections as well. Museum is on the Montjuic hilltop, so great views from the plaza and museum restaurant."

The colorfulness and vigor of the Gothic is an eye-opener if you think of Gothic as severe and restrained. The Romanesque collection is distinguished by recreations of chapel interiors and stunning carvings. Give it time to soak in: these are not collections for zooming in, seeing a few greatest hits, and zooming back out. If you want a few high-impact paintings, your needs will be better met by the small but excellent collection on loan from the Thyssen-Bornemisza. More modern stuff is upstairs.Works have labels but only about 1/4 have further written explanation, in Catalan and Spanish. The explanations are smart but leave you wanting more. This is one place where I might consider the audioguides.The two cafes, one inside at the back and one out front, are expensive and disappointing even by the standards of museum cafes.

This museum made some amazing conservation efforts to safe paintings on church walls dating back to the late Roman times 1100s, very impressive. Further more it has a vast collection with religious art (more than half of the museum space) of which most, but not all are from Spanish artists.For me the best part of the collection was the other half, a lot of Spanish artist, but only one Picasso, not his best painting.I liked the museum, it's collection and spent several hours there... Absolutely worth a visit."

It was built for the 1929 International Exhibition of Barcelona as the main pavilion. It has been the National Art Gallery of Catalonia since 1934.Originally, the collection mainly focused on Catalan art and artists. After years of expansion, it now has a wide diversity of collections from Romanesque to modern art. The museum now has many collections including the ones below: \u25ceRomanesque art collection \u25ceGothic art collection \u25ceRenaissance and Baroque art collection \u25ceModern Art collection \u25cePhotography collection \u25ceDepartment of Drawings and Prints \u25ceGabinet Numism\u00e0tic de Catalunya (Coinage)You can go there by riding subway L1 and L3 (Pl. Espanya) and walking about 1 mile. Due to the uphill incline and some steps, you need around 20 to 30 minutes to reach the museum. Once you are there, you can look down from the hill at the magnificent view of the city and the Magic Fountains of Montjuic. The architecture itself is a piece of art, and the sunset makes it even more attractive. You will need to allot many hours to enjoy the fine art inside the museum. The 17,200 sq-foot multifunction Oval Hall is a huge indoor space for social events. The daylight comes from the doom of the hall and makes it a very pleasant place to have all kinds of activities."

To discover the heart and soul of the Catalan people, you must go to MNAC to see the fabulous Romanesque art that's been gathered from all over Catalunya to protect and preserve it. The installation is superb and the art itself glows with gilt and rich color. The works seem so contemporary yet they date from hundreds and hundreds of year ago. A must see collection."

They built naves and windows and arches replicating the original structures and placed the frescos as they were done originally. The colors were so vivid it is difficult to imagine how they could be this well preserved. We tend to associate Barcelona with Gaudi, Picasso and Dali but the early eras have incredible stories to share with the visitor.

Much of what you see is church wall paintings painstaking removed from their original locations in order to better conserve and study them - they are wonderfully displayed in reproductions of their original settings.The 'Modern' collection seems to start in the 16th Century! However we persisted and were surprised at the number of (unknown to me, but then I am a scientist not an art historian) Catalan players in the late 19th/early 20th Century movements (Impressionism, Cubism, Pointillisme, etc.).The whole place is devoted to Catalan art and was a treat. As were the views over the city from the terrace - next time we will get there for lunch in one of the most spectacularly situated restaurants in the city.BTW, we went on the Articket (a great saving if you are going to visit a few of Barcelona's classic sites)."

The ticket cost is 8.50 euros but good for two days. I took advantage of both days. The primary focus here are on the 12th century frescos. Although they are mostly two dimensional and often (at least to me) the figures look almost identical, I try to place myself as a villager staring at these religious piece of art that were meant to be used as instructional. Some people have compared this museum to the Cloisters in New York. But that is a very long stretch. Make sure you walk into the massive central hall with its pipe organ. You can take non-flash photos of anything in the museum. To exit, I walked down a combination of escalators and many many many steps to the Placa d Espanya where there is a metro.

The building itself is also worth exploring, and it's location on top of the Montjuic offers some great views of Barcelona. Your ticket is valid for TWO visits within one month. I went on November 11th, so I have untill December 11th to visit a second time. Keep in mind that there are no backpacks allowed in the museum. Audioguides were \u20ac1 extra, I didn't bother to get one. The only thing is was missing throughout the museum were benches! I love to sit for a while, to study a painting in more detail."

First there is Romanesque art with the largest collection in Europe. Many of the murals are not perfect, with many pieces missing, but of course they were painted hundreds of years ago and suffered much destruction with time. Still they are fascinating.Then there is the medieval art of the Gothic age. There are beautiful sculptures from that time and many retables with colorful figures. All of the art in this museum has been restored to the best level possible and the Gothic collection is really superb.Then we can see the great masters of the Renaissance and Baroque ages. I love the El Greco paintings, the serious ones of Zurbaran, and the wonderful ones of Velazquez. Each had his own style, but they all painted in Spain and each left his own mark in the art history.The Modernist collection interests me more now because I am getting acquainted with it only now. There are pieces of furniture, paintings, stained glass and sculpture that is world class. There is plenty of Guaid furniture. Gaudi really amazes me because he was an artistic genius, highly original. I enjoy the bookstore because I have found wonderful art books there, more than in most museums. This museum is really one I admire and enjoy."

And the collection is absolutely HUGE.The Romanesque section is also not to be missed, with an amazing display of frescoes removed from a Catalan church dating to the 11th Century. The frescoes aren't perfectly intact, as you might expect, but they are numerous, beautiful and enlightening.There is also a very good collection of works from Baroque to Modern periods, including some very interesting Modernista stuff (including Gaud\u00ed) that you're unlikely to see elsewhere.On top of that, you can enjoy the view of Pla\u00e7a Espanya and Tibidabo after your visit with a nice glass of wine or beer on the terrace at the front.Admission is covered with your Articket card.

The loos are hidden away at one side of the main hall downstairs, there is a small shop but no overt attempts at marketing. The restaurant looked very civilised and too expensive for a quick sandwich but you can buy drinks outside on the terrace in front of the building. Watch the prices!

The Romanesque which is actual displays of art work that was painted on the walls of old churches throughout the countryside that were being torn down and a lot of the art that could be salvaged is on display here. Then there was the Modern art section which we decided not to see as it was getting late and we wanted to see the Renaissance section. After a light snack in the snack shop we set off for the Renaissance section only to find out that it was closed. This was not mentioned when we purchased our tickets 2 hours earlier and there was no discount given because this whole section was closed.

The Romanic and Medieval sections double as historic museums, with mostly religious paintings from church interiors.Moving on to the more \"modern\" sections, the art work became more and more varied.Yes, Picasso and Gaudi replicas are featured.One can go in the afternoon to get away from the heat outside, then hang around for the magic fountain show!"

The museum itself is located atop Montjuic, a hill overlooking the city centre and this allows for fine views.The selection of medieval frescoes and carvings from the Pyrenees and Catalonia is impressive. Also, check out the Modern Art section with Ramon Casas' tandem bicyle painting. A nice museum; spacious and modern."

Just go up the escalators or climb the stairs to the top and admire the view of the city below. The fountain below is spectacular and the fountain show is amazing. The palace lights are stunning. The museum has a great selection of different Spanish artwork and displays an excellent array of Spanish history and culture. You could spend two days in this museum, and the ticket can be used for two consecutive days, in fact. The museum inside is beautiful, beyond the artwork and artifacts themselves. You can go walking around the outside of the national palace and look at the nature, it's relaxing and pretty. Also have a look at the olympic arena just behind the palace; the views are amazing. You could spend a whole afternoon here."

            "review": "Art is ok, place is wonderful. The art is ok, as noted by a previous reviewer, doesn't compare to the Thyssen or Prado, imho.The building itself is pretty, I thought. I approached it both from above and below, and it's pretty to look at. If you're approaching from above (the Park), MNAC peeks through the trees. Take the tram up (it's located in the subway, it's part of the subway so it's a free transfer), at the top, you can go up to the Castle or walk toward Miro, and MNAC is just a little further down. The Park is very pretty near the Miro. The building is also pretty cool from the inside.The \"Magic Fountain\" is on the grounds. I never figured out the time schedule, but it was going off in the weekday morning (or part of it). It was very nice. I can see that it would be spectacular if all the fountains went off, esp. at night.Worth a gander, if not just to walk around outside."

            "review": "Not the best museum in Spain. The MNAC was strongly recommended in the guide books. Most of the presentation seemed to be oriented to the Catalan history, which I appreciate is a source of local pride. I suppose the highlight of our visit was the exceptional view from the front steps. Standing there, one can see the whole of Barcelona city. The museum itself was so-so, but we had just been to the Prado, Thiessen, etc., so perhaps were expecting more."

            "review": "Amazing....... Ok, im not into visting museums much, but its the actual BUILDING itself that is amazing!Seriously, its as impressive as the Taj Mahal and looks like a palace! You cant miss the thing really!There are about 100 steps that go to the actual front/doors of this building (its where they used to store hundred of famous paintings from across the world, but now i THINK there is a new museum built). When you get to the top of the steps, the view (on a nice sunny day!), is BREATHTAKING!!!I went to this building NYE about 3 years ago, as i heard from local spanish people its the place people go to celebrate, so, i did! Everyone walks up around 11:45pm with bottles of champagne (i had Lambrini, kidding...haha), and party streamers, and then around midnight at the top of the steps (theres like a little area people can take photos), the place explodes! At the back of this building are parks and where the OLYMPIC stadium is, well worth a walk around on a beautiful summers day.To get to the National art Museum, get the Metro to PLACA DE ESPANYA."
