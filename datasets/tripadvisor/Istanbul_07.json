If you would like to stay close to heart of Old Istanbul you can find for yourself boutique hotel or hotel, for those who prefer to live in more quite place you easily can reach Sultanahmet by tram. This area needs at least 2 days to explore. I will suggest you to get a museum card as it will save for you time and money (85TL for 5 days), also if you are planning to stay more in Istanbul or you are often guest, please get a transportation card - Istanbulkart (). Warning! Be aware of pick pocketers on tram-, bus- and metro stations! Keep your documents and money close"

The most famous monuments to visit are the Topkapi Palace with its Harem and the gardens with the Aya \u0130rini church/museum, the Sultanahmet or Blue Mosque with its fabulous blue tiles from Niceia, magnificent Aya Sofia facing the Blue mosque, the incredible Basilica Cistern and the Milion stone right next to it, the Obelisk, \u0130brahim Pasha Palace/museum, the German Fountain given to the sultan by the German emperor as a present. Between the Blue mosque and AYa Sofia is a historical Hamam originally built by Sinan, the great architect. The Hippodrome behind the Blue Mosque doesn't exist any more but you can easily see traces of it. There are so many things to see and do, including restaurants with fantastic views like the Seven Hills just across the Four Seasons Hotel which also has a nice and expensive restaurant. There are also street cafes. There are many shops too and also the Arasta, with a collection of good shops and also the Mosaic Museum. The Arasta is behind the Blue Mosque also. If you can find the right guide, you will find another layer of Istanbul under the present city. This is the Byzantine Istanbul which you may find in underground cisterns and also tunnels, rooms which can be reached from some carpet shops."

It's a thriving, bustling area, with lovely shops to look through and dozens of fresh baklava and Turkish delight stores to taste and buy goods. So much history here, much better than the Taksim area, which is far too modern for an authentic experience. However, beware the charlatans -everywhere - you're less likely to be charged an extortionate amount for your meal in Taksim than in Sultanahmet, which is probably it's only bad point."

There is so much to see and experience in a relatively small area, but you will need at least 2-4 days to see most of the sights. Be mindful of major Islamic holidays because it changes some of the experiences. Our last visit was during Eid Al Adha and the last 2 days of this holiday was so crowded that you could easily feel claustrophobic! The spice market was impossible! You didn't dare to stop to look or buy anything! Overall, this area is a wonderful experience with lots to see, many shops and restaurants, sweet shops and street vendors. Public transport is very reliable and cheap. I've been back several times and will still go back in a heartbeat."

The area is packed with Ottoman-era mosques, architecture, parks, tombs and palaces. Possibly the most touristy area in Istanbul, it still retains remnants of its old character in its back alleys but you'll have to search for these. You might be hassled (in a friendly manner) by carpet salesmen or waiters trying to convince you they sell the best Iskender kebab in Istanbul, but its all part of the fun. Walking around the area in the late evenings as the shops close down is especially atmospheric. The abandoned dark alleyways and dim streetlights provide a glimpse into what old Istanbul might have felt like."

The Grand Bazaar and the Trajan Column a short walk away or 2 tram stops away. Little Hagia Sophia is slightly out of the way but still within walking distance from the main area. Restaurants, hotels, art galleries, shops selling souvenirs and other commercial establishments catering to the tourism industry are plenty here.Should you want to explore the 'other' side of Istanbul in Galata, Taksim Square, Dolmabahce Palace and the likes the tram takes you the other side efficiently and at TL4 costs one way almost nothing.Sultanahmet district is Istanbul if I could say without exaggeration."

Be sure to walk through the Grand Bazaar.

Don't believe the sellers that only his are high quality they are all the same (probably low quality, but cheap), and don't listen to their stories (their kids have to go to school or the rent is too high or whatever).To the museums:If you want to visit hagia sophia and the Palace with the harem close by, buy the museum pass! It costs 85 ytl and you get your moneys worth pretty fast. You get into the hagia sophia, into the palace with harem (which costs extra), and into quite some museums for free! You can also ask restaurants or museum shop if they take the card for discounts! Enjoy your stay and don't let the city overwhelm you ;) "

The hippodrome and the blue Mosque are also in close proximity and the Grand Bazaar is one stop away on the tram. To recover from the hustle of the bazaar visit the Topkapi Palace and savour the view from the shady gardens. If one really wants a 'spoil' make an appointment at the Ayasofya Hamam which is connected to the Hagia Sofia building. Very professional, unintimidating Hamam experience especially for first time visitors. You will need to book ahead and it's quite pricy but well worth it."

If you are vegetarian I recommend lentil soup, Esav would eat his heart out for it.This area includes the Four Seasons Hotel and the Rug Museum, flying carpets and levitation, anyone? A carpet that flies would be preferable to a blue bus (crazy driver does not begin to describe bus drivers in Istanbul) but if you take a taxi in Istanbul you need the address you are going to written out for the driver and they charge flat rates depending on the traffic not by a meter.

It was planned that way because we wanted to hit two birds with one stone and see what we could of this amazing city. If you're on a brief visit, Sultanahmet is where you want to stay. This is is the district where the Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and Basilica Cisterns are all located within walking distance from each other. ANY hotel in that district is in a prime location but prices may vary wildly. We found ours on Expedia as an exclusive offer and saved 75% off refuser price. The T1 tram line dissects the district and is a good point to anywhere else in the city. As far as getting to Sultanahmet from Ataturk Airport, taxis are cheap but be aware of Fridays and holidays when traffic can turn a 25 min commute into a two or three hour nightmare. We took the Metro and it's a piece of cake. Get a Istanbulkart which is a reloadable pass that's valid for subway, tram and ferry. From airport-- take M1 metro line to Zetinburnu Station. Cross the tracks to the T1 tram line toward Kabasi. You'll be on the tram for approx 14 stops, get off at Sultanahmet. To take ferry from Sultanahmet to cross Bosphorus, take same T1 line, exit at Eminonu and the ferries will be visible. To visit the museums, but yourself an $85 (Turkish Lira, approx 50 US $) Museum Pass which allows you to see any museum within 5 days. Otherwise it will be $20-30TL per museum. Enjoy!!!"

Blue Mosque closes for mid-day prayers so best time will be early morning. Next, Head to Hagia Sophia. You can buy your museum pass at one of the counters (you must bring a copy of your passport or any other form of ID). You can get free pass for children under 12 years age here as well. Spend about 2 hours in Hagia Sophia. By then it will be Lunch time, so head to one of the restaurants between Hagia Sphia and Blue Mosque, or alternatively opposite to Sultanahmet tram station. After lunch spend the rest of the afternoon at Topkapi Palace."

While we couldn't find a hotel to match the first one we stayed at, it was a definite bonus to be able to walk to most of the attractions in the area without the cost of a taxi several times a day. It was easier to make several trips to the Grand Bazaar and come back to the hotel to unload the shopping.

This area is the historical centre where you will feel the ultimate history of Ottoman Empire.. \u0130stanbul doesnt only represent Ottoman or Islam. This city was the capital of Byzantine Empire once.. So imo this is the most beautiful city for culture turism due to its mixed identities. Still very different people from different background and ideologies live together in peace in this awesome city where asia and europe is connected with two bridges. Also 3rd is opening in a month..  So istanbul is a must and in Istanbul sultanahmet district is a must too. As an Istanbuler i have couple of recommendations. First find the original sultanahmet meatball restaurant. There are two big restaurant in the centre but the original and better one is the one where they dont accept credit cards. Also just a metro stop away there is a corlulu ali pasa medresesi where you can drink one of the most delicious and authentic turkish coffee and there are aromatic teas. Also a waterpipe (hokkah) of course!! I didnt need to mention blue mosque or hagia sofia btw.  All the cafes in sultanahmet area are authentic whereever you go you will just love the athmosphere. If i am to recommend a luxury 5* hotel that would be four seasons sultanahmet which was a prison once. They keep the feeling and touched it a little bit to give the luxury look. You can have a drink at the roof watching blue mosque. It is picturesque but stop taking photos and feel the rhtym:) if you prefer to stay in a boutique hotel just pick one. All have similar concept. But about the view its not guaranteed coz this is historical area so buildings are old and short.. Topkap\u0131 palace is in the area too. So one world just go..."

The tram is also accessible, and we used it few times to get to different parts of the city, again locals helped us how to buy tokens and where to stop."

Outside the mosque there is a square which is the remains of the ancient hippodrome used for chariot races. In the square is an obelisk taken from Karnak, Egypt about 400AD. The Hagia Sofia is right there as well and the Basilica Cistern which is a huge ancient underground water \"tank\". Make sure you leave plenty of time to visit Topkapi Palace - give that at least half a day especially if you see the Harem section. A short walk,in the other direction is the Grand Bazaar where the mechanics are waiting patiently to take your money - lots to see there. The Spice Market is a couple of stops away on the tram."

The harem is interesting as well because few people realise that they were actually prisons and seeing the palace and the harem quarters together, the contrast is marked. The mosaics museum is also worth a visit. It is possible to buy a ticket which enables access to most historical monuments."

The Blue Mosque was \"meh\" to me, (and my guide at Ephesus confided that \"it's only impressive to tourists\") but the Hagia Sophia and Tokapi Palace met my expectations. Details such as the Viking guard chief's graffiti, \"Halfdan carved these runes\" into a railing on a marble parapet resonated for me, as did the mosaic of the fair haired, Irene (born \"Piroska\") of Hungary. I'd no idea that there had been centuries of intermarriage, mercenary activity and trading between Byzantium and Eastern & Northern Europe. Three-four days was just the right amount of time for me to absorb history, and some excellent Turkish cuisine."

A popular tourist site, Sultan Ahmed Mosque continues as a mosque today with men kneeling in prayer on the mosque's lush red carpet after the call to prayer. Construction of the Blue Mosque, as it is popularly known, was built between 1609 and 1616 during the rule of Ahmed I. Its K\u00fclliye contains Ahmed's tomb, a madrasah and a hospice. Magnificent hand-painted blue tiles adorn the mosque\u2019s interior walls and at night the mosque is bathed in blue as lights frame the mosque\u2019s five main domes, six minarets and eight secondary domes. After the Peace of Zsitvatorok and the crushing loss in the 1603-1618 war with Persia, Sultan Ahmet I, decided to build a large mosque in Istanbul to reassert Ottoman power. It would be the first imperial mosque for more than forty years. While his predecessors had paid for their mosques with their spoil of war, Ahmet the First had to remove the funds of the Treasury, because he had not gained remarkable victories.It caused the anger of the ulema, the Muslim jurists. The mosque was built on the site of the palace of the Byzantine emperors, in front of the basilica Ayasofya (at that time, the primary imperial mosque in Istanbul) and the hippodrome, a site of significant symbolic meaning as it dominated the city skyline from the south. Big parts of the south shore of the mosque rest on the foundations, the vaults of the old Grand Palace."

We had only one day to explore Istanbul on a recent trip to Turkey, but I feel like we were able to really experience a lot, and I credit that to the tour company that we booked under, Parasol Tours, and the absolutely wonderful guide they provided for us, Berrin Yavuz. Berrin took my husband and I on a private, walking tour to Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, the Hippodrome, the Blue Mosque, and the Spice Bazaar (at our request as we were less interested in the Grand Covered Bazaar). She was SO knowledgeable about each location and very passionate about sharing that knowledge with us. She had a great sense of humor and never made us feel like we were in a rush or that it was a bother if we needed to stop for a bit. In addition to the main locations mentioned above, she took us to a tile shop where we were able to see a ceramics demonstration using a manual pottery wheel and to a Turkish rug weaving shop where we visited an underground cistern to see a simulation of the Hippodrome in its glory days, watched a weaving demonstration, and had all sorts of beautiful rugs laid out to hear about the different materials and styles. Berrin even recommended local places for lunch and dinner for us, even though those were separate from the tour and dinner fell after the tour had already ended (she made sure we knew how to find the location before dropping us back off at our hotel). Both meals were absolutely delicious, and it was especially appreciated after being suckered into eating at a tourist restaurant the night before with much heftier prices and lower quality food. We were fortunate enough to travel all around Turkey through this company, and I cannot recommend them enough. The drivers and guides are ALWAYS on time, if not early, and they will make the places you visit really come alive for you."

My favorite time is to end of November. The city is getting empty, less tourists than in summer, restaurants and hotels are getting slightly less expensive and one can forget about all his troubles, stresses, etc. Just remember at this time of the year the weather is slightly unpredictable."

My original first impressions of Istanbul is that it is incredibly packed with people, with narrow haphazard streets, and people walk everywhere disregarding traffic. It's like one big free for all. Everything has a bit of a crumbling, dilapidated look to it. This is not the clean, well-maintained old Paris. You get a sense of the extreme age of things from how it is all wearing away but slightly sad about the condition. When I returned this year, the same hustle and bustle was present but the city seemed to be more vibrant, less dilapidated, less crumbling. It seems like there are (much-needed) restoration and new development projects all over. Stopping at the many wonderful sites around the Sultanahmet was like visiting old friends. This is one of the most beautiful collections of buildings and public spaces I have ever visited. I love the wide open Hippodrome with its looted ancient artifacts, the stunning and massive Blue Mosque, and the charmingly crumbling and historic Aya Sofia. During Ramadan all of the plazas and streets around Aya Sofia and Blue Mosque are packed to overflowing. At dusk, the call to prayer plays over the loudspeakers and everyone starts to eat making it eerily quiet and beautiful. We sat on the edge of an old stone wall and ate our street vendor sandwiches, just taking in the sheer mass of people around us. It is an incredible sight. While other areas of Istanbul might be more modern, visiting the ancient Sultanahmet with its unparalleled mixing of all cultures is a must in everyone's lifetime."

I recommend staying in Sultanahmet - there are a range of hotels and guest houses to suit most budgets. The Sultanahmet Square is the hub around which these sights are found and it is full of life at all times of the day - its cooling fountains and line of sight the great Blue Mosque, and Hagia Sofia while also being a main transport hub bring many travellers and locals alike.The food scene here is also exceptional - wander around the back streets and find cafes and restaurants serving delicious authentic Turkish fare at very reasonable prices.

We always felt perfectly safe and had no problems. Many places, such as the Grand Bazaar and the Spice Market, do rudimentary screening of people as they enter.The only downside to Sultanahmet is the continual and unwelcome solicitations by rug merchants and restaurant staff to come into their shops. We quickly decided to say 'no thank you', avoid eye contact, and keep on walking. If you stop to be polite to everyone who entreats you, you'll never get anywhere."

This district has so much history, vibrancy, and fascinating places and people. At no point did we feel unsafe, even when we were out in the evenings. The carpet sellers can be quite aggressive in their friendliness; the experience of viewing carpets is interesting and they will bring you copious amounts of tea. If you want to look for Turkish carpet, by all means, but don't feel pressured. You can say no thank you! Don't miss the terraced cafe overlooking the water -- keep walking through the park past the Topkapi Palace to find it. Wonderful place to stay and walk to see so much of old Istanbul.

Beneath what was the stables for the Sultan is the Arasta Bazaar, less daunting than the Grand Bazaar! Hard to spot, but in the Arasta Bazaar, there is a small sign for a Mosaic Museum. These mosaics were in Justinian's palace, which stood where the Blue Mosque stands today, so they date back to the Romans.

No visit would be complete without visiting all of these places, so Sultanahmet is a must. The area has the feeling of being very safe. The majority of people are either just going about their daily business or sightseeing. But beware, just below the surface some danger lurks. This comes in the form of the numerous scam artists. Conversations will begin with 'hey where are you from?', 'hello my friend are you lost' etc. If you engage a very strong and sophisticated scam will start which could involve them befriending you, buying you a slap up meal, drinks etc before hours later scamming you out of thousands when they get you into a nightclub. Just be aware of it. Decline politely and don't be drawn in. You are not even safe from these people in the grounds of the mosque. They will follow you if they think you are worthwhile. So when approached, take note of their clothing and who is with them. The a couple of minutes later check around you to see if any of them followed you. My group were followed and we were very aware and security conscious. Make sure you keep wallets etc in your front pockets. Terrorism is also something to be aware of in this area. In early 2016, a suicide bomber targeted people near the fountains. This is of course incredibly rare and the Police presence has gone through the roof. The above might put you off, but don't be disheartened. It is definitely worth the visit, the locals are genuinely glad to see you. The current lack of tourists due to the bombing allows for some real bargaining power but it also means that the restaurant owners are desperate to get you through the door. The harassment from staff outside restaurants can put a real downer on a visit. Of course it is far from being a phenomena specific to here but if like me you enjoy minding your own business and soaking up the atmosphere, it can be a real pain in the rump. Even when you politely decline I have noticed with the younger staff a willingness to get sarcastic and rude. Sometimes you just need the patience of a saint to enjoy a holiday."

We had more fun talking with shop owners, hotel personnel, and the general population than anywhere else in the world. The city welcomes Americans. We loved all of Istanbul, both old and newer areas. It is an easy city to navigate on foot and with the local transportation systems."

I was unsure to visit Turkey, safety was a concern, especially since the latest events in Istanbul, but I decided to go ahead, because I've been wanting to go for a long time. I gotta say that I felt really safe overall and everywhere I went. There were security checks in all the tourist attractions that I visited. And because not many tourists are visiting Turkey (which makes me very sad, it's hurting their economy relaly bad), all the major sites were almost empty, I could see everything that I wanted to see, without long lines, or waiting time. You can book an old city tour or visit on your own, but definitely a must see. I personally used a company used Rock Valley Tours, and they planned all my tours in Istanbul, Capadoccia, Kusadasi, Pammukale and Ephesus. I loved having a tour guide; I loved the Ottoman period. Hopefully you get a tourist guide that knows a lot about history, if you are into that. I would definitely visit again. Turkey is a beautiful country, with so much history and so rich in culture."

Istanbul is a very beautiful historical cities, a mix between the east and the west. For cat lovers, you can see healthy cats and dogs almost everywhere in the city. There were lots of mosques and it was really soothing when the prayers were called. I managed to walk to the Blue Mosque before continue walking along the tram path towards Yeni Cemi, another beautiful mosque facing the Marmara Sea. Before returning to the airport for my next flight I managed to go to the Grand Bazaar (tips: just grab everything you like at the moment you see them because you will never go back to the same shop, it was huge and confusing! Another tips: prepare to haggle!). The tea was really really delicious and the shopkeepers were really friendly."

The Sultanahmet District, with all of its historic sites, is an amazing, mystical, spiritual center if you are interested in the history of the world. There is more security, which is a good thing. When we were in Paris 4 years ago, there were soldiers with guns everywhere, and nobody said \"don't go to Paris\". The buildings are ancient, the history is available and present for the tourist who is interested, and the people are so happy, so friendly, so glad to see tourists. Of course, this is a tourist area, and the people who live and work here are happy to see tourists! The business people we talked to said their business was off by 80% or more, and they were so saddened by that. I never for one minute felt unsafe, even when I was walking alone and the tourist guides trying to sell their services were very forward, to the point of being obnoxious. Turkey is beautiful and Sultanahmet is the place to start your adventure. The hotel we stayed in was unsurpassed - Ottoman Imperial Hotel - the food everywhere was delicious, the attractions were reasonably priced and even though there were lines to get into the most important sites, they were unbearable. I would go back to Istanbul in a heartbeat and I urge you to go, too."

So expectedly it is very crowded and bustling with tourists. Situated on the tip of a peninsula it is surrounded by the Golden Horn to the North, the Bosphorus strait inlet to the East and the Sea of Marmara to the South and has magnificent views from vantage points. In this area multiple tourist attractions are situated including Sultan Ahmet Mosque (Blue Mosque), Ayasofya (Hagia Sophia) museum, Topkapi Palace, the underground Basilica cistern, the Roman Byzantine Hippodrome, German fountain, Theodosius obelisk, and many more.This is a whole day affair and involves a considerable amount of walking. It is best undertaken with a tour guide to provide the important historical background of the various monuments and also to facilitate the visits in an efficient manner without wasting time or getting lost. We did these visits as part of our 10-day Turkey visit with Gate1 Travel and we were fortunate to have a very knowledgeable young tour manager, Oguz Atici, who had graduate degree in archeology and history. This background made his narratives all the more interesting. Oguz\u2019 pleasant and courteous personality and helpful nature was very appreciated making our Turkey visit a truly memorable one. Highly recommend both Gate1 Travel and our tour manager Oguz."

Restaurants with spectacular views have space when it suits. The Sultanhamet district is where we found the Blue Mosque,the Hagia Sophia and the fascinating Cistern. Gulhane Gardens are gorgeous, and the terrace cafe within is a great lunch spot. (We ere going to Topkapi Palace on our return in a few days.) The major attractions of the city are closely clustered, and easily accessible on foot. There are lots of guided tours to choose from, a terrific option where there is so much to be learned about the history and culture of such an ancient city. Turkish families and school tours go about business as usual, making Istanbul feel no more threatening than Paris or London.. .

And women cover your shoulders and hair. For myself it was as simple as a maxi dress with a cardigan and throwing a chiffon scarf around me. You will have to remove your shoes also. You are given a plastic bag to carry them in at the door. This is a must as part of the ritual for Muslims before prayer is to be ensure cleanliness (ablution). Therefore you can't bring shoes that have walking outside, inside. A wee pair of socks is ok once you wee move your shoes. Also don't worry if you forget any of this as there is a stall at the visitors entrance where you can borrow scarfs and linen skirts. Muslims pray 5 times a day and you'll be aware of these time by the call to prayer, during these times you cannot enter the mosque as a visitor unless to pray, out of respect. However there will be people praying on your visit as for some they pray when they can possible, so you have to enter the mosque from a visitors entrance once inside the courtyard. This grand mosque is very picturesque and once inside the grounds you feel a certain peace come over you as prayers are carried out and young children are playing, even an option to ask questions and discuss Islam with knowledgable imans. The architecture beautiful and the interior is clean cut. But in honesty it's not as gran as it appears, the mosque is worth a visit as it is beautiful to see but for myself it didn't meet the hype."

Its full of fine hotels, lovely restaurants and lovely little shops where you can browse in peace and buy some lovely stuff. The Arasta bazar is a little gem and is in this neighborhood. Enjoy Istanbul!! I certainly did."

It is definitely the most preserved area of the old Istanbul that nowadays is just a jungle of concrete buildings and skyscrapers with very little greenery left in between. Here you get a chance to see the ancient Haghia Sophia museum which was converted to a mosque from a church after the Conquest of Constantinople during the Byzantine Empire period. You can also visit the Blue Mosque which is a massive structure still used by thousands of Muslims during prayer time. In the same area you also get to visit the Obelisk, and the Serpentine column that dates back many centuries. The Topkapi Palace is only few minutes walk from these so you can definitely fill your day with the most famous places of Istanbul. Be careful with the some of the street sellers and shops as they may try to over-charge you for some of the souvenirs if they realize you are a foreigner."

The main attractions are the Blue Mosque, the Aya Sofiya and Topkapi Palace all in very close proximity to each other which is great. The only downside is that the queues can get quite long at Topkapi and Aya Sofiya. We visited Topkapi one morning and Aya Sofya the next morning and got there at 9am both days to avoid long queues and it worked a treat! All mosques are free to visit from dawn to late evening but closed to tourists during prayer times. Most of the mosques offer head coverings and long outer garments to those who are not dressed modestly enough to enter so all have the opportunity to see the beauty inside these magnificent buidlings. There are lots of shops and restaurants ( Sultan Kosesi, Buhara Kebab house, Massa were all lovely and reasonably priced). But my favourite bit about our visit to istanbul was the people. If it were not for their beautiful hospitality our trip would not have been as memorable. We were made to feel very welcome and loved every bit of our stay."

Grab a taxi or bus to the Grand Bazaar area, wander Galata bridge, and tour Hagia Sofia or the Blue Mosque. The crush of the crowd in the Bazaar itself can be a bit off-putting for the claustrophobic, but otherwise this is a must-stop area if you've never been to Istanbul before. I personally prefer to stay across the bridge in the slightly less touristy and more modern Beyoglu--think West Village NYC, but, y'know, if NYC were 600 years older than Jesus Christ and had much cooler architecture--but Sultanahment always makes for an interesting visit."

This area has a lot to see!That being said, you'll also get a ton of people trying to get your attention and come into their shops. At some points it happens so often that you'll actually start to impede traffic! My advice - avoid eye contact and if you have a particularly insistent person, a firm \"Hayir\" should do the trick. If nothing else, you'll have some interesting memories of the many creative ways people will attempt to strike up a sales conversation with you. My personal favorites, \"Let me guess where you are from!\" and \"Excuse me, can you stop your heart for a moment?\""

Sultanahmet is the name given to the historic peninsula of Istanbul which houses most of the Ottoman architectural treasures.The Blue Mosque - 'Sultanahmet' in Turkish - is an amazing building which dominates the skyline and the area which shares its name. The mosque is well worth a visit; admission is free, but you are invited (not pressured!) to make a donation as you leave.Opposite the mosque is the At Meydani, or Hippodrome, which an obelisk from Egypt and some Roman columns. The other end of the Hippodrome, Divan Yolu, has the tramline and plenty of places to eat and drink. Walk along Divan Yolu a bit further in either direction to find slightly cheaper eateries.Walking out from the mosque's exit you are confronted with a view of Aya Sofia - originally a church, then a mosque and currently a museum. There is a charge to enter the museum but there are some tombs in the grounds which are free to visit. Continue beyond Aya Sofya to the Topkapi Palace. The first part is free to enter, but you'll need to pay to enter the main parts.Also by the Hippodrome and Aya Sofya is the Basilica Cistern, which is well worth a visit. I can't remember how much it cost, but it wasn't much.Behind the Sultanahmet mosque are streets of old, wooden houses. It's worth a stroll down here.If you continue along Divan Yolu heading past Aya Sofya you will eventually come to Eminonu, from where you can get a ferry to Asia, cross the Golden Horn to Beyoglu or visit the Spice Bazaar and, if you wish, walk a little further to the Grand Bazaar.This area is amazing and you could spend a whole week just in this part of Istanbul without getting bored."

If tourists hadn't been bombed in nearby Beyoglu the day we arrived ( and in Sultanahmet two months before), and if the US state department hadn't increased its warning to tourists, my impression wouldn't be colored with any poke of danger, but because of these events, it is. During our six days here there was always a little question of \"what's up next?\" over our shoulder, which isn't the best way to enjoy a city. We usually go off exploring without much worry, but in this current time we stuck to the main sites where police were visible and where metal detectors were in use. The good news is that during our six days in Sultanahmet, we enjoyed staying in a hotel where the main old city sites and museums were within walking distance and we found we could walk anywhere we wanted to go. We enjoyed walking alongside Istanbulites and sharing in the exercise of going up and down hilly cobblestoned streets, and we found the area very easy to navigate.The city's exotic buildings, restaurant aromas, people in varied modes of dress, and street car and tram buzz make it a stimulating place anyone can revel in. All the most interesting, fascinating, and eccectic historical sites are here. The Turkish people are friendly and hospitable. Let's hope these troubled times pass away quickly-- for the citizens' and the tourists' sake."

SULTANAHMET SQUARE is the ideal spot for easy access to reach most of the major attractions in Istanbul, which can be reached on foot, including your shopping at the Grand and the Arasta Bazaar and all the small shops in the surrounding areas. It is close to The Blue Mosk, Hagia Sophis, Tapkapi Palace, Archaeological Museum and many more. If you like shopping, The Grand Bazaar is the bigger and better option of the two Bazaars. Merely follow the Tram Lines up the hill. It is about a 15 minute walk and is on your right hand side of the road. Take special note of save the position on your Google Map on on arrival. Finding your way out of the bazaar and to the Tram Line once again can be a daunting task if you have not pinned your position. Starting at this enormous Grand Bazaar, it can be followed right through several other Bazaars and down to the Spice Bazaar, which is close to the waters edge of the Bosphorous sea. Prices in the Spice Bazaar are more attractive than in the main Grand Bazaar. Sultanahmet is also within easy reach of the Trams and Metro Stations.

When a shoe cleaner walks in front and drops his brush - this purposeful action is done so that the 'tourist' picks up the brush and is then hooked thinking that the vendor wishes to return the favour by cleaning shoes. No so, they are looking to charge a phenomenal amount. Beware all those walking in this area."

The echoes of the recitation around the mosque structure was wonderful. My two daughters also enjoyed the internal atmosphere. It was free to visit, but you can make a donation on exit. The Hagia Sophia was a Christian church, later transformed to a mosque by the Otamons, now a museum. Seeing the paintings of Christ and the Angels was beautiful. As Muslims Jesus a prophet, was respected and images were covered by Muslims due to no images of beings allowed in a mosque. The entry was 30 lira. However we paid an extra 20 lira each to get a guide who explained everything in great detail.Topkapi palace entry was 30 lira plus 15 lira if you wanted to visit the residential quarters."

Located fairly centrally on the southern side of the Golden Horn, it's within walking distance both from the \"Great Attractions\": Gran Bazar, Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque to the south, but also the University (which is brimming with life like all campuses and worth a walk through when students are in session), Little Hagia Sophia and a multitude of little shops, restaurants and even food trucks for the more adventurous, at night. A very convenient trolley will ferry you back and forth from Topkapi and vicinities, or take you to Galata and North along the European side of the Bosphorus. For the more initiated traveller, walking North through narrow and winding streets, one easily reaches the Fatih district, where the flavor becomes very Turkish, with decidedly fewer tourists, but places well worth visiting or simply checking out, like the Fatih Mosque and further North, the Kariye Museum with its spectacular mosaics and even further Ey\u016bp and Pierre Loti, with its beautiful view of the Golden Horn and the City.If you venture to Fatih, DO NOT ignore the small and simply marvellous pastry shops that dot your travel: buy a few pastries here, a few there and eat your way through. Highly advise"

It is all things that I like that are combined and made your visit incredible. Go to the Blue Mosque, and Hippodrome, visit cisterns below the Sultanahmet and dont forget Saint Sophia on your way. But also take a nice walk to the park, enjoy the flowers at Topkapi pallace and get lost in the crowd of Kapali carsi.At the end of the long day enjoy a cup of tea in the one of the cake shops and try delicious baklava (I prefer dolama with pistachio.And if you are some kind of night bird then do not forget to go to one of the local restaurants on special belly dance performance.And you have rounded your circle on Sultanahmet :)"

The district is simply fantastic, worth visiting. One needs to keep in mind that there will be plenty of locals inviting to get into their shops - restaurants, sometimes in a rather persisting and a bit annoying manner. There are many beggars, apparent refugees from Syria, which is not sad, particularly when small children are seen there even in the evening. IT is good to have change.To pay for restaurants and shops one needs to keep in mind that credit cards tend not to work all the time. There are plenty of ATMs, however, to overcome the problem.Traffic is a bit problematic, sometimes, and streets are not friendly to those with limited mobility. The park near the palace if simply great, worth visiting and above all, the great, breathtaking views of the Bosphorus and the city from the terraces at the end of the park where for 10, 15 or 20 Turkish Lira one can enjoy turkish tea for 1, 2 or 3 people while relaxing and enjoying."

Well, being a local, an Istanbul fan and fond of history what I would humbly suggest will not be about what you'll be seeing. On the contrary, the most striking experience lies within what you'll not be able to observe physically. In fact, the neighborhood had been \"the\" centre, the heart of three real empires for 15 consecutive centuries. So, you can imagine how influential, colourful place it had been. Unfortunately, what can be seen today is just tip of an iceberg. The most interesting part is the completely lost buildings, temples, palaces and most importantly extremely vivid history of individuals : powerful men, women and the people, in general. There are thousands of real stories which goes beyond the imagination of wildest writers. All you need is little imagination and background reading. So here is my humble suggestion : if you have limited time you have to the \"touristic musts\". It's absolutely worthy. But you have to come back, this time for the \"route supported by imagination\" episode. If you have long enough time you can do both. I'm sure everytime you will discover more exciting things as I always do."

The places to visit here are plenty, many ancient structures and historically significant buildings, it would certainly save a lot of time to book a hotel in this area, as you can pretty much walk everywhere or just use the T1 tram.As a neighbourhood this is extremely touristy, lot's of restaurants, bars, shisha places and shops here, but it's also very touristy, the prices are reasonable for most places, but not really the place to go if you want to experience the local culture, even the very few places here where locals hangout are mainly for people working in this area serving tourists."

I went there january, my third visit in Turkey, but my first in Istanbul. The locals/the people that lives around Istanbul (and also the other tourists) are extremely kind, helpful and willing to make your visit there as wonderful as it can be. The city is huge, and like you might know, splitted in two sides. The asian side is where a lot of locals live (that's where i stayed) and the more touristic european side. although it's very easy to go from one side to the other. I did that every day. On the european side, there is a place called Taksim and in Taksim Square there is a very famous and long street called Istiklal street where you can find aaall stores and boutiques you want. And if you follow Istiklal street far enough you\u00b4ll adventually reach the famous Galata Tower, which costs about 30tl to enter (very much Worth it!).If you wanna go to Sultanahmet, you'll go to Sirkeci (it's the metro station closest to Sultanahmet) and when you reach the Square you'll see the Blue Mosque, Ayasofya and several other museums you definitely dont want to miss! Blue Mosque is free to enter and the Ayasofya museum costs 30tl and if you want a personal tour guide it costs about 50tl.The metro station system is very simple to use! When you find yourself on Ayrilikcesmesi metro station, you can pretty much go everywhere from there, including the rail way system. And Kadik\u00f6y is only one stop from Ayrilikcesmesi with metro. So, Istanbul is a beautiful city with lots of culture, attractions and nice people! I truly recommend it. This was definitely NOT the last time i go there!"

Despite the latest sad events causing terror and fear only two weeks after we visited, I'd advise people to go and visit this magnificent testimony of a glorious past where both the islamic and the catholic faith live in harmony, at least inside the magnificent museums and mosques.Sultanahmet is a neighbourhood of Fatih, one of Istanbul's districts. It contains some very unique and glorious buildings, among which probably the most visited are the Topkap\u0131 Palace, Aya Sofia, the Blue Mosque and Aya Irini. The magnificent Cistern and the Hippodrome of Constantinople are also there.We managed to visit everything in 4 days with a private guide, which I suggest to invest in. There's so much to learn about his city, one needs some expert guidance!Sultanahmet is also very close to the Golden horn and is facing the Marmara sea, where all the Bosphorus cruises leave. The Grand Bazaar is also easily reachable by foot and there is a very efficient tram service which can take you to the Pera district and beyond. Close by there is also an underground station which one uses to get to the Asian side if one wants to avoid the boat transfer. The area is full of very good restaurants with magnificent terraces.For all these convenient reasons we found that, unlike other areas, Sultanahmet is the perfect base to visit Istanbul by foot."

We were able to go into the courtyard of the Blue Mosque, but by the time the attractions were open large queues built up and we did not feel inclined to join those queues,Instead we had a lovely lunch in a Trip Advisor listed rooftop restaurant which was a small way up a side street fro the main Sultanahmet area. We followed lunch with a stroll through the city down towards the bridge which went over to the cruise ships and picked a tram up from there back to our ship. We are pleased about what we chose to do as we had a relaxing day exploring Istanbul. We would love to return and see the attractions as well and really hope that we are able to do so.

The tour came about in the following way.For my stay in Istanbul, I worked with Memphis Tours ofCairo, Egypt and as the local subagent for Turkey, Castle Travel of Kusadasi,Turkey, and I guess I will have nothing to do with either ofthem ever again. To provide me with a tour of the main attractionsin Istanbul, they linked me up with Turista Tours with an office in Sultanahmet.Dealing with the Turista office is miserable. The organization of the tour was mindless. First, we had to walk about .8km from their office to the Blue Mosque. Then we had to walk about a kilometer up the \"touts' alley,\" the Hippodrome, to Hagia Sophia. Then we had to walk back down the same kilometer to\"lunch\" (which was mediocre). Then we were supposed to walk once more up the samekilometer to the \"cistern.\" Kilometer after kilometer of pointlesswalking instead of seeing all the sights in one area at a time. What moron designed this tour? I dropped out before the cistern because my feet could not do anymore. A kindly Australian fellow traveler consideratelyalso dropped out and gave me use of his tram pass so that Idid not miss the last sight on the tour, which was two tramstops away, the Grand Bazaar.   I am 62 years old and this sure was a poor arrangement for me. Let me note also that both Turista and Castle Travel are so incompetent that they wrote on my itinerary that the same tour would also include Topkapi Palace, yet they scheduled this tour for a Tuesday--the one day of the week when the palace is never open. And they scheduled my visit toBaylerbeyi Palace in Istanbul also on the one day of theweek when it is not open! During the Sultanahmet tour, I asked the tour guide to use hiscellphone to call Turista's office and let me talk tothe manager about rescheduling the tours that wereincorrectly scheduled. He complied, but the manager at Turista Travelis so rude that he said, \"I don't want to talk toyou.\" Yeah? You don't want to listen to acustomer? Well, ok, buddy, I will talk to others. I advisetravelers to Istanbul to avoid Turista Tours like theplague."

We always found nice little take-aways if focusing on places with 'locals'.One should be aware that everybody wants to make a deal ;-) Watch out for people lossing their shoe-brush :-) If we'd get back, we'll pick the district again, even if in winter there was still a lot of tourism."

There are only 30 in the world now, most in Rome and Egypt and a few scattered through Europe. The Hagia Sophia was gorgeous. Nice to walk around and just enjoy, but hard to get a great photo o the ground level. Have to be creative to capture the beauty of the buildings.

Public transport from this area is by tram or the Big Red Bus Tour, which I would recommend highly as you get to see Istanbul first hand via the red route and blue route. You can hop off and on in any 24 hour period with your ticket. If you venture off into the side streets you will see the most fascinating sites for example one street was full of shoe shops. These shops were not really for retail but just to show what is on offer to the trade and boxes upon boxes are being packed in the street for distribution all of Turkey and the World. It is total organised chaos and a site to see and observe real hard work as carts are pulled up and down steep hills by all ages of men and boys. Great atmosphere"

There are so many hotels around here so you should never be more than 10 minutes away from the main Sultanahmet area.Public transport is probably the easiest way to get here. If you arrive at Ataturk, most of the hotels provide a free transfer. If you arrive at Sabiha Gokcen, then you can catch the Havatas coach to Taksim, then catch the funicular to Karakoy. After this, catch the metro to Sultanahmet. Buy the Istanbulkart (like the Oyster Card in London) which gives you cheaper rates on public transport and one card can be used by many people.Once you've arrived, you can just walk around everywhere for the top sites - Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia etc. (Buy the Museum Pass if you plan to see a few sites, will save a lot of time and money.)There are lots of free places to go including the Blue Mosque, University Art Museum, Topkapi palace grave monuments - many others are not too far by public transport (e.g. Gulhane Park)The only issue is there is not much good authentic food in this area. There are plenty of kebab shops and fast food restaurants including Burger King and McDonalds. Prices here for food are slightly higher than other areas - especially the Asian side of Istanbul (here the food is delicious and very cheap!)."

If you are a traveller who like to visits the city and experience the local life, look no further.. It can be shock on your first day. Motor traffic, Tram, metro all cutting through the streets.. Total chaos but you'll learn to love it for that's Istanbul for you.Word of warning, do not take the taxi for one its a rip off, two they never get to exactly where you want to be, it's always around the corner and thirdly the Turks like a good deal so if you are a couple expect them to stop and pick up another person to make an extra bit of cash and for that you'll have the pleasure of seeing place you did not intend to nor will you get there in time!So simply put use the public transport. It's well connected and very frequent and seemingly on time.. You have access you ferry Tram metro and marmaray lines all in Sultanahmet. All your sights are here.. So it is a good choice no doubt.Get the Istanbul Kart just like the Londons Oyster Card load up and it's the most economical way to travel in Istanbul and in my experience the efficient way too. We love the local transport so.much we even went back to the Ataturk airport by metro, close to 30-35 mins from Old City.Hope you found this useful."

The first tram stop up the hill is the Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi palace, and Basilica Cisterns (easy walk). We are usually adventuresome and like the challenge of public transportation ( I think it is a direct tram ride) but this time with the rain we took the shuttle. Orientation is a challengers the old city, as streets twist and turn and start and stop. Our hotel gave us a good map and a card to carry if we should become lost. You simply give it to the taxi driver and they will bring you home (good idea but we did not need it). The view from our hotel room looked out on the old Topkapi castle wall (50 m away) and the back of the Hagia Sophia. We stayed at the Yasmak Sultan hotel (clientele are international). There are a variety of shops and restaurants within a few minutes walk. At first we were hesitant to wander around the streets after dark but soon found the neighborhood was quite safe. This is not the trendy bar scene so it quiets down by nine or ten. We were worried about travel with an almost two year old but soon learned that the Turkish people see children as gifts from God. Even as we walked down the street men and women both would smile and wave and want to touch our grandson's head or hand. It was heartwarming to experience."

Initially, we stayed just outside of the district within easy tram commute. If I were to return soon, I might consider stating in a bit closer just to be able to walk everywhere. The Sultanahmet area will simply swallow you up as it simply where you will end up over and over again depending on your specific destination. Embrace the hustle and bustle and just take it all in. This is where you just walk and walk until you can walk no more!"

It's easy, but get oriented. it is easy to confuse what is the sub way and what is the light rail on the maps. We also learned there are no transfers. You have to buy a new ticket if you have used up your prepaid ticket. Use the machines that take cash-our credit cards didn't work) We ran out of lira, had to exit the subway (we had counted on being able to transfer from one line to another) exchange money,find the Metro. No, they don't all speak English, and Turkish in the Roman alphabet is incomprehensible gibberish. This time the taxi cab driver demanded 65 Turkish Lira when we got to the airport, though the meter showed 45. He indicated our luggage. He had started to swindle us by noting a traffic \"restriction, \" on the way, but it was minor so he couldn't use that. (they will use \"night fare\", demand payment before you are our of the cab,etc.) Previously a cab driver mentioned \"traffic\" (it was just the usual, and extorted 30 TYL from us)Still, a not to be missed wonder of the world. The Basilica Cistern my number one truly awe inspiring sight. Try to get an accurate map. Street signs are few and far between. If you like shopping, it's paradise."

Because all the Mosques and museums that matter are located here.The Hagia Sophia and the Sultanahmet Mosque (Blue Mosque) are the big landmarks and not to be missed. The Blue Mosque is more impressive outside than in, vice versa with the Hagia Sophia.Topkapi Palace would be the next thing to do. These three attractions can take a full day.But it doens't stop here. The Sultan Ahmet Park is a nice little green spot to take great pics...or a well deserved rest. Impressive at night with the wonderful Blue Mosque in the back (check the pics).The Divan Yolu Caddesi is the main drag here. Lots of shops and restaurants, fun to look and a good walk....but most of them cater to tourists and can be a hassle. The best places to eat are elsewhere. The \"Cafe Grande\" has good Baklava and desserts though.Don't miss out on the Arasta Bazaar, a short street with the usual Bazaar shops....but without the hassle. There's more to see, best thing is you just walk around, it's not like you will get lost easy. The Blue Mosque is always easy to spot.If you look for a place to sleep, I'd recommend the lovely little \"Hotel Historia\" just 5' away by foot from the Blue Mosque....quiet area, great views from the balcony. And lots of restaurants just out front (try the criminally underrated \"Akbiyik Fish House\").A great district here in Istanbul, but mostly about Mosques and history. To do some fun shopping I would head to Beyoglu (Istiklal Street). And don't forget to visit Kadik\u00f6y on the Asian side: Friendly people, low prices .... great food and products.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."

Of course, this ould only provide a flavor of the place and one that reqlly demands much more of one's time, but my feeling is that some is better than none. I managed to see the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, do a walk by the Topkapi Palace (but did not pay to go in) and past the new Mosque to the Spice Market) all which were an easy work from my charming hotel (the Berce-- super cheap and very nice-- great location). I particularly loved the Blue Mosque and Sophia. WIsh I could have taken a formal tour and have been more educated about what I as seeing. Still was beyond impressive.

Almost all the restaurants and shops surrounding the Blue Mosque are tourist traps, with low quality food at ridiculously high prices. I made the mistake of booking a hotel within 3 minutes of the Blue Mosque which made getting to the main sites easy but it also meant on a rainy day (and it rained for the first 3 days of our stay) we were almost compelled to eat at tourist trap restaurants as our hotel didn't allow us to bring food onto the premises. If I am in Istanbul again, I will book a hotel in another district like Fatih or Sirkeci, not Sultanahmet."

Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome, Palace of Ibrahim (Museum of Islamic Arts), Topkapi Palace with excellent archeological exhibition are the main attractions, but you also can enjoy the view from the terrace of a roof restaurant or walk down to Golden Horn for a boat excursion."

As Joshua D made comment touristic but what city hasn't a tourist district unless you live in a village in the middle of nowhere in Central Asia !!. If time is limited this is the area to stay as all the major sights are within its borders. All are within walking distance 10 mins one way 15 another. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants and shops galore. The salesmen are sharp and regardless the fact they saw you only this morning they'll ask you again and again to come inside and see my range of carpets or handcrafts. If you're new and inexperienced at travelling the world then you can be sucked in, but a polite no thanks then keep walking usually gets you a \"have a nice day\" comment. This is also where you'll fine all the Foreign Exchange counters, a must for the general tourist especially if you get involved in a shopping exercise. I disagree with a comment that the quality of shopping is poor, as there is a range of products and quality, to be found to suit all tastes. You must know what you're buying and pay accordingly for the quality you desire. There's so much to see and do in this area, it's where you'll find the Blue Mosque, The Cistern, Hippodrome and Hagia Sopia Museum to name just a few. Enjoy Sultanahmet - Dennis"

There's always lots of men asking you to come to their restaurant or shop and as long as you're friendly they will not be offended if you say no. It is more offensive to ignore them or be rude, so don't! They are just trying to make a good living. The shops are quite orientated to tourism but you can still find some traditional treasures. Lots of goods from Turkmenistan and Syria if you choose to delve. Lots of good inexpensive restaurants for basic kebab meals but also great veggie and meat 'casserole' type dishes to eat with rice or bulgar. Have a kebab for lunch but choose the clay pot speciality for dinner. Well served by the tram, only 4 TL per trip."

We hired personal guides to take us into the Basilica Cistern, Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace. Lastly the Chora Church. We had two half day tours with different guides. We learned more by having things pointed out than just reading in our guide book. Super neighborhood for Istanbul and Turkish history."

Many historical, cultural and religious sites along with shopping and many restaurants are within easy walking distance. Walking is easily supplemented by Istanbul's fine mass transit system if you want to other city districts. We loved the historical, cultural and religious sites (we have reviews of the individual sites posted separately). Restaurants were plentiful and many had great city and sea views. Shopping was everywhere, and given the current strength of the US dollar good buys were available. Note though vendors can be aggressive. My wife and I highly recommend the district for tourists.

Skip the packaged tours and do them yourself. Rent audio guides at the main sites. Get the 12TL 2 hour Bosphorus cruise. Pack a good guidebook, and pick up some maps. Have an adventure! Don't miss the Hagia Sofia, the Topkapi Palace, the Basilica Cisterns, the Blue Mosque (dress code alert), and the very fine archaeological museum.Oh, and buying a carpet is NOT compulsory - but expect to be sold one multiple times!"

It is also the start point of the Big Bus hop-on hop-off buses, and we found that a 2 day bus pass is more than enough to see the rest of the city. The first day we arrived in the afternoon and just took a loop on the bus to see all the sites and to decide which ones we wanted to visit the next day. Big Bus tickets are available from the buses in front of Hagia Sophia and cheaper if you buy them direct rather than from the travel agents around.Public transport is also available close by if you don't want to use the Big Bus. From here we also booked a boat trip up the Bosphorus to the Black Sea, and they pick you up at your hotel so no need to worry about that.Airport transfer tip: Book an airport shuttle from one of the travel agents instead of booking a taxi. It takes a bit longer but you will pay at least half the price. They usually leave every hour, just book a day or 2 in advance and they pick you up at your hotel.Tip: Don't go during Eid. We were there over the Eid Holiday weekend and it was incredibly crowded and the ferries and public transport were way too busy to use."

The sultanahmet mosque is also impressive. We were least impressed by the grand bazaar especially for shopping. the building is impressive but it is full of tat at high prices.

Visit the Hagia Sophia ( buy a ticket from a near buy vending machine and jump the queues - same price). Once that's done, visit the Blue Mosque (free), then the palace ( don't forget the harem even though it is a little extra), and finally visit the subterranean cisterns, all four are within a 1/4 mile of each other and well worth a visit. If you look lost for more than 1 minute someone will offer to help you: he is a carpet salesman - I guarantee it. ( Don't buy a carpet for more than, say, $200, unless you know what you are buying. Counting the stitches on the back isn't all there is to it.)Now your real exploration of Istanbul can begin! Dive down side streets, into tiny shops and go where the Turkish people go. Check out the spice (aka Egyptian) market. It is much much smaller than the Grand Bazaar, and the streets south of it a treat you will not forget. Learn how to use the trams, which is easy, and spend some time getting lost. Finally, choose a budget price hotel, again down a back street, and meet the people who don't arrive in mega air conditioned coaches."

Beware that you will be hounded by many friendly men offering to provide guide services and if not that, they have a carpet business to take you to. Better deals are available elsewhere, even money exchanging rates are better elsewhere. That said, if you politely but firmly decline the offers for services you will enjoy walking around through centuries of history. Enjoy!"

We were dropped off by our taxi near the Arasta Bazaar and on another occasion, near the Grand Bazaar - an easy walk to the major sights. You'll see many guides offering their services, but most major sights have very good audio guides, and visitors tend to hire accredited guides from their hotel concierge, websites and tour companies.Aside from being the lodestone of historical Istanbul,encompassing the Hagia Sofia, the Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, the Basilica Cistern and Hippodrome, a walk around Sultanahmet will take you to the Archeology Museums and most sights listed on the must-see list for visitors. The Big Bus stop is in front of the Hagia Sofia. This area has a huge variety of accommodation including internationally known hotels, locally owned and family operated guesthouses and economical hostels. Sultanahmet has hundreds of restaurants, cafes, food stores and souvenir stores. There are also street vendors with bottles water and seasonal snacks, small parks with benches for weary travelers. Clean paid toilets and the discrete presence of tourist policeDefinitely a safe, comfortable place to spend hours if not days, enjoying the glories of historical Istanbul."

The public transport is also bad, if present at all in the area, and if you wanna use a taxi, some drivers ask 10 lira, some 50 (!) for the same route. If you plan to visit Istanbul (which is definitely worth it), forget Sultanahmet, and rent a room in Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, which is kinda junction, with life, and good public transport."

One thing that really set this apart from other countries was that once the trader had asked you if they could help they all accepted \"No\" if that was the case and did not stalk you as often happens in other countries. They were all extremely polite and curtious and were happy to talk to you without the heavy sales pitch. A very pleasent surprize and most welcome. I even tried one of the local toilet's at the cost of 1TRY [a few pence], although this was a tiled hole in the floor, [within a cubicle] it was spotlessly clean with toilet paper and a flushing system plus a lady checking everything was ok after each visit. The hand washing facility was good with both hot water, soap and towels. My opinion of Istanbul and its people [I really didn't have one prior to my visit] has overwelmed me. Thank you for an experience I'll never forget."

You will step back in time as you get off the congested Istanbul roads taking the narrow streets that squeeze you into Old Town. A sightseers paradise with the Blue Mosque, AyaSofya, Cisterns, Palace, a plethora of eating establishments & stores and more all right here. To get to the modern side is but minutes away by Tram or to the ferries that take you across to the Asian side.  We stayed in a wonderful guest house (the Terrace Guest House) that was centrally located to everything only minutes away. It had the best views of the Sea of Marmara and the Bosphorous on its' rooftop.  The restauranteurs stand out trying to entice you into their establishments as there are many to be enticed by. As a westerner it can be unnerving or get old quickly but they're just doing their jobs. They were humorous, lovely and would let you know it if you strolled past them again. For us, it was a fun cultural way of life in this touristy area of Istanbul. Going to the square you will also have adorable young men come up to you giving you suggestions on lines to the mosque, for example. Once you acknowledge them they will find you anytime you walk by somewhat like a Facehugger. You find out they're all selling Turkish Carpets and you'd honor their family to drop by and find out more on how to buy them while there. They're very clever and tenacious but once again, that's the way. The best is to look straight ahead and say no thanks and keep going. Same for the Grand Bazaar. It's a vast land of vendors. The vendors will solicit you right and left and offer you tea to come look at their rugs or whatever. It will be a leisurely affair. Hint-if you accept their tea you are expected to buy something or at least look. Once you haggle, you are expected to buy.  Restaurants of every kind are at your feet. The breads are lovely, the shish succulent and mezzes fresh and aplenty. As it's hot, the Efes beer went down well. I'm a wine person but it was too hot for wine during our stay and Efes worked quite nicely. The Turkish teas (chai) and coffee (kahve) must not be missed either nor the baklava or the lokum or Turkish Delight.  This area is a cultural melting pot and yet so safe. Never once did we feel ill at ease or out of place. There had been tensions earlier around Istanbul but it's a huge city and we never felt any tension. The Turkish people are lovely and their city a pleasure to get to experience. This is a great place to keep you entertained for days."

You will need 2 full days on your feet , trust me! Don\u2019t use any transportation between those attractions! You don\u2019t need them!!!1. Start with Sultan Ahmet Bazar. Expensive, but higher quality items to buy with some old style coffee shops and restaurants ..... 2. Then WALK towards the Blue Mosque ( Sultan Ahmat Mosque)... make sure not to go during prayers time....3. Then WALK to Hagia Sophia Museum,4. From there walk again towards TOPKAPI palace..... 5. From TOPKAPI palace you can walk to Basilica Cistern / just across the street..... it's the yellow building on the other corner!.... 6. From there you can walk for half a mile or so towards grand bazar 7. Then it's up to you to go from there down towards Spices bazar through Mahmoud basa street ( one of the most crowded and cheapest streets in Istanbul ) Never go with tourists groups , otherwise your time will be wasted waiting and waiting. discover it yourself, on your feet!..... grab you selfie and enjoy discovering this part of the city....TIP: Don't trust anybody offering you any kind of service in this part of the city\u2026.. you don\u2019t need any help\u2026"

You will quickly find a restaurant or cafeteria to your taste and the area is also full of smaller shops where buying is easier than in the Grand Bazaar. The most interesting main sights, the two Mosques, Cistern Basilica and Topkapi palace are all close by. The tram will take you down to Galata andover to Karak\u00f6y when you need to see more."

All the sightseeing spots are in walkable distance. There are many mosques here, a Sultanahmet square right in the middle of the famous Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia church where you can feed the pigeons.

The Grand Bazaar is about 2 or 3 stops further down with the tram.however, the nice surprise were the side streets opposite the tram station, which were choc a bloc with nice little eating places, and even a couple of more elegant style restaurants, so we tried one and enjoyed the cleanliness and a tasty meal vegetable dish called Imam Bayaldi, with aubergines."

Sultanahmet is the typical muslin neighborhood that makes you imagine how would be the life of these people long time ago when the trading was heavily active and everything else wasn't just a tourist spot. Nowadays the area is 90% touristic I'd say. Everything is oriented to the tourism, but it wasn't like that few centuries ago and the remaining architecture and surroundings gives you a good idea on what was in the past. This is one of the mandatory spots to visit once in Istanbul."

Initially our tour group was in a beautiful hotel near the Taksim Square, but after the tour concluded, we moved to the Sultanahmet district. This is a very vibrant area of the city and our hotel was only minutes from the Basilica cistern, Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Aya Sophia and about a 10 minute walk to the Grand Bazaar. The hop/on - hop/off buses also depart by the tram stop adjacent to Hagia Sophia. There are many restaurants, all trying to get you to try their menus. We ate at six different ones in the week we were in Istanbul, all but one reasonably priced and met some nice folk at adjacent tables with whom we struck up a conversation. Admittedly staff on the streets tried to get us to buy carpets, leather etc. as we walked past, but usually we thanked them and continued walking. They usually tell you they have a cousin or relative living somewhere in Australia to start their conversation! A great area in which to stay and we would certainly stay in Sultanahmet should we have the opportunity to visit Istanbul in the future."

The tram system in Istanbul is very easy to navigate and can get you from here to Taksim Square in about 20 minutes and to the ferry for the Bosphorus Tours at Eminonu in about 10. I would recommend this as the area to stay in as a first time tourist to Istanbul"

I had stayed in Kadikoy on the Asian side for three days prior to all this, and would highly recommend a visit there for a rest after you have seen/shopped yourself to exhaustion in SA. Overall, SA is convenient for getting to the mosques/museums/bazaars, but dies down too quickly after 9 pm."

The Blue Mosque, AyaSofia, Topkapi Palace and Grand Bazaar (The furthest entrance is 2 stops away) are all here. The Bosphorus Ferries are 3 tram stops away. There's a wonderful Haman at Cemberlitas which is really Upper Sultanahmet. So if time is limited then this is where you want to stay for your first time in Istanbul. Having said that just remember that its pricy and why not they have a monopoly on the tourist zone. Try to go beyond for food at least a couple of times or every time if your on a budget. Much of the food seems quite middle of the road anyway. Just an example a Turkish tea is $1 street price but $4 or more in a cute cafe at Sultanahmet. But they are cute caf\u00e9s!"

We ate at some wonderful outdoor and roof top restaurants with great views.However, we became really annoyed by being pestered by carpet salesmen and restaurant waiters who constantly hassle tourists in the street asking them to visit their particular shop and restaurant. It meant that one could not even look into a shop window without being hassled and asked to visit that shop and buy a carpet.  I am sure that this happens everywhere in Turkey, as it is their way of doing business, but it did rather spoil our experience of walking around the streets."

From Topkapi to AyaSofya, the Blue Mosque, Basilica cistern, up to the Grand Bazaar and all points between, there are many happy hours to spend here. Unfortunately, the hustlers know this and ply their trade charmingly at first, with a number of tactics when rebuffed. There are, officially, more carpet shop owners in Istanbul than carpet shops. This is true of jewellery shop, cafes and any other type of shop in the city. Each appears to have a dozen people out hustling tourists, all of them 'own' the shop, obviously. Their most common tactic on being rebuffed is guilt 'I was only being friendly and offering you tea' - 'don't you want to make your wife happy?' - 'Sir, you can have the cheaper one, but I'm sure your wife deserves the better quality' and the famous line 'trust me, you will be happy with it' - just before whatever it is falls apart - in fact 'trust me' is a common signal that 'I'm about to let you down' . The Grand Bazaar is a great sight, but prices are based on the barter system that starts at about 5 times the value of the goods and a common tactic when you asked for a price is to ask 'how many units?' this makes you feel guilty, as you only want one or two, which reduces your desire to barter. If you start by asking the 'price each', then the answer to his question is, 'that depends on how competitive your price is'. He will ask for 'your price', having started at 4-5 times the value, then be offended if you offer a fair price - guilt is their main weapon. They will insult you, quite subtely, in the process - 'if you don't want to buy something nice, then we have this...' is another common phrase, admitting to selling 'not nice' things - it's a curious one but most people seem to miss it and say no, no, I want the good one - guilt is the main weapon!General rule, if you pay more than one third of the opening price, you've paid too much - you can't 'win' against them, it's only by how much you lose!I try to avoid the high-street cafes too, better, cheaper cafes are off the track a bit and service is variable. The best service is great, the rest is off-hand - it tends to reflect the quality of the food, so a recommend from your hotel can be a bonus - telling the cafe the hotel have recommended you and asked for your feedback may also help.Istanbul:- do it, but be aware of the common tricks"

It seems a bit superfluous to review the district (much like reviewing Times Square) since the many of Istanbul's iconic locations are concentrated here and probably why you came to this city in the first placenevertheless, a few quick tips from a first time visitor1. The hotels are really convenient if your goal is to hit all the historic spots, but not so much to get to other parts of the city, especially the Asian side. If you are planning to be in Istanbul for a few days, it may make sense to split your stay between the historic district and other neighborhoods2. The restaurants in and around the historic district are mostly mediocre and almost every one of them has a \"barker\" standing out hassling passers-by to look at their menu. This sometimes gets so aggressive that we noticed many folks walking in the middle of the road just to avoid them. Some restaurants actually tout their \"no hassle\" policy with large boards :-)3. The Arkestra bazaar (at least in our opinion) and the shops in that vicinity is a pretty good place to browse, haggle and buy things. It is far far better than the over-hyped Grand Bazaar4. Take the tram/funicular if you need to go past the historic sights. The ups & downs are pretty deceptive and you will suddenly be out of breath walking uphill"

Instead, take the Tram from Sultanahmet to the last stop: Kabatas. Get off, cross the street and pick up the funicular to Taksim Square. It's a snap. All in 15 minute or so. Then, from Taksim Square (which didn't really impress me, but it was raining) you can walk DOWN Istiklal Street. You will thank me you didn't walk UP this street.

Felt safe, secure.....perfect spot."

I avoided the very popular sites where cruise ships dumped off hundreds of people who stood in queues consuming time with me the solo traveler left to wait and wait. Instead I set out on foot to explore the Sultanahmet district. I spent a good hour sitting outside a carpet dealer's shop drinking tea with the owner an discussing the state of the world, family, and carpets. What an insight and joy to share our common experiences. I bought sweets in small shop, watched an older lady kindly feed the pidgeons, and viewed the city from the rooftop restaurant at Pierre Loti Hotel. A bowl of lentil soup was unforgettable. The best was the hookah cafe where the charcoal braziers heated the pipes and I drank yet more apple tea and watched the world go by. This experience taught me more about life in Istanbul than any museum ever could!"

If you have limited time, make your priorities and make every minute of your visit worthy. HOW TO GET TO SULTANAHMET DISTRICTIt is easy accessible by tram line T1 or metro line Zeytinburn - Kabata\u0161 /get off at Sultanahmet square stop/. A more beautiful option is drive by tourist buses get on&get off. They have stop in front of Blue mosque.WHAT TO VISITThe major attractions represent: Blue mosque /Sultanahmet mosque/, Haghia Sophia, Topkapi Palace and Basilica Cistern. These sights are located within walking distance. Only problem are long rows in front of these sights. The good idea is to plan one day for two major attractions. For example, only visit to Topkapi palace involves four hours at least. Also. long rows plus visit to each of other mentioned attractions involve a half day. Walking along narrow and winding streets of this area is really beautiful experience. Don't miss it! I came cross charming traditional Turkish houses beautifully painted in blue, green, red color. Also, walk along Soqukcesme street, that runs parallel to the walls of Topkapi palace and you will find the wooden houses, typical examples of Ottoman architecture. I would like to mention two beautifully decorated fountains worth your admiration - the first one is the Fountain of Ahmet III in rococo style with adorable tiles and valuable inscription in front of Topkapi palace and the second one is the Fountain of Emperor Wilhelm II with polished granite columns and gold mosaic dome in front of Blue mosque. TAKE A BREAKWhen you get tired, and when you are thirsty and hungry, it is time for break. There are stands with refreshment at Sultanahmet square. They offer traditional Turkish ice-cream, different kinds of fruit, freshly made natural juices of melon, carrot, lemon, orange, pomegranate. If you are in mood to have a break at table, don't miss cafes/restaurants located at top of the buildings in this area. You will be rewarded with an amazing view.PAY ATTENTION TO:Be ready to wait in long rows in front of attractions. Because of warm, even hot weather during summer days, bring with yourself a bottle of water, put a hat on your head, sun protection creme on your face, sun glasses on your nose and don't forget city map in your pocket.Enjoyable time guaranteed!"

Great place and easy to get to all important places from here. First thing we did was to exchange some US dollars to local currency. By the way the two local currency exchange offices are not the best ones, although they are better than airport. For a rate of 2.76, one was giving 2.56 and another one 2.60. I have seen places near Aksara and Grand bazaar that gave 2.66.After converting money, walked into a Turkish delight and pastry shop that is like downstairs. We got samples of some fruit flavored delights to take and munch on our bus tour. We then head to red bus hop on hop off tour. My husband did not want to get off anywhere yet, so we took the whole tour. It was a great first experience of the entire city. Commentary during the tour was awesome. Then we went to the same pastry store which also had delicious baklava. We tried some baklava and cappuccino there. Although the place looks very small from outside, it has very big seating area inside and very good customer service.We then walked by some stores in the area. Watched a lady make Gozleme, went to couple of souvenir stores and bought some. By the way, I have so far been to Arasta bazaar and Grand bazaar on my second and third days, but this place seemed to have good prices. We then got some dinner packed and head to hotel. Great experience and great energy in the area which made me go there every day and try different things. Walking distance from there to Blue mosque, Arasta bazaar, etc. There is also a Starbucks and Mcdonalds in this area."

It's even better if you base yourself here like we did which meant we just walked to the attractions and took a tram anywhere else. As for the restaurants, it's a buyers market with inflated prices to match just be careful with your choices.

Take in a key sight then lunch down a busy side street, afterwards walk through a bazaar have an ice cream/coffee stroll around and observe. Istanbul being centrally located attracts tourists from across the world and feels a true melting pot. Sultanahmet is the size of a large Disney park and totally for tourists. However it is steeped in history, more colourful with a greater variety of food and surprises. Main downside is constantly being approached by touts for boat trips, restaurants, carpet shops, guiding services etc which although done politely becomes a real drag having to fend off.I'm sure the area loses more tourists as a whole who get fed up off having to spend another day fending off 5-10 touts when all you wish for is a stroll through the area at your own relaxed pace"

So it came as almost a shock that during out trip ---first in Izmir district and then in Istanbul - we met only wonderful and warm people, going out of their way to explain, show, point toward, answer the question etc. Clean streets, unbelievable sales skills --- nice, polite, warm ( I know that I use this word a lot but how did it feel) and educational. The private guide that we had in Istanbul (Nesrin Ulupinar, Delightful Istanbul Tours) was very knowledgeable, very personal, open and helpful.

The Sultanahmet District is where you will find Haghia Sophia, the Blue Mosque and its amazing Arasta Bazaar (our favorite shopping in Istanbul), the Istanbul Crafts Center in an old caravansary, the outstanding Museum of Turkish and Islamic Art, the Hippodrome where the Romans raced their chariots circa AD 200, the Mosaic Museum, the Baths of Roxelana, the magically echoing and cavernous Roman Basilica Cistern of 1001 Columns Constantine's Column, the Church SS Sergius and Bachus, the Bucoleon Palace, the Skollu Mehmet Pasa Mosque, the Tomb of Sultan Mahmut II, the Marmara University Museum of the Republic, the Roman Obelisk, Firuz Aga Mosque, both the brazen and the Serpentine columns, the Fountain of Kaiser Wilheml II, and many other splendors, including some excellent restaurants. If you miss Sultanahmet, you have missed Istanbul.From Sultanahmet, the land slides down to the Sea of Marmara. The streets are full of traditional wooden Ottoman houses directly on top of the former Great Palace of the Byzantine Emperors. Rarely has an area been more historic, full of more stories, and more delightful to visit. Enjoy not only the obligatory mosques, museums, and squares, but stop to enjoy yourself with fresh squeezed fruit juices in the local cafes and coffee houses. At the cafes around the blue mosque, you can see Whirling Dervishes dance daily, as well as hear live traditional music. At the Arasta Bazaar, housed in the old stables of the Blue Mosque, you can find some of the best shopping in Istanbul. Enjoy yourself. You can also pick up an inexpensive several hour boat tour of the Sear of Marmara and the Golden Horn from the street tour guides in this area."

Only one warning - apart from the usual gypsy kids hassling you for money - don't fall for the taxi line that there's a political rally and so much traffic that your usual taxi fare of 20TL has risen to 170 or 100 TL. Insist on the meter and tell them it's only 25TL of whatever your usual fare is. They'll object but just hold firm, insist you'll get another taxi and they'll soon realise you're onto their scam.

The tram is ideal and cheap way of travel, if staying outside the district and has stops near the Blue Mosque. Have a good map and walking shoes as Sultanahmet has excellent Turkish Restaurants/eateries, accommodation and there is always a McDonalds for coffee and toilets if stuck, but do your research. What to see, well just look around as the standouts are the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia Museum, Topkapi Palace and Basilica Cistern. When walking to the Blue Mosque view the Egyptian Obelisk when walking through the flat Hippodrome, outside the north western entrance to the Blue Mosque. Outside there is always someone just waiting to take advantage of the unwary tourist, should they want a taxi, turkish carpet or a guide and I suppose it is part of the experience, but be courteous and continue walking. Just on the north western edge of the district is the Grand Bazaar (have a map and know your entrance No.) and Spice Bazaar Just enjoy the experience and venture down streets, though it will not suit everyone. Take your camera, especially when visiting in April for the stunning tulips gardens on display."

Some of the restaurants are so competitive they do anything to get you into their place such as offer you 20% discount, free desserts, free bottle of wine, etc...

I found that the main tourist attractions are situated here: One can easily access The Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace and The Bazaars and Market places. Turkey is full of tourists and there are constantly people trying to sell you things. One has to learn to be firm to say NO. I found that it was much better to walk from the Egyptian spice bazaar through the back routes which leads to the main attractions. If visiting the attractions in the Sultanahmet region then best go early as the crowds turn into hoards and hoards of people. Most tourist attractions close at 4pm so get there early or you will miss out. My personal favourite is Topkapi Palace which needs a whole day to visit and don't miss The Harem section. Also The Basillica is not to be missed. All these places are within walking distance of each other. There are also alot of exciting restaurants and an exclusive Turkish Hamam which must be experienced. If travelling out of Sultanahmet to Taksim then the cheapest way is the tram and the funicular which only cost 4Lira per trip. One can also take the Big Bus which has two routes, via the Asian side and the other via the European side. The Turkish Delight and Baklava is like nothing you have ever tasted."

It holds the big ones - Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Topkapi Palace and the Basilica Cistern all in an area around the Hippodrome which has several attractions either in it or adjacent to it.As such you'll be spending a fair bit of time here and my best advice is to get yourself a cheap, clean hotel in this area. Don't fret over the amenities of your hotel, you'll only be there for sleeping anyway. The area has a mountain of places you can eat, tourist tat on sale and alas annoying - and sometimes aggressive - carpet touts. The latter can be a real nuisance.Those issues aside the area is well kept, patrolled by tourist police and is quite civilised. Some of the winding narrow streets are a pain as you can easily get disorientated in them but it's not that big an area and you'll get your bearings quickly enough.There is actually little point in recommending this area of Istanbul. Quite simply if you don't go here you didn't go to Istanbul."

You either have to stay in the European side also known as Taksim or the Muslim side, Sultanahmet if you want to be close to the action. Sultanahmet is beautiful, easy to get around, on a hill so a good work out! Lots of cute smaller hotels to choose from but it is sooooo expensive! Also in general cab drivers in Istanbul are scam artists. EVERYONE knows this. They pretent like they don't know the address and drive around and then charge you an unfair price. Also they charge depending on traffic. I paid 15 turkish $ to come back to Sultanahmet from Taksim at night and 50 turkish money to go to Taksim when there was traffic. So, it pays off to stay somewhere that you can walk to everything. If you can't travel to other countries like Americans, I can understand why you would go to Istanbul, no visa needed. But if you are an American and you can go anywhere in the world, don't go to Istanbul. It's a total tourist town. I guess I just don't really like places that have lost all of their authenticity because the people there have to rely of tourist money to make a living."

Get a map or just follow your instincts and you will see many wonders. Just walking around the Hippodrome and looking at the columns is special in its self. Lots of tourists but also many local people make people watching fun. A little bit off from the main run is the Arasta Bazaar, well worth a visit with many little quirky shops (no alcohol though).Take the time to walk around Sultanahemt and you will be well rewarded."

Use local transport, shop at one of the many local markets and you'll be fine. But a word of warning re. local markets - they know a tourist when they see one. Most traders were brilliant though and I paid local prices. Check opening times for the big attractions. Often seasonal variations and renovation works mean that the guidebooks can be out of date really quickly. If you're into Museums and monuments etc - definitely recommend the tourist card. But big savings only if you actually visit all the places it gives you access to."

Be aware that everything you might buy in this district has much higher price than other districts!After visiting all around there,You should eat the Turkish traditional Ice cream!Unfortunatly I missed the Ice cream!"

This is where you will find the cistern, the Hagia Sofia, the Blue Mosque, a tram stop, Topkapi, lots of carts selling delicious simits (1 TL each, 2 TL with Nutella inside - heaven!) and roasted corn and chestnuts in season. Plenty of police presence keeps (most of ) the begging children away, but you will have lots of opportunities to practice ignoring the very friendly young men who are not selling anything but you do look like you want to buy a rug. Take some time to just sit and enjoy your simit while watching the crowds."

Beautiful mosques, great restaurants, palaces, museums, Egyptian Obelisks, Roman remains trams, the bazaars, beautiful squares, bustling shops and friendly people - all within easy walking distance of each other. Best to stay in this area in one of the many cheap hotels. We went in March/April. Take layers of clothing. We got sun burned on Wednesday, drenched in torrential rain on Tuesday and chilled by the wind on Thursday. Coat on and off, umbrella up and down - be prepared for all. Take comfy shoes and a head scarf if visiting the many mosques. The restaurants sell traditional Turkish food in this area and not all serve alcohol. This is a fairly conservative area of the city and there is not an abundance of bars, although you should find enough to keep you amused. There are several places to change money and they offer a good rate of exchange. Go to one of the many cafes selling the filled 'pancake' style creations you will see the women rolling out in the windows. Several just past the Roman Cistern - carry on down the hill towards the park and look on the right hand side. Delicious!"

We were impressed that in most parts of Istanbul the shopkeepers are not too intrusive or badgering. Start from the bridge and walk up the street of spices. Enter the Grandbazaar from the north after wandering through a maze of narrow passages of spice, sweetmeats, fabric and jewellery shops. Expect that any taxi or buss will want to drop you well away from the centre of the area as the traffic is so bad and we were tthere at the end of March. What it must be like in mid season in June/July I read to think. So walk! At least from the edge of the area. But so much to see and not just those monuments mentioned above. There are hundreds of mosques, the Hippodrome, old churches, bazaars, shops, the old waterstorages and much more."

We found that some of the shops outside of the Grand Bazaar were sometimes less expensive.

Usually I take them to Hafiz Mustafa for tea and baklava (and relatively clean restrooms). I make sure they go to the Aya Sofia and the Blue Mosque. If they have time, they check out the Basilica Cistern, too. It is relatively easy to reach by the Ataturk Airport. A taxi would cost about 50 TL (currently about $20 and it may take 25 minutes if there is not too much traffic) or one can take the metro to Zeytinburnu and then transfer to the Tram (about 8TL per person and about 60 minutes).Allow an hour to take the taxi back to the airport, unless it's rush hour, then you've made a big mistake :)"

Make sure to try Turkish Delights. There are so many flavors to pick from. Many of the stores will let you sample the flavors before you buy to make sure you like the taste. In the evening, pick a restaurant and sit outdoors. You will be able to hear the Call to Prayer, which is something I will never forget. If shopping is something you enjoy, make sure to buy some beautiful scarves. You can haggle with the store owners for lower prices. I will be definitely coming back to this area during my next visit. I felt very safe, and everyone was really friendly."

After that see Topkapi palace then if you've got any energy left the hippodrome or mosaic museum. If not, you have no reason to stay here. You've seen it all. As delightful as it may have been, better evenings await you. The evening brings all of the usual trappings of an area based entirely on tourism: overpriced restaurants, beggars (usually with heartbreakingly Young babies exposed to the elements), touts touts and more touts - if it needs promoting like this then I don't need to go there - rip off taxis who won't take you anywhere local (and cheap) and all sorts of vendors, promotors and tradesmen all trying to separate you from your money. Don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed the history, the architecture, the culture and the fusion of East and west. What I don't like is being ripped off. I could compare it to the west end of london or any other metropolis in this respect, BUT this is not the centre of the city. My biggest issue with the old town is the lack of reinvestment. I am aware of a number of refurbishment works underway but outside of the actual Sultanahmet square where all is neat and tidy, the side road pavements are at times impassable due to the poor condition of the pavements, the bags of rubbish piled up, the encroaching shop fronts or the presence of touts or street vendors. To walk in the road in the face of badly driven traffic (specifically the taxis) is to look the reaper in the eye, so not an option to be taken lightly! It's not just that but to walk to the grand bazaar over irregular pavements littered with pot holes, protruding LETHAL metalwork, sacks of cat infested garbage and NO street lighting in the pitch black, snowing, January skies left us bruised, hobbling, tired and pissed off. When we got there is was far from worth the misadventure. Again - don't get me wrong! The sites here and the treasures contained within are beyond compare. See them. Enjoy them. Don't stray off the beaten track and then go somewhere more conducive to a great evening, like the new town!There are a few bars dotted around but they are more cafe style bistros. We ventured around a few behind the palace area but most were empty or closed. One we ventured into was very welcoming but within five minutes the owner was trying to coerce us into taking tours, boat trips (-9 in a gale) or shopping excursions. This proved to be a theme with the businesses in this area and while I do not knock someone for being enterprising in a tourist trap I do resent being held to ransom in bars, shops and restaurants a la captive audience while waiting for the sales pitch to be exhausted before finally being presented with my bill. I have not experience repeat occurrences of this kind in any other City. The best thing about the attractions here are the proximity of each to it's neighbour. You can walk out of one and trip over the next. You may be accosted by sherbet vendors in between but they really are a hop skip and a jump away from each other. For nightlife, head north to the new town (not too far north, just over the bridge and you'll be in the right area: Beyo\u011flu, but Taksim is also good). You could spend all night stumbling from one bar to the next, but as there are so many up and coming trendy new bars worth exploring, we busied ourselves drinking in these. They are slightly harder to locate but all well worth a visit. To sum up, a great area for sightseeing but our priority was nightlife, so a mistake on my part staying in this area on the recommendation from a resident friend. Enjoy!"

Don't get annoyed, just laugh and keep on walking. Laughing always works, for both of you.Here's another thing I love. Those back street outdoor restaurants, pick any one, it doesn't matter because the food is all pretty much the same, good enough and not that expensive. This trip I sat down near an intelligent,friendly,couple from the Nederlands. We talked and talked, exchanging book and movie recommendations, and ideas. Sitting outdoors drinking and talking with new friends in the gentle Istanbul breeze, does it get any better? Yeah, it does. We continue to think of new movies and book and so we email often.Overpriced hotels, of course. Try a hostel, not just for youth anymore( I'm a 65 +female solo traveler)This trip I stayed at \"Antique Hotel and Guesthouse\", $20 or $25, 4 bed room with a clear view of the Mamara, breakfast included. Quiet and clean. Take a chance.Don't only stay in Sultanahmet explore the whole city, bypass the taxi drivers, and take the public transportation, keep your money on your body, and do not wear a fanny pack, even on the front, it marks you as an inexperienced traveler. And please don't wear your best, or even any jewelry! Take the ferries back and forth on a hot summer's day and catch the breezes, like the locals do. This is Istanbul, it is beautiful, fun and an adventure. take it.And even though it is the most touristy place of Istanbul, it is also the power spot, those Ottomans knew a few things, the Topkapi, the Ayasofya, the Blue Mosque, how much history can you take in one small spot?"

We stayed in a hotel in the district, of which there are many to choose, then just took off on foot to see the sites.

Here are concentrated all the main monuments of the city: Aya Sofia, Topkapi, Blue Mosque, Hippodrome Cisterna and both Grand Bazar and The Bazar of Spices. This thing makes the area very very touristic so my advice is to avoid this place for lunch or dinner because there are other areas where you can find typical Turkish foods better and cheaper. Anyway about the neighbourhood it is easy to reach from the North part of Istanbul (Beyoglu) thanks to a tram (N1) that goes from Taksim to Sultanhamnet. The cost of each ticket is 2 TRY. I think that it is not necessary to buy a pass becasue this city needs to be explored by walking to understand the real Istanbul. From Sultanahmet you can arrive also in the West area Fener and Balat of Istanbul on foot or by bus. This area especially during and after the sunset becomes amazing thanks to all the different lights that comes from all the monuments that are there. My advise is explore explore and explore this area. All the little streets you could have a big surprice. Have fun!!"

Most of the places of lodging may not be a fancy as in other parts of the city but no where else to you have such ready access to the great sites that we really cared about. To experience Istanbul you have to walk it and there is not better district to walk then Saltanahmet. Be warned that there are hills. Taking taxis are not really easy in these narrow roads although possible and they are plentiful. The famous mosques, Grand Bazaar, Hagia Sophia, are all within this area. Most people who deal with tourists speak a little of several different languages, especially English so if English is a language of yours you can get along fairly well. If you do not visit the Sultanahet District I don't know how you will really see Istanbul."

Sultanahmet is essentially the \"old town\" of Istanbul, and is characterised primarily by the glittering domes and minarets of the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque, with an abundance of other places of interest in between. The whole area is breathtakingly beautiful. The stunning Hagia Sophia and equally attractive Blue Mosque mirror one another, and are linked by a lovely park adorned with pink flowers in summer and a large fountain. The park is bordered by the historic Ayasofya Hurem Sultan Hamam - originally built by a sultan for his favourite wife, Roxelana and now converted into a luxurious Turkish bath (highly recommended!). In front of the Blue Mosque are the remains of the hippodrome featuring the column of Constantine, the serpent column, the obelisk of Theodosius and the German fountain. Also in the Sultanahmet area you will find the Topkapi Palace and Basilica Cistern - both of which should be high on your list of places to visit.The Grand Bazaar is a short walk away, with the Egyptian Spice Market a little further away (take a tram here, it's a bit too far to walk). You'll also encounter several other mosques, Turkish baths, shops, cafes, restaurants and bars. It's always buzzing, but is especially beautiful at night when the monuments are illuminated and the call to prayer rings out from the various mosques in the area. As most of the sights are here in Sultanahmet, I would recommend booking a hotel in this area. There are plenty to choose from, to suit all budgets and tastes from backpackers to luxury hotels. But there is no point staying elsewhere in Istanbul, since Sultanahmet is where all the action is."

Where are you from?\" If you respond, expect to have a new friend, who will walk with you for a while, trying to get you into his shop, which usually specializes in rugs. A new tactic was used on us during our most recent visit when a man said, \"Come into my shop so I can rip you off.\" We had to laugh, but we generally ignore these guys.The area is easily accessible by tram, so there is no problem getting here from other parts of the city. But we usually stay in Sultanahmet during our visits to Istanbul. That allows us to walk around not only during the day but at night when the tourists and tour buses are long gone. It is a special treat to have the place mostly to ourselves and it is absolutely safe.There are many nice hotels and B&Bs here. This time, we stayed in the Esans Hotel, a renovated Ottoman mansion with eight rooms, just a 5-minute walk from Topkapi Palace. It was wonderful lodging with incredibly helpful staff.The Sultanahmet District is certainly a \"must see\" for first-time visitors, and it remains a draw for many who have been here before."

If you stay in this area, it is touristy enough for you to be touted everytime you walk past a restaurant, but none of them have proven offensive, so don't be afraid. Just say no thanks, if you don't want to enter. 95% of the people we meet are generally amicable and honest, some even endearing, but there are some restaurants that may try to fudge your bill at the end, adding an extra dish hoping that you will not notice. Or send you dishes you did not order, feigning miscommunication if you call it out. Just be firm when you are ordering, ask them to repeat your order. We encountered this cases only in restaurants, both of them selling fish which are seasonal prices and hence easy to fudge.Restaurants near the attractions costs twice as much as those away from it. You can get pretty good food for 20 lira per person, large portions. Those near attractions or good hotels tend to have routers and cost more, including tips. Do not be afraid to venture out of the immediate area for cheaper and good food! Istanbul is very safe, from our 9 days here.For attractions start the day early, like at 8 or 9' and you will be able to avoid the crowd that usually comes at about 10. Or you can visit during off peak season, the winter months, but not during Christmas, year end period. Use the tramvay to get to most places, it only costs 4 lira per trip, no matter the distance. No need to tap out when you leave the station. Istanbulkart gets you a discount to 1 or 2 lira per trip, but you can't get the card at every station. God bless and enjoy!"

All of the historic landmarks and attractions (Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, etc) are all located here. The streets are kept clean and all business here caters to travelers from carpet stores to restaurants. We stayed in a hotel one block away from the Blue Mosque and walked to everything we wanted to see. The Grand Bazaar was a ten minute walk away while the Egyptian Market was only twenty minutes away. We also had a wonderful view of the Sea of Marmara from our hotel. My only complaint is that sidewalk salesman, who stand outside their business courting you, are very good at what they do. They are extremely good on using Western \"niceness\" to their advantage. If you are not interested in a carpet, say \"no thanks\" and move on; otherwise, you can spend a significant amount of time having tea in establishments you had no desire to visit in the first place."

The overall feel of the area, sadly, is a theme park version of Turkey during the Ottoman period. If you are looking to experience the 'real' Istanbul, rather than ticking off a checklist of famous tourist attractions, I would travel further afield. Most of the shops and facilities in the area are selling to tourists, e.g. souvenir shops, 'real Turkish baths', bubble pipe cafes, belly dancing, kebab restaurants, blokes selling carpets, etc. etc. There is also, as others have reported, a lot of touting and street selling - not all of it by humans. Yes, even the famous stray dogs and cats of Istanbul also have their own begging pitches (if you're a dog lover, you can watch them moving 'pitch' as the attractions open and shut).Modern Istanbul is predominantly across the river in Beyoglu. We found better souvenirs around the Galata Tower. If you want to shop for brands then the area south of Taksim Square is also excellent. There are also fascinating, but less touristy, sights in the new part of the city such as the military museum - which is huge - and the Galata Tower, which has amazing views of the Golden Horn. And, yep, you won't get bothered by one tout or carpet seller..."

Peaceful, ancient and serenely quiet, enjoy your time in pure silence...Venture around west to see the curvature of the old Hippodrome, where you can still see the elegant arches, masterfully crafted standing in time, and a few filled with bricks. Imagine this was the south curve of the hippodrome where, if inside, thousands cheered while chariots, horses, or gladiators and took hairpin chances for glory around the stellae.Having this small part of Byzantium, where you can create your own story, staring so closely, without recognition, is one of the true wonders of ancient Constantinople."

Most of Istanbul's \"must see\" sites are centrally located within the easily walkable district allowing you to accomplish much in a short time. With advanced tickets, you can see the Basilica Cistern, the Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, and Topkapi Palace in a day. Depending on crowds and seasonal hours, you might even be able to squeeze in the Grand Bazaar. Sultanahmet is clean and felt quite safe to walk at night as a solo female. Other popular neighborhoods like Eminonu and Sirkeci are easily accessible by tram."

The Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Topkapi Palace are all within a short distance of one another.From previous reviews you might get the impression that this is a vipers nest of thieves and cutthroats and I'm sure there are some. However, by simply being sensible and taking the kind of precautions which all tourists in a large multicultural city should take you won't have any problems. The Police are very visible in this area so just keep your eyes open and don't be naive.Small cafes in the streets close by the Hagia Sophia can provide a tasty lunch if that's what you're looking for. They serve the locals so are usually very good value and quality. Larger restaurants on the hill alongside the Hagia which follow the tram line are also in general good value but beware of them pushing \"extras\" onto you while you wait for your ordered meal. This will usually be a tray of little plates and dishes containing starters. If you don't want any just say so, they won't be offended. Service at slack times is very good but can suffer when they get busy - don't get stressed just enjoy a more relaxed way of dining!This area is close enough to the ferry terminals to walk to, as long as you are mobile, so don't be pushed into taking a taxi. If you don't walk you will miss all of the lovely little shops and cafes I've mentioned."

Friendly hospitality staff, catering to many tourists. Obviously I AM a tourist (and speak virtually no Turkish). I spend several nights in this area and also several near Taxsim Sq over on the Modern District. Personally, I preferred the Modern District, as it seemed more authentic... less \"hello Lady, come look at our menu\"s, and more everyday Turks and international tourists just bustling along the energy of Iskital Street. And a lot less American music in restaurants. The Flower Passage and other small shopping alleys tucked off the main drag are great. Most speak some, or fluent, English. Just exotic enough for a first timer like myself. With an open attitude, Istanbul seems like a city you can just plant yourself in and become part of the scene. However, Sultanahamet is an area I think everyone should see while in Turkey!"

The shops, the food and the historical sites are wonderful but there is a darker side to it too. If you are an animal lover be warned that there are literally thousands of stray cats that live in this area and sometimes it can be very hard to see. They can be dirty, starving and some have broken bones or are missing eyes. The city is working to control the stray dog population but they have done nothing about the cats. The people tolerate them and some of them even feed them and leave out water but these cats are starved for affection and will literally jump into your arms if you offer to pet them. We stayed in Sultanahmet for 9 days and fed strays every day we were there. I couldn't get over how friendly the cats were. I was never bitten once! Of course you have to respect them if they don't want to be touched but 90% of the time they wanted food and love. Of course you must wash you hands after every time. I bought a package of wet hand wipes and kept in it my purse.Another thing is that there are beggars from Syria who use their children to beg for money. The Turkish people we asked told us that most of the Syrian refugees don't beg but that a small minority would rather make their money from tourists than to work. It's just had to see the children bare foot and so dirty.The last thing is that in the Sultanahmet district there are hundreds of shop and restaurant owners just waiting outside their businesses trying to get you to come in and spend money. The constant harassment can be very wearing and quite frankly it was the worst part of our trip. Brace yourself because no matter what excuse you give for not coming in they have an answer to counter it. Just say no or ignore them completely and just keep walking. Otherwise you'll never make it down the street.I hope this info helps to give you a better idea of what to expect when you're down there."

They approach you, ask where you come from (say Istanbul!), look genuinely thrilled to meet you as they have a best friend/ex-wife/daughter who lives in a named city in your country and converse in a very convivial way...the next thing you know you are in a shop with VERY hard sell.

Always polite, they moved on when we made it clear we weren't in the market.Also, shop around for the tours! Hop on and off bus tours are expensive and not that well organized.

The mosques are spectacular, the shopping is terrific, Topkapi Palace is one of the most beautiful palaces you will ever see, the food is great and the Turkish people are wonderful. My wife and I had a private guide from Meli-Tours (highly recommended if you are willing to splurge a bit), which added so much to our explorations of Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome. Our guide, Tan, even helped us know which shops in the Grand Bazaar had authentic Turkish goods rather than cheap knock-offs, while we shopped for family and friends back home. The only complaint with Sultanahmet is that it tends to be quieter at night than the more modern part of the city and be prepared for very bad traffic when going to and from the airport to your hotel. It is easy to get around this district on foot to see the attractions and we also found it very easy to use the tram system to get back and forth to the newer side of the city."

Endless shops, little streets, restaurants and coffee shops. Safe at night. Photo opportunities also abound.The Tram and Sultanahmet Station were close at hand and the trams were very reliable (albeit crowded). Get hold of a Tram Route Map and be sure to buy enough tokens. Also be aware of where to disembark and to change trams.of course, the Grand Bazaar is an attraction. Be prepared for crowds, noise and learn to haggle - otherwise you will be ripped off. You will get lost in the bazaar so just take note of the number of your first entrance and work your way back there. The locals are very helpful and do not be afraid to ask.One can also break out from the Sultanahmet and take the tram across the water or get on the Sehir Hatlari Bosphorus Cruise.We focused on the walking, shopping, eating and photographs. Conventional site seeing opportunities are many. (buy lots of Turkish delight and other sweet things !!)"

All well worth a visit but be prepared for long queues though you seem to be abale to queue jump officially by buying the services of a tour guide who all seem to have a stash of tickets on their person! We engaged a very nice guy at the Topkapi for 120TL plus the normal entry ticket price per person of 30TL plus 10TL for entry to the Harem. This gives you an hour and a half of his/her time which is plenty to see the Harem, The treasury and the main buildings. They then point you in derction of the other areas worth seeing. We thought this a great deal."

I would not have wanted to stay anywhere else. It was so nice to have our hotel located just a few minutes' walk from so many of the major attractions of Istanbul, including the iconic Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque which dominate the skyline. There are thousands of years of history in this part of the city. It is also easy to take a tram or a ferry to other parts of the city. The one significant detraction was the number of hawkers blocking our way or interupting our walk in an attempt to get us to buy a carpet, a city bus tour, a cruise on the Bosphorus, a city guide, a meal in a restaurant, etc. If we stopped to engage in conversation with every \"friendly\" Turkish merchant we would never have got anywhere in our sightseeing. We certainly felt harrassed at times, but we would smile, say \"no\" in Turkish, and keep walking. At times I wanted to take a peek inside a store or have a look at a restaurant menu. But I kept on going, knowing that it would be even harder to get away, if I stopped to look at the goods and decided not to buy. Otherwise, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Sultanahmet district."

Most of the area is made up of very old low buildings lining very narrow one lane winding streets running up the hill. There may be more big hotels than appeared to be because they mostly blend in with the general architecture. The elegant Shura Design towards the top of the hillside was a good choice. The streets are not marked one-way so many times a line of cars was backing up the hill to make way for others coming from below. The distance between the Blue Mosque, Aya Sophia, the cistern and Topkapi with the Sultan's harem next to it down by the main street and the Great Bazaar above (interesting mostly because of its historical context, otherwise hundreds of shops selling mostly the same items. If you are a poor haggler like me you will end up paying way too much for everything) can easily be covered on foot in 20 or 30 minutes. There are lots of shops and restaurants all around and a number of interesting spice bazaars along the narrow back streets. A few miles down below the view of countless ships lined up to go through the Strait of Bosporus is fascinating.An amazing sight to see - a little girl kneeling on the sidewalk late one evening playing some kind of flute for money. I assume that the parents were in one of the shops across the wide main street but there were few cars or pedestrians around so it looked like a very unsafe situation.Watch out for the street kids and be careful where you give money to anyone. Late one evening I walked across a wide empty square and gave a dollar to two young boys. They immediately ran to tell others and quickly I was surrounded by maybe 20 6 to low teens boys. There probably would not have been any violence but then again you never know. I had difficulty moving along and one small boy had his hand on my front pocket where I had my wallet. I kept yelling 'NO' and finally got to the edge of the square where a man sitting on the sidewalk shooed them away.I also would not go with any of the hustlers on the main square. One tried to get me to go with him to his family's store. I said I could not buy rugs or whatever they were selling but he insisted that I should just 'accept their hospitality', tea or coffee. I did not want to find out what would happen if I went and did not want to buy anything. He followed me a good 10 minutes on Topkapi square and finally I got away by saying I needed to get batteries from my hotel.I had a most fascinating experience at 9 one evening listening to the call to prayer from Sophia Mosque. After a while the call ended and then another started from a small mosque somewhere behind me and the two continued this call-and-response for some time. Overall a very interesting place to see. And the main street has a number of travel agencies where you can book any number of day tours or longer to other areas of this part of the country."

The area is ideal to be in walking distance from the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace and a handful of other Istanbul must-sees - but don't be surprised or overwhelmed by the fact that this has led to the neighborhood catering almost exclusively to the tourist population. You will not see the \"real Istanbul\" here - but what do you expect in an area holding so many Byzantine and Ottoman treasures? Any city in the world with such amazing history to offer develops a similar area to cater to the visitors they receive each year. I had a great stay here, however felt more at home in other parts of the city. You're a tourist, enjoy the touring!"

We stayed just a short walk down the street at the Perula Hotel so this area was right at our doorstep. Once we left our hotel, within 2-3 minutes we were at the Hippodrome with the Constantine Column, the Serpent Column & the Egyptian Obelisk of Thutmose III & German Fountain (Fountain of Kaiser Wilhelm II); the Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmed Mosque); AyaSofya (Hagia Sofia); Baths of Roxelana; Basilica Cistern (with the 2 faces of Medusa); Arasta Bazaar; Topkapi Palace; various restaurants/cafes/food vendors--roasted chestnuts/roasted corn/fresh , shopping stores/vendors, public transport (tram/ferries/subway). The entire 'district' is close-knit so it is easy to walk from one attraction to the next. While there is no fee for the district as a whole, there are fees for the individual attractions. For example, the Basillica Cistern costs 20TL (Turkish Lira), the Ayasofya is 30TL & the Topkapi Palace is 30TL. I have fotos but I will post them on the individual attractions. Oh, and if the weather calls for rain, make sure you buy an umbrella (usually there will be street vendors selling them in the rain if you get caught without) because when it does rain, IT RAINS. Have a great time....we did! :D"

Its just that it wasn't what I expected and I've visited many places.The local attractions are definitely worth a visit, the Blue Mosque looks almost ethereal in the day light but inside it is quite disappointing, there isn't a great deal to see inside other than stained glass and expanse of red carpet and lots of lighting so it is a short stop off after a long queue. The Hagia Sophia and the Hippodrome and palaces are all worth a visit but I didn't find them as inspiring as the past dictates and I love history and architecture.Istanbul to me is definitely worth a visit and the Sultanahmet district is crammed full of great places to eat and drink and there is plenty to do but Istanbul has a pretty grey landscape there is block paving everywhere and I have to say that although the bazaars, shops, restaurants and attractions are worth a visit.Istanbul has lost its Turkishness, its that simple, its now ultra European (which I know is what it is) but it is almost cosmopolitan. I wanted dusty streets and an edgy atmosphere like Marrakech but again as I said before this could all be more about me."

There are many good sights (including 4 losts of cisterns) within a few minutes' walk, and more a bit further in on the Eminonu peninsula if you're prepared to walk up to half and hour or so. For example, Chora museum, Sultaniye Mosque, New Mosque, Grand Bazaar... There are plenty of hotels to choose from in Sultanahmet, and places to eat. You pay a bit more for food here, but it's not too bad, and they are better geared up to tourists with their dietary needs than most places are. You'll also have lots of people trying to sell you carpets etc., but you don't have to buy them! They can be persistent, but just relax and ignore them or banter with them - it usually works.One could happily spend a few days here. If you really use your time well and pack in the sights a bit, you can see a lot in a couple of days."

Istanbul, Turkey, may not be the most beautiful city in the world, but it is definitely one of the most exotic ones. after years of dreaming about it, we just made our first visit to Turkey, to Istanbul, in mid September 2014. it is the best time of the year to visit, the weather was just perfect, sunny and pleasant every day, except for one rainy day during our nine days stay, to start with, we made our reservations for a nice, spacious apartment instead of a hotel room, X Flats Gumussuyu is located near Taksim Square and Dolmabacha palace. it is a great location with easy access to transportation. the city offers a great mix of old and new, east and west, modern and historical, sites. all sites share some common qualities, they are simply beautiful, charming and exotic. the beautiful hills combined with the Bosphorus and the sea of Marmara add the blue water and space for some of the most beautiful, colorful scenery. ferry boats use the water ways to travel to amazing spots like Prince's Island and Ortakay. the narrow hilly streets near the Galata tower with all the art stores and restaurants, are more charming than similar places in Paris and New York. the old town is filled with old monuments, bazaars and museums , one can smell history in the air, the sound of the call for prayer adds the sound effects for one to be lost in time. did I mention the Turkish people, they are simply beautiful, all young ladies and young men around could be models or beauty queens anywhere else in the world. and food, every restaurant offers a great selection, Turkish cuisine is just delicious, and prices are very reasonable too. I have always enjoyed getting myself lost in a new city which I have never seen before, discovering the virgin beauty of Istanbul was an unforgettable experience, now I am in love, cheers."

The cafes are also very aggressive in trying to get you inside. With that said, it is place you have to see. We were in Istanbul for 10 days and we kept going back to this area. If you want a great lunch away from the madness and crowds, check out the Kilari cafe across the street from the Basilica Cistern (a must see). Amazing food and relaxing atmosphere.

No need to describe their obvious attractions and importance. But word of warning: if you travel at peak season (July and August) arrive early to avoid the bus crowds and have a museum card purchased through a travel agent or at a kiosk in the main aquare in advance. This lets you in to most museum sites ahead of the line. Take a lunch break at the lovely outdoor cafeteria within Topkapi Palace museum overlooking the Bosphorus, and return to finish your tour of the building in mid late afternoon when crowds disperse. The extensive park within the walls and outside allow for rest on the grass. At night, Sultanahmet affords lovely walks around the flood lit monuments with minimal crowds. Many of the local restaurants have roof top dining facing the Blue Mosque."

And then you take out our map and discover that there is a mind-blowing amount of historical areas in this region!The best way to appreciate Sultanahmet in my opinion is to dedicate one day for a single attraction. Then use the rest of the day to walk around in town and imbibe the culture of Istanbul and its people. And remember to thoroughly appreciate the food, as it is amazing! I agree that some merchants and their overly persistent nagging might cause a bit of displeasure, but the beauty and magnificence of this place more than makes up for it. Frankly, I found that the people here are generally friendly and helpful. But I would not advice going out alone late at night.Start your visit early to avoid the crazy long waiting lines at the historic sites. And make sure to take your time."

Sutanahmet has an amazing collection of historical sites -- the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the Cistern, the Grand Bazaar, among others, and all within walking distance. The only thing we found increasingly annoying was the aggressiveness of the rug store salesmen -- they approach you on the street with polite greetings (\"oh, where are you from\"; \"how do you like Istanbul\") that instinct compels you to be polite in response. But then it becomes a sales pitch to come and just look in his strore. And the aggressiveness may last a block or more and he won't stop even when you say \"no\". So be prepared and learn your own way to wave them off or ignore them."

Some hotels give you a card which you can top up at the machine at the station and use for your journeys. It is very cheap. Have Turkish Lira ready for all purcahses. you will save money. Do not use Euros. You will be ripped off.4.Amazing food choices available. Do try as many places and be more adventurous .5.All sweet shops and ice cream/dessert shops in plenty along the main road footpath. Absolute heaven! Loved them.6.Turkish fruit tea like Apple tea etc tastes a lot better than normal tea at an average of 3 TL per cup.7.Do try the bottled AYRAN (buttermilk) after every meal. It\u2019s delicious and settles the tummy and costs just a couple of TLs.8.Turista is a great travel agency who can do all your bookings for sight seeing in Turkey at great rates, which again are negotiable. Dont feel shy asking them for a discount. There are many other equally good agencies and most are friendly. We used Turista.9. Grand Bazaar is about 10-15 min walk away in a different direction Ask the guys at the hotel before every venture, most of them will guide you very well.10.We found the back streets near the hotel to have much better priced items than Grand Bazaar.11.Spice bazaar could be a waste of time and the spices could be rubbish, but if you have nothing to do, please do visit.Very interesting place and colourful12.There is another market called Araasta bazaar behind Blue Mosque which we had no time to go to.13.Most attractions are 5-10 min walk away.(Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern etc) from most hotels in Sultanahmet. that is the beauty of Sultanahmet. You are in the heart of the activity and never more than a 10-15 min walk to anywhere of interest.14.Catch a tram to the Eminomu stop (3 stops away) and walk 5 min to the water front ferry station to catch a ferry to do a Bosporus River cruise. Just go by ordinary ferry, it costs about 5 TL return and many options available. Go in the evening just as it is about to get dark, to take advantage of the lights on return and enjoy the beauty. The actual cruise of 3 hrs or so costs between 10 for basic to 50 Euros for the fully loaded cruise each but may not really be worth it, especially if you are hard up for time like we were.. If you go in the afternoon, you might do the European and Asian quarter on the other side of Gallatta Bridge too. Taksim is another interesting place to visit..15.Hard Rock caf\u00e9 is there if you are inclined..16.If shopping, start your offer at about 30% of the asking price and settle for about 40-45% of the asking price. Price in TL is always better. Have cash ready. Don\u2019t use card. be prepared to walk away and 90% of the time they will get you back. its fun bargaining and they don't mind either.17.Assume everything dessert/sweet has nuts, so be very careful if you are allergic to nuts.18.Delicious freshly made Gozleme is available in some restaurants only.19.Beware of Turkish baths. Need to go to a reputed one or you will end up with a bad experience. They do pretty heavy thumping/cleaning/scrubbing.20.Buy water in big bottles of 5 litres from about 3-5 Tl . Most places charge you up to 10 Tl, but is worth only about 3-5TL. Shop around. Keep them handy in the hotel and fill up and carry smaller bottles when you go out. It will save you a lot of money21.Exchange $/GBP for Turkish Lira directly at the money changers shops lined all along the main road. One of them usually has a better rate than most of the others. Take a walk and look at their electronic display. Also at Grand Bazaar the exchange rates are even better.Do not convert your currency to Euros in your country of origin, its not economical. Its smarter to do it with reliable xchange shops here.22. Lastly for people who are used to eating delicious Falafel rolls in Australia, Europe and USA, please remeber these are unheard of in Istanbul and not available. At least we could not find any. In fact we had to hunt for Gozlemes.Overall a lovely, colourful and vibrant place. We loved our 8 days in Turkey with 3 in Istanbul. Will definitely go back again."

The folks selling the carpets are leaches. Pretend you don't see them by not making eye contact. Most of the rest of the folks are nice and helpful and, really. It seemed to us as if the entirety of the world was plunked down there and they all loved it and decided to stay! (Except for the carpet beggars, who should be shot!) Go to the Hagia Sophia very early in the morning because the lines are very long. Take a boat ride on the Bosphorus and buy the scarves that they sell on the boats. They are $5.00 there and sell for $25.00 or $30.00 in the States. Our favorite restaurant there was The Antique Turquoise (a block or two off the main drag). A wonderful hotel is the Armada (like The Ramada Inn except with an \"A\") You can see the Bosphorus from your room and the lights from Hagha Sophia from their restaurant. This place has my heart, although I had to fight off the carpet beggars:( Be Bold. Be strong!!! This is a must see!!!"

The best part is that there are little gardens where you are free to sit and enjoy your afternoon lunch like a picnic in the middle of a busy city. The volume of people is great so it is really busy. The security and staff are quite friendly and helpful to tourists. The tram runs through this area so it is easily accessible but a great walk too. Many shops to pick up all manner of souvenirs. Great night life too. Loved it!"

Greeks, Romans, Slavs, Persians, Crusaders and finally the Ottoman Turks just to name a few... but I digress, sorry.

Play along and try your best bargaining skills! We were surprised by the colourful and neat displays of the merchandise. The huge pyramids of nuts, dried figs, dates and other kinds of fruit, look so beautiful. An open invitation to taste everything! All the bags with different kinds of exotic tea and spices ensure sensory overload, especially when you are a foreigner and not used to this way of browsing. And not to speak of the huge variety of turkish delight (locum) choices. If you do not have space in your bags to take a few boxes with these treats back home, at least visit the Spice Bazaar for your own eye-candy!"

Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Grand Bazaar, the site of Constantine's Hippodrome and more are all right here within easy walking distance. It is a place not to be missed. However, as other reviewers have noted, everyone is trying to sell you something, always at inflated prices. I felt like a girl running a gauntlet of construction workers. Shopkeepers and street salespeople call after you, try to engage you in conversation, follow you offering to guide you to \"the antique shops\" (of course their own), all with one view in mind--to get as much out of your pocket as they can. You can bargain down for some things, but if you are visiting multiple places, you will find better prices outside Istanbul. Both Cappadocia and Izmir have better prices for most things, including the smaller souveniers. Turkish Delight is a ripoff in Sultanahmet shops and the spice market--they sell it in boxes that are artificially large. If you are going to other cities, wait to buy anything until you go there. Do NOT be polite. Ignore the salespeople and when they pester you, tell them no and walk the other way. Most of the restaurants suck too. They are overpriced and underwhelming, with a couple of exceptions. I'd just look for a kebab stand and get dinner outside Sultanahmet unless you choose one of the few restaurants that receive good reviews. It is the price of enjoying the world-class historical sites here."

Good points about Sultanamet: It's close to 90 percent of the big attractions in Istanbul. It has it's own metro stop that can take you just about anywhere -- including the airport. You can also walk easily to the harbor for boat trips. While it's crowded, the hotels that are set back in little hans off one or two main drags are pretty quiet. There are some very charming side streets in the area where you can escape and look at real Istanbul. This is the Old City, so its the architecture is really cool and there are many charming historic buildings along the back streets.Bad points: I've lived all over the world, including freaking Shanghai, and I was annoyed with the crowds here. Starting at about 7 am and late into the night, the narrow streets are packed with tourists who are walking en masse very ... very ... slowly. So just walking somewhere like the tram stop, which should take 2 minutes, takes 10. After a few days, it was starting to feel like a form of torture. Really. I have never seen crowds like this. It's sort of astounding in and of itself to see so many people from all over the world (including many muslim people) who apparently love this city and feel a connection to it. But yeah, after a few days, the crowds were a constant source of bemusement or rage (depending on my mood).Next time, given the awesomeness of Istanbul's public trans, I'd probably stay in Beyoglu where it's less crowded. That side is also quite cool and atmospheric, and though it's also crowded, it feels a bit more Turkish and a bit less like a Disneyland-type world inhabited entirely by tourists."

Though it also has at least 4 major sites to see - St Sophia, Blue Mosque, Cictern, Topkapi...I would recomend to have lunch by the sea - you can just walk down from Topkapi exit. Walk along the sea and take a fish sandwich they make right in the street. Dont be afraid - it is fresh and clean. Take your sandwish and seat at the rocks by the seaside and enjoy teh atmosphere. I normally come there to have a break for lunch and give my legs some rest, or by the end of the day to enjoy the sunset."

Being a peninsula bounded by bodies of water to north, east and south (the Golden Horn, Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara, respectively) and by the old city walls to west, this part of the city is essentially what used to be called Constantinople, as the rest of what is today Istanbul was part of independent cities, towns, villages, fields or even complete wilderness later absorbed by the city. This process is still going on as Istanbul grows with increasing speed. Istanbul, or Byzantium as it was called then, was first settled by Greek colonists from Megara in Greek mainland in 667 BC. They founded their city at Seraglio Point (Sarayburnu) which is now occupied by Topkap\u0131 Palace. However, recent discoveries in a metro construction site in Yenikap\u0131 (on the southern coast of the peninsula) dates the very first date of Istanbul's settlement back to about 8000 years ago, which makes the city one of the oldest still-inhabited spots of the world. This peninsula was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985. Sultanahmet, walking distance to the all historical sights of istanbul named old city."

You have 4of the top ten list (Ayasofia, Topkapi. Blue mosque and Basilica Cistern). The street vendor is a little bit handful to handle, I may say. Is not that they're trying to rob you or something. But, Seems all of them comes from the same school of salesmanship. They will ask you the first question: \"Where are you from?\", then \"Are you two married?\" if yes, \"How many children\" and so on and so on until you start askign questions about the surrounding- then after that, they will never leave you. So, it will be better just show them your palm and say \"Thank you\". Quite interesting to see almost all of them are using the same approach like I mentioned above."

Hagia Sophia was fascinating, impressive and a symbol of tolerance! The Sultan instead of destroying the biblical art covered it up with plaster! Now with ongoing restoration we are able to see the beautiful images and millions of gold chips! We used a local guide at the entrance paid 60 TLR in addition to the tickets - was well worth it! We did the Bosphorus cruise for 100 TLR for 4 people - the vendor just across from Sophia. It was spectacular way to see this sprawling city and the tour guide was great! Dinner at Motbah next to Hagia Sophia is a must to experience the Ottoman Cuisine! Don't miss the Dondurma, freshly squeezed juices on the streets! Grand Bazaar is an experience ....but low quality goods. We bought the Turkish Delight at Hafiz MUSTAFA in Taksim Square....the best dont miss it! Hafiz Mustfa has the best coffee and pastrie! The ceramics sold at Grand Bazaar are certainly not handmade! If you visit the pottery making store in Cappadochia you will appreciate the difference! Tram ride is an experience! Put on your best walking shoe and walk everywhere! Visit the Istiklal street in Taksim Square....late night...just bustling with people! And the street food are excellent! 4 days is Istanbul was not enough to experience this great city! Certainly going back! BTW if you love fish make sure you eat by the we shore!"

If you are keen to read the reviews before planning your time in this area, make sure you also look at the Trip Advisor reviews on the Historic Area of Istanbul. Essentially this the same as Sultanahmet.I have reviewed the Historic Area (August 2014) and suggested that the key is to pre-plan your visit, there is so much to take in. That review goes into a lot more detail if you are interested.All of the key attractions demand time, the queues unfortunately in the August - October period are long, and there are tourists and Turks everywhere. Do persist however, as the rewards are immense. In particular, endurance is required for the Topkapi Palace and its vast surrounds - warrants a half day at least, with lots of walking. Remember the hat for the sun, a water bottle and camera batteries.The hours that attractions are open is a challenge for Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque and the Basillca. They are also closed on certain days. So plan ahead with your guide book. Do not fail to wander the Hippodrome and admire the minarets in these vast open spaces amidst a city of well in excess of 20 million people. And eat locally in the many many sidewalk cafes with such great vegetarian food in particular and a cold beer. If you are still to choose where to stay this district is superb, it gives easy walking access to all of these attractions, and if the queues are too long, you can head back to your hotel and then come again 2 hours later. I can recommend that the Erboy Hotel is a great little hotel with a very good international breakfast and is ideally located in this district."

The second time we stayed at the Hagia Sofia Hotel at \u00a3145 per night but the price reflects the close proximity to the square and a more luxurious finish.Arguably the cleanest city I have ever seen and Sultanahmet retained a magnificent historical and traditional ambience whilst providing a vast array of bars and restaurants to cater for every taste."

Initially we really disliked the constant hustling, particularly relating to the Bosphorus cruises and the incessant carpet shop hustlers; however we did find that a polite but very firm 'No thank you' was often enough to dissuade them, provided we just kept walking and didn't engage with them in any conversation or explanation."

It is really easy to do the Sultanahmet district trip yourself. Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Basillica, Hippodrome, Museums are all close by and walkable distance. During month of July, weather is around 70ish and awesome to walk. We walked close to 16000 steps/day. We are a family of 5. Kids are around 15,11 and 5. We are also vegetarian and there is a falafel place(Makarana.sarayi.com.tr) near Grand Bazaar, this is very inexpensive and high quality. There is also a Hamam place next to this. We went to an Indian restaurant near sophia called Dubb restaurant. Food was good and service was great, but expensive. Taxi are very inexpensive and drivers are honest. They didn't want to take tips and we literally forced it on them as we were 5 people in one taxi.Also, take the bosphorus cruise offered for the local turkish people which is 20lira per person."

We found it best to not tell them where we were from from as invariably they would know someone in your home state and talk and them push you to visit their shop (carpet, pottery, etc.). But we never felt threatened are worried about our safety. We had an added bonus that on the first night of Ramadan we were there and it was jammed packed with thousands of folks sitting at tables waiting to eat and we inadvertently were in a prime spot to see the Prime Minister of Turkey as he got out of his car and with his body guards got to the stage and made a speech. We were less than 10 yards away! But this is a great area to stroll and people watch. Lots of cafes and such and again, we never felt threatened in anyway and always felt very safe."

Our stay in Istanbul was coming in the month of Ramazan or fasting month of Muslims. therefore we wanted to to stay in a hotel which was close to the blue Mosque so that we can easily walk to the mosque to attend the prayers. Thankfully we got such a place. Though it was not very close but was reasonably close. One can easily get lost in the small streets of this district but in order to find your way you just have to ask about the blue mosque. The main market of this area is on the tram line but if you want to buy some cheaper stuff my advise is to try out other small streets and never forget to bargain. If you have booked a hotel here then keepits phone number with you and make the taxi driver and the hotel talk to each other. While roaming in the streets be ware of pick pockets. Preferably leave your credit cards in the hotel, Turkish merchants also like cash payments. Here you would find many students with the \"ask me\" shirts, they speak prefect English and can be excellent interpreters for you. There are many attractions very close to each other in this district it is advisable to dedicate at least a full day for this district"

Anyone who has ever done the tours/taxis/timeshare walk at Cancun airport will be able to relate....but rather than one strip, this is an entire area of constant harassment. I had no problem with this in the bazaar, in fact that's where I expected it, but everywhere got to be a bit much.TAXIS: BEWARE. Despite being licensed, you will have to be very firm and specific. Provide EXACT addresses to hotels. By the end of our trip I was having to hold up the map/GPS on my phone to show them how far away from the route they were supposed to be on. Rip off merchants who drive like lunatics. Literally every cab I went into I had to dig out the belt receptacle.

A highlight was the Spice Bazaar, a 15minute walk away from Hagia Sofia. Do this on your own, before a tour if you can. Explore the surrounding markets on a saturday with the locals and pay \"local resident\" prices. Prices go up on Sundays for the influx of tour groups. Buy turkish delight from \"Hayat\" the store, its fresh and delicious! Careful of the traffic as a pedestrian!"

The red bus is available if you want to do a bit of hopping on and off in order to visit other districts and also the tram. Taxis are a cheap ride too. If you like walking like we did you can walk from here to Taksim Square in the European part of Istanbul which again is a wonderful place to visit. It's more upbeat than the Sultanhamet district but still worth a visit and there are many sites to see and explore on the way. Some of the attractions in the Sultanhamet district are free to enter but others have costs involved which are not exorbitant."

The only thing that is annoying is that a lot of men will hit on you if you are a woman alone. In my case (I am blond and curvy) it got to a point where I was almost unable to sightsee due to those distractions. I ended up putting a scarf on my head, which helped a little bit but was uncomfortable in the heat.Some of the men were pretty good looking so it was only partially annoying.

Truly fascinating and splendid! The biggest problem, however, is navigating the area through constant hassling and harassing of rug merchants, store and restaurant employees, who do everything short of sticking out a foot to trip you, to get you to come to their store or eat in their establishment! They follow you everywhere you go, start off politely, appearing to want to befriend you with personal questions about your nationality, then extend invitations which cannot be politely refused, then descend into mild abuse when all else fails. The worse place for this is, naturally, the Grand Bazaar...I only lasted 15 minutes, even though I had originally wanted to buy some gifts there. I couldn't take two steps without being uncomfortably 'swarmed'. There is much less of this behavior on the other side of the bridge, but it's not as historically impressive.If you can run the gauntlet, the Sultanemet is astounding. But be prepared and don't kid yourself into thinking you can dissuade these guys by just ignoring them"

I am sure istanbul and turkey have many other great things to offer but in a couple of days you can cover all the wonderful historic attractions here and also cruise the Bosphorous. The major mosques are all magnificent externally and due to an aversion to insanely queues we haven't ventured inside one there is another free mosque just by the wonderful spice bazaar and with no queues an far fewer visitors it was amazing internally and a ver peaceful place to reflect in even if not of the Islamic faith.(even those of the atheistic faith might have enjoyed the experience).We made an effort on a Saturday to then walk to the grand bazaar but soon we're enveloped in hordes of excited Turks shopping in the street markets by the spice bazaar to the point where we felt we didn't need the grand bazaar experience. Re the spice bazaar the most amazing produce we found was at nourish but watch out or they will try and sell you everything in the shop in a very skilled sales approach and this is no cheap shop. Loved the choc pellet coated pomegranate etc confectionery logs and the smell of the amazing spice blends. Also forget the many very average restaurants for lunch and instead go to the the Maui bufe by the major post office.fresh,tasty, cheap , fresh juices and mainly locals in virtually a street food setting.For a fancier eating place with amazing views go to the seven hills rest but only order seafood - the rest is really disappointing . Check out the review I am about to post if interested. Easy to get lost here in areas where some lanes and roads cross and intertwine in a romantic but jumbled confusion so be prepared. We haven't tried it yet but apparently the huge queues can be avoided by hiring local guides who approach you. Don't know about it but sounds a great idea in principal On another note beware being ripped off in bills and short changed (as we were twice in the same transaction in the British style port shield hotel - those guys were tryers) . Also beware of kebab overload food wise:)"

Ho took over Istanbul and this district was named after him. This is an area to do almost everything a tourist wants to do when visiting Istanbul. Many places are within walking distance to this area where there are mosques, churches and many other historic structures not to mention the restaurants, bars, street merchants etc. Do search this place to see the pictures or perhaps some videos. Walk on the very blood stained soil where the Crusaders ransacked Hagia Sophia, Sultan departed and returned from wars with his mighty military following behind and where the decisions were made that lead to the unintended discovery of the American continent. Surprised? Read up! :-) If you are a photographer, history buff or fascinated with details, you can easily spend 3 days in that area alone.

It's like going back 50 years but with mod cons... the milkman walking around with his churn and measure calling outside houses for custom... vendors with carts selling melons, potatoes, salads, the rag and bone man..... wonderful. Be prepared for rich aromas. holes in the pavements and lots of wild cats; traditional houses with peeling paint and people sitting in the streets, talking, until the street lights go out. Away from the Blue Mosque area is a run down but intriguing insight into the real Istanbul. It's safe to walk around and certainly not to be missed."

These are like cafeteria like restaurants where you choose your food then pay for it then go grab your table. These are very affordable, unlike the sit-in restaurants. For example, just last month, my wife and I were able to have a very nice lunch or dinner for just $8 equivalent versus an easy $20 for for two in sit in restaurants. These self service places that we went to were all very clean. The food is very good. I suggest trying the meatballs (they are not really ball shapes but flat long ones, but make sure they are fully cooked). In Taksim Square, there is one Self Service near the square itself - that was expensive. If you walk along Istiklal Caddesi from Taksim to the other end, if you just walk about 10 mnutes, you will see St Anthony church on your left. The Self service right to the right of the church (facing the church) is very good and a lot less expense than the one near Taksim Square. I recommend that place if you want to save on your dinner."

Public transportation is very easy to access. Restaurants, bars, and souvenir shops are around.But beware of spammers especially at night. Someone pretend to be kind to you and then offer you to have drink and then charge you $250. It's very common at this area. Just be careful to a Turkish man that you don't know well and speak very good english. Spammers usulally speak english very well."

We stayed in three different hotels during an extended visit to Istanbul (and Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria) and two were in Sultanahmet (the \"Old Town\" of Istanbul). This is the area to stay in as you can walk to almost everything and public transportation, especially the tram, is available (and cheap) for everything else. Most of the tourist attractions are in this area, especially the top ones (Topkapi Palace, Aya Sophia, Blue Mosque, the Grand Bazaar, the Spice or Egyptian Market, the Cistrern, the ferries on the Bosphorous, etc.) and many good restaurants.The area runs roughly from the ferry terminals on the Bosphorous in the north to the Sea of Marmara in the south, with Gulhane Park and the Topkapi Palace taking up the northeast 15 or 20% or so of the region. The tram runs from the train station next to the ferry terminals to Gulhane Park and then down to Sultanahmet station (near the Blue Mosque and Aya Sophia) but extends far to the west (and to the north from the train stn)--trams are easy to use, just find a station, put your money into the automated ticket machine and take your red token (about 75 cents US) to the tram entrance.Two great small hotels in the area are the inexpensive Soliman Hotel in the northern part of the old town (close to Topkapi Palace, the ferry terminals, Gulhane Park, the Spice Market, Hafiz Mustafa, etc.) and the White House Hotel in the south-central park of the old town (close to the Grand Bazaar, Aya Sophia etc.).The Sultanahmet region seems very safe and we had no difficulty during the eight days and nights we spent walking in the area, even late at night (of course, take appropriate precautions and don't make yourself vulnerable, as anywhere else). People were friendly and accommodating, with recommendations or directions and meeting people on the street and in parks became \"half the fun\" of the visit. While all the great tourist attractions are certainly worth visiting we found backstreets and such to be just as interesting. Sultanahmet is a walker's dream area with lots of atmosphere."

We also did our daily food shopping with the local people which gave us a very authentic experience. The Turkish people were uniformly friendly and helpful, and we have never seen such a hardworking lot! Age didn't seem to make a difference, at dusk you would see people in their 70s, sometimes 80s, pushing their carts up the hilly alleyways after a long day at work. You can find the oudoor flavoured hooka lounges and many cafes and restaurants there as well. At night we founnd it quiet in our area, important for sleeping.The apartment was on the 3rd floor but managed by a very helpful & courteous young man who left us a big breakfast outside our door every morning. A typical Turkish breakfast of salty cheese, pastries, tomatoes, olives, processed meat, tea.If you need the western shopping experience and are a good walker, Taksim is a good walk away.All in all a fantastic tourist experience with many wonderful memories."

Best deal!\" \"Guide to Istanbul!\" \"Private tour of Blue Mosque!\" \"Come eat here!\" It's kind of wearing after a while, and it's CONSTANT. Just say \"no\" strongly and walk away. Obviously, come to Sultanahmet though. It's where all the historic sites in the city are. You'd miss out on the Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Basilica Cistern, and so much more. It would be silly to not come."

As our hotel was overlooking the Topkapi Palace gardens, we didn't have far to walk to get to the major attractions. Yes, there are lots of guys touting for business, but a firm but polite 'no thank you' worked wonders. Saying 'maybe later' at the restaurants worked for us too. Not once in 6 days were our arms grabbed as others have said, nor were we followed and pestered. In fact we found everyone polite and friendly and helpful when we got ourselves lost in the back streets.A really great area to explore with so many beautiful buildings with such a lot of history."

            "review": "SCAM central. Wow, I really was disappointed my with the experience. I was really looking forward to visiting Istanbul but left with a different opinion. Istanbul is a beautiful city filled with gorgeous sights however; you have to watch out for yourself. I felt like everywhere I went, the people were trying to rip me off. I am only going to discuss my experience with the Sultanahmet District. People will try anything to scam you.While waiting in line for the Hagia Sophia, we were bombarded with people trying to sell you tours. It's not just one, it was a whole flock of people. A simple, \"no, thank you\" does not work. They are like flies and you can't swat them away. After about the 3rd person, I just ignored. It seemed to work but then another one would quickly approach. Another scam, that took place was the \"Do you speak English\" scam where someone will try to sell you their Museum Pass. This couple approached my husband and I and told us that they were just visiting for the day on a cruise and bought the three day pass. They assured us that there was 2 days left. They seemed \"sincere\" and wanted 55 lira for them. We denied their offer. If it sounds to good to be true than it usually is. After waiting in line, we bought our Museum Pass and then discovered that they scan your pass. From what I understand, each location can only be visited once in the three days.Next, we were walking towards the Blue Mosque and were approached by a local man. He told us that the mosque was closed for prayer and to come back at 7. He recommended somewhere for my husband and I to eat. Luckily, the restaurant was recommended in the Rick Steves' book so I know it was a safe choice. While walking us over to the restaurant, he told us that he owned a carpet store (eye roll). He left us and I was surprised he didn't try to get us to visit his store. We finished eating and were walking back to the Blue Mosque around 7:15 and there he was again. He spotted us and came over to us. He wanted to show us around. There was a long line but he took us to the front and gave us a private tour. I couldn't help but feel uneasy. My husband had money to give him as a tip and thank you. He wanted us to take a look at his carpet shop. We felt suckered in. We told him that we were NOT interested in buying such items. We looked at this shop and then were led upstairs to talk to his \"cousin\". He tried offering tea, water but I declined. He was not happy. I understand the culture, but I wanted to be straightforward and tell him no thanks. We quickly left and vowed that we wouldn't be put in that situation again.The next day, we were walking by a restaurant and the food looked delicious as it was displayed in the window. We walked in and I noticed that there were not any prices in front of the cafeteria style food. This was a major red flag. My husband asked how much and told the guy he wanted to pay BEFORE we ate but the owner got angry and demanded that we eat, then pay. I knew he was trying to set us up for a scam. I read numerous reviews that you always pay BEFORE you eat when at a cafeteria style eatery. Basically, they can charge you whatever amount and you can't deny as you ate the food. We left QUICKLY and didn't want to eat anywhere else.Also, besides trying to sell the tours, people are trying to sell you books, beads, Bosphorus cruise tours. On the topic of the Bosphorus cruises do not buy from them as they charge way too much. Buy your tickets from the official cruise company which is located by the Galata Bridge.One more thing is that I do not recommend taking the public transportation. The trolley always looked crowded and the people were crammed in like sardines. All I could think of was that this was a perfect scene for pickpockets. We walked everywhere. We walked from our hotel in the Sultanahmet District to the New District. It was a nice walk besides the flies trying to rip you off.It is too bad that a few bad apples can change your experience. I am just glad that we were smart enough to not get scammed although I left Turkey feeling like I missed out. I understand not all people are bad, but the scamming is just unreal.I am in disbelief that TripAdvisor recommends Istanbul as the top destination to visit in 2014. It is beautiful and unique but I believe that changes need to be made before this is recommended with such a prestige title. Like I said earlier in my review, not all people are bad."

The kindness shown by Nedim Kaya and his family went far and above in aiding myself and my wheel chair bound mother. Pouring rain, no taxis and at no time was there anything beyond concern for my mom. Nedim walked 7 blocks with us to hail us a cab and ensured we got a fair price. If you have ever been in Sultanahmet and seen the traffic, as well a competition for customers; you will understand how special and wonderful he was.The shop is lovely and I regret not making it back there on this trip. However I will shop there sometime and HIGHLY recommend that if you are looking for authentic goods, at a fair price (which can be hard to find in the tourist area), I honestly believe you will not find a better place.Check out their website: elrincondefehmi,comNedim, many thanks to you and your uncle!"

Signs could be better to segregate queues for those entering monuments with Museum Pass from those queuing for immediate tickets. With queues 1km long, this is not a whimsical thought. You can spend lots of time quieuing and if hot, not a pleasant experience. We walked away from visiting Galata Tower because of very long queue (not included on Museuem Pass listing). City so very interesting, Shame to have obstacles to maximising opportunities to enoy it all."

However, one need to pay attention to the crowds and to people selling all kinds of things that sometime can be really annoying. Don't stop if you are not interested, just ignore them - same thing you should do in the bazaars. Devote some time in visiting the museums and reading a little bit of the history of the place - otherwise it's just buildings and shops. Nice hotels of all kinds are available, restaurants too touristic for my taste. Sultanahmed District is definitely worth visiting when in Istanbul - however do not underestimate the more modern part which is the \"face of today\"."

You will enjoy walking here. But be careful when you shop, remember to bargain a price.but...if you want to stay in a lively place of Istanbul, then you should stay at a hotel near to Istiklal Street, Taksim. Because you need to take a taxi to go back to Sultanahmet after 11pm, it can cost at least 7\u20ac. But if you are a tourist in Istanbul, the taxi driver would choose the long way, so it can cost much more."

This is also one of the areas that scam artists and dishonest taxi drivers ply their trades because it is a beacon for world-travelers.Be very wary of anyone that unannounced approaches you on foot in the area, especially men who are alone. They will usually get to stop you with a ploy that they thought you were Turkish or for a light and then the scams start, (you can research this on this site or any Internet search engine).Another typical problem in this area are dishonest taxi drivers; from money switches to wanting to take you to their \"special\" night clubs instead of where you told them to go. Many times they will not take no for an answer and will rack up expensive bills.Sultanahmet is a great place to visit, but it has the highest proportion of scammers to regular people in any of the 39-countries I have visited."

The first was the shoe shine. Google this for an explanation of what the scammer does. We were saved because we were both in sneakers - difficult to shine! The second was the food scam. Google this too. The restaurant tried to get $40 USD out of us for two kabobs and two cups of tea. Be VERY CAREFUL about what is brought to your table. Just because you didn't order it, doesn't mean it's complimentary. Here's the problem with Istanbul: 99% of the Turks are genuinely kind and honest. The other 1% are extremely smooth thieves and very dangerous. More than one tourist has been threatened with violence. Just do a search to read a few stories posted. The trouble is its impossible to tell who belongs to the 1% and who belongs to the 99%. Before you go to Istanbul, go on line and read about the scams and how to protect yourself. NEVER, EVER, follow a stranger into a shop or a bar if invited. Let me repeat - NEVER, EVER go with a merchant or stranger. You WILL be robbed, and there is nothing the police can do to help you. Do your homework when considering Istanbul as a tourist destination, then don't let your guard down because people seem friendly and nice. THATis exactly how one gets trapped."

The mosques are beautiful and the Blue Mosque is simply captivating.There are an array of wonderful restaurants and the grand bazaar is great fun. If you visit Istanbul I would recommend you stay in the Sultanahmet District. On my 2nd visit we stayed in Taksim district which was an area I did not particular enjoy, for me it was soulless and has none of the charm and essence of the Sutlanahmet District."

            "review": "The essence of old Istanbul. The crumbling yet imposing walls of the ancient city still stand in the Sultanahmet area, the heart of old Istanbul, where Byzantium and Constantinople survive in the semi-sunken Milion marker (Rome's starting point for all distances measured in the Empire), the capacious 2nd century Hippodrome, and the iconic Hagia Sofya of Emperor Justinian. Among these treasures of the past, crammed into every available space, are the hotels, the neon-lit cafes and pastry shops, the souvenir and trinket-sellers and street vendors of today's Istanbul. Find a good hotel in this area (there's no lack of choice) and surround yourself with the essence of Istanbul.Sultanahmet is a snapshot of Istanbul, past and present. In winter, the acrid smell of burnt chestnuts (roasting is not an option!) and singed corn-on-the-cob from street carts fills the air, against a backdrop of soaring minarets and the call to prayer. Sleek new trams snake up and down the revamped tourist hotspots, linking Eminonu and Sirkeci to Aksaray and parts further afield, delivering sightseers to the Topkapi Palace, the Museums, the Hagia Sofya and Hippodrome, the \"Blue Mosque\" and the Basilica Cistern. Walk. This is the best advice we can give. Everything in the Sultanahmet area is within easy reach and winter is the best time to visit. Mediterranean winters are mild and the hordes have not yet arrived; the place is yours, particularly at night. Around the Hagia Sofya and \"Blue Mosque\" are streets of cafes and restaurants, ribboned with lights and vying for business in the good-natured way of the Turks (\"Albura Kathisma\", 36-38 Akbiyik Caddesi, two streets behind the Four Seasons Hotel, is highly recommended).Pace yourself -- another important piece of advice. There is so much to see that sensory overload is a very real problem. Take the time to find out the details: the frescoed angels supporting the dome of the Hagia Sofya, for instance, have six wings each, two for flying and four for shielding their faces from the radiance and beauty of God, whom they protect. Look for them when you are on the upper floor, peering round the scaffolding in the centre of the church.Talk to everyone. Turkish people are warm and hospitable, and most understand English to a greater or lesser degree. (Proof of their goodwill is all around, in the number of stray cats everyone seems to feed, and the fact that a stranger searching a map inevitably draws a \"Do you need help?\" from passersby.) And even if you discover that the shawl you bought in the Grand Bazaar is 10TL cheaper at a street stall, you will have had an amusing conversation with a highly skilled salesman in the oldest and largest covered market in the world. Worth it!"

Obviously it is a tourist place and therefore it is frequented by many tourists in search of the spice or souvenir, but it is highly traditional and therefore I am sure that will amaze you."

Sultanahmet can end up getting some bad reviews from people simply by merit of the fact that it's where most tourists tend to flock. However, while this is absolutely, irrefutably true, there's a very good reason for it. This neighborhood is a truly excellent platform upon which to build a trip to Istanbul.If you're a savvy traveler you're going to have a sense of where you should and shouldn't be eating and shopping, and it's very true that Sultanahmet has a large number of tourist traps. These stores absolutely do not define this neighborhood though. If you do your research it's easy to find wonderful, authentic, and reasonably priced shops and restaurants, and easy to avoid the places selling overpriced junk. This is also where the lion's share of famous historical sites are that most travelers will have heard about. The Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque are both here, in addition to Topkapi Palace and the adjoining gardens. You'll also find the basilica cistern here and beautiful grounds surrounding the mosques.My girlfriend and I also found this neighborhood to be quite safe, as long as you take necessary precautions. Pickpockets abound and we almost had one of our phones snatched literally out of our hands at night, being saved only by some quick thinking and sharp eyes. However, police are everywhere and the city is clearly on its A game when it comes to protecting tourist safety both during the day and at night.In short, this neighborhood has a lot to offer and is a nice place to come back to, particularly if you're like us and prefer to start with one neighborhood and then work your way further out into the city. It was reasonably quiet at night, felt safe, and had a lot to offer."

The #1 thing I learned was prices and quality of workmanship vary greatly from store to store. So, slow down and pay particular attention to the details of workmanship as well as cost. Don't make the mistake of buying the first item you see before getting a feel for nuances of how different stores produce these products...don't worry you'll see the same items over and over again at other stores. Above all negotiate aggressively at 1/3 of asking price...If you're patient you will probably find better quality at a considerably cheaper price if you take some time. Lastly, there is more inferior products than quality ones so look around to find the stores who take pride in their work...you won't regret it."

I waited in the queue to get my passport stamped so I could leave the airport, unfortunatley I didnt have the correct visa so had to purchase 2, 1 for myself and one for my sister. I was then waiting in line once again. I was 'knocked back' by the same rude police/immigration officer who claimed I did not have the visa stamps once again. I summoned another police officer immediatley to clarify the situation. He flicked through my passports and correctly established that me and my sister did have the correct visa stamps. He allowed us to go to another advisor who was sitting at the desk. They looked at our passports and let us go through. I stepped out of the airport and immediatley spoke to a taxi advisor wearing a yellow high visibilty top. I asked him for a taxi and instead of putting me in a taxi he told me he would get me one. The taxi operator signalled at me to follow a man who approached from the opposite side of the road. He was a plump, chubby turkish man wearing a dark coloured suit. He asked me to follow him. I was feeling very nervous at this point as this man had a gleaming smile on his face, considering me 'easy pickings' he askd me where I wanted to go. At this point me and my sister were at the entrance of a car park a few minutes walk from the airport. Another man was waiting at the entrance of the airport. I refused to allow my sister to enter. The other man was introduced as the 'hotels manager manager' he was apparently the main manager of all the hotels. I had never heard of a job position like that. I decided enough was enough and I told the men politley that my 'dad was near' and I had to go. The men wernt very pleased. I noticed a yellow taxi approach me and to remove myself from the situation of these weird men I got in. The driver seemed polite and sincere. He had broken english. I explained that I needed to go to a hotel. And I told him I wanted the price to be around 40-60.00 lira. We started speaking. We got into a deep conversation regarding the beauty of turkey. The driver asked me for my mobile phone. A black iphone 5, which i was happy to give him to enter his mobile number into. I would rather stick with one trustworthy taxi driver then go with loads of different taxi drivers. We got lost in conversation. Eventually we reached our destination, mavi onur hotel in sultan ahmet district. The fare was 43 lira (equivalent to \u00a325.00 or their abouts) and I had 20 lira and \u00a360.00. The taxi driver charged me 20 lira and \u00a360.00, \u00a380.00 in total. I did not realise I had been ripped off. My sister told me not to pay him, but being in a vulnerable situation their was not a lot I could do. I asked him for my mobile phone back and he claimed that he had given it to me back. Which he had not, if he had I would have had it in my pouch with all my important belongings. I was left feeling skrewed at the hotel as their was nothing else I could do. I could not contact the police. I did not have their number. I just took it on the chin and tried to forget about what had happened. (I later realised that the yellow taxi I got picked up from was not an official airport taxi) the hotel staff were really friendly and advised me on what tov see atch out for. I was several minutes away from sultan ahmet mosque. It was really nice. It was a shame my whole holiday ended before it actually began in turkey. I understand you should not judge a whole group of people by the actions of a minority however I would still recommend everyone to stay away from turkey and go to Muscat Oman which was my next destination. That was an experience I will always remenber for the right reasons."

If you want more authentic, not places trying to cater to a more Westernized palate, venture out. For shopping, they will bargain a little but since the area is so populated with tourists you likely won't get the best deals in this area.Also, the tram was extremely convenient and easy to use. We took it everywhere from going to the Topkapi Palace (5 minute tram ride) to going to the Galata Tower and up to Taksim. It's only 3 Turkish Lira (or $1.50) each way. You can't beat that.Next time, I'll probably stay in the Taksim area, it's a little younger and more trendy. Plus the Hotel Marmara is there. You must try Raika, their restaurant on the top floor.

Yes the shop keepers will badger you and they all seem to have PhD's in psychology or mind reading. Smile and ignore them without speaking. They are efficient with their time and won't bother with you. Make jokes and otherwise engage them and you are fresh meat.

Even if you do not go inside the buildings (there can be long lines), the exteriors are still impressive (to me, the Blue Mosque is the most beautiful building in the world) and there is a lovely fountain that is especially pretty at night.

Of course you expect a place to be touristy when you've in the tourist district, but as a woman traveling alone, I found that many of the vendors and restaurant personnel were so pushy that it actually bordered on aggressive. Several men working at restaurants near the Grand Bazaar actually blocked my path so that I couldn't pass and kept blocking me until I finally rudely told them to move. Similarly, other vendors \"introduced themselves\" by shaking my hand and wouldn't let go of it for 30 seconds or more while they attempted to convince me to buy something from them. Finally, everyone who claimed they wanted to practice their English with me actually just wanted to sell me a rug. As I said, you expect the place to be touristy, but when you're approached by people in this kind of aggressive or pushy way 15 or 20 times per day, it's way too much."

Magical: some of the unexpected and striking views opening round nondescript street corners, the rich layers of past civilizations competing for your attention, the smells and sounds (particularly at prayer times) of the old town. Mystery: the lack of street name signs in the area south of the Aya Sofia/Blue Mosque which makes finding any particular place impossible in the dark if you are adventurous and want to walk for more than 10 minutes, like we did. It this a way a making sure that Istanbul taxis find customers every evening? or to increase the sense of achievement if/when you do find the restaurant you were looking for? Or did the municipality run out of cash when it got to this area? we will never know, but be warned. Of course the unwanted restaurants you pass by will do their best to grab you off the street ,when you start to look tired and confused and your feet are beginning to falter. Do enjoy the big sights during the day, visiting the Aya Sofia, the Cistern, the Hyppodrome, the Millenium pillar, the Blue Mosque are \"musts\" on a first visit, before you take the tram down to Eminonu and catch the brilliant ferry up the Bosphorus."

Also, do not miss the Basilica Cistern built in 532. My favorite experience was the Turkish Bath. Pure bliss after two days of walking.

It was an excellent place to stay and it was very easy to get around to the sites (many within walking distance). Quite easy to go across the Bosphorus Straight onto the Asian Side of Istanbul and also very easy to go across the bridge over the Golden Horn (the inlet dividing the European side of Istanbul).We hope to go back to Istanbul one day, and if we do we will certainly be staying in the Sultanahmet District again. We felt very safe and everyone is so friendly."

This area of the town is as full with once in a lifetime sights as it is full of hotels and tourists.That means: Rooms are abundant and comparatively cheap and often with a bit longer stay hotels offer some extras as a free airport transfer. Organizing anything touristy will be pretty easy as there are dozens of agencies around. On the other hand, food and drinks do come at a premium (though the quality general is good).And if you stay there you have everything within walking distance or within two tram stations.On the other handm it is often crowded and the more or less reckless way of driving meets the streams of tourists. Many nice sights are missed due to the big attractions.And if you are a party goer and like to club or dance. Sorry, this is not the area for you to book a hotel. It takes some time, money, and walking to get to the hip areas. btw, generally guided tours do take lunch break and the main atrractions become comparatively empty."

I was able to do just that in the Sultanahment District in my four day stay. I got very settled in the area with just the four days I was here. This area is close to all the major attractions, short walking distance to many others (Grand Bazaar Old Spice Market,) and the rail station stop is also nearby making for easy access to other parts of Istanbul (Galata Tower,Taksim Square..) If there were any negative aspects, it would be that the area is saturated with tour agencies and I could not walk anywhere with someone trying to sell me something whether I was alone or in a group. (Though they were more persistent when I was by myself.) Next time I'll think to wear earphones so I won't be bothered as much. With that said, most locals that talked to me in the area were very polite and generally pleasant to talk to.I was able to find nice place to sit down for the evenings at one of the hostel cafes/restaurants at Akbyik Cd. which was around the block from the Metropolis Hostel where I was staying at. Never a dull moment in my stay for sure!"

It is jam-packed with beautiful and fascinating historical buildings and activities. We just spent 6 weeks touring Eastern Europe, starting in St Petersburg and working our way south, and Istanbul was easily our favorite place.Referring to my headline: When you get off the Tram in Sultanahmet you're likely to be approached by someone offering advice or even \"free\" guide service. We knew going in that this would happen, but we liked the guy that came to us and offered to take us through the Blue Mosque \"and end with a stop at my carpet store... no obligation!\" So we took him up on it. Turns out he was very knowledgeable, helping us circumvent lines and then, once inside, giving us the level of detail and background on the place that we had paid for in previous cities. Once we finished, we went to his nearby shop, where the \"closer\" took over, at which time our guide faded away. We sincerely looked at several carpets and we were willing to buy, but none suited our tastes or budget. The salesman tried pretty hard to get me to commit, but I knew to not even put a price out there that I would be willing to pay. He soon realized he would not make a sale. Total time spent was maybe 20 minutes. Because we had the right attitude and held our ground it was actually kind of fun, and has become another experience of a great trip."

The advantage was that we went to the blue mosque 2-3 times however being friday it was shut to visitors for part of the day and also at other times prayers were going on, yet we did not miss seeing it coz we were so close we could just walk back and see it at a time convenient for us.Also all around the district all kinds of foods are available.Even other parts of town were easily accessible because of the trams and boats. Infact even spice bazaar and egyptian bazars are all close by. We could also just walk to take the boat cruise. The tram noise can get a bit annoying but not too much of a problem.All in all a good place to stay."

The Divan Yolu (main street with the tram line) is littered with restaurants and shops of every kind. It's unbelievable to imagine that there are so many historically significant monuments within a stone's throw of each other. Almost all the top-rated attractions (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Basilica Cistern, Hippodrome, Cemberlitas, Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar, Suleymaniye Mosque, etc.) are within a couple of kilometres of walking distance. One should definitely do this by themselves on foot. It is not at all worth paying a tour operator to show you around. There are numerous hotels in the Sultanahmet area, and it makes sense to stay in one of them and go around the district."

It is incredible to be around all these great tourist attractions with 1700 years of incredible and varied architecture / history, and it definitely has a great atmosphere. Probably need a minimum of three full days to really experience the area. I found the area to be relatively safe no matter where or when I found my place semi-lost. Only thing you need to watch out for are \u201cHello friend, where are you from?\u201d calls. Someone on every corner wants you to buy a rug or give you a cup of tea (translation: come talk about buying you a rug or giving a tour). Just best to wave at these guys and ignore them. If you want to make a large purchase like a rug, it really is best to do your research to find out who are the reputable dealers (they are usually not the ones hawking and are NOT found in the bazaars). If you want to get away from the tourists and the hawkers, head on down to the sea side for a walk along the shoreline or into the Gulhane Park\u2026 it sure was nice to meet some real locals around there and just stroll around. Now there are plenty of decent places to eat and have a drink around here, just some of the best prices and quality to be found is along the less traveled backstreets and often along with service. Also, if your into guided tours, I recommend booking a them in advance of arrival (plenty of tours reviewed here on TripAdvisor), instead of purchasing on the street. I found the guided tours helped get me adjusted quickly to all that there is to see, and since I stayed here 5-days+ I had plenty of time to go re-visit at my own leisurely pace"

You can dine quite reasonably here and enjoy 'true' Turkish food' The historical sights are close together so it is easy to visit Hagia Sophia, Suleymaniye Mosque and the Topkapi Palace. A visit here is a real treat and the transport links are second to none."

Whilst I enjoyed seeing the sights of the old city I found it very crowded with tourists and so all the shops were expensive and annoying with their constant yelling out to you to come buy! Same with the grand bazaar, I enjoyed the back lanes near the spice bazaar much better as these were where the Turkish people shopped and it was fascinating to see what was on offer and no one bugged me there. However probably it is the best place re a Hotel as you are within walking distance of most of the major sites and the tram is also in the Main Street.My best tip for getting into Istanbul from the airport is to organise a car transfer. It took over an hour on the Saturday I arrived and would have cost a lot in a taxi so I was relaxed knowing I didn't need to worry. Make sure you have small change available for tipping as well."

This old town as it is known as offers a great cultural experience. It is surely the best place in Istanbul and not worth missing. It was a unique experience to explore this city, which is nothing like you have ever seen before.

Every corner here is full of history and just sitting on one of the benches in the garden between the Haghia Sophia and the Blue Mosque is an experience. Our hotel was located in Sultanahmet and that gave us a great advantage to spend more time here. It is also packed with many restaurants and cafes and we didn\u2019t have to venture any further. Most of the historical sites are here on walking distance. Every day we started with a walk around the Hippodrome \u2013 this is he square in front of the Blue Mosque. It was here that chariot races were taking place and also here, in 532 during the Nika rebellion, when 30,000 rebels were trapped and slaughtered. No much left today \u2013 only three monuments. There were brought here from all over the Byzantine Empire to decorate the central line of the Hippodrome of the new capital Constantinople. I was attached mostly to the Serpent Column. The three intertwined bronze serpents were casted to celebrate the victory of the Greeks over the Persians during the Persian Wars in the 5th century BC. Constantine ordered the column to be moved from the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. It must have been a beautiful work of art. The other monument -The Egyptian Obelisk \u2013 is also fascinating. It was originally erected in Luxor. After nearly 3,500 years and after such a long journey from Egypt it has not only survived, it is also in astonishingly good condition. Here also is the Museum of Turkish and Islamic art. During my visit the museum was closed but at least I had a glimpse outside. The building was one of the grandest private residences ever built in the Ottoman Empire and I was quite intrigued by the tragic story of its ex resident \u2013 Ibrahim Pasha. He was a Greek, born to Christian parents and at the age of six sold as a slave to the Ottoman palace where he became a good friend of Suleyman the Magnificent when he was also a child. This good friendship gave him the advantage of being promoted to various posts and his power and wealth became so great that some diplomats referred to him as \u201cIbrahim the Magnificent\u201d. He had so much influence on the Sultan and his affairs that the Sultan\u2019s wife, Roxelana, in a fit of jealousy, managed to convince her husband that his dear friend was a traitor and had him assassinated. It is said that Suleiman later regretted Ibrahim's execution and this is reflected in his poems, in which even after twenty years he stresses topics of amity and trust between friends. Going further you encounter Haghia Sophia - after 1500 years it is still one of the truly great buildings of the world! As you pass through the great Imperial Gate behind Haghia Sophia, you enter the First Court of the Topkapi Palace. It is fascinating to have a glimpse at the world of the Ottoman dynasty ruled an empire that included the cities of Athens, Budapest, Belgrade, Sarajevo, Bucharest, Sofia, Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad, Jerusalem, Mecca, Cairo, Alexandria and Tunis, all at one point.On your left is the Byzantine Haghia Eirene, Church of the Divine Peace, commissioned in the 540s by Justinian to replace an earlier church that had occupied this site. The building here is almost exactly as old as Haghia Sophia. My favourite part of the palace was the Harem. The scholars regard the harem as a vital system of organizing the Ottoman Empire. Here also is the Archaeological Museum \u2013 one of the best in Europe, and the Basilica Cistern, a fascinating and almost romantic place that once brought drinking water into Constantinople. On your way to the Grand Bazaar you will encounter the column of Constantine \u2013 one of the most venerable monuments in the city. It marks the centre of what was once the Forum of Constantine the Great and was erected by him to celebrate the dedication of the city as capital of the Roman Empire in 330 AD. There are a few benches around the column where you can sit and admire the monument, even with the many pigeons perched on it. After dusk the city becomes ever more beautiful. The elegant silhouette of the Blue Mosque is illuminated and looks spectacular. We used to sit or walk in the garden between The Haghia Sophia and The Blue Mosque with a large fountain in the middle and enjoy the view. Here in a few restaurants we witnessed that amazing dances of the whirling dervishes who never get tired. Their performance is magical. I understand it is a religious ceremony but still it is a must see. While walking around every day we had a fresh piece of watermelon, sweet corn - roasted or boiled, roasted chestnuts, ice cream or Turkish simits (circular bread with sesame seeds). We also stumbled on the friendliest street cats I ever met."

Each morning it was quite a doable walk to all the must-dos in Istanbul... the Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Basilica Cistern, Topkapi Palace. I feel like I have a good sense of the geography because we stayed there, and I think we were able to be really efficient and make the most of our stay.There's good shopping and dining here as well, although prices can creep up since it's a touristy area. Still, there's no better way to get acquainted with the historic aspect of Istanbul, to really feel the layers of history. For the business, cosmopolitan side, you will need to look elsewhere."

Both ways are safe, and more economical since there is a lot to see. The other thing that I did not like was the price at the eateries. Everything was grossly over priced compared to other places I had eaten in. The food was good, but not worth the cost. All that said, if you are careful this place is certainly worth visiting to check out all the beautiful historical buildings."

Some can be covered in a day, as majorities are located in the old city Sultanahmet.I stayed in Sirkeci, which was just a walking distance from Sultanahmet, so you don\u2019t need taxis.1. Hagia Sophia Museum / Church (Ayasofya)2. Suleymaniye Mosque (close to the Grand Bazaar)3. Sultanahmed Mosque \u2013 The Blue Mosque 4. Rustem Pasha Mosque5. Sultanahmed District (have a walk around the area for exploration & eating)6. Bosphorus Strait cruise7. Topkapi Palace8. Dolmabahce Palace9. Galata Bridge (takes you from Sirkeci to Taksim)10. Galata Tower (located at the end of Taksim road, worth the walk)11. Princes\u2019 Islands (take half a day tour, don\u2019t waste the whole day!)Don\u2019t miss out in going to the following Bazaars:1. Kapali Carsi \u2013Grand Bazaar (closed only on Sunday)2. Egyptian Bazaar \u2013Spice Bazaar (open 7 days a week)3. Fatih Carsamba (open on Wednesdays)There is a tram that crosses Sirkeci, which can transport you to Sultanahmet, and also take you to the other side of Istanbul, the European side. Then you can take the underground metro to Taksim square / road for a long walk. End it by visiting the Galata Tower. There are restaurants there. Warning: there are nightclubs there too, so prepare yourself for some loud music. But there are also live performances by street musicians as well. It\u2019s a lively place, and packed with high market brand shops.One unique experience that you should try, if you want to, is the Turkish Hamam. \u00c7emberlita\u015f Hamam\u0131 is considered the oldest Hamam (built in 1584). I tried it and it was heavenly.Sirkeci has a lot of restaurants & supermarkets, so you won\u2019t go hungry till 3 am.Things to eat & drink: Doner Kebab (national snack) and Turkish coffee! Most restaurants will have the usual Mediterranean appetizers (like hummus), and usually serve you a basket of freshly baked Turkish bread. Try their meat & seafood dishes. They play very well with spices, so you will enjoy it. Don\u2019t eat from dodgy places. Last thing you want is food poison. Galata Bridge has some of the funkiest eateries, and stall markets.Take the following:1. Camera and the charger2. Get Turkish Lira before you travel3. Take some Euros too, just in case5. Clothes according to the weatherHave fun!"

We wanted their advice on the various Turkish apple teas but they were so rude that we walked out the shop and purchased elsewhere.Next we headed to the wharf where we would meet the boat. We were disappointed to find that we went on the regular hop on hop off river boat. There was a commentary on the boat in Turkish and then English in between times our \"guide\" repeated what had just been said (although he did occasionally add some additional bits of information).When we got back to the bus we were offered the chance to go to a leather outlet which was refused by all on board.

They also have a metro line connecting all of these which you may consider taking to the Galata bridge, Galata tower and the Spice bazaar if you are too tired to walk. Sea of Marmara, the Golden Horn, and the Bosporus add further to the beauty and charm of this place. I would recommend staying at a hotel in the Sultanahmet district that serves breakfast on the terrace with a view of the sea (there are many such!). Walk as much as possible to truly experience the city. Audio guides are available at all major attractions for an extra charge but I did not find them informative enough. You will be better off saving those liras and reading the information boards instead. There are some small cafes that are open till late night and serve good food at very reasonable prices.

There are also literally hundreds of restaurants to choose from, including loads with great roof terraces with views of the city and the sea. It's easy to find your way around and get oriented - oh and there's plenty of shopping nearby, too. Highly recommended."

Enjoy the area, and don't forget to walk to the Spice Market or Grand Bazaar..."

In the late afternoon older family members reserve spaces at the many picnic tables laid out in the Hippodrome.

This was truly ancient Istanbul/ Constantinople. Everywhere you walked, and you could walk everywhere, you encountered historical sites. Plus the area had great restaurants and shops. The shop keepers were friendly and answered questions readily. We spoke only English but had no problems communicating. We were out into the evening hours and always felt safe, wherever we walked.

The big sights are here... the Blue mosque, Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sofia but also the fun little twisty lanes and ancient houses, great restaurants and yes, the carpet sellers! I got snagged when I had just arrived, jetlagged and was having a wander...I later learned it was the classic \"pick-up\" line...a handsome man approaches you speaking English while you are taking a photo or looking at your map. He offers to show you the Blue Mosque (or whatever), tells you he is not a tour guide just a Turkish citizen who wants you to be sure to see the Mosque because it will be closed tomorrow...or some version of that line. Off you go walking with him, he takes cuts in the huge line of tourists and in you go. After that lovely favor he has done...you says thanks, but wait! His family happens to have a carpet shop and he would like to just show you....before you can say Visa or Master card, you are having rug shipped home...which is OK if you want a beautiful rug, but if not, just stick to your wandering about. It is all very safe and if you get lost like I did, just ask anyone. It helps to carry a card from your hotel as well, so the language issue doesn't hinder you. Be sure to take water with you...it is hotter than you think and it is a lot of walking on cobblestones. You can also pop into a bar or restaurant and enjoy a tea...please don't waste your money on Turkish wine, but the Effes beer is quite good!"

You will find the same stores and cafes and at a reasonable price. In case you plan to take a day trip to the Bosporus river then there are people standing besides the Haga Sophia church and selling the same cruise at 15 \u20ac!! we were cheated by the shops selling the same tour @ 35 \u20ac...That apart even a doner is so costly from 9-10 TL whereas 2 stops down you will get it for half the price...do not be in a hurry to shop from this street.Rather enjoy the beautiful blue mosque.Sit around and take a breath taking view of the churches and monuments....1"

Also, when entering the Grand Bazaar, make a note of the Gate number (written on the gate archway), this will help if you get separated from other members of your party or wish to visit an area of the bazaar later.

There are new(ish) areas, very old and decrepit areas, many small twists and turns- and all of it very interesting and a little more exotic than Europe. Five times a day you hear the call to prayer over loudspeakers, which is actually pretty cool. You can stop anywhere for an apple tea (\"chai\" is tea here) or an Efes (beer), although some restaurants don't serve alcohol. Tons of little shops selling rugs, tiles, scarves. Everyone has a relative in America, and everyone has prices that you'll never believe -- you're always \"the first customer of the day\" so you get a very special price. You can usually get them down about 80% just by not being interested. A few streets will take you to the seashore, which is undeveloped but has big rocks you can sit on, and great views. After a day or so it becomes very comfortable and a great place to walk around at any time, from early morning to late night."

From the old city you can easily walk down to the quieter waterfront and stroll for kilometres along a pretty esplanade. Back in the old city there's cafes, restaurants, street food, ATMs, tour shops, souvenir shops (cheap or expensive), carpet and leather sellers, little hotels and a myriad of other wares and it seems every one of them has a person standing out front trying their very best to coax you inside theirs. This may get a little overwhelming, but politeness goes a long way when dealing with these guys and so does a bit of good humour.

For our first experience, I am really glad we stayed in this touristy area, as it set us within walking distance of the top things on our list. That Sultanahmet is touristy does not mean that it is without local flavor. We rented apartments down the hill to the south of the sites, in one of the neighborhood strips. This added a special flare to our experience with fruit vendors passing by in the morning and utilizing corner shops for groceries, etc. again, for our first experience, staying in Sultanahmet was important. We would probably consider other options for our next visit.Some tips for staying in Sultanahmet:1. Look into renting apartments. This saved us a ton of cash as we could cook our own meals. And it gave us a lot more room to spread out.2. Expect hills. Up, up, up.3. Don't be afraid of the tram. It passes right through Sultanahmet with a stop near the Constantine Tower, as well as Hagia Sophia, and down by the water near the Bosphorus tour boats and Egyptian Bazaar. 4. There is a Starbucks on the main road in Sultanahmet, between the Hagia Sophia and the Constantine Tower."

Many of the roads are cobblestone and some are a bit hilly, so comfy shoes are a must.Yes, it can be a bit annoying to have men constantly touting for business, but they are just doing what they need to do. We quite often joked with them in response to their light-hearted flirting.

English is spoken in most shops, hotel , restaurant , but knowing some Turkish words will help with taxi drivers . One thing they won't tell you , is that he area is connected with narrow alleys where taxi drivers do not like to go , even though we met some honest taxi drivers but couple of them would refuse to drop us of I front f our hotel. Good news is that Istanbul has plenty of clean restrooms for only one Turkish lira (70 cents).With all the great hospitality and good food, you are face with numerous cigarette smokers who are polluting the air including the inside of hotel, bazaar , restaurants , front of the shops etc.Do not start a conversation with shop salesmen if you do not want to buy otherwise they won't leave you alone.Having plenty of Turkish lira will help , you can get a better rate at the exchange office ( not banks)' they do not change money!!!!!!.The food in the restaurants are goo but little pricy , we were very disappointed on our return trip, the airport was hotter than hell at 3 am . Automated dispensing machine was in Turkish And accepted only credit card to purchase water or soda.Good news , there was plenty of porters who were happy to help with the luggages for 10 lira"

That said its a great place to eat, just take your time when choosing where to stop. When we were there major work was ongoing which will make walking much easier but cobbles are an issue. Cash machines are plenty full and all shops seem to take plastic so no need to carry large amounts of cash. I would say a minimum 3 day full day stay, but it can be done in less if you plan well - but who plans that well & wandering is part of the charm of the area. Safe feeling when out, day or night but minimum police presence was evident. A must visit destination."

I didn't take the traffic jams to and from the Airport (S. Gokcen) to town into account. An hour and a half each way for the HAVATAS shuttle bus (13 TL each way). The shuttle takes you to the Takses neighborhood - very fashionable broad and long shopping street. On the 4 km walk to the Sultanahmet district I found the crowds - on mainly local people very impressive. It took 2 hours to walk 4 km!Great shops and resturaunts. At the Spice Market - the crowds became impossible to transverse. I think early morning might be a better bet - or midweek....Definitely a city to visit - but use the public transport to get around!Plan to take it slow!"

Only negative thing i can say for travellers with younger kids is that there are no playgrounds. Just beside the Blue Mosque there is a big green area with banks where street sellers offer you everything even tea! and there, kids can feed the birds. But there are no restaurants offering activities for younger kids or any other attractions that younger kids can enjoy except the month of Ramadan.

Ignore the constant calls for your attention (especially if you are a woman travelling alone, though some comments will definitely make you laugh) and explore the city safely. Some of the side-streets off the main strip of Divan Yolu have lovely eateries at very reasonable prices. And the currency exchange offices all along the street have reasonable exchange rates too.

I recommend booking one of the many great hotels there, and using the free, offline Istanbul TripAdvisor city app to look up reviews. All the streets are lined with scammy restaurants and shops, and their owners will endlessly haggle you to come in and spend money. The shops never close - almost all were still open at midnight when we were walking around. Many of the restaurants are tourist scams - Wikitravel's Istanbul article lays it out nicely if you want more elaboration. Bottom line - don't go into a store and buy anything without an idea of how much it normatively costs, and don't eat anywhere without looking up reviews and ensuring you are receiving the menu with the lowest prices (i.e. preprinted and with Turkish & English). Be prepared for gypsies and other street vendors everywhere you look and many stray dogs and cats."

I cannot express how clean it is. Plus, they are still working on some things, so it's bound to be even better in the future. Istanbul knows what it's doing with making things accessible. Next to the Blue Mosque is the Hippodrome, which is underrated. It's very interesting to walk around, to imagine chariots racing each other around the column and the still-standing obelisk. (How can that still be standing?! It's amazing) When you come to Istanbul, plan to stay in this district for quite some time. It's old and beautiful and connects you to the past.

Then, two lovely historic edifice will greet you, as soon as you enter Sultanahmet park, the magnificent Blue Mosque and the charming Hagia Sophia. Sunrises here are spectacularly serene and peaceful. You will wake up to the sound of flying seagulls and the daily morning prayer. Never miss the grilled kebabs in Turkey, considered to be the best in the world. They have one of the nicest people around. This place has to be on the top of my list. An instant favorite!"

It is especially irritating when one has only a few days of precious time to enjoy all that Istanbul offers.As documented elsewhere, these guys (and they all seem to be men) approach tourists, ostensibly to become their new best friend, and simply will NOT take \"No!\" for an answer. It seems that the more politely one says \"no\" the more eager they become to tag along with you. If you try to escape by entering an attraction, the person will wait for you to come out (if there is only one exit.)

This is truly one of the world's most remarkable squares - the Blue Mosque to the west, the Hagia Sophia to the east, and behind the HS, the Topkapi Palace with its extensive grounds and gardens. Besides the buildings themselves, there are lots of little craft stands and cafes where you can stop for a bite or admire Turkish wares. Nearby is the Mosaic museum and a lovely long bazaar with lots of tourist-friendly shops. *But the annoying and continuous persistence of the tour guides and jewelry/rug salesmen can be extremely vexing.* I am a patient and polite person at heart (from the Pacific Northwest), but I had to put my game face on and hold up a hand with a head shake that meant business at frequent intervals. Don't feel bad if you have to get loud and direct, or just walk briskly away - it's not your job to fill their quotas. Outside of this one area, I had hardly difficulty in Istanbul at all with overly aggressive sales people. Go, just go with some psychic armor."

Sultanahmet is the perfect place to live for a 3-5 day visit in Istanbul, because everything is nearby; The Blue Mosque, Topikapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, the Sultan's hammam(bath house), tours on Bosporos, the Grand Bazaar...It is a nice quiet area, with small shops and restaurants as well as bigger places.The streets around the Mosque can be crowded with \"guides\" really wanting to sell you expensive goods, so beware. Instead choose the small shops and quieter streets, down the hill from the Mosque or around the more quiet corners. It is absolutely possible to do good bargains, but please be sure that what you buy is really worth it. Check more places before you decide on carpets and jewellery, as the prices normally start out very high. And even then you should be careful. Women travelling alone do not have to wear headscarfs but it helps a lot, especially as the men are much more clingy to women who does not wear them.Istanbul has an openminded style, but in the tram there are pickpockets and in theGrand Bazaar you should not pay more than half the asking price.The park with the big fountain is lovely and there are several nice restaurants in the area. The hammam was expensive, but worth the price! Newly renovated and with good massage and soapwash, in calm, luxurious rooms with your own locker room and loads of time to relax after treatment. Very friendly and nice women work there, and there are offers for a lot of different packages."

After our visit this is our order of preference:1) Ayasofya Camii, 2) The Cistern, 3) Boat trip on Bosphorous (2 hours 10 Turkish Lira each), 4) Topkapi Palace and Harem, 5) The Spice Bazaar, 6) The Grand Bazaar, 7) Blue Mosque 8) Guilhane Park alongside the Topkapi, (look for storks nesting in the trees if you are there in spring), 9) The Hippodrome where chariots raced (near the blue mosque), 10) the Galata Tower, (not really in Sultanahmed but not far) great views over Istanbul (TIP: there is an arrow showing a one way direction around the top, but when it is busy it is difficult to see, also remember to use the toilet next to the lifts on way down, they are 'free' now you have paid for your visit and very clean).TIPS:Prices seems higher around the Topkapi Palace but drop within a relatively short distance.A downside for us was that traders were constantly trying to engage us in conversation and asking us to to look at something. This may be OK for the first store or restaurant, but it happens at the next, and the next and... We found a simple and polite way to stop them was to say, \u201cI already have one\u201d, \u201cI've just eaten\u201d, \u201cI've already been\u201d or something similar, depending on the circumstances. Prices for things like nuts and Turkish delight tend to be priced per kilo. This is not always obvious and can make them look prohibitively expensive, which they are not.Some people just wanted to talk or practice their English. We even had a conversation with an old lady who spoke fluent German to our broken school German. However, two traders developed a dark side to their chat; \u201cYou promised to come in\u201d which we didn't, and \u201cYou people come here but don't want to spend any money\u201d- not true. So my advice would be to try not to get involved unless you are sure it is appropriate.Try the apple tea and different Turkish delights.The round bread rolls with seeds on the outside were really nice and filling. They cost 1 Turkish Lira each from street vendors and were handled hygienically with plastic bags/gloves and handed to you in a plastic or paper bag. If you have a good breakfast, they make an excellent stop gap before you have lunch or dinner.Following tram tracks can help you find you way round easily, going down hill will get you to the Bosphorous and, going up hill, back to the Grand Bazaar area.Be careful with the traffic. It seemed to be quite common for bikes and vans to use what we would think of, as pedestrian areas. Also keep your eyes open as there are many changes of levels and unprotected steps on pavements."

A minor thing to be cognizant of, there are cats all over this district. All have their home areas and are cared for by the locals. (I would assume they're valued as rat catchers.)

It was a great experience just to walk about. All the vendors on the streets selling their wares. Sometimes you can buy something from the street vendors that will cost you double at the Grand Bazar, (as I sadly found out to late).Walking the streets late at night is especially wonderful. So alive, so busy so different. The shop windows made me stop in awe as to the array of foods available. Just get out there and walk - and if you tire, hop on a tram and just ride up and down the street - you can see so much that way without the leg power."

I will prefer to stay somewhere else - probably around Taksim or Bey\u00f6glu areas. But if you only visit Istanbul for the first time for a less than a week, I don't see the reason not to. Yes, the constant - at times persistent - advance by those shops and other street entrepreneurs can be frustrating, but after awhile, we decided to take it with some sense of humour. Yes, most restaurants are overpriced, except probably Doy Doy behind the Blue Mosque which became our sort of local, but it's also a short walk to Sirkeci area where cheaper local cafes such as Fasuli can be found. The area is within walking distance to those main historical sites - which it is a great introduction to Istanbul (well, for the first timer like me), but if one needs to go deeper, then she/he needs to simply do some research and explore the other areas in the city. I decided to first explore the 'old' Istanbul, before treading its new parts, that was how Sultanahment fell into my itinerary the first place."

Sultanhamet has the three most important historical sites in Istanbul (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, and Topkapi Palace), and thus is the center of tourism. It is also the only part of the city where you will be surrounded by gift shops, rug shops, and over priced restaurants, all geared to the tourist trade. My suggestion would be to stay somewhere else (Taksim Square area would be great, but really anywhere near the tranvia line is fine) and just go to Sultanhamet to visit the sites. Yes, it is neat walking by the Blue Mosque every day, but being hassled by all of the people trying to get you in their stores/restaurants is tiresome, and it really is not at all representative of Instanbul, nor Turkey, nor Turkish people as a whole. Also, if you stay here, you run the risk of not seeing anywhere else, which means you will end up missing out on what a great place Turkey really is. The Fatih district, right next to Sultanhamet, is a little better, but it is a lot seedier, still kind of touristy (particularly in terms of the restaurants), and not very conveniently located in terms of the tramvia unless you are up by the main boulevard. Something across the bridge on the \"Golden Horn\" would be much better in my opinion. Taksim Square is the center of night-life in Istanbul, so if you like lots of cool bars it is definitely the best choice."

If you have the energy there's also the blue mosque, a bevy of Sultans' tombs (and those of the siblings they strangled to avoid competition), the site of the old hippodrome (where some sensible chap called Belisarius slaughtered 30,000 rowdy sports fans in the 6th century), and the best lukum shop in Istanbul."

If you are here for more than a week then this can get very wearying and trying. Please note that after dark the area is patrolled by men who will try and get you to go with them to bars, particularly in the Golden Horn. If you go with them expect to be scammed of at least everything you are carrying and probably more. Take care not to spoil your holiday. Additionally, there are quite a few street children who prey on kind-hearted tourists and it can be hard to spot whether they are genuinely in distress until you have seen them pulling the same tricks for several days. * Worth going? Oh yes. I keep going back, but take care."

I'd say you need to spend two days here if you want to take in these sights, not just visit them. You can take long breaks between them sitting on the benches around the fountain and the tiny park or savoring Turkish dishes in one of the many restaurants located there. Make sure you stay till the night falls to see the sights illuminated.

Therefore, I didn't really get to experience the beautiful Bosphorus or seaside atmosphere. Rather, I spent the majority of my time in shops, restaurants, and attractions in the Sultanahmet district. Yes, the area is very touristic, and I heard more people speaking in English and Italian than in Turkish... however, if you're a foreigner with a limited understanding of public transportation in Istanbul, it's definitely the best place to stay while in the city! Within 15 minutes you can walk to most brand-name shops, the Grand Bazaar (waste of time), Blue Mosque, Ayasofya, Basilica Cistern, and many restaurants. Naturally, beware of prices at all sites and restaurants... they are inflated in this area because it is full of tourists. Also, double-check all prices before paying as well as change. It wasn't uncommon for shops, museums, government offices to try to rip you off by stealing a few Turkish Lira from you. Always google the exchange rate for Euro in the morning so that you can ensure that shops aren't charging you too much in Lira, as they often list the price in Euro rather than Lira. If you're in the area, I recommend staying off of the main street with the trams and exploring the side streets. There you will find cheaper restaurants, a cinema, shopping centers, and artisanal shops. As always, be smart with your belongings as theft is not uncommon!"

This is because the majority of the streets are steep and not very wide, so it is impossible to have a lot of huge hotels.A good option would be to spend 2 nights on a hotel on this area, and then another 1 or 2 on Beyoglu / Taskism area, so that you can experience both walking or using public transport for short rides.Avoid the restaurants if you want a decent meal.

We were in Istanbul in the first few days of December this year and, despite ministrations from well-meaning friends that Turkey was hardly the place to go to at this time of the year, fell in love with this charming city the moment we walked out of the Ataturk airport. It is a place where the ancient and the modern co-exist in perfect harmony. The Sultanahmet district more than any other part of Istanbul best embodies this symmetry. All the major historical sights of Istanbul lie within a radius of three-fourths of a kilometre of Sultanahmet Square, Istanbul's crown jewel. The wide open spaces, the quaint palm trees lining the perfectly--paved walkways, the many-coloured fountains that light up the square after sunset, and the stunning view of Hagia Sophia looming from behind these fountains -- and yes, the carts selling freshly-roasted chestnuts and vanilla-flavoured teas, together make an hour spent here in the evening a memorable experience, relaxing and exhilarating at the same time. We sat there the first evening, after visiting the Blue Mosque and the Basilica Cistern-- and could not help coming back to it every evening we were there. Yes, there are vendors goimg about trying to sell their wares, and tour operators inviting you to book a trip on one of their excursions-- but each one of them has the innate tact and courtesy that distinguishes practically everybody in Istanbul from people in other metros in most parts of the world: they never hard-sell their stuff , never get on your nerves and always take a 'no' with a polite smile. The Square is a perfectly safe place too, and my daughter and I happen to have walked in the deserted Square well after ten on a windy winter night , never feeling insecure or threatened. That night we were privileged to see something truly extra-ordinary: high up in the sky on the full-moon night, a flock of seagulls was going round and round one of the Mosque's brightly-lit, tall turrets, their white bodies beautifully complementing the blue sky and the reddish-brown light from the turret. I will not forget Sultanahmet in a hurry!"

Also watch out for Taxi drivers on the make with fake 50TL notes and literally taking the tourist route, ask the Four Seasons (or other good hotel) to call a Taxi and those drivers seem trustworthy. Also watch out for fake tourists/locals who will ask you take their picture and then offer to treat you to some Turkish Tea as they will try and take you to a leather, carpet shops or a fish restaurant. Great sights but Istanbul police need crack down on these touts."

Most salesmen would lead with \"where are you from\" as though they were going to be helpful - though we didn't need any help. A few would follow trying to start a conversation for 3-5 minutes. When the same guy approached me for the 3rd time in 3 days, I knew I wasn't making enough of a negative impression.If has been about a month since I returned, yet this is what I remember most about the local people. Sad.There were some guys trying to sell upscale tours in the Ayasofya area too - they were professional and polite. Never a bother at all.The Hippodrome area has the top 7 sites all together, but seeing them all in one day would be nearly impossible unless you were extremely rushed. 1.5 days would probably be fine, if it wasn't during a busy period.Restaurants in this part of town will be much more expensive than elsewhere, but the food will be fine to fantastic and the staff's command of English more than sufficient to prevent mixups. I'm positive their English is better than my Turkish!"

Only drawback was the vendors who wanted you come to their shops. I finally turned rude. Interesting to me were the friendly cats which appeared everywhere, particularly at the mosques. I noticed people putting cat food out to make sure they were fed. The ones venturing in public all looked fed and kept themselves clean. The streets are mostly cobblestone, lots of hills, and there is a lot of uneven-ness. Would be hard for people with major disabilities. I navigated ok with my 2 arthritic knees."

There is so much history in the area that has been preserved, from the cobblestone roads to the buildings. If you stay here then you will be able to get to all the major attractions in the area by walking. A tram will drop you off right in the heart of the area. I felt 2 days was perfect to see most of the major sights without rushing, but I did not get to see anything else in Istanbul. Also keep in mind that a lot of attractions close around 5:30-6:00p (at least in November), so plan your trip accordingly."

There is an abundance of hotels, many of which are smaller boutique hotels housed in renovated old buildings, a variety of restaurants with menus of a wide price range, bars, small clubs, shops selling Turkish crafts, fashion and accessories especially scarves, etc. Shops and restaurants tucked away in small hidden streets tend to have lower prices, while those on the main drag charge the most. Mature travelers may find this district more appealing than the modern Taksim area & Istiklal Street frequented by the younger set due to the large number of cafes and bars and a boisterous nightlife. Sultanahmet is much quieter at night.Sultanahmet gets overrun by tourists in the summer, its main drag congested with foot traffic during the day and early evening. In the large public areas. if you're a woman walking alone- young men loitering there may follow & try to befriend you, starting by asking \"Where are you from?\" or some other cliches. It is best to keep your personal distance and go on your own way."

Tips:- Go very early or very late for entering Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sofia. It is worth it.- Check Tripadvisor reviews to find the best restaurants in the area.- There are bazaar, restaurants and shops that will sell you everything almost 24/7.- If you dont buy anything from street vendors, most will say 'Sorry, No English?!', Buy something from the vendors like the bread or corn, and they'll be your friends and they speak to you in fluent English."

I've been back twice since. Its charm never wanes. In fact it has improved over the years due to the more relaxed attitudes of the locals. No longer are you hustled into shops to buy trinkets or carpets. It is a great place to stay as there is so much happening here and it's easy to get a tram to Taksim or other areas each day. For cheap, lovely accommodation try Antique Hostel or the more frequently available but less beautiful Nobel Hostel around the corner. For something more luxurious but small and romantic, try Hotel Zoe. These are all a stone's throw from Sultanahmet square. Plenty of others though."

Many of the restaurants are expensive to very expensive and their claims of 'authentic food' stretch the truth quite often but it is possible to find a reasonably priced meal if you're looking for it.A carnival atmosphere seems to preside, especially in the open area between the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. The fact that this is a popular meeting place for Istanbulians adds to this. There is still a hint of Turkish authenticity to the place but the \"Brand\" stores are beginning their approach. The plethora of persons, shops and services that are determined to part you from your money makes me feel as if the area has lost some of its soul or maybe a new one is being forged in a 'Turkish bazaar' kind of way.I'm certainly NOT suggesting you shouldn't go there. In fact, you can't avoid this area if you're doing your job as a tourist properly but you need to get further afield to experience the real Istanbul."

Impressive sights, especially if not obscured by a heavy coat of tourists. Walk around the open areas after dark when the tourists are snug in their hotels and the sites are lit up. The bad: Not enough main sites. The number of tourists divided by the number of sites equals madhouse. The early bird catches the sites before the mob.The ugly: (1) The friendly, uninvited guide. I call them fishermen. The tourist walking with any hesitation concerning his destination is the fish. We are yanked into the carpet store, hopefully not entirely off track from the intended destination. Tip: Ask the fisherman whether he knows a good place to sell carpets - you're trying to get rid of some. The fisherman quickly cuts bait.(2) The taxis. Taxis are allergic to Sultanahment. They don't know their way around and don't want to learn. Their idea of a destination is the neighbourhood, not the specified address. I wonder how the deluxe hotels manage the obstinate taxi drivers. On one occasion, two taxi drivers engaged in a good chat declined to take us, indicating that the hotel was only two or three kilometers and that we should walk.More tips: 1) Get the hotel to identify a taxi-friendly location on the rim of the district which is within walking distance of the hotel. 2) Have a good map or GPS. 3) Learn to take the trams OR, failing all of that, stay in the hotel and look at pictures of Sultanahmet."

A trip up & down the Bosphorus was offered by 2 people at just 15 euros each (list price 20 euros this company, more from others) starting from the area beside fountains near Blue Mosque. Very pleasant on our Sunday afternoon (as markets closed I think) . It's always worth asking for a lower price for everything, although there were some small shops by the Blue Mosque that had realistic prices displayed for small touristy bits & pieces.The street food we tried (chicken pitta near market) was also very reasonable and tasty (2.5 TL = about \u00a31) .We expected to use trams, but didn't need to as all pretty close together in this district."

Its lovely and keeps really well.Do be patient tho if you have time to look around. I liked a lovely warm scarf that was being sold for about 30 pounds and I ended up buying the same scarf at the Viewpoint for the Golden Horn River for only 14 pounds!"

The chortles cater or all price ranges but expect to pay about \u00a380 per double room with breakfast which will be typical Turkish. The area is hilly and the cobbled stones near some repair. High heels are not recommended. The place is well linked by the tram which is cheap and regular. The Grand Bazaar is something else. It is like a tardis you can get lost for hours and be prepared to haggle. What ever is the asking price half it and don't be embarrassed or shy about it. You are expected to haggle. A lot of people stay near Taksim square which is more modern but for menot a patch on Sultamahmet. By the way the atmosphere in Sulthanahmet during Ramadan is like a carnival with families gathered around the blue mosque and street traders everywhere you feel that you have been transported to the Istanbul of the 14c AD quite amazing."

Looking around just mesmerizes you by the sheer presence of some of the world's most renowned structures. The Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Arasta bazaar, Basilica Cistern....the list is endless. Each place unique...each place with a story. The quaint hotels with their restaurants on the street give it a rich look..the cobbled streets transfer you to the 18th Century. It is always advisable to stay in one of the hotels in Sultanahmet and then explore Istanbul. It all started here for Constantinople as a trade route. And who can forget the Museum of Archaeology with its astounding collections of artifacts, mummies, stone carvings, pieces from Troy and the huge collection of sarcophagi! Sultanahmet will leave you spellbound and you will truly be in the Lap of History!"

Do buy the tickets so that you can get by the lines without waiting. We had no big push to buy Turkish carpets with one exception...a kind guy seemed like a tour guide but was really a salesperson who gave a \"tour\".

Read any tour book or other reviews here and you'll quickly learn that Sultanahmet is the home of most of the more notable, centuries-old sites in Istanbul. There are a plethora of hotels ranging from backpack-budgets to a Four Seasons. We hit a number of restaurants and they all serve pretty much the same food in this area. It's good, but it's mostly a variation of one sort or another on kabops. But it is good! Roof top restaurants abound with great views of the Bosphorus. The area is best covered on foot and you need to be able to handle hills. It's not quite as steep or as high as San Francisco or Seattle if that's any help. Also, in general, there are stairs and no wheel chair access. Hold the negative judgements. It's just the way it is. Do not expect great clubs here. Those are up north mostly on the west side of the Boshporus. That's where you will find the swanky night life and very nice hotels to strictly relax. If I was with a lover, I might just stay up there and catch a cab to Sultanahmet for the sites and do the night life up north."

Indeed, top sights such as the Blue Mosque, Ayasofia, Topkapi Palace or the Basilica Cisterna are all in Sultanahmet. I was there during the Ramadan and at night, it's the noisiest and liveliest place of Istanbul. Everybody is eating with friends or family in the parc near the tram station and the obelisks. It's worth to see this ! Sultanahmet is also a very good idea to explore Turkey's huge choice of food! Kebabs, baklava, Turkish delights, ..., there is everything. The drawback is that it's one of the most touristy places of Istanbul and as a consequence, prices (especially for food) are sometimes double compared to other quieter areas and you have a very very high chance to be ripped off in those shops or restaurants (experienced myself several times until I understood what was the \"normal\" price)."

I usually like to stay in the Old City so that I am only a short walk from all of these sites.

Both are also quite a lot more expensive than the more outlying areas of the city. Difference is that dining in Sultanahmet is quite pricey while you can get some nice cheap places in Khao San.I guess if you want a more Turkish experience and have an adventurous streak in you, there are much better places to stay in Istanbul. Just make sure it's close to a tram line and you will be all set and will definitely save a lot more on dining and accommodation!"

Initially I was aware of the salespeople saying hi all the time, and of potential pickpockets, as other reviewers had pointed out. The area is however extremely safe. I even walked around by myself (many friends had told me that women are not to walk by themselves...? not sure what that was about) on Sunday evening, in the Grand Bazaar area, where everything was closed. I saw many groups of men together and was never approached by any of them. That was amazing. Had I been in Brazil...the story would have been much different. The bottom line is that this is EXTREMELY safe. I also attended the international folk dance competition (just behind Hagia Sofia) two nights in a row (started around 9pm). I sat next to folks who seemed to come from Turkey, and started talking to them. Most of them did not speak English. So that gave me the perfect opportunity to try my almost inexistent Turkish on them :) Sure enough, they were ready to help! I went from 'tamam' to 'teshekur ederim', 'gule gule', 'iyi gunler' in 5 minutes. After that I kept repeating these so I wouldn't forget them, and they laughed at me. That was really cool. I so loved to interact with them. They let me take pictures of them and pointed to the dancing folks and gave me thumbs up when they were liking the group. I so enjoyed the people here!"

            "review": "The heart of Old Istanbul. The Sultanahmet District is the heart of Old Istanbul. It sprawls over a ridge-line high above the European side of the city, and looks down on the busy Bosphorus waterway. It contains all the ancient monuments and buildings and tourist sites which make Old Istanbul famous \u2026 such as the Ottoman Sultan\u2019s Palace (Topkapi) the fabulous Hagia Sophia, the imposing Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome, the underground Byzantine Cistern, the Archaeological Museum, and even the Grand Bazaar.The district itself takes its name from the Sultanahmet Mosque (known commonly as the Blue Mosque because of the abundance of blue tiles inside). This great mosque, built in 1616 by Sultan Ahmet 1) is instantly recognisable by its six minarets (most other mosques in the area have from one to four minarets).Because it\u2019s so famous and rich in history, Sultanahmet is also crowded with hotels and tourists. Fortunately, the city building laws limit house sizes in this area to three-stories, so there are no high-rise buildings to spoil the skyline. Consequently the sights are there to be seen.They are, however, usually crowded with tourists, both foreign and domestic, so my best advice is to go either very early in the morning (before the big tourist busses start arriving) or go late in the evening (when the big tourist busses have left). That\u2019s the time I find it easiest to access the major sights without waiting in queues for hours. This advice applies particularly to Topkapi Palace, where you need to arrive as early as possible because queues form here early and are sometimes huge (but don\u2019t let this put you off because Topkapi is really worth visiting and if you're there by eight when the doors open you can get a ticket and have an hour of relatively uncrowded enjoyment.) Also, a little tip for shoppers: the museum shop just inside the Topkapi Palace gate is better than the one beside the ticket office outside.)The other challenge for visitors to Sultanahmet is that the district is perched on a steep ridge-line, and while the central area is reasonably flat, the streets all around are often cobbled and often run steeply downhill to the water. So, depending on your level of fitness, walking around the district can be a challenge to some.Getting there: The easiest way to visit the sights in Sultanahmet is to book a hotel in the district. There are plenty \u2026 some closer than others. They all claim to be excellent and to have wonderous views, but be cautious with these claims \u2026 check the reviews carefully and look for photos closely because some hotels are not all they claim to be. However there are some truely excellent hotels in the area (for example: see my review of the Ottoman Hotel Imperial in Sultanahmet). If your hotel is not in the Sultanahmet district, the easiest way to get there from other parts of Istanbul is by ferry to Eminonu near the Galata Bridge, and then catch the tram uphill to the district. Get off at the first stop past the Hagia Sophia. Trams are easy and quick. You buy tokens at each tram stop (there\u2019s one right beside the Eminonu ferry wharf near the Galata Bridge) and hop aboard for a ride up Alemdar Cadessi to Hagia Sophia and the main Sultanahmet area. The trip takes just a few minutes and costs two tokens (about one US$). If you\u2019re fit for a walk, just follow the tram tracks uphill. It\u2019s not steep and will take you 25 minutes, and there are shops and restaurants along the way.Bottom line: If you\u2019re visiting Istanbul, you MUST visit Sultanahmet. The best of the city is here. But wear stout shoes for the cobblestone streets, carry a good map, go early & be prepared for a full day out. Oh, and take a camera, because it\u2019s very photogenic."

In Sultanahmet's imperial days, traders sold spices from distant dominions in the bazaars, dignitaries hunted in parks lining the Bosporus, & buildings rose to immortalise the sultans. So the location is very old & very interesting with many historic treasures. Sultanahmet is right at the heart of the old European city & is a highly recommended place to stay. The old town centre was once the heart of Ottoman life & for first time visitors to Istanbul, the allure of the old city is inescapable.I found the ideal way to explore Sultanahmet is on foot - it is compact & seemed to be safe. The city's buses, trams & trains are also easy - you can find information at the Tourist Information place. The Sultanahmet area is handy for trams to modern Istanbul. If you use a taxi, ALWAYS be sure to agree a taxi fare with your driver before setting off. But proceeding through the city at a leisurely pace, taking the time to really enjoy the surroundings, the buildings and the people, means you have time to notice all the little things, from the man selling peeled & salted cucumbers, to the dilapidated posters of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey, that still adorn cafe walls.Wear very comfy shoes. The stairs/steps are very uneven & the streets are very rough cobblestone.Take your own scarf for your head to enter the mosques. Shorts are inappropriate in the mosques as are sleeveless tops. They will loan you a cape to wear (that everyone else has worn).THINGS TO DOFirst it's time for some consumer culture! Allow plenty of time in the Grand Bazaar. Make sure you try bargaining, too - the locals love it when you do. Annoying carpet-traders are a fact of life - keep on walking, avoid eye contact & don't answer questions if you are not interested.If you get hungry/thirsty, Erenler Cay Bahcesi, Yeniceriler Caddesi 36/28, Cemberlitas is an old city nargilah cafe tucked away in a former medrese (Islamic school building) near the Grand Bazaar. Men in uniform hurry from table to table with trays of tea glasses & cups of thick Turkish coffee & shovels full of hot coals to stoke the nargileh pipes.In the Spice Market Bazaar henna is heaped into green cones & fist-like sponges are strung from the ceiling.The Yerebatan underground cisterns are worth a visit for the carved stone columns used willy-nillyYou can view treasures in the Topkapi Palace - from mosaic rooms & acres of manicured gardens - once lit by tortoises carrying candles on their backs - to the centuries of bling kept in the dimly cabinets of the Treasury.Exhausted by the strain of not buying a kelim in the Bazaar, you can find respite in one of Istanbul's most famous sights, one of the more than 3,000 top mosques.Rustem Pasa Mosque within easy walking distance of the Spice Bazaar showcases exquisite Iznik tiles, which cover the walls, columns & facade of its porchHundreds of tiny glass lamps hang low from the roof of the Blue Mosque on wheels of iron, & appreciating the glamorously tiled dome gave me a crick in the neck!Once a Byzantine church only for Christians, then made into a magnificent mosque, the Hagia Sophia is now a museum. Glorious, mosaic-filled & not to be missed.  Most of all.......HAVE FUN!"

Not really knowing what we were doing, a local rug merchant approached us and gave us a nice tour of the area, which was great. The blue mosque was very interesting. Then he took us back to his rug shop and served us drinks. We ended up buying two rugs and spending way more than we had planned. Later we had a good dinner in one of the local cafes. It is about 45 minutes cab ride from the airport, about 45 Turkish lira ($25) for the fare."

It is very pleasant to walk through the cobbled streets and explore (even though when I was visiting it was snowing pretty hard- thus a little less enjoyable than I'm sure it would have been in better weather). Naturally, it is overrun with tourists pretty much year round but that also makes for great people watching.

Many restaurants and small convenience shops scattered all over the area, many small family owned restaurants with amazing and inexpensive home-made food. We walked everywhere from it. We also saw Taksim Square and we felt that we made a right choice by staying in this district instead. We felt that Istiklal street was somewhat overrated. Perhaps other major cities have spoiled us and this street did not measure up to them. We will be back :-)"

We took this 3 day trip for our Daughters 40th Birthday to Istanbul and stayed in Sultanahmet which is very close to a lot of the more interesting historical sights in Istanbul. We stayed at the Ottoman hotel Imperial which is a small boutique hotel with a special certificate. It has a lot of history at this hotel very interesting as it used to be occupied by the army and was a school also. It has subsequently been renovated into a very beautiful boutique hotel with interesting decor the colours in the rooms are vibrant in reds and oranges very uplifting.The bedrooms were a little small but we thought it good value for money. The terrace area a lovely setting for breakfast with views over the domes. For sightseeing in Sultanahmet you were right there a few minutes walk away from the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia and Topkapi Palace.The Basilica Cystern was across the road .Breakfast was very good and tasty consisting of cold meats, fruit yog, cereals,and hot food etc a very good choice. The first day we thought it a good idea to orientate ourselves to the city and took a City Sightseeing tour bus around a really good idea and you could get on and off to see the sights. That day we also went to the Hagia Sofia and the Blue Mosque as very close together. The next day we went to the Grand Bazaar and the Basilica Cystern. We are going back to visit for 3 days this September as such a lot more to see such as Topkapi Palace and Dolmabahce Palace also the Egyptian Spice market. We also want to go on a Bosphorus cruise.You do have to be very aware of the pickpockets, bagsnatchers and the taxi scams the \"you only gave me 5 lira\", when you gave them 50 lira and do not agree to go with anyone that stops you in the streets especially if they want to befriend you and take you to a bar for drinks where you end up paying thousands of lira for a few drinks and some fruit. Do not engage in conversation with anyone who approaches you on the street as a general rule best to ignore them.If you answer politely they take this as encouragement. Forwarned is forarmed. None of this should put you off of what is essentially a wonderful and beautiful city with an endless wealth of history.We hope to use the same philosophy and common sense this September on our return to Istanbul."

If you are first-time visitors to Turkey like us, just walking through the Sultanahmet District of Istanbul, you immediately feel you're walking through history. There is so much to see and so much going on in this part of Istanbul that I believe, reading about it before your visit or taking a well-guided walking tour would certainly be worth doing. Otherwise, taking a stroll on a lovely sunny day or warm evening just to enjoy the sights & sounds of this amazing city should be part of the visit to Istanbul. Just like many big cities, I kind of expect that Istanbul is no exception as far as locals endlessly offering wares for sale, trying to make a living. But my personal experience of always responding with a smile and a definite no if I'm not interested at all always resulted in a positive way for me. Given the chance, we certainly will visit Istanbul again."

The Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Hippodrome area with the obelisks, Topkapi palace, Basilica Cistern and museums are within a block or two. The Egyptian/Spice market is about a10 minute walk from the Grand Bazaar down an alley downtoward the pier. Entry to the Blue Mosque is free, but be aware that you must be modestly dressed. Shoes must be removed before entrance (a plastic bag is provided) and ladies must have a head scarf and no sleeveless tops or shorts are tolerated. They will provide coverage if necessary. There are fees for all the other sights; we were on a tour so luckily we didn't have to deal with that,but all were worth it. Grand BazaarLoved this! But, you must Bargain, And Bargain hard. Start at half the asking price and slowly advance to what you feel it's worth. If you're not satisfied with one vendor, just move on to the .next. The people everywhere we went were so friendly, helpful and courteous. Bosphorus tourCheck the weather before booking this one. We went in late May and it was 40 degrees with 30 mph winds. I'm sure it would've been much more enjoyable on a clear, sunny day, because there are many beautiful and interesting sights to see. When walking around the Hippodrome/Mosque areas, you will be approached by someone asking if you need a tour, directions , pictures taken etc. Be aware, they are salesmen and after they take a pix or 2, they want to take you to their uncle's carpet shop.  FoodLoved the food in Turkey, but, must admit we did'nt always know what that great tasting meat on the spit really was! Tasted great and we never got sick ever! Wear sneakers or very comfortable shoes as there are many cobblestone streets and hills to deal with. You can get anywhere you need to by the trams that run thru the city to every imaginable place for 1.75 TL. We only changed money to get small bills for the trams. Every shop we went to accepted USD without a problem.  The street vendors are amazing! They sell everything from \"elastic\" ice cream\" with a show to pretzels, grilled corn on the cob, chestnuts and even grilled fish. Loved Istanbul! People are so friendly, helpful and courteous everywhere. 2nd time visitor to Turkey- not our last! Happy to answer questions."

There you go... you have a spare 6 euros in your pocket...Apart from what I said above...great place to see historical buildings and mosques, eat good meals and buy brilliant souvenirs."

The District itself is very nice, well kept, very clean and clearly marked with signs and directions. My main recommendation is: be ware of the restaurants in this area though. The food is expensive and people will pretend they do not speak english and put a ton of stuff in your plate (most places are set as buffet style) and you'll end up with a huge bill. This is an expensive place to buy souvenirs. If you want to buy pewter plates or artifacts it's best to do it OUTSIDE of the spice market. The little tents outside the market have very affordable and good quality items. The Sultanahment District is a MUST. Don't even think about missing it. Go to the Blue Moque, Hagia Sophia, the Hippodrome and Topkapi Palace during the day and enjoy the restaurants, the bars and the view at night."

Word of caution - the Grand Bazaar is incredibly huge, fascinating and confusing. Try using a guide or expect to get lost somewhere in this site. Also, we were not shopping for anything in particular and so the great number of jewelry, Turkish chotchkies etc. were not of much interest. The site was.

Bring lunch with you and have a picnic on the Hippodrome or in front of the Blue Mosque.TIP: This place is ripe with people pulling you into their carpet / leather / jewelry / ... shops. Most will strike up a conversation, and then proceed to take you to look at their wares. Bought a fantastic leather jacket this way, and the experience is really wonderful.

This place has so much history with all the museums and mosques and cobbled stone streets. Everything is within walking distance or very near the tram. Avoid taxis and walk the streets, take a wrong turn, get lost and find your way back and in between you will find the real Istanbul and have an amazing time. The Good:Old IstanbulHistoryMuseumsFoodTram stationsStreet VendorsShoppingThe BadSometimes too touristyAvoid the doner kebaps. I was so looking forward to eating doner kebaps, however I was very disappointed. It seems they only sell to tourists who dont know good food. The meat (what little they put in) is tasteless. You take a bite and you only get bread and some salad. Tips:1. Eat what the locals eat. We watched for a couple days and noticed that the locals hardly eat the doners from the street. Instead they eat Tost and we tried that and it was delicious. What is Tost? Basically a panini made with Turkish cheese and your choice of meats. 2. Also try the Islak, which is a wet burger - sounds unappetizing but believe me, try it - much better than the doner. 3. Definitely go to the Spice Bazaar - much friendlier vendors and their prices are reasonable - they dont quote you an outrageouse price then discount by 70% like in the Grand Bazaar. 4. Dont waste money on Bosphorus Tours. Get a good guide book then go to Eminonu and grab a Bosphorus Ferry cruise for around 10TL. 5. Do use the Trams. Very affordable and easy to navigate. Go to Kabatas and take the funicular up to Taksim Square. Much cheaper than a taxi and better experience."

We purchased multiple transport tokens and used the trams and ferries extensively. The Spice Market and wider area behind it was one of our favourite places. We often ate in little shops where English was not spoken but the smiles and friendliness of all made us feel welcome.We were approached all the time around major sites asking where we were from and offering to be a guide or take us to their shop around the corner. This was part of the charm of the area as these people had a delicious sense of humour and when you got speaking to them a story which often impressed. One person was able to converse in five languages of which we had a smattering and was thrilled when we told him we had visited his Kurdish town a few weeks earlier.When we return to Turkey we will again stay in Sultanahmet."

At the end of August, on the last Friday evening of Ramadan, my girlfriend and I arrived in Istanbul for the start of a 5-day visit. After checking into our hotel, we took a taxi up to Sultanahmet Square - actually, the area was so congested that our cab driver got us as close as possible, and then we had to walk the last couple block or so up the hill.Wow, what a crazy festive scene! It was after all after dark and time to break the fast. There were carts selling all kinds of snacks and desserts: grilled corn on the cob, handmade lollipops and ice cream, all kinds of things.Then there was the outdoor crafts fair, which apparently is open just for that last weekend of Ramadan. It was filled with crafts made by local artisans. My girlfriend bought a couple pairs of earrings, one for herself and pairs for her daughter and a friend or two. Walking through there, we met with a feast for the eyes.As we approached the Blue Mosque, the crowd grew thicker. There was, of course, one more prayer for the night, and people were gathering for that. We wanted to be respectful, but we were also curious to witness the pious fervor of Ramadan. Indeed, the prayers were broadcast over loud speaker, so that hundreds and hundreds of people who could not get inside the mosque could still participate in the courtyard outside.We were thrilled to see that we fit right in with the celebration. We spoke to many English-speaking Turks who were thrilled to talk about New York City - many said, \"oh, I would love to go there!\" or \"oh, my cousin lives in the USA!\" And they were all very friendly.What a great party! And I'm glad we got to not only witness it, but also to be there in the middle of it!"

But you get a romantic atmosphere and/or spectacular view in return combined with a lovely meal.The Faros Sirkeci Hotel is right next to the Tram station (Gulhane) and with the tram you can easily go to Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque, or even on foot to Topkapi Palace."

Beware of constant approaches from men saying 'I'm not a guide- they are trying to take you to a shop' or ' I'm not selling carpets - they are!' or generally getting in the way. No different from many places but it did seem worse. Watch out if given advice on opening times for mosque- while you are waiting they will show you their shop!

People were very helpful if you were lost and there were SO many people who spoke English and were patient with my attempts to say a few words in Turkish. Only 3 negatives: 1) DON'T drive in that area, leave it to those who live there and know how to get around. 2) Be prepared to hear regular Prayers over the PA system. I was thankful they didn't wake me up with the prayers, but the first time I heard it, I wondered about the frequency and duration. But it added ambience to staying in the area. 3) Be prepared for every person that has a \"rug\" shop, or has an \"uncle\" or \"cousin\" with a rug shop. They are very persistent. But, that's a lost art in America, the ability to engage someone in conversation, quickly develop that rapport and then make a sales pitch!"

It is one of the oldest part of the city and you can see some remains in the middle of hipodrom,still surviving today. And the Narrow streets around the quarter are also worth visiting. There are many resturants you can find all variety of food,even from Chinese,Korean and Indian culture:) There are also travel companies ,but the ones on the main street is a bit more expensive than the ones in the narrow traditional steets.You can also see the mozaics museum and remains of the old Byzantin Palace,known as Palatium Megara in the area. Some hotels,travel companies and carpet shops protecting some mozaics and cisterns, also availabe to visit for free :) just ask people how to find such a place:) Many people can speak English and also variety of languages in the area:))"

Sultanahmet Koftecisi (its a place that sells only 'meatballs' for lunch quick in and out near ayasofia on Divan Yolu Cd). The obvious blue mosque, Ayasofia, spice and grand bazaar Topeka Palace was a nice walk. I could not get enough of the honey rings the street cart and bakery guys were selling, not the bagel/pretzel looking ones but the more churro looking ones and their cousins sold at bakeries that look like little oval nuggets(the place I really liked that sold them was outside the spice bazaar, I think on the same 'street' as this famous stand that sells coffee beans (everyone knows it)."

It is great to walk around and sightseeing is free of charge !There are numerous small boutique type hotels in the area and lots of restaurants which gives a great choice according to your budget. We loved the Acra Hotel as it was in a quieter side street and during the height of the season those hotels located on what is known as \"Backpacker Street\" I imagine could be quite noisy. It was great to be able to walk out the front door and immediately be in the centre of everything. If sightseeing is what you want then with the Blue Mosque, Sophia Hagia Museum, Basilica Cistern and the Hippodrome all basically in the same area and the entrance gate to the Gulhane Park and Topkapi Palace a 5 minute walk away and the Sultanahment tram station giving cheap and easy access to other areas it really is the best location. You can also hire a bicycle which can be fun - although I would recommend staying in the general area as the roads in Istanbul are extremely busy ...and also make sure to stay out of the way of the taxi drivers..!From the main square you can also get your tickets for the \"hop-on/hop-off\" tour buses - currently 19.95\u20ac for 24hrs.Don't forget to try a Nargile (or hubble bubble water pipe) as well as the obvious but delicious honey turkish delight....and enjoy everything Istanbul has to offer.(A tip is to make sure you have 0.50TL coins available for the toilets and be prepared for \"non standard european\" facilities when you are in the centuries old Grand Bazaar !...lol)."

Other district of Istanbul are very similar to parts of other European cities, but the Sultanhamed and the Bazar district are certainly unique. The area is very lively and walking outside at night at any time is a lot of fun because so many people are around. There are many restaurants that look like tourist traps but in fact many of them are pretty good. Just do your homework and check out the restaurant reviews on tripadvisor.com. The district is full of things to do and see and one could spend the whole vacation here, but public transportation from here is also very convenient and makes it easy to explore other interesting districts of this amazing city. I would definitely recommend staying here to all people visiting Istanbul for the first time. Yes it is more touristy... but the nearness and convenience to all the major sites is unbeatable, and you can still experience the full flavors of turkish customs and life because the district is also full of Turkish people going about their daily business totally oblivious of the tourist around them."

Take a lot of pictures and do some homework before you arrive so that you can absorb all that it can provide. While Istanbul and the Sultanahmet area are key attractions, there was a downside for me that did not impact my rating of this area but something to keep in mind. What I disliked were those who I believed were out to con me into buying things I didn't need, didn't want, the presences of potential pickpockets, and being approached by the classic opening conversational lines by male strangers that may have led to the classic bar scams. You may want to get to know the locals better. If so, do it on your terms and your approach, not on someone elses approach and come-on to you. This is not limited to Sultanahmet but any global city where a good tourist industry thrives. Don't be paranoid but be informed and have a great time."

I enjoyed the sights, energy and culture of this district. Most everything that I wanted to see was within walking distance and those that were a bit off the beaten path, I just caught the Tram and off I went. Many shops and street vendors ( both food and souvenirs) to choose from. Upscale and inexpensive items to buy and take back home with you. Please note: I found out that the shipping company: DHL will not ship any spices back to the USA. I purchased some Saffron (the real stuff from Arifoglu #31 in the Egyptian Bazaar) and I had them vacuum seal it to take back with me. I held onto it like it was worth millions. It was only 25 Lira for I gram, way less than what I would have paid back in the US. Even though I spent about 10 days in this district, I still did not see everything. I have lots to look forward should I be able to come back. Food markets, drugstores and Turkish Baths. I found that the Tram was very easy to take and understand. What a Great Place"

I found a Tour Operator before going on my trip (Istanbul was the transit city) and set up the hotel accommodations and tours. I wasn't disappointed whatsoever and fell in love with this city. I became engaged a year later and vowed to myself that I would take my wife to Istanbul and I did: February of 2007. We loved it and stayed 9 days. Sultan Ahmet is quiet during low-tourism seasons and very inexpensive. It has everything and is near everything. You really don't have to leave Sultan Ahmet and if you want a short vacation, it is perfect. I would go to Istanbul just to shop while earning a quick getaway. Taksim (great for shopping and eating) is a madhouse and if you are a foreigner, you'll get approached by con-artists and pimps. I recommend Sultan Ahmet to everyone and please see my post on hotel accommodations."

Around Sultanahmet* This is a great area to stay for sightseeing, you can walk to so many places and there\u2019s a tram stop there, so you can easily get to a lot of other places.* Sites & activities in this area include: Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, Basilica Cistern (don\u2019t miss this, and a great stop when the weather outside is bad), sitting around the fountain in Sultanahmet Park, walking along the Hippodrome; Topkapi Palace; Istanbul Archeological Museums, lots of restaurants and shops, and more.* We stayed at the Hotel Poem & liked the hotel and the location (easy to get places, a view of the Bosphorus, and a rooftop sitting area). We also went for breakfast a couple times on the rooftop restaurant at the Seven Hills Hotel, which had a great view of Aya Sofya & the Blue mosque, especially in morning light.* For guys \u2013 have your hotel recommend a small barbershop in the area where you can get a haircut & a traditional Turkish shave (but be forewarned, if you agree to the warm wax on the ear it will hurt when they tear it away to remove the tiny hairs \u2013 you might want to pass on that part)Here are some trips from Sultanahmet to other spots \u2013 and there are a lot more things to do than listed here: - Hop on a ferry and just watch the sites.  - Hop on a ferry to one of the Princes\u2019 Islands. We saw B\u00fcy\u00fckada, which was large enough to offer restaurants, hotels, horse & carriage, and lots of walking. We also saw Burgazada twice, which we liked for walking around, but it was smaller so offered less activities, I think most visitors would prefer B\u00fcy\u00fckada - We took a cab to Ortaoy, spent some time walking around, took a cab to Bebek, spent time there, and then took a ferry back down the Bosphorus (I think it stopped at Emin\u00f6n\u00fc that time, but check a map to be sure).  - In Bebek look for a little ice cream shop (warm season only) that is take out only & a bit below sidewalk level (you stand on the sidewalk and they reach up to serve you), they had great sour cherry ice cream. We went back for it a second time in November, only to find out they are closed in the off season. - Istiklal St, a modern street with Taksim Square at one end. Lots of restaurants, coffee shops and stores. There\u2019s an old fashioned looking tram that travels up and down the street if you just want to sit and watch. - Istanbul Modern, if you like modern art there\u2019s lots to see here. You can get there by tram, get off at the Tophane stop. If you get on the tram that says \u201cKabatas\u201d at the front you won\u2019t have to switch trams.  - Grand Bazaar \u2013 a short walk or 1 tram stop from Sultanahmet - Spice Bazaar - Emin\u00f6n\u00fc area, the Emin\u00f6n\u00fc tram stop is about 3 stops from Sultanahmet area. In Emin\u00f6n\u00fc you can get fresh grilled fish on a bun, walk along the Galata bridge, cross over to the Karak\u00f6y area (where you can get great Baklava & other sweets at Karak\u00f6y G\u00fcll\u00fco\u011flu), or catch a ferry to Istanbul\u2019s Asian side - Spend some time on the Asian side, check out Haydarpa\u015fa train station, and walk around the markets a short walk from the ferry terminal. If the weather\u2019s bad you can always hop on the old fashioned tram (Kadikoy-Moda tram) that does a loop of about 10-12 stops. One day we sat on it for 2 full loops until the rain passed.Other Tips* Get an Akbil and load it. The Akbil is an electronic fob that you preload with Lira and can use for getting on the tram, ferry, busses, funicular, metro and probably a few more things. Multiple people can share one Akbil & you can add more Lira as required. This will save you money & time. When you\u2019re done with your Akbil you can return it for a refund, or pass it on to some other tourist.* For food recommendations check out the blog Istanbul Eats. They also offer food walking tours (but book these ahead, we missed out when we tried to book at the last minute) * We took cabs about 5 - 6 times in Istanbul. They were reasonably priced. \u2013 the only problem we had was one cabbie refused to turn on his meter and quoted us a price about 5 times what we expected to pay, so we made him stop as soon as we could, got out and refused to pay anything. We asked our hotel about what we should expect to pay for certain trips & the cabs drivers were always close to that range.* The customer service in Istanbul was better than any other country we\u2019ve been to (Europe, North America, Australia & New Zealand, and a few other spots), I can\u2019t imagine the shock Istanbul residents must have when they visit other countries. Enjoy.* People in Istanbul were genuinely friendly, and I don\u2019t just mean the salespeople, if I was sitting on a park bench in Sultanahment someone would stop to visit. If I was loaded down with stuff on a tram, someone was quick to offer me a seat. This is an amazing city to visit."

If you don't mind a chat and a cup of tea, answer those men who call out to you. They won't attack you or try to seduce you (not in the first 5 minutes, anyway! but they will try to take you to a shop/attraction where they get commission. A Turkish woman would never respond to a man who called out to her in the street, so just look straight ahead and keep walking if you're not in the mood. Staying in Sultanahmet, you can walk to all the most famous attractions, but they are better with a qualified guide. Private tours are best, and not even that expensive. We got ours from TurkeyTravelCentre .com - because we needed a private tour to account for our special needs child and our need to go slow and take breaks. They were amazing!!! We then booked the rest of our Turkey trip with them. One of their tips which we followed was - after you've seen the sights - get out of Sultanahmet!!! There's more to Istanbul than the museums and Blue Mosque. This city rocks, but you need to go up to Taksim and Istiklal street and the area around Tophane and Istanbul Modern to get the vibe. The nargile gardens in this area are the bomb! although alcohol-free."

My tips are:You can use Euros here, but to get better value, do buy the local currency Turkish Lira.Do try and include a boat trip on the Bosphorus as well to complete your sightseeing of this city.Everyone in the Bazaars are friendly and nowhere near as harassing as other cities in the world. Yes, they will try and catch your interest, but a smile and a polite no thanks works fine. Feel free to chat to them, they are a friendly likeable bunch! And of course, you MUST haggle with a smile!A refreshing bottle of water in one of the traditional outdoor cafes is a very reasonable 1.5TL, so don't be shy on visiting these lovely outdoor cafes for a rest and a cold drink. We also stopped at an outdoor cafe for a shish kebab lunch with salad for 10TL each - and it tasted great. Most of the locals speak some English.We loved Istanbul and can't wait to return."

They are a bit of a rip off like the half day ones costing around Euro 35 & taking you to Rustam Pasha Mosque (free entry except during prayers when its closed) & Topkapi Palace( ok you donot stand in the ticket que but are you ready to spend that much for this little). Invest in the audio guide instead much better experience as the guide gives you the outline & disappears. Not really but he doesnot accompany you inside but waits in the lawns. My suggestion would be that you visit busy places like the Topkapi early in the day they open by 0900 hrs if I am not wrong & avoid weekends or school holidays. Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia(Ayasofia), Grand Bazar, Cistern are also close byOnly the whole day tour which takes you inside Dolma Bache palace is worthwhile, but donot chose the half day one as you could do the cruise only (1 hr 30 mins on the boat) much cheaper by doing from Kardikoy near Eminnou station.For people not wanting to walk there is a convenient tram which moves from Kabatas & is only 1.75 YTL per person. It connects with Taksim via the funicular, so you have most of the city at your disposal.But like most cities with history,culture, architecture, interesting people this is best done on feet. Lovely places to eat specially near the Egyptian/Spice bazar area, good for people watching, Bosphorous etc. Only word of caution is being crowded be a little careful of your belongings & check the prices on the menu before sitting down in the resturants as the ushers could be a little too pushy for comfort."

Very old area, with literally a million hotels, quite dirty at some points, messy, crazy traffic and with those horrible un-even stoned pavement that makes it impossible to wear heels and a challenge to walk without looking at the floor at all times.But it's got its charm. We were there during Ramadam and by the time the sun went down, a million outdoor parties started to celebrate it, and to eat; it gave us a chance to see something different. At night it's amazing with all the monuments and mosques lit, beaufitul, charming and very very special.Line 1 of the tram covers almost the whole area and it doesn't have as many hills as the other sides of the city (eventhough it does have some that are quite impressive).This is the area where we had dinner everynight and we certainly enjoyed it, each and everytime; we went to every single Sirkeci hotels branch restaurants and appart from the great breathtaking views, the food was simply amazing everytime and at a very reasonable price (we were adviced of these restaurants beforehand) and also a couple others around the area and we just had been told about the overpriced, tourist intended restaurants and avoided them, so simple, worked out perfectly for us. Ibni Kemal cadessi is great for food, and had a lovely atmosphere at night. Also does Ticarethane Sk, beautiful street packed with lovely restaurants. We didn't encounter any problems, no safety issues, we just took the same precautions we take when in London, Paris or NY.I wouldn't stay anywhere else in the city next time we go, and you bet we will, we loved it."

We stayed 4 nights in a great place a couple of blocks from Hagia Sophia. It is a tourist area, so things can certainly be overpriced. Bu,t we were able to find good reasonably priced food to eat. The shop keepers, especially restaurants and carpet sellers, are aggressive, but we quickly got use to them and found that they were basically very friendly."

Well there are some good restaurants, most are far overpriced, and many engage in outright scams to get you to overpay. Your far better off getting out of the tourist areas. You will get far better food at a much better price ."

            "review": "Practical Tips to Visit SultanAhmet, Istanbul. We spent more than 7 days visiting Istanbul and we stayed in Garden House, a nice hotel in SultanAhmet area. This was our first visit. We are a family of 6 with small children, but the outstanding transportaion system and local help made our visits to different parts of the city easy & enjoyable. We did not have to take any guided tour. As such we were relaxed, felt the culture, spent as much time we needed in places we selected, and visited at our convenience and timing. We ate at different places and food was excellent. Few tips: Change your currency in shops. We got 1.92 TRY for 1 Euro (July 2008). In the money exchange places, the exchange is more like 1.80 TRY for 1 Euro.Always carry TRY for ticket purchases, entrance fees, etc. They may not convert other currencies.Avoid Taxi if you can, although Taxi is very frequent and convenient. Public transportation system is great - from train to bus to ferry. If you take taxis, please ensure that when you pay, you don't get distracted by the driver. Give the driver exact change - if possible, in front of others (like other members of your family). I don't want to sound paranoid, but my friend was cheated twice. He gave the driver 50 TRY and the driver distracted him and then produces a note of 5 TRY saying that is what he gave him! So watch out for such tricky practices. In general, people are extremely friendly, nice, smiling, and helpful. Food is great but if you crave for Chinese, Indian, etc., those are hard to find. Be satisfied with local food, Turkish Kebabs and Showarma, fresh bread, and fruits, they are delicious.Taking pictures are allowed in all places. Some restriction is Topkapi museum. Some places do not allow flash (like archeological museum). Some places are not open every day of the week. Check before you make your schedule.Here is a partial itinerary that we followed:1. Day-1 Evening: Blue Mosque(walking)2. Day-2 Ayasofya & Topkapi (walking)3. Day-3 Bosphorus tour: Take tram from SultanAhmet and go to Eminonu (1.4 TRY per person). Cross the stree toward the sea and take a left and go down until the bridge. The pier will be BOGAZ ISKELESI. You can buy a round trip ticket to Anadolu Kacagi (17.5 TRY). It takes about 2 hours to reach (with several stops in between, but you don't get down). You get down and find numerous restaurants around. You can just walk in one of the streets toward the hills that will take you to Genoese Castle (in about 20 minutes, uphill walk) from where you can also see the Bosphorus, Black, sea etc. You will also find a good place to eat prior to reaching the top. Once you return, you can also have lunch at one of the restaurants.4. Day-4 Basillica Underground Cistern (1001 columns water reservoir) and Sultan Eyup (Mosque of Abu Ayub Al Ansari, companion of prophet Muhammed, pbuh): Go toward SultanAhmet tram station and the underground cistern is right at the corner across Ayasofia. Entrance is 10 TYR. Eminonu and take a bus (99A) that will take you to Eyup city (about 30 minutes ride). Bus charge similar to tram, 1.4 TRY per person. They are frequent, nice, and you can always find seats. As you go, you can also have a glance at the city walls on your left. When you get down in Eyup on the right side of the highway, you will find several restaurants, shops, go right through the area and the mosque is about 2 minutes from the bus stop. There is the mosque and the shrine. Pictures are all allowed even with flash and video. It is a beautiful place. Catch the same bus from the other side of the street to return to Eminonu.5. Day-5 Dolmabahce, Galata Tower: both are on the other side of Golden Horn water. Take the tram and get down at the end of the route (Kabatas). Again, it will be 1.4 TYR per person. Get down and follow the same direction on the sidewalk on the right next to water. You will reach Dolmabahce in about 5 minutes.Return by tram up to Karakoy (Galata Tower). Get out of tram and on one of the street corners, it is written TUNEL. Enter and there is an underground train (0.9 TYR each). This train has only one stop, i.e., near Galata tower. Get down from this train, come to the street, walk, and take a right (in 1/2 minute) and continue on this travelling downhill for about 10 minutes. Then take a right and you will see the Galata Tower. You can go to the top floor for 10 TYR per person. You can see the whole Istanbul from the tower.Coming back, go to the underground train and come to Karakoy and take the tram to return to SultanAhmet.Day-6: Archeological Museum (SultanAhmet), Uskudar (Asian Side), and Beylerbeyi Palace: You should visit the museum, just follow the tram line from SultanAhmet and you will arrive in 3/4 minutes. Then you can take the tram (or walk) to Eminonu, and take the ferry from Uskudar Iskelesi to Uskudar. This is a small place on the asian side. You can catch a local bus to go to Beylerbeyi Palace (right under the suspension bridge). Return to Uskudar by bus and take ferry to come back to Eminonu. The bus stops may be tricky so please watch out so that you don't miss the place where you want to get down.Day-7: Chora Museum (also known as Kariye church), Grand Bazar, Beyazit mosque, and City Walls: Take tram from SultanAhmet in the direction opposite to Eminonu and get down at Beyazit (second stop). You can visit the Grand Bazar (at the stop) and the beautiful Beyazit mosque on your right. Next to Beyazit mosque is Istanbul University and the terrace in between is huge and nice. Grand Bazar prices are high and lots of bargaining take place, so be careful. From Beyazit, take a bus (I guess #85C) that takes you straight to Kariye. Get down, follow the same direction of the bus and take immediate right. Walk for another 5 minutes and on the right is the Chora Museum. As you come out using the same way you took to go there, but then go toward the main street on your right and you will find the city walls (also on your right - no need to go to the other side of street). The old walls are still there with some part being renovated.You can always squeeze in many other places, like the spice bazar, Taksim squre (you can go from Dolmabahce to Taksim and then to Galata tower), other shopping places and mosques, etc. Just walking along the streets are great and you can view so much of old structure and architecture.We went in July and the temperature was around 85 degrees F during the middle of the day. It was very nice. No rain except when we climed up the mountain for Genoese castle (Bosphorus trip). IT rained heavily for 30 minutes and then there was beautiful sunshine.Thanks and enjoy your trip!!"

            "review": "Surviving Sultanahmet. Sultanahmet is an enchanting location. Very old, very interesting.Walking everywhere is ideal and seemed to be safe. Most things are close. The public transportation is also easy. Most of all, take the time to really enjoy the surroundings, the buildings and the people.Do allow plenty of time in the Grand Bazaar. Bargain like crazy.And the restaurants in the Grand Bazaar have very good food.I ate in the Davidoff and had the very best pizza I've ever eaten!Yeah,,,I know....crazy to order pizza in Istanbul, but I wasn't feeling well and wanted food that I recognized.Take the Bosphorus tour. You can see the entire area and you get a chance to relax.I did not enjoy \"Istiklal Caddesi.\" Busy, commercial street. Not quaint as indicated in the guide books. Tawdry shops, a few eateries, Best attraction was the window with the ice cream vendor.Also at the lower end of the street, you will find yourself at the Galata Tower. Nice observation deck.1. Annoying carpet salesmen are a fact of life. Do not make eye contact, keep on walking if you are not interested.The Turkish say 'no' by quietly uttering a sound like \"tsssst!\" and throwing their head upward just a bit, raised eyebrows. I found this worked wonderfully!!!! even with the cats that are plentiful!2. Beware of any person that takes an interest in you. They are salesmen. They ask if they can help you find your way; or they ask where you are from; then they ask where you are staying! And worst of all, rather than helping you find your way, they try to lead you to their uncle's carpet shop! (they get a commission!)3.. Wear very comfy shoes. The stairs/steps are very uneven and the streets are cobblestone. As a 60something, I did not even wear my sandals so as to not snag the toe in the very rough cobblestone streets.4. If you find your hotel unsuitable, change. There are many. We moved directly across the street to much better accommodations.5. Take your own scarf for your head to enter the mosques. Shorts are inappropriate in the mosques as are sleeveless tops. They will loan you a cape to wear (that everyone else has worn).6. There is a very nice patio restaurant behind the Yesil Ev hotel.In the garden passageway to that patio restaurant, look to the left and see a stairway downward (it is the lowest level of the hotel)...there are very clean free restrooms at the bottom of the stairs. The Yesil Ev is centrally located and easy to see. It is a light green building, directly behind the Dirvish Cafe, which is sort of between the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia.7. If you use a taxi, make certain of the cost before you get in. Ask several. Flat rates vary. The very best is finding ones strictly charge what is on their meter. If you are going to the airport, ask your hotel for a taxi with a good rate. If you have a lot of luggage like we did(a month), a \"car\" rather than a taxi is available and not costly.8. Most of all.......HAVE FUN!"
