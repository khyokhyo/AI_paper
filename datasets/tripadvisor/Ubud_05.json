            "review": "Learn to cook in a traditional Bali house . Cleanliness was 100%. We made 10 dishes including 2 deserts. Presentation was beautiful, instructions clear, and we had a good laugh. Recipe options were given for ingredients hard to find in local country eg banana leaf. I now have a good understanding of the basic flavours of Bali dishes and am confident I can reproduce at home. So the real highlight of course was the tasting and eating at the end. Delicious because all the ingredients were fresh and made from scratch. Highly recommended."

We were picked up from our hotel and went straight to the market where they buy all their ingredients which was nice to see. Then we went where they make coffee and tried different types of coffee and tea. The cooking class was with group of people in local house. We have learned to cook few delicious dishes the best think was to eat them in the end yameeee :) We have also received recipe of the all dishes we have cooked which was great.We really enjoyed this cooking class everybody was very friendly."

I enjoyed the whole evening and it was very comfortable as a solo traveller. It was also nice being in Made home and meeting his family. So when I return in August with my husband, we went again this time during the day so we got to go to the markets and as a special request we got to cook Nasi Goreng which we have since replicated back in Oz with great success !Unfortunately our trip with short and we never got to go on Balimanggang other trip, next time very keen to do the Volcano hike and mountain bikingWe also use Balimanggang for all our transfers and they were very affordable and reliable. They spoke very good English and were able, to answer all our question and fill us in on all the history and culture of the area.Great experience thank you"

The pick up from the hotel came earlier than expected, so we needed to hurry. But it was nice to take a look at the market. The day before we already visited a plantage, so that part was not very intresting for us, but cooking was great! Fresh ingredients, great taste and you'll get the recipes afterwards."

            "review": "A great cultural and culinary experience!. We started our day with an early morning pick up, then off the local market.The market, where activity usually starts around 4 am, was quiet by the time we arrived. But that made it perfect for our walk-around. Our host and guide Made Larte\u2019s took us on a show-and-tell around the market and pointed out items we would use in our class. We didn\u2019t buy anything at the market, because Made had shopped and prepped for our class ahead of time. The market is a lot different from what you would see at any of the Ubud tourist markets and at most markets at home, so it was worth the visit. During the drive and during the class Made shared tons of information about food and culture, answering our millions of questions about cooking and life in Bali.Next stop \u2013 the Luwak Coffee plantation. We saw the Asian Civets that are key to the production of this unique coffee. After the quick tour, we enjoyed some complimentary tea samples \u2013 delicious!\u2026 and shared a small coffee sample @ $5USD. They bring communal tea sampling glasses, but we asked for individual glasses and they obliged. The coffee tour ended at the Gift shop. We were anxious to get to our cooking class and hastily bought some gifts for home\u2026 Buyer Beware \u2013 Luwak Coffee is noted as the most expensive coffee in the word! A 200 gram package @ $7.600 converts to approx. $76USD NOT $7.60. We bought 2 packages and had an unpleasant surprise when we got home to a higher than expected credit card charge. The cooking class was held in our chef's private home. Chef Made, his family and kitchen support staff were all knowledgeable and very hospitable. The class was in English and everyone was easy to understand. The whole morning so much fun, and it was a real authentic \u201chands-on\u201d cooking class. Everyone got their own apron and then with knives and mortar and pestle in hand we started\u2026 For two hours plus, we cut, peeled, diced, ground, saut\u00e9ed, steamed, and barbequed. The menu included a chicken soup with fish balls, tomato sembal, peanut sauce, steamed rice, a vegetable dish, steamed banana leaf wraps, 2-3 traditional Balinese barbeque meat dishes, dessert and more. We even made our own offerings. My favourite was the ground Tuna sticks. When cooking was done we all settled down to a family style buffet with tons of food. We left with a full stomach and take home recipes for everything we made. It was a very fun day, great value and an overall wonderful experience."

            "review": "Delicous food - cooked by ourselves!. We did the afternoon tour and started at a coffee plantation. It was nice, but we have been to a plantation the day before. But you don\u00b4t need to buy anything there and the tasting is for free.The cooking itself was very nice. We were 9 people and the chef explained everything well, although not in perfect English. I liked his humour and we had a lot of fun! The place was kept clean and the ingredients were fresh. We cooked soup, curry, vegetables, sate, different kinds of sauces, meat and a dessert. Each two persons were cooking by themselves and at the end we mixed everything together. So you could really cook by your own and taste what you have done. At the end the food is prepared nicely like you can see on the photos. I have the feeling that I learned a lot - there are typical ingredients that you use for everything. I feel prepared to try it out at home :) For that we got the recipes of what we cooked."

He took us into a market that we wouldn't have originally been brave enough to walk into. Then visited a plantation and tried the famous civit coffee. There were 5 others and we were all made sure to be included in the preparation of all the dishes. We were educated on the base herbs and spices required to make our own Balinese meals and were sent home with a recipe book to ensure we wouldn't forget all the tasty dishes we as a group cooked together. As a whole it was an enjoyable experience, very hands on and one that I'm very glad we took part in whilst staying in Ubud."

We had to wait 45 minutes until we finally got our tour on the market. The guide was very rushed, so the market tour was only for five minutes.Then we went to a coffee farm, where they selled overpriced coffee. We didn't ask for such a tour and we just wanted to learn how to cook.For the cooking class itself, our group was to large and we didn't had the feeling we actually learned something.The receipe we got a the end was nice, and the food was good.After we paid (way to much) for our class, the owner asked extra money because we drank a beer. They did not mentioned it that i was not included and expensive.We made a big mistake to come here."

We first stopped at the local market and then went directly to Made's family home. We skipped the coffee plantation because the four of us already did the tasting before. It was very nice to see a real Balinese family home and learned some things about the Balinese culture. Next: the cooking! It was really well organized. We made a whole buffet of typical Indonesian dishes (from starters up to dessert) and because we were a small group there was lots of cooking to do :) And finally we could taste and eat the result of our hard work, it was a delicious meal and we were all stuffed at the end. Thank you Made for this nice experience and the recipes. We will sure try to make them at home! "

            "review": "Wonderful Experience at Cooking Class. I had a GREAT experience with this cooking class in Ubud, which I did in August 2016. The day consisted first of a stop at the local food market in Ubud, where our guide showed us many of the typical local ingredients, and those we would be cooking with later that day. Next, we stopped at a small plantation where they grow many herbs, spices, coffees and teas. We had a tea & coffee tasting here of about 12 different types, which was included in the overall cost. We also had the experience to try to the famous \"luwak coffee\" produced onsite for an additional 50K rupiah (under 3 GBP). All of the teas & coffees were delicious and it was an informative session. Next we had the main event - the cooking class. It was a small group - we were one small group of 4 (of which I was one) and a family of 4 alongside us, with 2 main instructors for the class, plus some additional helpers. Over the course of the time we made about 11 different dishes. It was a family-style approach where different people handled different steps (i.e. one person chopping certain ingredients, the next person using the mortar & pestle to mix them, etc.) and taking turns with different steps on different dishes. I think this would be suitable to anyone with an interest in cooking and food, and you would not need any specific cooking skills beyond the very basics- suitable for cooking novices or more advanced home cooks who want some exposure to Indonesian cuisine. There were children in the family who was in the same session as me (guessing about 7-10 years old) and they were able to participate fully, with the instructors making sure to assign them the tasks they would be best suited for and would be safest for them. The highlight was our shared lunch at the end in which we ate everything we had made. The food was delicious and we received copies of all the recipes. The instructors were friendly, gracious, helpful, and easy to understand. This included pick-up/drop-off from my hotel in the centre of Ubud and the full time of transport and all activities was about 08:30am-1:30pm."

Pick up at hotel in Ubud was on time and short drive to the market and Balinese house where class takes place. Class was small, which was a big plus because of attention to detail per person. Detailed information about ingredients and recipes. In short: awesome experience, nice host and good food. Perfect morning activity!"

We went to a local market first, which was interesting to see. The cooking experience was fun. The cook keept us pretty busy. No time to sit down and relax. The recipes were traditionally Balinese and the food tasted great! Also proper hygiene is taken into account.At the end of the workshop the cook gave us the recipes in a small booklet (print-out). It's a pitty that these recipes are not really clear (no measurements) and that they seem to differ from the workshop. I won't be able to reproduce all of them at home. Overall it was a great cooking experience in a local Balinese residence. It was fun and I had a great meal for only 350.000. Good value for money. Five stars!"

We were picked up from our hotel on time and dropped off at the end of the class, full of great food and enjoyment. We made around 6-7 dishes, also all the spice pastes. It was very interactive and the tutors were very knowledgeable and attentive and the kitchen was extremely clean and well stocked. We also made all the, condiments and sauces, including peanut sauce for the Sates sticks, Sambal, Soup, Main courses and even a desert. We were treated very well by the chef \"Made\" and his English was very good as was his wife's who also helped considerably with assisting us to make the yummy Balinese dishes. We learnt heaps about the food preparation and the price and event very worthwhile. Absolutely recommend to anyone who likes Indonesian food and a good dose of fun and hands on activities. The price was very good for the event and being able to eat the food we prepared at the end made in extremely good value. The trip to the Coffee Plantation which was included was also very interesting and we got to taste 16 different coffees and teas, including the Labac coffee.

The cooking class is in a balinese village and home which makes the experience very authentic you can even stay at their hotel. If we ever return to Bali we will definitely take the course again.

I was travelling in Bali with a small group and on a free day I decided to pick up this half day cookery course near Ubud. So pleased I did. This is a small family run class, about 30 minutes drive from Ubud centre, but he comes wherever and picks you up. There are two classes and in the morning, I'm told he takes you to the market to buy the ingredients although he grows the rice himself. I went to the afternoon class and the fresh ingredients where already waiting. In the four hour class we where introduced to 11 Bali recipes, with hints and tips, along with friendly banter. After you cook you can relax and eat in the open rooftop kitchen. The food will be excellent and you will have tasted something special."

We cooked a menu of 8 different meals- the teachers were very kind and caring about us, they explained a lot and made us feel very comfortable.

First: regarding the class it was very informative, it gave us a basic tricks for cooking as well as giving us a passion for cooking. The whole experience was amazing from Cooking to grilling to chopping. We also wanted to know how to cook the fried rice and the fried bananas (which was not on the cooking list) and Made (the chef) was very happy to teach us how to do it. Although I didn't like most of the food as its different than ours in Egypt but will still go again. Second: the management was extremely smooth, I kept in contact with Made (the owner of the place which is having the same name like the chief) through the email, I booked and had the car pick us up without any drama. Everything was through email and was credible. Third: prices are really good in comparison to other cooking classes. It's affordable. I contacted many classes but most of them where vet pricy and others didn't want to help me doing a surprise cake for my husband as its out of schedule. Fourth: it was a tour with a lot of information about the Hindu life. It was very exciting to see their houses and to know about their religion and see the temple. That was another highlight of the day. They have very rich culture. Fifth and the most important : I hade a numerous emails back and forth between me and Made to try to make a surprise for my husband in the honey moon. I didn't want to make the traditional candle dinner. Made (the owner) was extremely helpful and flexible. I asked him if he can makes us a cake and a slow dance as we didn't have a wedding. He welcomed the idea and after some emails it ended up by planning a demo Balinese wedding . He got us the weeding costumes, cake, dancer and musicians. The best thing about it was his whole family celebrating with us. OH MY GOD. It was an amazing night and we kept laughing till we went to sleep. Tips: -wear something comfortable. -The cooking class takes some time so relax and be ready to spend have of the day cooking but in as exciting experience. -Expect not to like the food as the taste buds might be different but personally I'll do that in every single city that I will go to. -If want to customize anything don't hesitate to tell Made, that's what made him different than the other people that I take to. Thank you Made and enjoy your time there."

Picked up from our hotel by Komang, he turned out to be not just the driver but a mine of information and helped with the ingredients, the cooking, took photos for us and was generally a wonderful host. Started with a trip to a herb and coffee plantation, here we were given loads of information and 12 different drinks to taste. Then off to the cooking class location a few kms away. It is in the home of the owner and has probably enough facilities for 12 or 14 people. We were the only 2 on this course, presumably most people do not have the aversion to morning that I have (and it was not main season). Komang and the lady who owns the house (their cooking school) showed us how to prepare and cook the seven courses. The whole thing was a wonderful experience in beautiful surroundings. And the food was brilliant - the soup I helped prepare was amazing. We have done a number of cooking classes in different parts of SE Asia and this was definitely the best, would heartily recommend. Thanks for a wonderful experience."

We made 8 dishes in all and were lucky to be the only people doing the afternoon class that day. The location is in the family home and it has great views of local plantations and jungle. The pick up and short drive there was also very enjoyable as it felt like we had left the main drag and were going into the 'real' Ubud.

He gave us a tour which I found very interesting. He told us that the whole family live there - 4 families however they all had their own dwelling.Next we went to 'cooking class'. Four of us cooked up a Balinese storm. Now as I said I am a fussy eater and although I didn't eat all of what we cooked, the whole experience for me was about understanding how the Balinese cook and their main ingredients so that I can take what I've learnt home and tailor it to my family's tastes. At the end of the class we got to sample our delights and I must say, I did try most of the food and it was ok. My husband is a real 'foody' and loves trying food and new tastes; he adored all of the cusine. A great morning out and I would definitely do it again!"

Especially the famous Luwak coffee, priced at around 1 million, can be bought for 250k elsewhere. It would have been professional if the chefs would warn you for this, as it is a genuine rip-off."

Wawa wewe means so so or comme ci comme ca, I say this because although i did not really enjoy my day it was as tourism goes in Bali ok,some experiences can leave you angry and frustrated this did not,. I wanted to lean the basics of Balinese food, and this class covered it. The chef or guy that took me had limited English, he certainly spoke well but understood little of what i said back, He asked many of the same question again and forgot my occupation which is a chef surprisingly,or again he just did not understand, I had thought that he would have been interested in this fact being a chef or working in the industry, he did not work for the company full time and was called in to take me in the class (i was the only person that afternoon). He adhered to the cooking side of the program with military precision, almost robotic, which for me took away from a personal experience and we were joined by another chef/cook but not the advertised cruise ship chef, i liked the second guy, he had better english but he stayed only long enough to complete he tasks and left again.. The first part of the day was to take me to a coffee plantation. I had been a few days before already to another one, i indicated this to my tutor, but he took me anyway.. I dont like the style of the coffee plantations, after/ during tasting they tend to want to sell the cat poo cino for 50000 rp which there is no way of trusting that is actually the real mccoy, and generally its a why not i try it once, then they take you generally to the shop which the make out or present the idea that they have grown and processed the over priced products on site, not just the coffee but the spices and teas can be well over priced, To me its just a scam and not authentic you see no evidence of coffee, tea or spice production, but you do get to see as you go in various spices growing in a large jungle/ garden setting, but no actual plantation,And the coffee plantation cost the cooking class nothing,I suspect they may even get a hand back for bringing customers as many people are trying to drag you to plantations, that's how we got to one the first time. I was never taken to a local market, which is on the brochure and i do love to see them the real local markets in asia can be eye openers, exciting, horrific and interesting, so i was disappointed not seeing a market. After cooking the food and displaying it i asked that i could take the food away as i really was not feeling well or hungry my coach insisted a taste a little which I did and offered a bintang which was slightly more expensive than a restaurant 25000 small 50000 lg As i really couldnt eat a meal ( had had a late lunch and i think the heat was getting to me, and i had picked up a flu or cold the week before, anyway kindly he let me return with some leftovers for my partner and the guest house staff.As for my partner, she chose to go to the tourist market shopping which worked out well as 350000rp each if the both of us had gone it would have been an expensive day by Bali travel standards.However I think I gained what i went for the basic sauce or spice paste, which if my tutor is correct is the base for almost every Balinese dish, but sourcing the ingredients may be difficult.In all i feel if you find a guest house and get along well with your host you would have a better experience going to the market with them and learning the base dishes that every Balinese would probably know at their home, if you can wrangle it."

Then we went to the family compound were they had built a cooking school out the back. The cooking was great, the only down side being that instead of learning a number of dishes from start to finish, the five of us worked on various parts of dishes to make about 8 dishes, so I didn't feel like I had a grasp on all the dishes cooked (I gather this is a similar experience to other cooking schools here, I'm just comparing to an excellent school I went to in Thailand). The husband and wife who ran the place were very welcoming, their limited English made up for by the guy who guided us the whole morning. The food was awesome, traditionally cooked, and we were so stuffed at the end. The only real downfall was the written recipes, with incomplete recipe lists and odd instructions, and a spice paste referred to by three different names which was very confusing. I had hoped to find time to write them out in better English, but I'm sorry, it's been too long and I can't remember the steps well enough...hopefully someone will offer to do this for them as this really was the only problem."

Ok if you have been dragged to one before that might not make much of a differ nce but if not, then it s ineresting. At least atthe one we went the poor Luwak life in a bigger cage with some tree stumps and a sign \"breeding\" (2 Luwaks in the cage) instead I'm fa box cagelike at other places. If you don t agree with the method of making Poo Coffee .... this is Asia at the end of the day and I m sure there are \"things\" Asians don t like about Europe. Back to the cooking class: Made 2 has explained all ingredients and preparation before you start getting you hands on experience, they assist and explain while you are preparing pastes, sauces, and other parts ofthe menue. Very relaxed atmospaehre, no Master Chef attitude, very down to earth easy going. We enjoyed every minute and highlight was lunch: Yummy is the only word to discribe!

The best part was the whole 'food experience'. Going to the very local market where the food you are going to cook with was purchased. Then heading to the plantation to see how they harvest all the chillies, spices, garlics, gingers etc. this also doubles as a local coffee your and includes a nice tea and coffee tasting free of charge. Then it's into Mardi's house and he does a great job firstly explaining they layout of the traditional Bali home and what each aspect of it represents. The its onto the cooking. Very clean, you cook everything from scratch and you really take plenty of lessons away from it. They're constantly stopping for drinks and to explain the more important steps in detail. The variety of traditional Balinese food is vast and really gives you and all round Balinese chef and taste experience (curries, open grill, salads, satays, soups, deserts... etc) Bus pickup and drop off to the door of your hotel tops it off.

We participated in this cooking class after cancelling a rafting trip due to the weather and after taking it I'm so happy the weather turned on us because this was an absolutely amazing experience! First I'll say that our hotel offered a cooking class similar to this one for $110 per couple. We paid much much less with Bali Manggang. As is mentioned, this is held in a private kitchen in a local village where you do everything from chopping to grilling all of your own dishes and then you get to eat it all from the family recipes. This is a must do if you are every in Ubud! Everything tasted delicious & fresh!"

The very friendly chefs pick you up at your hotel, show you the fresh ingredients on a local market and take you to a small plantation nearby where you learn about different plants and have the chance to taste different coffees. (For 50k rhp also a cup of coffee luwak) After that you go to the house of the chef to cook in a traditional style kitchen on a rooftop. You'll definitely make more delicious dishes than you will be able to eat. And if you're lucky maybe the owner takes you to a tradional rooster fight in the village Temple!"

We were a family of 5 and it was it was only us in the class!! We went to the local Balinese market, not the Tourist Ubud market and were shown the various ingredients and spices. We ended up buying some of the traditional sweets to try later. Then we went to the organic spice farm where they serve tea and coffee for you to try. We tried about 12 different ones and then some Arak( Balinese spirit) and then some organic chocolate( milk, vanilla and orange). You have the opportunity to buy the products afterwards, which people have said is expensive but the place is educational and we thoroughly enjoyed their products. The chocolate doesn't have dairy so my daughter loved it. We stopped in at a rice field and it was explained how the rice grows and is harvested.Next was the cooking class in an actual village and is at someones house, not a hotel! However, the kitchen area is a large open area perfectly set up to prepare and cook your food. We each had a cooking space and they had about 8-9 stoves to utilise. We each had something to do, some chopping, some cooking vegetable curry, some cooking chicken meatball soup, some making the bean vegetable dishes or the spicy sauces, Lemongrass, BBQ and satay sauce( my fav) And we got to BBQ the satays, the pork satay's and the chicken.We all contributed to making 3-4 dishes each. It was full on cooking for each person. This is not a demonstration class!Our food feast was plentiful! We couldnt eat it all and we eat a lot! The final dessert was banana fritters that were boiled, kind of like sweet dumplings!! And then they were coated in fresh coconut. They were delicious! I will be making these back home! So easy but just yum, not too sweet!They also catered for us as we don't eat wheat, and everything is very fresh.The staff were wonderful, very happy and nothing was too much effort, the class was not rushed and we were able to really enjoy our meal. We were also allowed to adjust the spice level to suit our taste, and we like really spicy!! If you want a hands on class, where you participate fully for 2-2.5 hours just cooking, and then having a relaxing time eating then you must do this class!! We also have recipes to take home. Highly recommend!!"

The food was delicious, and simple enough that I feel comfortable that I'll be able to re-create back home. The tour started out with a local market tour and then plantation tour to give an idea of the local produce and it did add a nice little touch to the day. We were lucky as my friend and I were the only ones who had booked the class so we had the class to ourself; although I still believe we would have enjoyed it just as much if we had to share. The chefs were able to adjust the recipes to cater to my dietary needs, so I didnt miss out on much. Everything was made from scratch and the fact that we got the recipes at the end made it even better. Only thing I would suggest; would be for the recipes to come to with measurements as they only provide the ingredient list and method; but no measurements for ingredients."

Made and the other teachers provide a real insight into Balinese life. They pick you up and drive you around. Visiting the market and the garden with herbs was very special and a lot was explained about the use of the ingredients. We were lucky to be with the two of us which made cooking the food a really good experience so we could do most of it ourselves. There was plenty of time, the kitchen was spacious and clean and the food was cooked with a lot of care. The peanut sauce is the best I've ever tasted! Made knows exactly what he is doing and everything tasted and smelled delicious! Would definately recommend this cooking class out of all the companies. One of my best experiences in Bali!"

The guide took us to a local market, not the one for tourists and overpriced ingredients. We sampled there a few sweets that we bought ourselves from locals and then headed to a coffee plantation to have a coffee which is the only reason I will not put a 5 star rating here. I would skip this visit to see poor animals in the cages and see the business they do with them there.The visit to a rice field was fine, pity we had to rush for the cooking already. The chef and his team are friendly and made us all organized while preparing more dishes at the same time. Luckily you get recipes of all meals you do there so you can prepare it yourself at home. We cooked maybe too much for five of us, but the class was definitely worth as the guide and chef can give you a nice background of Balinese cuisine."

All I can say is do this cooking school (as long as you don't have crazy dietary requirements or are a super fussy eater/hard to please)..... It's well worth the money and time.- Firstly we were picked up from our Resort (and dropped off at the end of the day) and driven to the markets (morning class only). This was a really nice touch. We tried some fruit and asked question about the food. Then we were driven to the family home.- When we arrived, we were given refreshing lemon drinks and our host talked about Balinese culture. All done with enthusiasm and humour. - The class room was super clean with great facilities. The lesson was structured well but was also fun. - We chopped, swapping jobs at times and then cooked in pairs. I am glad we weren't able to \"put our own stance on the cooking\" as it would have made the dishes less authentic. Plus there were 12 of us in the class so that could have been a disaster! I feel like I can cook these dishes at home now with the recipes we have been given and we were encouraged to cook for our families. - All the while we could help ourselves to cold bottled water. We were offered tea or coffee at the start and at the end of the class with dessert.- Puspa was not there for all of the class but this was not a problem at all. The other staff were super friendly and fun to be with. (I think it's fine to hold two classes at the same time, they were staggered, especially since we were well looked after and were there to cook food).- Puspa and her staff did a great job of explaining the ingredients and explained how we could use other ingredients that might not be available in our countries. This is as authentic as it can get (we are tourists after all). We were invited into someones home to cook in a well organised kitchen. Learning from someone who has set up a great business. Thank you Puspa and everyone at the school for a great day. If I am ever in Ubud, I will be back. This is a must if you are a food lover. It's great value for money and a fun day out... I can't wait to cook for my friends and family."

We are a family with 2 young children, travelling for the year and therefore on a limited budget. We wanted to go in a course which welcomed children, gave us an introduction into Balinese cooking and was good value for money. This absolutely did not disappoint in anyway. We left totally delighted at the wonderful experience and could not see any room for improvement.I emailed in the morning and after a few quick exchanges, we were booked on the afternoon course on the same day. The transport arranged was perfect, and the driver was really very welcoming and informative about our general Bali chit-chat. On arrival we were provided with a lovely welcome drink, which we had overlooking the lovely surrounding countryside. We were looked after as a party of 8, which included our 2 children age 5 and 8. The staff could not have been more welcoming, and let the children do everything the adults did. It meant it was a fully interactive trip for all of us, and our children were fully engaged and enthused throughout. We could not believe the amount of different dishes we prepared! All very different, totally authentic and giving a really good insight into Balinese cooking. It was really nicely paced, you get to prepare, cook a bit, eat starter, cook main, eat main, prepare pudding etc. This meant there was a really nice pace to the class. The food was absolutely delicious, and there was more food than the 8 of us could eat. However, we weren't too full to have seconds! I logged onto trip advisor to see another review posted for 4 Nov which only scored the class 2 out of 5. I am really astounded with these comments as this was NOT our experience of the day at all. There are lots of staff to help, but only 2 real guides, which is actually quite nice as you get a bit of variety in the instruction.As well as a totally authentic Bali 3 course meal, with about 8 different recipes, you get tea/coffee/water included, a welcome drink, free pick up service and a recipe book. To me, it was an exceptionally well thought out course with friendly helpful and welcoming staff. The quality was top class, and the experience and value for money therefore outstanding. As we left I said to my husband that they could not improve on this course. Don't miss this great experience! You won't be disappointed."

This cookery course may have an authentic origin, but it over commercialised and lost any authentic feel.The cooking is basic - you will chop, stir and crush - and then everyone's 'cooking' is combined so any personal flavours you have added are gone. There is limited opportunity to put your own stance on the cooking. Also the veggie options are limiting - how many different ways can you at tofu?!The course overall feels over orchestrated, Puspa has multiple classes on the go and is splitting herself between them, which means it lacks a personal touch. Instead you leave feeling pressured to write a good review as Puspa refers to TripAdvisor as her 'god mother' and like you've been ripped off any real Balinese cooking. It's a shame really. I feel like all Puspa could see was dollar signs in all her guests and experience or sharing knowledge wasn't on the agenda."

The booking process is super easy and they will pick you up and take you to where the tour begins... the local market in Ubud... then on to the rice paddy where you have great photo ops and they explain the rice harvest. Next to the home of AMAZING Puspa and Wayan who take it from there. You are actually a guest in their home and they make you feel so welcome! You become a part of the family and meet so many different people in a very comfortable setting! They have the day orchestrated to the second and it is so well organized! And you get to eat the delicious meals you prepared at the end! This will be one we will repeat every year! I recommend it and guarantee you will never ever forget this experience!"

We coordinated our own taxi ride to the class as we decided to spend the entire day in Ubud after the class. I emailed Paon cooking class via their website and coordinated to meet in front of the Ubud Palace at 8am. We were greeted by a staff member right on time and took a brief tour of the market where we were told about the different fruits and veggies available there. Our guide even gave us extra time to make a few purchases along the way:)Next was the rice paddy field \"tour.\" This was more of an explanation of the history and importance of rice while standing in front of one of the fields. It was beautiful but my group and I found this to be a little longer than necessary. Although the guide was sweet and funny. We then went to Puspa's home. This was amazing and so clean! She and her husband were very funny and welcoming! The cooking class was informative, memorable and a great time! The food was yummy and they were very accommodating to those with allergies or vegan or vegetarian. I would definitely recommend this class! Just FYI... Allow at least 5 hours total if doing the morning tour. Our taxi for the entire day was about ($65 US plus tip)Thank you, Puspa! (Aka \"honey\")"

There's a cheeky sense of humour in the cooking instructions, mixed in with vigilant food safety and hygiene, so we felt relaxed the whole time. The recipes were briefly explained beforehand, with all the ingredients. Everyone took turns chopping, slicing, grinding and frying - and then we had an amazing banquet for lunch. Most of us went back for seconds. And then there were bananas with coconut cream for dessert! Returned to hotel full of good food and good memories."

This is a professional and well though through cooking school that I can highly recommend. If you are not from the area of Ubud, you may have to rely on a driver service that the cooking school offers. Right now, this driving service is quite expensive, since the driver stays at the place the whole day. This can be improved, and will also be improved as promised by the owners. Alternatively you can always organize the transport yourself. The cooking school is worth it."

We started out seeing some rice fields and heading over to Puspa's house/school/restaurant. Her husband entertained us for a bit (also mentioning how they had to have a village meeting about when Pokemon Go was appropriate) and then we all went in to an open air kitchen. It was super fun and the food was so amazing and not as complicated as I thought - I even think I may be up for recreating it now that I'm at home. I even made sure that I didn't completely destroy our little cookbook on the ensuing 3 week backpacking trip. And Puspa herself was so adorable. When she found out that my cousin had brought along her \"honey bunny\" for the trip, she offered to be my honey bunny for the day, which was just delightful. We posed for a picture after under what appeared to be a solo wedding photo of herself. The whole day was weird and beautiful and hilarious."

Everyone was given a job to do and clear instructions were given as well as giving alternatives for some of the ingredients if your not able to source them once you are back home.

            "review": "Fantastic day out!. We are rather partial to a food tour or cooking class and Ma spending two weeks in Ubud was the perfect opportunity to partake in another one. We chose Paon Bali due to their ranking and reviews on trip advisor and were not disappointed. The 350,000 IDR (about \u00a320GBP) included pick up and drop off from our accommodation and a brief tour of Ubud Market, as well as the cooking and eating of eight dishes. Yes you read that correctly EIGHT, all of which were delicious. But back to the beginning\u2026We were collected a little late, which is par for the course in a country as relaxed as Bali, by a very smiley Wayan who dropped us at Ubud Market where the rest of our group was gathering. We walked around the narrow stall lined passageways while another Wayan (It's one of only four Balinese unisex names) and one of the owners of Paon Bali, introduced us to the local fruits. Sappadillo, snake fruit and mangosteen were new ones to most of the group but having been on a lot of food tours and eaten a lot of fruit over the last months we\u2019re familiar with them all and big fans of mangosteen in particular. We were also offered smooth orange passion fruits, far from the wrinkled aubergine coloured ones we get back home. (Over the last few days we have eaten fresh ones, still yellow, picked straight from the vines that form part of one of the roofs at Bata Bata our favourite local warung (eatery) as an appetizer to their delicious meals.) The cobwebs crowding the grubby ceilings above the market stalls sent shivers down my spine thinking about the spiders who must have made them but I managed to keep my focus on the goodies we were passing through and kept panic at bay After our quick market stroll we were split into groups and taxied to Wayan\u2019s house in the hills overlooking Ubud where we regrouped and gained some more making a total of twenty four budding chefs. On arrival we were offered wonderfully refreshing Balinese lemon juice. They do not have yellow lemons on Bali so people assume they are limes but they also have limes and green lemons which have a taste somewhere between western lemon and lime. You find it served most places blended with a little sugar and ice and it\u2019s really the most refreshing drink. While we were drinking and after an amusing introduction to his home and the cooking school by the very charming Wayan we met Puspa, his wife, the boss, and our cooking teacher for the day.After a quick chat from the very lovely Puspa we were led back into the cooking area, a large covered space with two permanent cooking areas, three long worktops with hidden hot plates and three seating areas around a central courtyard.Throughout the day we were split into pairs and all given the opportunity to slice, cut, mush, make, stir and cook at least one stage of each dish making for a really fun and interactive experience. I was teamed up with South Korean Sujee while JHubz and Ma made the perfect comedy duo We began by making Bumbu Kuning; a traditional yellow sauce that was used in several of the dishes and that included some twenty different ingredients ranging from familiar turmeric to galangal and candle nuts. The ingredients were placed in a big stone mortar and required some pretty impressive grinding with a four foot wooden pestle. Once suitably mushed (technical term) we started preparing the ingredients for all the other dishes and when everything had been sliced, diced and chopped to perfection our workstations were magically transformed into cooking areas.The first of our dishes was Sup Jamur; a clear mushroom and vegetable soup that was easy and quick to make and delicious to taste, which we did as soon as it had been made.Then it was on to cooking the rest with the ingredients we had prepared earlier:Kare Ayam; Chicken and coconut currySate lilit Ayam; Minced chicken grilled on bamboo sticksGado Gado; Vegetables in peanut sauceJukut Urab; coconut and snake bean saladPepes Ikan; Steamed fish in banana leafTempe kering, deep fried tempe in sweet soy sauceI won\u2019t bore you with the details of each, suffice it to say we fried, steamed and grilled until a real feast had been created. Everything was downright delicious; I was so full after my heaped plate that I couldn\u2019t go back for more even though I wanted to, badly, never have I been more disappointed in myself.My chilli allergy was easily and painlessly accommodated into the process and they clearly have experience dealing with people with allergies. Despite my telling previous places we\u2019ve attended in advance, I have either been treated like a pariah or expected to forgo most of the dishes. Here everything was tailored so that in my partner pair we made a chili free version of everything, really first class service.The class was rounded out by Puspa making Kolak pisang; Banana in palm sugar syrup for us all as a final treat before we headed off on our separate ways. It was a great class, one I would highly recommend, interactive, fun and even with twenty four of us, we were all equally involved. Canadian David and Stephanie who were on their honeymoon, Sujee and the three very nice young multi lingual Scandinavian (we think) girls who shared our table were great company and made the experience even more memorable, a really great day out. It was so good in fact we may even go back again while we are here Xx"

My husband who does not cook ( maybe a BBQ once a year if I am lucky) got right into the spirit and sliced and diced, fried and stirred to his heart content. We got to try all that we had prepared and cooked and it was simply an abundant amazing feast. The best food we had enjoyed in our many trips to Bali. Highly recommended."

We probably has 20 people in our class and there was also a second class going on upstairs. There is a lot of staff and they have a very good plan for how to handle all of the attendees and keep it fun and interesting. We cooked 7 different recipes and you do get to have a hand in cooking at least a piece of everything. You have a little downtime while they do the final preparations for the food which is a great opportunity to talk with the other people in class and hear where everyone is from; they get a lot of folks from all over here. Only thought to make it even more awesome is to add some adult beverages. :) Logistics wise - they did pick us up from and drop us off at our vila. We left around 3:45 and returned around 8."

It is very clear that this I a business with every single little detail planned.Even the hosts jokes and gestures was rehearsed in this play.After a tour to the market we had to make 8 courses in 4 hrs. After an hour with preparation we were paired up to do the cooking. The cooking was so fool proof that even a small child could do it with flying colors.After preparation all food was collected and finished by the staff that prepared it as a buffet.I would have liked to have spent less time at the marked and more time in the kitchen with more guidance. And I'd also would have liked to eat that I produced myself.To be honest in think the level of difficulty was to low for my expectations.We were told to rate and review the experience on TripAdvisor. Now I have done so!"

The trip to market is interesting and you are given the chance to try some local fruits if you want, you also stop at some rice paddy fields and the process of planting, harvesting and how the rice is prepared is explained there. The food preparation is shared amongst the group and then you get cooking. The menu is great, there's tons of food and you leave with a recipe book so it can all be recreated at home.Definitely worth the money and a lovely way to spend a morning."

It was arranged by our agency (Black Tomato) and we are so happy they recommended this experience as part of our trip. Aside from eating, we don't know our way around the kitchen so well, but we aspire to. This class was a great way to learn some basics from scratch and put some good recipes in our portfolio. And it was great fun as well. Wyan was an engaging, clear and pleasant teacher/hostess. She was very helpful with imparting proper technique and we found the practice of suggesting alternative ingredients and equipment to use back home to be extremely valuable. She also said she'd be happy to skype with us if we needed a refresher. The owners came by to say hello and check up on us. They were welcoming and curious to know what we thought about the experience. Although we did this as a couple, it's clear that this would be a fun group activity as well. Perhaps most importantly, the food was excellent and the plating was stunning. Overall, this was an excellent experience that helped us get further in touch with our Balinese surroundings and we definitely learned something we hope to implement in our home in the near future."

We received a booklet of recipes of the dishes we cooked and the staff were funny and efficient in preparing everything behind the scenes so we had a pleasant experience. It was a good introduction into Balinese/Indonesian cuisine and the food we cooked was delicious. However, if you're looking for a more in-depth learning experience you're probably not going to be 100% satisfied, the class was quite large with around 15-20 people and while they had more than enough room and could deal with the amount of people without any problem, the \"learning to cook\" part came a bit short. The food we cooked was great but it could've been a bit more so that everyone gets a second serving. Nevertheless I can definitely recommend this class if you're looking for a fun evening with good food!"

You get to participate in all aspects of the cooking. The hosts are so friendly and funny. The class is very well organised and relaxed. At the end you eat what you have cooked and the food is delicious. You also get copies of the recipes to take home. The price is 350k per person which is just under \u00a320. The experience is well worth this plus you get a three course meal on top. If you are staying in Ubud they provide transport to and from your hotel for free. We loved this cooking class and definitely recommend to try it!"

They hosted about 20+ of us and we each shared preparing the ingredients and had a hand in cooking everything in smaller groups. The owner had great energy, was funny, and taught us how to cook each meal, step by step. She even offered alternative ingredients in case we could not find traditional Balinese ingredients back home. We made over 5 dishes and each tasted so fresh and delicious, I was surprised we cooked it all! The cooking class takes place in her home and we were able to enjoy our dinner in her beautiful backyard forest view. They also offered free rides from Ubud."

Although we were picked up 20minutes late without warning we were on our way to the traditional house with lovely couples in our minivan. We met a lovely Getman couple from Munich and another German lady on her own. The vibe started off nice. It wasn't before long that we were in the traditional house where you will be welcomed with a drink and explanation by the owner of the traditional house setting.Once that was done we go inside for some tea and coffee and the explanations on cooking begin ! The ingredients are all fresh and the host is just the loveliest cutest woman you could ever imagine. With a smile as big as the sun and a personality larger than life she really made the cooking class fun and exciting!!Be prepared to be called \"honey\" a hell of a lot by her! The food was second to none (starter, main and desert) and all easily replicable if you try at home.I don't want to give too much away from the experience but it is one of the best things to do if you want to constructively kill 3 or more hours in the evening. The price is worth it as it's the cost of a posh meal in Ubud but you get the interaction here. All in all, there's so many pros but the only con would be timeliness of driver coming to collect us. 5 stars all round. This is a MUST people! Don't forget payment is in cash and is paid at the end of the class! Enjoy !"

This was the first attempt at a cooking class for our group, and if this experience was an indicator of how much fun it can be, I know this won't be our last.Our tour started with a trip to a local market where we could get a sense of what ingredients were available in Indonesia outside of what we found at Circle K. I would have liked actually do the shopping for our class there, but I understand that isn't to everyone's taste and would extend the course by several hours.Both Puspa and her husband were more than gracious, welcoming all of us to their home. Both had a great sense of humor.When we got to our \"kitchen,\" all of the prep work had been completed, which afforded us more time to learn about the dishes we were making rather than doing all of the grunt work.\"Class rooms\" seemed to be about 10 - 12 people, so not everyone got to do everything, but everyone in our group seemed to have fun and no one felt left out.Teams of two were assigned to the cooking, so everyone got a chance to have a hand in preparation.All dishes were finished by the staff.After doing all of the cooking, we got to sit down and enjoy our banquet - all of which was excellent. I think we all felt bad that we left food behind, but there was must too much to eat.I can't speak for people from other areas, but as residents of the San Francisco Bay Area, the recipes provided used ingredients that are readily available locally.Highly recommended."

Pushpa and her husband were great hosts, they had a large set of cheerful workers constantly cleaning pans and getting ingredients out. But we did not realize how many people were taking the class.First- Pushpa does not conduct the demonstrations for the entire duration of the class, it is her assistants do. We had 3 large tables, with about 10-12 people working on each table. All of us would have to gather around a cook top for a demonstration, and a short person like myself could hardly get a peep. We expected the experience to be a bit more involved and intimate, but with so many people in the class all we go to do is stir the vegetables in the pan a few times and chop a few vegetables. If you are doing this just for fun its great. if you are hoping to get something out of it, then I would not recommend the class."

The class itself was conducted in such a way that everyone was involved in the preparation, then the cooking of the various meals and sharing the meals with your group at the end.

I was a solo traveler and felt totally comfortable not being in a couple. The couples assisted me any time I needed more than two hands. Each couple gets to prepare part of each dish. When the dish is complete, they are all combined to feed the group. I thought the food was fantastic. The ingredients looked like high quality compared to what I had been buying at the local grocery store. It should be noted that only the morning group goes to the market. I took the afternoon/evening class and was disappointed that we didn't get to go to the market. I hadn't been able to find it so I was looking forward to going with Puspa. She is really funny and happy to provide alternate ingredients for items that you can't get at home.

Here we learnt about the local foods and ingredients we would be using.Next onto a rice padi near the cooking school, here we were told about the rice growing process etc.Now onto the cooking class which is held at the home of the organisers family. They have a wonderful huge open kitchen. The group was a fairly large one, maybe 18 people but we all felt included and had the perfect balance of watching, cooking and eating. The food was all amazing and this is coming from someone who rarely ventures further than eating pizza and chips. There was salad, local dressings, sauces made from scratch, tuna steak, chicken satay Skewers and more. We were then dropped off back at our hotel.All in all a very enjoyable day. Would definitely recommend especially for the price. (Roughly \u00a320 which includes all the food you've cooked plus the recipies to take home)"

            "review": "Good but falls a bit short. We went the Paon Bali cooking class after the rave reviews on TripAdvisor and although it\u2019s well organised and fun it fell a bit short of a proper cooking experience. The main issue is the group size and personal touch. We went for an afternoon (4pm) class so you eat in the evening rather than at lunch and they were 20+ people. Although the main lady (Pushpa) does the intro and has a great personality the class was run by various helpers for most of the time (I think Pushpa had another class upstairs)The set up feels very much like you\u2019re a \u2018line cook\u2019 in a large kitchen and ingredients you were making were mixed with 5/6 other groups who were all doing the same thing at the end so there was no real connection with the food (level of spice etc), and little opportunity to have dialogue with the teacher whilst in the process. The final meal prepared to share was delicious and hygiene throughout was of a very high standard but obviously due to Pushpa\u2019s success dare I say it the enjoyment of the experience may be lost. I\u2019ve done a couple of 5* cooking classes before in Thailand and Barcelona with groups of 8-10 and a personal touch with a single lead teacher. I\u2019m sure this was how Paon Bali started and if you manage to get a small group with Pusha it\u2019d be 5* (morning class may be better). As it is though it didn\u2019t offer much for a cooking enthusiast.Also as a note to management by all mean at the end ask people to rate on TripAdvisor but don\u2019t try and push people to give 5 star or speak up if you didn\u2019t think it was \u2013 no one is going to do this in front of over 20 strangers as it\u2019s not appropriate! Just ask politely to \u2018rate if you get the chance and if there\u2019s any issues just speak to me personally about how things could be improved\u2026\u2019"

We bumped on this cooking class almost by accident doing a small research on Internet, somehow it was meant to be.I am not an active cook myself, nevertheless we wanted to share a moment discovering ingredients and new meals. I don't like spicy, so that a huge challenge. We were received with a bright smile and welcome drink, until everybody arrived and we were 8 for the class. The host told everything we needed in forehand, in case there was any doubt on who did what and that we would eat everything we prepared. Yummi!Beautifully fresh and well presented ingredients in an impeccable clean wide kitchen. Each of them was explained in detail and how we could eventually find or replace them by similar ones back home. We were also given the possibility to cook standard or vegetarian, nice detail for some in the group. Spicy, medium or none. The preparation of the dishes and yellow sauce was split into smaller groups, but in a way that everyone did take part of the same meal. I was amazed how well organized it all was and how much pleasure we took in seeing things advancing. No previous cooking experience is required, the host is there to explain and help out at any time.The first meal to be ready was a soup, which we are as \"amuse bouche\" before we went to more serious stuff. Grinding ingredients with a stone and another bigger stone / wood grinder was a great experience, and using woks also great to use. Once we finished preparing our mains, I couldn't believe WE just did all that!!! I just wanted to start eating and taste it. Overall the class doesn't seem long as you are most of the time busy cutting, preparing, grinding, mixing, cooking and eating. By far it was the best Balinese dinner we have had in two weeks, and a true local experience worth living. 350.000 IDR seems a fair price for this."

The day started with an insightful visit to the market, although the hotel pick up was about 30 minutes later than agreed. In small groups, we were given a tour of the market, taught about the key ingredients and even got to taste some fruit which I had never seen before. From there, we went to the beautiful rice fields, which offered some wonderful photo opportunities and taught a little about the fields and farmers themselves. Next we went into the hosts' actual home, and we greeted with a refreshing glass of coconut and lime ice drink. The host or \"King\" of the home, was funny and charming, he told us about Bali culture and families, even showing us the various parts of his house, including the family temple and what each part symbolised. From here we went into the gorgeous open air kitchen, the views are breathtaking. The Queen of the House, Papsa, had us all laughing with her jokes and introduction, and gave us exceptionally good coffee. We all prepared the food together and cooked in pairs or singles. Everyone seemed to be in a good mood, open minded and chatty. We tried a lot of new ingredients and had a go at traditional methods, such as the Bali \"blender\". The menus were smoothly adapted for pescatarians, vegetarians and vegans. Papsa's assistants were also a pleasure to be around me and the course ran like clockwork, ingredients were always given to us on a little plate right on time and the whole event was very smooth and graceful. The food was wonderful, and the atmosphere fantastic. I would really recommend this to anyone interested in uncovering a little piece of Balinese culture first hand in a fun, informal setting. I would also say that this course is fantastic value for money, you get a private market tour, rice field tour, understanding of the culture, new experiences, new cooking skills, unlimited (beautiful) coffee, tea and water, new friends and a very delicious and satisfying meal. Just do it! The food is only half the fun!"

It started off with a morning market tour \u2013 which was quite nice as we saw the various fruits/vegetables that we wouldn\u2019t normally get in north America. The guide allowed us to taste some of these exotic fruits \u2013 which was quite nice as well. We also saw some of the key ingredients that are used in Balinese cooking and learned a little bit about their culture. The most interesting part was when we stopped at a rice field on our way to the class and the guide was giving us a quick crash course on the Balinese culture, farm life and their naming convention. It was definitely an eye opening experience. The cooking class was very organized. Its not like other places I\u2019ve been to where we made our own individual dishes. This was more of a group effort. The food turned out delicious and the entire process was quick and fun! Pushpa was super friendly and funny which made the experience even better. The only feedback I would have is to have more vegetarian options and to use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock."

Frankly, I have no idea why this class is so popular. My reason being...1) After the class begins, they ask you to grab your place at chopping, grinding, or leave-picking stations. You will be pushed around with people trying to find their place to work on smth (with class size being up to 20ppl), and their pushy staffs (they have like 7 staffs helping around) aren't too helpful either. They just take veggies that were sitting at other stations, and tell you to chop it. But not in a friendly or wanting to help way at all. Pretty hostile in fact.2) You don't really get to eat what you cooked. They give you a little station with stove, and tell you to stir this stir that etc, but food that everyone made gets COMBINED into one big bowl and gets mixed. When class was done, I couldn't eat mine all the way since it was way too salty. I understand people have different sodium level preference- but I think the way class has been laid out is bit poor.3) They won't give you basic understanding of how each ingredients are used. Yes, they tell you what each ingredients are called- but you won't get any explanation over how each can be used and incorporated. So, if you are just looking for an experience of cooking Balinese food itself- then this class would be good for you. However, if you are like myself, who is looking to learn how to utilize spices, then I'd say look for some other classes.4) Unfriendly staff and environmentMs. Paspu has helpers around her moving things around and placing ingredients for participants. As I mentioned earlier, they are not friendly at all. They are always in rush, and when I tried to grab my plate to put into heated pan, (I guess they made a mistake and placed a wrong one?) they just grabbed it out of my hand without saying anything, and just placed a different plate saying \"Use this\". Just the whole environment felt pretty unfriendly, even though Ms. Paspu is up there smiling and keeping on calling you \"honey\".At the end, I felt like I didn't get much out of the class. It felt more like a factory with random chopping, and grinding ingredients without really knowing what they are supposed to be used for. My boyfriend and I I even left without having dessert because we were so tired of being there...I honestly think you can find smth better with the same class fee, which is IDR 350,000 per person."

If a normal cooking show on TV is like watching a movie, this is like watching the same in 3D or maybe 5D if I add aroma and taste.If you have NEVER cooked, you will still find the chopping and grinding of novelty but if you are into even putting together a basic meal for yourself, you may feel you could have got this by looking up the recipe online.The only two things I will give then is that you end up eating a good meal and they run a well planned course."

The team were really friendly and gave lots of helpful examples for substitutes should the ingredients not be available in your home country. Needless to say the food itself was amazing, some of the tastiest food we had in Indonesia. The free pick up and drop off service to Ubud is great and is only 15/20 minutes away from the centre (Ubud traffic dependent!). One thing to mention is that we only got a response via tripadvisor not via the contact and booking form on the direct website. Would highly recommend this class."

You have to go to this class whilst in Ubud!"

Paon Bali has the best instructor 'Puspa' in whole of Ubud and possibly in whole of Bali. The location is a 2 storey cooking school cum house and the entire staff is extremely welcoming. All ingredients were professionally organized, really fresh and proper hygiene maintained at all times. Partcipants were served with tea and coffee. Puspa was really entertaining and her instructions were really easy to follow. This is a must to do experience if you are in Ubud, Bali."

I signed up for the morning class, which started with them picking me up from my hostel, followed by a tour of the locals morning market (which becomes the tourist souvenir market later in the day), with explanations about local fruits, veggies and spices. We then drove to a rice terrace on the way to the kitchen and were taught about the farming process of rice. At Paon itself, we were given a welcome drink, and had a funny intro by the husband and wife duo who run the company. The cooking class began with an explanation of the 8 dishes we would cook, then we all (18 of us)set out to do the prep, with each person doing something different (which made the prep time super quick). For the cooking, we paired up and took turns with one person cooking and one person adding the food to the pan, then switched off throughout the morning. Overall the food was absolutely amazing, and it was so much fun! There were even leftovers! I totally recommend this class!"

The dishes prepared were delicious and helpful instruction was provided in the creation of each dish. Written recipes were provided at the end of the night and email/web contacts provided in case we had questions. Puspa is a generous, cheerful and hilarious host who maintains a constant rapport with the group and ably leads a team of assistants who work with the participants in the meal preparation. This was one of the most enjoyable cooking classes we've participated in and would highly recommend!"

You're made to feel like part of the family. No risk of Bali belly here as all the meat is kept refrigerated (they also buy direct from a halal supplier) until ready to use & everything is kept very clean.

For this cooking class you are taken to the home of the brilliant Puspa and Wayan, who have converted half of their compound into a fully featured Balinese version of the Masterchef kitchen, complete with several helpful assistants to help things run smoothly. They were at great pains to emphasise the hygiene side of things, using bottled water for drinks, explaining the meat source, and avoiding the dreaded BB (Bali belly)! As someone who is paranoid about food I must say the setup was excellent and I had no qualms about eating the food we made. We were in a group of around 20, but predominantly worked in couples, and all the pot washing and cleaning was taken care of for us. The host was an amazing lady, very funny, and a real character. It certainly opened my eyes to Balinese cuisine, especially the vegetarian options, which were full of flavour. Book now!"

The owner and cooking teacher explained why things were laid out in a specific way in the house. We then got cleaned up and the dishes were explained.

And an amazing place to learn to cook. The class begins with an explanation of what you will be cooking and the ingredients then the group begins prepping the ingredients - you will get to take turns doing different preparations (chopping, grinding, slicing etc). After that you and a partner will cook six dishes and two sauces together and sit down to a delicious traditional Balinese feast ending with a simple and delicious dessert. Overall it was an amazing experience and I highly recommend it. You will leave with a happy belly and a book of recipes to recreate the delicious creations at home.

I was concerned I would be a 'downer' on the whole party- as the cooking class was a part of a tour. I had no reason to be concerned this was the best cooking adventure I have experienced. The hosts (Wayan) and his boss (wife, Puspa) full of character, local knowledge and culinary talents; facilitated a class that one could not fail, but could learn and best of all create a delicious multi-dish meal from local, traditional ingredients and methods; in the beautiful serene surrounds. The entire cooking team were fluent in their English and so efficient, talented (& forgiving). For those that have specific dietary needs Puspa had numerous creative substitutes- which tasted as fabulous as the other meals. Trust me you will get so much more from this unique class than you anticipate. Ps: you will also take home a recipe book."

The setting was truly magnificent, immaculately clean and set up for a fabulous cooking experience and feast. I've done this class every time I've visited Bali and always learn something new and refresh my cooking skills to bring home. Couldn't recommend them more highly. Puspa and Wayan's warmth and personality and beauty are magnetic. Highly recommend for a wonderful experience of Balinese life and food. It is always a highlight of my visit to Bali.

She really made the whole experience an enjoyable one. Each step of the process was beautifully explained and we actually learned the different traditional Thai styles of cooking. Mommy Puspa was even considerate enough to add a last-minute dish of Mee Goreng, which I had earlier mentioned was a dish that I loved. Because of the light and fun environment that was set by Mommy Puspa and her team, we were able to interact easily with new people from different walks of life. Such a great first day experience!

We were picked up very punctually by their driver and the venue is actually not very far away at all. Maybe only a 15 minute drive from Monkey Forest Street. We were warmly greeted by Wayan and Puspa and had a lovely refreshing lime welcome drink before being told about the building. We were then taken upstairs to start the class. Puspa is hilarious and incredibly welcoming. The chef who took our class was very thorough and helpful with any queries. We got a chance to learn how to chop, slice, crush and blend the Indonesian way and the aromas throughout were great! We cooked a total of 8 different dishes and the operation was so smooth. The members of staff who cleaned and transformed the kitchen after every dish were brilliant. We had a lovely group and all the food we cooked was simple but tasty. We also got the recipes to take home after. A great experience to have in Ubud and well worth the money."

We waited for 20-30 minutes for another 12 people to join us before we were told about the area and growing process. We got back into our respect vans and continued on to the Subawa family home in Laplapan village. We were given a refreshing drink and a brief introduction in their courtyard from Mr. Subawa and then waited (again) for his wife to start the class as there were two classes being held at the same time in different parts of the house which she went back and forth between.We prepared the ingredients in two large groups and cooked in pairs in an immaculate kitchen. We created and tasted 8 different dishes. Dietary requirements were addressed. Recipes were received at the end of the class and only cash was accepted for payment.Mr and Mrs Subawa are great hosts but it felt like we were attending a cooking school factory. I wish their website was more informative and included the size of the cooking classes with a detailed itinerary. We would have preferred a smaller, more personalised approach, with less waiting around."

Each mouthful an explosion of the spices and flavours that we had helped to create. On the business side of things, the cooking school is excellently run.

After a hotel pickup, the class started by a visit of Ubud's food market to discover the products we would use later. Then we headed to the owners' home where we were welcome by Wayan, the owner. Such a sweet character! He entertained us with funny stories for a couple of minutes, explaining how Balinese homes were organized. Then we were handled by his wife Puspa and her team, to prepare our dishes. A lot of the tedious tasks (like peeling garlic or turmeric, mincing the chicken) were already done, so we could concentrate on mixing the ingredients and cooking them. Everybody tried everything as we were constantly rotating so we could discover different aspects of the cooking process, including preparing the famous yellow sauce in the Balinese blender. The atmosphere was super friendly and the organization and timing super professional. We left the place with the recipes and a promise to Puspa to rate our experience five stars.. what else?"

Puspa is lovely and a real character, she made the whole morning a lot of fun and her staff are all knowledgable and helpful. We visited the market in the morning, which eludes to the fact you buy your ingredients here, but it is actually just a tour. Which was still enjoyable. The group's are quite large but then you are split up onto smaller tables to firstly prepare all of the ingredients - herbs, spices and veg. Everyone rotates and get a chance to try everything - definitely need one of those large knives!!!I'm Gluten Free and Puspa knew exactly what needed to come out of which recipe and separated some ingredients for me and knew exactly what was what the entire way through. Within your smaller group you then cook all the ingredients and this involves lots of new ingredients and skills which was so much fun.Of course the best bit is eating the food later on, the chicken curry and the satay was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be giving them a go at home - and Puspa has now sent me further recipes which I can't wait to tryWould DEFINITELY recommend for a real taste of Balinese cooking."

From the warm welcome on arrival to all the jokes, the cleanliness of the facilities, the quality of the ingredients and the instruction all the way through to the tasting (amazing), the Paon Bali Cooking Class is an absolute must do activity. You won't be disappointed!Wayan and Puspa are so funny and on top of that it was so nice to 1) learn how to cook Balinese food and 2) to understand the resourcefulness of how they cook.Plenty of options for veggies and meat-eaters and Wayan and Puspa's house was incredible; we were welcomed like family members!"

The prompt pickup from our hotel was followed by a delicious welcome drink, a tour of Auntie Puspa's beautiful home (the views!) and meeting her adorable dogs. The setting above the river is really spectacular, and there is real charm in cooking in Puspa's own home. Her husband and her assistants are all delightful. Seamless transition between preparing the ingredients, cooking the food and making sure everyone feels involved and sure of themselves. Great opportunity to meet people too, if you are traveling solo or as a couple. Making good friends and sharing laughs with them was such a bonus. Can't wait to cook some of the recipes for my family. Thanks, honey! ;)"

We had allergies, gluten free and vegetarians in our group all of which the staff had alternative options for which tasted just as great! We all participated in the cooking process and it was very hands on. The staff ensured we all moved to different preparation areas and tried the traditional ways of making the basic Balinese sauces. We cooked in pairs, swapping with each other for every dish. Would absolutely recommend to anyone travelling to Bali wanting to experience a true Balinese meal, in a traditional home with lovely hosts. Will absolutely be returning here on our next trip to Bali!!"

A great introduction to our short stay in Ubud on our first morning there. Everything was super organised, well set up, beautiful, thoughtfully done, and the food was fantastic. It really set us up to appreciate and understand Balinese food and the culture around it. Puspa is a real character - very welcoming, funny and chatty. We did a morning class so got a tour of the Ubud markets with Puspa. This was a real hit to the senses and again set us up for the rest of our stay in Ubud with her explaining bartering and the different ingredients and even cooking utensils we came across. The cooking class was run on a balcony (one of three or four classrooms we thought) that overlooked lush forest and had a welcome breeze coming in. Hygiene was flawless, we always had cold water, and everyone enjoyed a really hands on experience with us doing some prep work as well as using the stove top burners and even shaping our own sate kebabs. Be prepared to eat yourself silly and make some friends. If you're vegetarian or have any other requirements this isn't a problem for this course, they're very accommodating and make everyone feel at ease in a Balinese kitchen."

It was a morning very well spent for me and I'd definitely recommend this place if you want to experience Balinese style cooking.

I naively believed that we would all be preparing and cooking individual dishes from scratch, instead we were assigned different food preparation tasks before taking turns with a partner to cook the different dishes. There were a lot of people in our morning class and many were already experienced cooks, for a novice like myself I would have learned more in a smaller class.I also felt that the morning trip to the market was really not necessary, no ingredients were purchased and the information we received there was duplicated in the class. If you want to see the morning market in action get there at 6am when the locals are doing their food shopping.That said it was a fun class, Puspa was fabulously entertaining and the group (those that I did get to talk to) were a fantastic bunch of people. At the end of the class you take home with you a booklet of the recipes, which also gives great tips on alternative ingredients to use back home."

Paon Bali offers those interested in Balinese cooking an excellent professionally run experience, a delicious meal and a chance to meet other food lovers from around the world. We went for the evening meal, so missed the market and rice field visit, but this did not at all detract from the experience for us. We were picked up and returned to our Villa in Ubud as part of the service. In between we had a lot of fun making nine different Balinese dishes. Importantly you learn to make staples such as a yellow curry sauce and peanut sauce that then are key ingredients in to a wide array of dishes. As someone who regularly cooks Asian food at home I learned a lot about the ingredients, how much to use, and how to prepare them. The whole evening is incredibly well organised. There is a very big focus on hygiene and all the ingredients are pure and clean. We have one daughter with food allergies and the other is a vegetarian and Paon catered for their needs with ease and without fuss. It was especially nice that our vegetarian daughter got to cook all the vegetarian versions of the dishes she was to eat. This is our fifth trip to Ubud, so we have pretty much seen and done everything around here, but this was our first cooking class and certainly well worth doing - and at Rp.350,000 per person it is incredibly good value. Finally we met a nice Belgian family and got to get to know them and share a lovely Balinese banquet."

My only complaint is that the morning market stop didn't really serve a purpose because we didn't buy any ingredients there (all the ingredients had already been purchased). I feel like this takes away from the authenticity because it's always nice choosing the meats and produce you want to cook with beforehand just like the locals. Maybe I'm just spoiled because the cooking class I did in Vietnam included the market stop and we bought everything at the market we would use to cook with and the teacher there did a very good job explaining to us how to tell if something is fresh or old at the market etc which was very interesting to learn. Just gives it a more authentic feeling purchasing food like the locals at the market which this class doesn't do. I also think the class is a little big and perhaps offering smaller more intimate classes would be better. But besides those two issues it was a very pleasant day cooking with friends."

To be fair, I just need to say that i don't think i have ever rated a 5 to any business before.There was also another class running at the same time, so there was alot going on. The class was well organised and methodically structured like an orchestra. The staff were very nice and helpful and i have to give special mention to the husband whom i thought was so lovely and genuine. Throughout the class there was consistent referral to food safety to prevent Bali Belly. The location appeared clean and tidy.I noted some attendees felt uncomfortable leaving their belongings in a place which was accessible to others and not in view which was fair.

Step by step, we prepared a lavish and delicious meal, with advice and assistance from the staff.They manage a pretty astonishing balancing act during the class. On the one hand, we all became a well-oiled machine, grinding and slicing and chopping, mixing, frying, sauteeing, etc etc. On the other hand, it felt completely relaxed, and everyone was having fun.As impressive as that is, of course, it doesn't make a difference if the product isn't satisfying. It was. Soup, curry, sate, gado gado, snake bean salad, pepes ikan, tempeh kereng and for dessert, boiled banana with palm syrup. All delicious. All spicy and layered, the way Balinese food should be.If you like to eat, have fun and make friends, this one is a no-brainer. You won't find a better way to spend an afternoon."

BEST ADVISE EVER!We did the evening course so we didn't go to the market. for us it was fine because we already know all the ingredients.The class is very efficient and everybody gets to do every dish.when the moment comes you feel like taking break, you are already done and they overlook the final stage of waiting by the \"engine\" :).The queen of this kitchen is an awesome lady called Puspa, her husband is an amazing guy with the best sense of humor.Thank you for an amazing night!"

I choose Paon Cooking Class and had a beautiful experience. The staff is particular nice and kind. They show you trough every step and you can follow them really easy. You make a lot of dishes for everyone to enjoy afterwards. I loved that they use traditional Bali kitchen tools and that the instructors give you a solution how to do it at home if you don't possess them. The fun you have during the cooking makes you feel very confident and made me feel as it isn't that difficult. I enjoyed it and recommend it to all Balinesian Food lovers!!! :)"

You start in the market learning about the foods and spices of Bali and then to the family villa to learn how to cook Balinese essentials, all the while learning important elements of Balinese culture. After cooking a traditional Balinese meal, you eat the fruits of your labors. The recipes are spectacular. The quality of teaching is top tier. It is well organized and they anticipate your questions. They inquire about dietary restrictions and make accommodations (one of our group had allergies). The cooking experts and the novices in our group adored the program equally. I'm excited to try what I learned. The view is gorgeous too."

Collected from our hotel in Seminyak and driven to Ubud where we met up with our fellow budding chefs where we had a tour of the Ubud Market, then off to the Rice Paddies for a lesson on how rice gets to the table!!A short drive later we were greeted by Wayan with a refreshing Lemon Juice and then we hit the kitchen... Puspa showed us how to chop, dice, and blend. We were underway and cooking.Our class was a mix of young and old and from all corners of the world, 15 in total and everyone had a great time. Laughing and chatting while we took turns preparing or cooking. We made 8 courses in total and at the end all sat down together to enjoy the fruits of our labours. The food was great and the company and surrounds even more so.This would have to be one of the most fun things you can do in Bali and great value for money. Much cheaper than some of the others but not cheap and nasty. Do your self a favour and give this place a go, you will not regret it."

There is an afternoon class that does not include the markets. I think the markets is just for morning class.

The husband was incredibly funny, welcoming and just an overall happy guy. His wife, our cooking guide or \"food friend\" as they said was also hilarious, sweet and a wonderful teacher. Right when we arrived we got welcome drinks. The cooking was fun, relaxed and interesting. There was probably 15 of us in total, but they split us up into smaller groups which was nice. The food was the best food I've had yet in Bali (and we made it! #score). The ambiance and setting is beautiful, the facilities are clean and they offer lots of tea, coffee, beer, soda and water. But the hosts and their staff made the experience go from 5 starts to 10 stars. I would recommend this for couples, friends and even solo travelers. Can't wait to take our little recipe books and make some of these dishes! I would say this is a must-do if you come to Ubud."

At 35,000 rupiah (about \u00a315) each, it's a complete bargain. To put things into perspective, our hotel was running one for more than a million rupiah pp! We wanted the early morning class with market visit, but as we were booking the day before it was sold out. Luckily we got a space on the 4pm class. Pickup was smooth and included in the price (drop off is also included afterwards). After arriving at Wayan and Puspa's home, we were greeted with a cool welcome drink and treated to Wayan's little comedy routine - hilarious! Next up we met Puspa, who enjoys calling everyone honey and is an excellent teacher. Their couples standup routine is just brilliant and obviously well rehearsed! Prep and chopping gets everyone involved, we all had several tasks to carry out. When it came to cooking we were all doing the same thing, with our individual efforts then combined to form the large to dish for everyone to share and eat at the end. A genius and smooth way of teaching 20+ people at once. The food at the end was delicious and it was a sociable evening, eating and chatting to our fellow travellers. Vegetarians need not worry - there are alternatives available. My boyfriend and I are so pleased we gave this class a go and can't wait to try the recipes at home. Highly, highly recommend."

He introduced us to his home beforehand and it was more like a show he made us laugh and feel loved. The house itself is incredible very clean bathrooms and kitchen/dining area. The cooking portion pretty much took up the whole day but we learned traditional cooking methods and the staff were very helpful and patient with us! We got a chance to eat overlooking a wonderful view and made some great friends at the same time, if you're in the area highly recommended!"

            "review": "A Slice Of Balinese Life. TL; DR Do it. No regrets. Scenic cooking class, satisfaction guaranteed. Before I start this review, I'd like to give a quick shout out to the wonderful people of Bali and the stunning place that it is. Anyone planning a trip there will never regret it. On with the review now.\u2022What is Paon Bali? What can I expect?\u2022-Paon Bali, roughly translating to Kitchen in Bali, is one of the numerous cooking classes in Bali, promising to teach authentic cuisine. There are two sessions, one each in the morning and afternoon starting at 8:30 AM and about 4 PM respectively. However the difference would be that the morning session includes a market tour while the latter does not. -The market in Ubud is quite interesting and you're shown around and given a sample of various local fruits (In addition to spices, knives, wood carvings, face masks, meat, dried fish).You could also buy some of the wares if you wish. (Negotiation, it goes without saying, is a must). After about half an hour like this, you'll be taken to the beautiful rice terrace village of Laplapan for a quick view and tour before proceeding to the actual class.\u2022What can I expect at the class? How is the scene?-The class itself is at the beautiful home of Wayan and Puspa, who are possibly the best hosts in the world. You're graciously welcomed into their gorgeous house with a tall glass of particularly refreshing lemonade. Here, Wayan regales you with his humorous and witty take on the world today and makes you feel like one of his family members coming home to roost. All this while you're sitting around in the courtyard, with a bunch of strangers who begin to feel like family already. The coming together of flavors, so to say, has already begun. -Wayan then leads you to the kitchen where the class takes place. Here, after a cup of tea or coffee, you finally meet Puspa, who can absolutely be called the Nigella Lawson of the East. She explains beautifully and the dishes seem to throw themselves together. -You will be taught about 8 dishes including a dessert.\u2022What is so special about this class?You suspect that you're being made to cut dummy veggies, crush prop spices, which will be stealthily disposed and perfect dishes be replaced in their stead. There's nothing of that sort, no. All the food is cooked by YOU, 100% and still is completely authentic. Herein lies the magic; You could go in completely inexperienced, and still be proud of the fact that you made something so beautiful. That is one heck of a feeling and that alone makes this class worthwhile!\u2022Is it crowded? No, expect about 30-40 people or fewer in a batch. It does not feel uncomfortable at all.\u2022 Price350,000 IDR (Indonesian Rupiah) ie $26 per person.\u2022How to get thereThey offer free pick up anywhere in Ubud. Else, you may take a hotel taxi. However, be sure to set out early if you're at a considerable distance from the place, and make sure your driver actually knows where the place is.\u2022What about food allergies? I'm a vegetarian, can I attend? I do not eat beef or pork, how can I attend?-You will be asked about any known allergies beforehand, therefore there is no need to fret.-Vegetarians will be taught appropriate dishes, and there is no dearth of delicious Balinese veggie options-Chicken and fish are the only meats used, with none of the sauces being of animal origin. Any other meats are suggested as alternatives but not actually used."

            "review": "Delicious Traditional Balinese Food. This was the only cooking class we did in Ubud and it was a great experience. The day starts off with a pickup from your hotel followed by a tour of the local market. Afterwards, they take you to a BEAUTIFUL Balinese home approximately 10 minutes from the market. The father of the family greeted us and welcomed us to his home and explained a bit about Balinese culture, Ubud and his family. Next was the cooking. They started off asking if anybody had dietary restrictions (eg vegetarian, allergies, etc) which was very thoughtful. They even have a second kitchen to prepare food for certain religious restrictions (e.g. Muslim or otherwise). They had us prepare and cook all of the food and explained what substitutes could be used if we couldn't find some of the ingredients. This was appreciated as it would definitely be difficult to find certain items back home. I cannot thank them enough for welcoming us into their home and showing us how to cook such delicious and authentic Balinese food. They even provide you with the recipes to take home.My only comment was I thought this could have been done without a trip to the market (30-40 minutes). The reason is because, in my opinion, the market wasn't that out of the ordinary. Also, for the cooking class, most of the foods are sourced elsewhere (higher quality) to ensure tourists don't feel sick if they are not used to some of the more local qualities (this is a positive in my opinion). That being said, it seemed others enjoyed the market so please take this with a grain of salt. Overall, it was a GREAT way to spend a morning and I would highly recommend this to anybody who loves eating and/or cooking!"

            "review": "Amazing experience. It's a day later and I'm still thinking about the amazing experience I had yesterday in the morning session of the Paon Bali Cooking class. Everything from beginning to end was simply wonderful. You're picked up at your local Ubud hotel and transported to the market for the first part of the class. You gave an opportunity to see and learn about some of the local foods and customs in preparation for the class. Next stop is a quick stop to the rice fields to have that process explained. Last stop is to the Paon family home for the actual cooking class. We were greeted with a wonderful welcome drink into the most amazing open air setting. Not sure if this is what all typical Balinese homes are like but this was just stunning. Next we are taken to the open kitchen prep area where all of the ingredients we'll be using to prepare our meal are displayed beautifully. Pupsa, who is is so endearing and calls everyone \"Honey\" explains all of the ingredients and what we'll be making then it's time to get down to work. Everything runs like a well oiled machine, even with a class of at least 20 people. Everyone has an opportunity to slice, dice, and participate in the prep of the ingredients we'll be using for the meal. Then when it's time to cook, each person has an opportunity to do that as well. They are great about switching up so that everyone has an opportunity to do everything. Even though neither situation applied to me, they were especially concorned about people that were vegetarians and/or had food allergies to ensure that their food was prepared separate or with appropriate modifications from everyone else. The end result was the most amazing meal!!!! And when you leave you are given copies of each recipe to take home with you to prepare at home. I have already posted about my experience on Facebook advising anyone I know to take this class when they visit Bali and if/when I return, I will surely do it again myself. Thanks again for the amazing experience."

We were picked on time(the real one,not the Balinese one) in our Ubud hotel (if you are not in Ubud,they will pick you up for a fee). The class is in Puspa and Wayan home. It is split usually into two smaller groups. Puspa is really amazing teacher and she really cares about everyone's comfort.

(i might suggest not eating breakfast that day also.) this experience was truly the highlight of that day and one of the main highlights to my entire experience in bali. i really can't say enough to express how pleased i was with paon bali. absolutely worth the $350,000 rupiah (approx. $35 USD) that i paid. my only suggestion would be to extend the program a little to include 15-20 minutes of shopping time, after the market presentation (i found myself wanting to purchase some fruit and spices afterward, but didn't have time to.)even still, I GIVE THIS EXPERIENCE **10 STARS!!!**thank you for a beautiful, memorable experience!!!amber s."

I would like to start by saying all three of us were glad we did. Pick up time was on real not Bali time that was nice but it's vacation so what's a few minutes if they were. They dropped us off at the market where our guide taught us of local ingredients and just being in and seeing the market was really neat. From there we went out to a rice field and another guide gave us a very informative \"tour\"( we just stood there but lecture sounds boring). From there it was on to cooking. When we arrived at a beautiful house we were greeted with a most delicious lime drink which was a great start. Names have escaped me but the husband entertained us while things were being prepped in the back. He did an amazing job of being funny and entertaining but also quite informative of they layout Balinese houses and how family life works. Once he finished it was off to the kitchen where we were greeted by his wife and a layout of gorgeous ingredients. I wish I could remember names but the wife who was teaching us to cook the dishes was equally as amazing at mixing entertainment and humour but still kept it informative. The cooking part was fun and there only being 20 or so of us we all got to cook everything with the odd hand off of duties. I should also mention they handled my seafood allergy very well. The food we made was amazing and I'm so glad we got to bring the recipes home with us. Once we paid there was zero wait we walked out and straight into a car and were taken back to our hotel. The best way to describe the over all experience is don't leave Bali without trying this it would be a serious mistake."

Was actually nice to get out and see a bit more of the land. Do the morning tour which includes the market tour as well - afternoon tour = no market tour. From the markets you head back into the crazy traffic to the homestead of the lovely couple who run the tours. A brief explanation of the house and we're up to start chopping. There's enough to do and share without being overly involved or uninvolved. It's sounds like a lot of dishes but they are pros and it all gets eaten by everyone. They have multiple classes running at once and we were up the stairs which was excellent to see into the valley right before us. Fell asleep in the car on the way back to the hotel. Excellent day and the recipes have all had a work out since coming home. Food is incredible and incredibly easy. Yes to this all over again."

We were given a 30 min wet(?) market tour which was nice, it included fruits, spices, utensils, etc. 10 of us (all couples) were transported via their company van to Puspa's place. The cooking area overlooks the beautiful Ubud scenary. Ingredients were peeled and cleaned for us, we only need to do the cutting and cooking. Everyone had a shot at cutting ingredients, cooking, etc. Puspa and her assistants made sure everyone was doing something. Everything from start to end was very smooth and organized. Loved it."

We chose to join the cooking class for the evening session, but it is great you have the option for a morning session that also includes a market experience. Puspa and her family were so fun and made the experience a wonderful time. Upon arrival you get a delicious welcome drink, and then the fun begins. It is set up very well with lots of room for everyone in a great outdoor kitchen atmosphere. The variety of dishes that you get to prepare and enjoy afterwards are so tasty. From start to finish everything was perfect. We was an authentic experience and loved learning more about the cultural meaning behind a Balinese Home. We loved this cooking class and would highly recommend it to any traveler! A must do while in Ubud"

We received printed recipes for the 8 dishes we made. We were picked up at 8:15am and dropped off around 1:30pm. 350,000rupiah included our transportation in nice vehicles, trip to the local produce market, class, and of course eating the lunch we prepared. Great experience. Fun for husbands too, but they opted out. Too bad. They would have loved it. Highly recommend."

We learnt about the owners compound. I love these two..... Married for 17 years I believe and they bounce off each other. They are so funny and very caring. The kitchens are large and you all get to have a try of smashing, chopping, frying etc. A fridge full of cool water was free and you could drink as much as you needed. Toilets clean and tidy.

Also, we brought our five-year-old daughter with us and they arranged a lovely babysitter for her while we cooked. If you have time to do just one tour while in bali, make sure it includes this cooking school. Do the morning tour, if you have time, as the walk-through of the local market is really interesting."

Having read other reviews about Paon I thought I had to check it out.We went for a morning class as I had wanted to see the markets. We were picked up punctually and taken to the market where - Wayan I believe? Showed us around. We got to try different fruits and had an explanation on various ingredients we would be using. Her english was awesome, she was very informative and the markets were sensory overload. An awesome start!It was back to Laplapan to have a brief lesson on an paddy field. This was very informative and the guide was a local who's family had farmed rice for generations, his knowledge came through very well and I learnt lots that day.Next stop was to the house for a refreshing welcome drink, introduction and to be taken around the family home. I must confess I can't remember his name - we did the class a week ago and it has been very busy but all the same MR was very funny and friendly welcoming us all.We cooked 8 different dishes and were given the opportunity and encouraged to have a go at every part. Before any section we would have a talk about the meal we were doing and it was all very interesting. There were 2 people to each stove and we were in different sections o it was all very social. Bottled water was available throughout which was handy as it was thirsty work!We used a traditional balinese mortar and pestle and cooked on a barbecue with coconut coal. Honestly a very unique experience and totally tasty!Finally we all sat down to enjoy our food and chat about the morning. An unbelievable experience from start to finish. Everyone involved was friendly, knowledgeable and were people people.I would recommend to everyone and anyone.p.s almost forgot the settting which is a spectacular open plan kitchen with views over rice fields - immense."

I expected the classes to be more hands on, cooking a full dish per couple instead of everyone cooking their portion and combining it together to make one dish. Overall it was a pleasant evening and if you're new in the kitchen, this would suit you. If you're more experience in cooking, especially with Asian cuisine, this cooking class may be a tad simple for you."

My husband and I enjoy taking cooking classes in different countries we visit, and this was one of the best organized.Prior to arrival, email communication with Puspa was prompt and easy. Explanation of all the ingredients and each person getting to cook each menu item (there were 8) were excellent. Instead of dividing the group to put 2-3 people in charge of each dish, everyone participated in cooking every dish in small portions, then combined in a single pot/pan for final heating and serving.The setting was also very nice -- at Puspa and Wayan's home with 2-story open kitchen. Overall a wonderful experience, and totally worth it just for the delicious food you get to eat!"

It runs like clockwork. You learn the basics of some utterly delicious Balinese dishes and even get the recipe books to take home. We'll definitely be trying them!

The organization was seamless and stellar. Pickups happend on time. The guides were friendly, professional, informative, and spoke very good English. We enjoyed the market tour and tasting the various locally grown fruits, smelling the local spices, and walking through the colourful chaos that characterizes the site. After we drove maybe 10 minutes to a house in a nearby village where the actual cooking class took place. The place was spotless and had an incredible view from the second floor open kitchen over the jungle. Again, the organization was fantastic. The food was prepped so that we got to do all the fun stuff and none of the tedious work. The staff was all so friendly and helpful and extremely conscientious of cleanliness and sanitation. They washed their hands frequently, had us do the same, and used hand sanitizer to show us before touching any food. Our class size was small (8 people), which was fantastic for getting hands on and we had a really nice group. There were two other classes running simultaneously in different kitchens throughout the house, but the setup was so thoughtfully considered that we hardly even knew they were there. I've heard the menu is pretty similar from school to school but I can't complain one bit because every dish was delicious! We made 8 things in total: Balinese salad, yellow sauce (the key ingredient in 70% of Indo dishes we learned), peanut sauce, gado-gado, satay lilit, chicken curry, fried tempeh, and boiled bananas and jackfruit for dessert. We left with full bellies, a booklet full of recipes, and smiles on our faces from the wonderful staff and the hilarious jokes from Puspa, the matron of the house and the mastermind behind the Paon school.We'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to do a cooking class in Ubud. It was a great experience."

We booked the cooking class after reading reviews on TripAdvisor, the class was a fraction of the cost of booking a cookery class with our hotel at 350,000pp (\u00a320)We were picked up at 8.15am from our hotel in a people carrier (this was included in the price), and collected another couple en route. We visited Ubud Market and had a tour guide who spoke English very well. He described importance of temples and offerings in Hinduism culture prior to touring the market. In the market we tried various fruits from Bali and he showed us stalls relating to our cookery class (spices, meats, utensils to buy..) From here we drove to a local paddy field and had an opportunity to take photos. From here we could see other people carriers who were also on the tour. Each car arrived at the cookery class and we were greeted with an iced glass of lemon drink. One of the hosts spent 5-10 mins giving a talk about Balianise culture and their home (I won't give any spoilers!) it was really insightful and each person who was hosting the class was friendly and kind.  the class, (which had about 20 people take part) was well organised. All the food was weighed with veggies peeled ready. We were given tea and coffee before starting and each an apron and cloth. Excellent hygiene throughout. We each chopped various elements to each dish, the host described each dish we were going to make and kept reminding us of how the elements came together. We split into pairs and used a burner between us to make dishes, contents were combined before being served. The food was amazing, we were each given a recipe book with the indonesian name of dishes in addition to English titles. We emailed the class for the chicken stock recipe after we left and we're given the recipe within a day! The class was fantastic, lots of opportunities to experience traditional Balianise Cooking - totally recommend this experience for anyone in the area. "

We begun are day meeting in the market where we were met by our guide and given a tour of the market to see what the ingredients we would be using later looked like. We were driven to the class site, which is a large private home in the midst of rice fields, just outside of the main city. We learned more about the ingredients and how we could source or substitute them if unavailable back home. We were divided into small groups where we were instructed in a step-by-step process to prepare and then cook the dishes. Once the cooking was complete, we enjoyed the fruits of our labor, a delicious multiple course Balinese meal."

The market tour involved standing around being spoken to about fruits etc rather than focusing on and buying the ingredients for the dishes we were to cook. There were way too many of us in the group (26). The cooking class itself was more of a chopping experience. I didn't get to make a dish from start to finish and even when we did cook ingredients off, they were just added to a big dish with everyone else's so I didn't get to taste how I cooked it. Pros:-Pick up and collection from accommodation-lovely, tasty food-nice hostsCons:-class size WAY too big, you get lost in the group.-don't really get to cook anything from start to finish- a lot of waiting around during the day (in the market, waiting for others to chop etc)"

The market was very dirty & unpleasant to walk through but it was full of color and vibrancy. Then a stop by some rice terraces with our driver guide who gives us some idea of how rice is grown and harvested and also a little bit about the composition and families which make up the villages around Ubud.Finally we make it to Paon's house. With our welcome nice cold drink we sit around the courtyard whilst Paon welcomes us to his courtyard and explains a little about the layout of Bali houses and their compounds.Then we are introduced to his lovely wife and the cooking lesson begins in her lovely wide open kitchen - well thought out layout - work tables - burners (switch on your engines), a wonderful team of assistants getting all our cooking utensils and ingredients ready for us to cook. We are all given opportunities to cut, dice, crush, grind, mash up ingredients using traditional Bali utensils - lots of action and fun and of course cooking our own lunch and eating it.

It helps in ordering food in Ubud. The location in a village home near padi fields is an experience you'll never get with other cooking classes. An affordable and well prepared day, with the hospitality that only the Balinese can extend.Highly recommended."

I found this cooking school as number 1 on TripAdvisor so thought I'd give it a go even though it was slightly more pricey than others after speaking to other backpackers in ubud. The day is 350,000 rs. However, I had such a great time! They picked me up at 8.25 and we walked to ubud market where we were told about the local fruits, vegetables and spices on offer. We even got to try local fruits such as snake fruit, mangosteen and hairy fruit. Next we got in the taxi and they dropped us off at a local rice paddy to take some pictures (stunning!) before driving to the cooking school. Our cooking host is the most adorable lady, you just want to take her home!! We were greeted on arrival with a cold refreshing lime squash as she introduced herself and the history of the house. Next we went inside and another welcome drink was waiting for us, either local coffee or lemongrass and ginger tea. Our group was about 20 but the room was plenty big enough that it didn't feel like a big group at all, it still felt very personal. We all got involved in the prep and then paired up for the cooking. Once everything was made we sat together and ate our delicious local dishes! Another hot drink and dessert finished the day off perfectly and we were presented with a booklet of her recipes to take home and a request to keep in touch. A perfect day with the most lovely people."

I took it with Husband, and we spent several hours learning about the food, the culture, even the architecture of a traditional Hindu home. Both Husband and I are very happy that we went.The class started with a trip to the local outdoor food market. Wow. Talk about a very eye-opening experience. Our host for this part of the trip was one of the assistants in the kitchen. He knew the vendors in the market and used their products for us to taste and touch. Being from a very sterile, Western culture, I found some of the food handling and storage shocking to say the least. Fascinating. Sometimes downright gross, but always interesting.Then we drove out to the rice paddies outside the hosts' village and had a mini lesson there about how this grain is cultivated and how big a part it plays in their lives and diet.And then we went to the home of the hosts, Puspa and Wayan. We were welcomed with a fresh limeaide drink (using bottled water so as to avoid getting \"Bali Belly\") and a speech from Wayan. He's really funny and charming. (\"Happy wife, happy life!\") He said many times that we should consider his home our home.Then off to the kitchens we went and started prepping food. We chopped, we sliced, we diced, pestled, sauteed and fried. Eight dishes later, we sat down for a delicious traditional Balinese meal that we had created with Puspa's guidance. She is also very funny and charming. \"Honeyyyy!\" she'd yell after almost every sentence. Haha. I can still hear her voice in my head. It has the same tonal quality as the actress in That Seventies Show who plays the mother, married to Red. Hilarious.If you're looking for a class that has not only traditional Balinese food at its core but also the added bonuses of a Balinese cultural education, by all means check this class out. You'll meet and share time with some other very enthusiastic tourists from around the world and feel like part of a special family by the time you leave.Of note: Puspa asked all of us to come to her if we had any problems whatsoever so she could fix things for us and for future classes. She only wants 5 stars on Trip Advisor reviews because this is how they make their living. They are very focused on ensuring their guests are happy and satisfied. I was happy to give 5 stars because they earned it. Also, our driver we paid separately, although he was arranged to pick us up by the cooking class. You could probably get one cheaper if you arrange it outside of their class on your own. We paid 650,000 rupiah for the day (because we went to another different workshop after before going back to Seminyak), and our other driver only charges us 450,000 for a full day of driving. I'm sure you can get it even cheaper if you wish, but we're happy to pay a fair price for a day's work. 650 seemed expensive for this area."

You can tell they have done this many times. We were a group of 20+ tourists, which concerned me, how do you do a hands on cooking class with that many? Not to worry, they have it all figured out.Quick stop on the way at the Ubud food market. Not really impressive, and winding down by 9AM when we got there. Then a quick stop at some rice fields, great photo ops. Also got a better idea of the ups and downs of the Ubud geography. Arrive at the private home of Puspa And Wayan, great hosts.We then cooked an 8 course meal. Chopped up all the mis-en-place in teams, (it's amazing what 25 pairs of hands can get done.) Then one by one we sauted, stir fried, or poached our way to lunch. It was delicious.And a very affordable 350,000 Rupee, or about $29 US per person.Don't miss it."

I appreciated the fact that Puspa gave alternatives to ingredients that might be hard to find All in all we made a soup , 6 mains and a dessert .All incredibly yummy "

Taking a cooking class however helps you to understand the local culture, its food and customs - and introduces you to some fun people - very nice perk for solo travelers like me. Together the 7 of us chopped and mashed and stirred and cooked following the instructions of our charming hostess. We made a soup and about 6 main course dishes and a dessert. Everything was well organized and explained - top notch hygienic conditions were followed and we had a lot of fun. We consumed our tasty fixings and I'm pleased to say I was able to take home a doggie bag so I can enjoy it again tomorrow (thanks to the frig in my apartment). I especially appreciated the pick up and drop off service and the 4 hour event is such a good value at only $26. I highly recommend Paon Bali Cooking class. Bonnie"

We started with a look around the market and heard about the local fruits and spices (Ubud market isn't the prettiest, but it was interesting to learn about the products). Then we briefly visited the rice paddies to learn about rice growing. Then onto the house of Puspa and Wayan where we cooked. It was a lovely setting overlooking the jungle and the kitchen was outdoors yet covered. I was surprised that our group was large (17 people) but there was plenty of space for everyone. Puspa was a great teacher and kept everyone working throughout the morning. We cooked 7 different dishes and they were all incredibly tasty. You eat everything that you cook. Being given the recipes to take home is a great way to finish the day. The only negative for me was the pick up from my hotel - They were 25 minutes late and then a girl turned up on a motorbike and took me down the road to the market to meet the rest of the group - I didn't mind this too much, but it was less professional than the rest of the day."

The market was bustling and colourful. Not for cleanliness freaks, this is a wet market, get over it.Over at Auntie Puspa's house we did the cooking class. In total our class had 9 people, which I think was just right. There were enough \"stations\" and equipment set up such that everyone could rotate among various different tasks such as chopping/slicing/pounding/frying, etc. If you had any problems, the staff would be there to make sure everything is alright.We got introduced to the ingredients and their alternatives (in case you couldn't find those ingredients locally). The staff were very experienced and managed time very well. There was a good balance of explanation, demonstration and practical hands-on time with the cooking. The instructions were peppered with jokes in between for great entertainment. At the end we got to eat the meals that we cooked, which was absolutely delicious and too much for our group to finish. You get to bring back a set of the recipes of the meal you cooked. Puspa also offered to answer any questions you might have about other dishes, over email.This activity is also great for family bonding.I am so glad that I signed up our entire family for Auntie Puspa's cooking class.

Once greeted by her entertaining hubby with a delicious, refreshing drink and given an introduction of what to expect for the afternoon, we were ushered into our kitchen, complete with gorgeous views! Our group was upstairs with an open air kitchen and intimate eating area. The cooking class flowed extremely well at all times. Unfortunately, the exuberant Puspa was working with the class downstairs but her staff that assisted us were extremely helpful and very friendly! We made 8 different dishes ~ all very flavorful and fresh! The best part was the recipe book given each participant at the end. I'm still working hard to find tempeh in Korea to make my favorite dish. Thanks so much!"

My 12 year old daughter especially loved it!"

The class is a bit large but the quality of food we cooked was great. I must say that if you are a professional cook or really serious about cooking, you might be disappointed as the class if for general public who wants to spice up their cooking. The class is designed as much entertainment as a cooking class."

We were welcomed with a refreshment and welcomed and greeted by the owner. She was very kind, funny and helpful. We cooked 7 courses and it was all delicious. The price was also very reasonable. 350000idr. Would recommend and come her again. My friends also couldn't stop talking about the great experience."

A quick drive later we stopped momentarily to hear about how rice is cultivated before another very short drive to Puspa's house.We were welcomed into Puspa's home with a refreshing drink, and entertained by Puspa's husband, Wyan for a few minutes (he's a very funny guy) until it was time to get cooking. They are very friendly & hospitable people and make you feel very welcome.The class is very professional, slick, well organised and easy to take part in. Its great fun too. There were about 20 in our group from all over the world. A couple of family groups of 4, with children, some couples and a lady on her own. Everyone cooks at stations and there is always one of the many helpers on hand should you need them.You'll read a lot of good things on trip advisor about this class....and its all true.

We got a great insight into more traditional Balinese life and how to cook some traditional Indonesian food which is often hard to find in the tourist spots of Bali. The owners clearly just love what they do and they are very successful at doing it, striving to make the class as best it can be and take on feedback from guests. A few of us even had a good gossip with puspa with some coffee after the class, showing how genuine she is about making the class an all round fantastic experience. We have done several no.1 rated cooking classes and this is certainly up there with the best. Don't leave ubud without doing this if you're interested in Indonesian food."

            "review": "So good we went twice!. We booked on to the morning cooking class session, and were picked up on time by the driver from our accommodation. We were then taken on an insightful tour of Ubud market. We had been before but not this early in the morning, when the main food sellers are active. The guide was instructive and knowledgable about local food and ingredients that would be used in the cooking class. Thankfully, food for the cooking class is provided by a supplier, not from the market which is quite unsanitary. On the way to the cooking class we also stopped at a rice paddy to learn about the cultivation of rice - again, very insightful.Upon arrival at the class we were greeted with a cold drink, which was very welcome and made to feel extremely welcome by the family! The class itself had the perfect mix between doing relatively uninteresting prep and having the feeling like we made the food, and the guests do the cooking, not the staff. In that sense it was very hands-on, no one left with nothing to do and at all times very engaging. The facilities allow everyone to participate regardless of the class size (ours was around 18). The menu is varied and flexible depending on dietary requirements e.g. Vegetarian or allergies. The speed of the class was just right, not too fast and not too slow. It was also super efficient, dirty pans being whisked away in the blink of an eye! The food itself was delicious - there was more than enough to leave feeling very full and satisfied. The family and team of helpers really made the morning- so friendly, happy, funny, helpful, and passionate about their food. We enjoyed so much we came again for an afternoon the next day. The menu we made was largely the same - a few small substitutions for several of the dishes (e.g. swapping mushrooms for tuna), one brand new dish (nasi goreng) and a brand new dessert. To some extent, the second day felt like a repetition of the previous day - however the flip-side is that we learnt so much more the second time, as the methods and ingredients sink into our memories more. And of course we got to eat the excellent food again!"

We were in a group of 19 people, of which 5 were vegetarian and had for a large part a separate cooking class. Upon arrival we were immediately offered drinks. The owner gave a quick tour of the compound. We have been to a few Balinese compounds, this one was the nicest and cleanest to see. Then we started cooking. Before every dish, the wife of the owner would explain how the dish was made, and what other ingredients to use if you can't find the same ingredients at home. Then tasks were divided and we started cooking. As mentioned in other reviews, don't expect to do everything yourself: a lot of food has been prepared already, and for example dessert was made by the personnel, but still, you get to do a fair amount of hands-on work. In the middle we had a break to enjoy the mushroom soup, then we continued with the rest. In the end we enjoyed our delicious, self-made dinner with a lovely view over a small valley, and had a nice chat with other guests. We thought it was over too soon!If you would like to do a cooking class in the Ubud area to prepare some Balinese food, we would recommend this one!"

We chose the Paon Bali cooking class because of the excellent reviews. What can I say, my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. After booking with them, they contacted the guest house where we were staying so they could pick us up the next day. The driver took us to the local market and a guide was already waiting for us there. The market tour was interesting as we learned about foodstuff and tools typically used in Balinese kitchen. On the way to Paon Bali, we stopped by the rice fields for a brief talk on rice farming. It was informative, but we weren't really interested. We were then taken to Puspa's place. The welcome drinks were already waiting for us and Puspa gave us a brief introduction to Balinese cuisine and the Paon Bali cooking class. We were then ushered to the huge outdoor kitchen. Participants took turns preparing the dishes. It was very hands-on. Everyone had a lot of fun as we tried our hands preparing the ingredients using traditional Balinese kitchen tools. The best part was eating the dishes we prepared. There was enough of each and we got our bellies filled. We had to leave earlier than other guests, but Puspa was still able to make arrangements to drop us off at our next destination. I highly recommend this to those going to Bali. One thing to note, though, is that it could easily eat up half a day's worth (or more) of your trip, so be sure to include this in the itinerary."

The driver picked us up from our hotel in kuta which i organised with puspa via email. ($40 for the day, about 1.5hrs one way ) we were taken to the markets first but a few of us had weak stomach's so we didn't stay long as the smell was a little overbearing. (Don't let that put you off at all!!) Next we were taken to the rice fields which were lovely to see then back to puspas for the class. Her husband was lovely and explained about there house and culture while we sipped a really refreshing drink they made. Then it was down to it. I liked the fact that even though there where about 25 in the class we had our own prep table and all cooked together. There was plenty of food and all tasted amazing. We were all given recipes to take home and puspa even gave us some left overs before we left as our 15yr old daughter woke up sick and had to miss the class. Since being home we invited friends over and cooked a few of the dishes for them which they also thoroughly enjoyed. No bali belly here! And for $35 an adult and half for children it's definitely worth the money and experience."

I was picked up my hotel at 8:20 promptly and whizzed off to pick up another 4 cooking 'apprentices'. Once everyone was in, we scooted off to Ubud market (downstairs is fruit, spices and meat) where our very smiley and friendly guide, Wayan, explained about Balinese traditional fruits and veg and we also tried many items such as hairy fruit, snake fruit and Balinese oranges. Myself and a few others had assumed we would help to pick the produce but as this ended up being a big group (our car met up with two others so in total around 15 of us) perhaps it would be too difficult to do so. After this we ventured off to the Rice paddies where another guide explained the family traditions of rice farming, which was very interesting. Once everyone had taken pictures etc. we head for the cooking class and were welcomed with an icy cold refreshing drink and another Wayan (owner of the business). Wayan also made us feel welcome in his home (which is huge!) and shared funny stories about their village traditions and gossip. We went into the kitchens around 10:25am where we were greeted by the host and queen B, Puspa. Before you start, Puspa goes through the menu clearly - in total 9 dishes were prepared and cooked. If you have allergies, they can tailor the menu for you (you just cook something slightly different). The meal prep was very enjoyable and a great opportunity to talk and get to know the other guests whilst you chop onions, garlic, chill or mash peanuts. Note that you also have Paon kitchen helpers to assist you and point out quantities etc. The dishes are very easy to master once you realise that the base for many dishes in Bali uses the same herbs etc. good to know for when you are making back home so you can make a batch of the yellow sauce paste! The food was SO good, probably the best Indonesian food I have eaten during my trip and situated in a large kitchens that overlook the forest. What more could you ask for? A hands-on activity with a great host and friendly family. Thanks for a great day!"

It is incredible value at AUD$35 and we gained so much knowledge and had a memorable experience. The day begins with a walk through the central market to be educated and have a taste of the local fruits and vegetables. This is particularly valuable if this is your first SE Asian experience. We then went up to Puspa's village where her cooking school is located. We stopped at the rice paddys and learnt about the propagation through to the harvesting of this grain. It was very informed. Once we arrived at Puspa's home we were given information regarding the importance of building and temple placement by Wayan, Puspa's hilarious husband. On to the food....the jungle view from our work station was amazing and both the organisation and the dishes we prepared and cooked were outstanding. It is very hands on and we all prepared and cooked our feast which was devoured with enthusiasm. This is a must do experience whilst in Ubud."

Our group of 5 (age 20+ to 60+) have all enjoyed ourselves very much in the class. Hint: as it is a minimum 90-minute drive from Seminyak, we have opted for an afternoon class and organized a couple sight-seeing activities before the class. We loved the refreshing iced welcome drink which was perfect after spending hours in the heat!"

Then we drove down to Laplapan village near Ubud town with Bali family home / cooking lessons. The owner is Wayan Subawa - very nice family. The staff was amazing - very kind, a good teacher, with good humor and good english. . After making the 7 dishes, there was so much food - no way I could eat it all (we wanted to!). As a group, we took turns preparing many vegetables and ingredients garlic, ginger, asparagus, broccoli and the horn of plenty, rice, onions, peas, tomatoes, carrots, cauliflower and plenty more. We are Bali chefs, now graduated. Wok on!"

The market is interesting though very 3rd world and a bit fragrant. (Don't visit the meat section as it is un-refrigerated and has lots of flies.) There were 10 of us for the cooking class which is held on the compound of a Balinese family. It was very well organized with a lot of attention to hygiene. Together we cut and prepared several dishes for our lunch. The teacher explained all of the ingredients and how to cut and prepare each dish. Though there were many common elements each had its own distinct flavor. The food was some of the best we've had in Bali. The facilities are modern with a nice toilet and sinks. The staff were polite and helpful and everything was clean. The price was very reasonable and she asked for feedback after we were finished. That is rare here and a good sign. We'll return on a future visit."

I booked this class when I arrived in Bali, it was a great class, however I wouldn't call it brilliant - I've been to the Baipai Cooking Class in Bangkok that is similar to this one and found the Bangkok one to be much better. With the Bali school, you don't get to make the whole dish, it is a group effort, which was a bit of a shame. Also the group that we had was huge (22), so that was hard to navigate. It would have been better if everyone got their own cooking station and you cooked dishes from scratch, but it isn't that type of class. I stayed in Seminyak and it was 400k for transport through the cooking school, which I'd recommend doing rather than booking your own taxi, as the school and markets can be difficult to find, so it is worth spending the extra on having them collect you."

We were shown all the ingredients (arranged very nicely) and were explained about a typical tradiational balinese kitchen and its steam cooker for cooking rice. We were then explained about all the 7 courses we were going to prepare (from Soup to Dessert :)...). It was very well guided and the owner was hilarious and informative and always helpful. It was fun learning about the ingredients and cooking style followed here. And then we eat :). We were also explained about the house and met their family members.All in all a great experience."

The food prep was great and there was just enough of being able to experience everything without having to do all the unpleasant work. The instructors were a hoot and kept things lively for us. Cooking was delegated into stations and I was sad to miss the tempeh even though I mentioned that was the primary reason I took the class.

I own a Travel Business and I recently discovered this tour on a google search whilst in Bali. I was looking at Casa Luna but didn't feel that it would give me the cultural experience that I was looking for. After emailing Puspa, she responded immediately and advised that The tour included a Traditional market Visit, before moving on to the family owned Rice paddy with tour and then finishing with full 8 course cooking class in Puspa's house!!Puspa and her husband were fantastic hosts, The tour really gave a insight into culture and the traditional Balinese family and way of living. Very informative. The cooking class couldn't be faulted, A fantastic variety of dishes and not hard at all, even catering to vegetarian if needed. Very hands on and we didn't just watch, we created all the meals ourselves. The kitchen was set up perfectly for a group of 20 people and the lessons were very easy to understand. The best part was sitting down afterwards to eat all of our creations buffet style. We even received a recipe book to take home!! Please give this tour a go if you are feeling the urge to be creative and cook whilst in Bali Its traditional and informative, A fantastic day tour. Located in Ubud. 5 Stars from me and would definitely do it again. Thank you Puspa for a fantastic and memorable experience."

I booked the morning Paon cooking class while I was in Ubud as a fun activity for me and my family to take part in, but also as a way to see a bit more of Ubud and eat at the same time! Once you have a date booked in, a driver comes to pick you up from your hotel (if staying in Ubud) and takes you to the first stop, Ubud market. A guide walks you through the different local foods and spices used in balinese cooking, and provides an opportunity for you to make any purchases from the market. You are then taken to the rices paddy fields to learn all there is to know about rice and it's importance in the balinese diet. After that you are taken to the paon cooking school to meet your teacher (Pushpa) and get going with some actual cooking. There is a community feel about the class, with different people doing different jobs (some people are chopping, some are blending, some frying, etc), with rotations actively encourage by Pushpa and her helpers so everyone gets an opportunity. The whole class literally makes a balinese feast, complete with starters, mains and dessert. Ingredients and tools are explained, as well as an interactive demonstration of a balinese blender! Once the meal is cooked, everyone sits down together to enjoy the fruits of their labour and at the end of the class, a booklet of the recipes cooked that day are given out to everyone. Tea, coffee and bottled water are provided throughout the whole day. Overall this was one of the favourite activities of the trip for my family because you get to make and eat super fresh, simple., tasty food, but also Pushpa's energy is just wonderful. She brings the whole group together so you don't feel like everyone is separate in their own groups, but working together for one common goal....filling our bellies!"

After this, you're welcomed into Aunty Puspa's house where she greats you with a lemon ice drink and then your choice of lemongrass and ginger tea (delicious) or Balinese coffee (strong and black). The session begins with meeting the other groups (mostly couples) and the reveal of the ingredients and what you'll be cooking. You're all then given a task (chopping, dicing or blending [which is using a mortar and pessel])After this, you're given a pan to fry a small portion of what the group has cooked. Kicked off with the term 'start your engines', you light the grill and tip in your prepared ingredients. After this, you sit down with the group you've been cooking with and enjoy the food you've created. Upon coming into this session, Aunty Puspa took careful consideration into checking food allergies and if there were any vegetarians. However, despite said precautions, some shrimp paste slipped into my partner's food and he was violently ill that night. I, however, had a great time. I went for the food but ended up making some international friends while there."

Afterwards, we were brought to the home of Ms. Puspa where we learned about the structure of Balinese homes and families. Then we got to cooking 8 dishes in stations that we rotated around. The hosts were hilarious. It was a great experience. Don't expect to learn how to cook 8 Balinese dishes in less than 5 hours. It was more a cultural lesson and introductory course in Balinese food. I loved that all the dishes were healthy. I learned alternatives to cooking healthy. Two things I really liked: 1) it was sanitary, complete with hand washing stations and sanitizers. No Bali belly for me. 2) my boyfriend was sick, started coughing when he smelled the bbq smoke. Instead of kicking us out, Ms. Puspa took care of him, gave him ginger-lemongrass tea.

We went two weeks ago, and our morning class was full even if it was off-peak season and it was a weekday! there were 24 of us total but everyone got a chance to cook. The hospitality they show you is so heartwarming, sharing their house, their home, their cultural traditions. It's quite interesting that when they asked us how we heard about Paon Bali, everyone in unison answered \"Tripadvisor\". :D You won't regret it!"

You will learn heaps about local foods and sourcing them if you do ihe morning class as it includes slso a tour of Ubud traditional market.You then will be taking yo Paon, just outsixe the centre. On the way they stop at a stunning rice field for a brief overview of the rice and its importance to Balinese families and culture. You are shown how rice is grown and the life cycle and harvesting of rice is explained.You then go to Puspas home and are given a lovely welcome drink while she explains the buildings in their traditional Balinese home compound.Now you proceed to the custom built cooking class area, this kitchen within her her compound. The kitchen space is huge...it's airy, light, breezy and spotless.This is where you get to work with her, learning to make the sauces and pastes that are the building blocks for all Balinese dishes you will prepare. You will assist in cutting, frying and construction of everything you will eat. The meat is fresh and ready to go. There are many options for vegetarian cookers here. She can cater for your needs easilyin the class.The hands on time is extensive but you wont feel overtaxed, you are laughing snd learning and its very easy to pick up the knowledge and participate in the preparation. Paon cooking school is a very hands on experience. You will make a beautiful meal of many varied dishes to enjoy at the end of your time in the kitchen you will enjoy eating a sumptuous feast of what you and your cooking class colleagues prepared. Paon is definitely of the best cooking schools I have ever been to becuase it is so much more than the kitchen. Its the market, rice terraces, the balinese home compound and hands on experiences. You will get to know Puspa as I did. She is in fact a most generous and wonderfully knowledgeable guide to understanding and preparing Authentic Balinese food.I have done this class 3 times over 5 years and I always enjoy my day out with her.5 smiles for Puspa and her Team! \u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a "

From there, we moved to the spacious kitchen with a view at the back of the property where we had a hands on experience cooking several Balinese dishes. The cooking classes were led by the woman of the house and she was a delightfully entertaining person to spend a couple hours learning from. All the staff were very helpful (and impressively efficient), and our meal at the end was delicious. The class had about 20 students, and didn't feel crowded at all and everyone had the opportunity for a hands on experience every step of the way.

Would do it again!! 10/10"

We were expecting a small Balinese kitchen but this was a professional set up, with a well thought out kitchen and preparation and dining area, with a great setting.Puspa and her team had everything spot on - and organised everyone with uber efficiency, humour and very tasty food. You basically prepared, cooked and ate the groups evening meal.Would certainly recommend, and my 'honey bun' (thanks Pupsa) now has no excuses not to get a meal ready. "

Wayan, Puspa and their family welcomed us to their beautiful home in ubud.They were so welcoming and friendly.Started off with a market tour and returned to their home to start the class. Food was absolutely amazing and fresh. Their assistants were so friendly and cleaned all the benches plates and bowls and utensils as we went along. She often mentioned about the risks of Bali belly so she ensured everything was of 1st class standard. The classes were so much fun and the food we cooked tastes awesome.I would highly recommend this to everyone going to Bali.Thank you to wayan and Puspa for making our visit an amazing experience"

Classes are run on the grounds of the home of the owners, in beautiful surroundings. The premises are immaculate and the staff were welcoming and helpful. We were picked up from our hotel in Ubud and started our class with a visit to a beautiful rice field. When we arrived at Paon, we met the owners and whilst we sipped on a delicious welcome drink, she introduced herself and shared some details about herself and her home. This was an interesting way to meet the rest of the class and get everyone chatting. Basically, everyone is involved in the cooking which was a lot fun. The owner and staff are efficient but manage the class with a great deal of humour. We produced a wide range of traditional dishes and then sat down to a wonderful feast. At the end of the evening everyone received a copy of the recipes. We were also encouraged to contact the owner if, when we got home, we could not access all the ingredients, so she could provide alternatives. Once again I had a wonderful evening and definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn how to produce delicious Balinese dishes."

After that we went to the family's rice field and got to know how rice is grown.Then we went to the cooking course (around 20 persons in total). That's a big group, but they oganised it very well, so everyone could try out everything and we cooked in teams.The location is beautiful, in the middle of the rice fields with view over the rainforest. The food was very good quality and delicious. Everything was easy to understand and for 350 000 Rupiah it was a great value! Thanks :-) See you next time."

In the class we made 8 dishes plus a demonstration of dessert- the class size was perfect at 8 and everyone had hands on experience. Best was the teaching of two basic sauces - peanut and curry that can be applied broadly. Would recommend to anyone interested in a Bali Cooking class. (also loved the fact it was in a home and we learned about the traditions of architectural home layout in Bali culture)."

While Puspa has a very organized and structured process, the class is still laid back, easy, and fun. It's the perfect combination.And best of all - you get to eat all of the delicious food, and take home the recipes! I recommend contacting them directly on their website, and making the reservation quite far in advance. It takes some time to hear back from them, and our class was fully booked! At this time (October 2015) we did NOT need to pay ahead of time."

Since the moment they picked me up from my villa, showed us around in Ubud market and got us to taste local fruits to the entire session of the class is a wonderful experience. I do not cook often back home so I was a little worried when I signed up for the cooking class but it was pretty easy and we all followed the instructor step by step so nothing was too hard. The kitchen/their house is very clean and the open kitchen offers a good view when we are making the cuisine.Food was very tasty, couldn't believe we made them ourselves, the ingredients they used seems pretty fresh. They provide recipes for the cuisines of the day, so for someone is enthusiastic about cooking, can follow the recipes and make them back home. Recommend to those who looking to do something different in Bali, I personally will go back again next time I am in Bali"

Staring off with a tour of the local market, our tour lady was super informative and it really felt like an educational tour. She took us through the market the locals use to buy their fruit and vegetables and many more items, explaining the different foods we came across, what they are used for and how they differ from European equivalents. After the tour we headed to our cooking class. Upon arrival we were greeted with a refreshing drink and given an interesting and funny introduction to the place we would be cooking in. The course is family run and the husband was a great entertainer, telling us about Balinese home traditions, family traditions and what each area of the home symbolises. He also made sure to drill home the saying 'happy wife, happy life', which being a newly wed along with another couple at the course, made us laugh :-)The cooking course was introduced by his lovely wife, where apart from being so friendly and inviting, really took us through our ingredients and the different courses we would be making and when each course is typically had in Balinese life. The cooking course itself I would say relied on the teamwork of your group, where together you take different responsibilities of the preparation. This was a great way to meet people and have a good chat as you chopped, grounded and sliced your ingredients. Each step of the course was well instructed and any ingredients that may be harder to find in your home country were given examples of substitutions. Fun and laughter was encouraged and all the courses felt like something you could roughly replicate at home. The surroundings to the location were beautiful and once everything was prepared and cooked, as a group you were able to enjoy your team effort meal.If you are in Bali this cooking class is well worth the book! You will not be disappointed."

Staff was friendly and approachable and both the owner and her husband were very kind and humorous. The cost per person is $350,000 rupiah and you pay at the end of your class. As we lived in kuta and had a driver, we met our guide in front of ubud palace (note they also do pick up at kuta but it's around $400,000 return). At first it was a little confusing as our guide didn't have a sign so we didn't know who we were looking for. But they found us at the end so it was all good. We were taken to the ubud market to show what produce we will be using, which was quite interesting. The market itself is not really the cleanest and is quite busy. So if you're not a fan of 'asian markets' I suggest you take the afternoon class which bypasses the market. Our guide then took us to a beautiful rice field and explained how they grow rice. We were each given a welcome cold drink when arrived at poan's house and her husband gave us a welcome intro - he was very nice and humorous! We were given unlimited tea, coffee and water during the class. They really took great care of us, making sure we weren't thirsty and that we understood everything. The whole cooking process was fun and well structured. I won't reveal too much here other wise I will spoil the fun! They will let you know alternatives to ingredients you might not have in your country. All in all, the food was super delicious and we will definitely recommend people to take this class. We will come back again Poan!"

The setup is very clean, the equipment is in great condition and the ingredients are very fresh. You prep and then cook about 8 different dishes that are later shared family style with members of your cooking class. We each got a takehome recipe list and were told ingredients that you could substitute if they were not available back home.

With a group you get to cook many different dishes and share them all together at the end.You will chop and prep all the ingredients and you will cook them all as well. You get a lesson in Balinese cooking and in their culture.The morning class you go to the Ubud market and learn about the ingredients and spices you will be using. It's a mini tour before you go cook.You can book private classes or be part of a large group. I have to say cooking with a group of strangers, who become your friends, is priceless.Food and cooking really does break down boarders.If you are staying in Ubud, they will come pick you up at your hotel, and return you there once class is done.I highly recommend this class, and if I had time, I would go back again."

First and foremost, the food was delicious, the organization of the class was unbelievable, and it was incredibly clean. But I have to say that the highlight of the class was Puspa. It is worth taking the class just to meet this amazing, hilarious woman and to see her beautiful home. I chose this class because of the reviews it had on Trip Advisor, and I was not disappointed. One of the highlights of my trip to Bali."

We were picked up at our hotel in a comfortable van. When we got to the property, I thought, oh no... is this going to be dodgy. But no, as we got to the kitchen, my fears were alleviated, as a modern and clean kitchen was displayed to us. We had an amazing time. The host and her helpers were so friendly, and knowledgeable. We got in and assisted with the preparation and the cooking. Just perfect. We met a lovely couple from Germany, and we shared dinner with them at our table. The food was excellent. And the bathrooms were modern and clean, a surprise for Indonesia. This is something everyone should experience during their visit to Ubud."

We were more than 20 people and i had the feeling of being in a factory. You get assigned to cutting certain veggies and do not prepare the whole meal for yourself. You get the parts needed ready on a plate and put it in the pan. Then all the pans will again be put in one and the dish finished by them. All in all I did not have the feeling of cooking my own meal."

The host of the class was inviting us to learn something about his culture and family. It gave us such a warm feeling of being welcome. The class and the cooking was perfect structured, everyone was able to help. The female host of the class was clear in her commands and had everything under control, that's why we didn't get the feeling of being not useful. The menu which we cooked had a soup in it. Which I didn't prefer. I have been in Bali several times, I can't count anymore, but soup was never on my plate. It would be interesting to see if the menu differs from year to year. In that case, I would definitely come back."

After cooking everything up, it was then combined in a big pot so we couldn't eat what we personally made nor adjust to our liking. Because of this, we found that most of the dishes were nice but bland and lacked the real spicy Indonesian flavours were hoping to discover. The hosts were nice but it ran more like a production line then an intimate cooking experience in a Balinese home. I wouldn't recommend this to others, look around for something that offers smaller class sizes."

At the start, the host were very charming, introducing us to their home and Balinese culture. What's more, they never fail to make all of us laugh with their jokes. However I felt that the class was rather commercialize with 30+ student at the same time, when it was obvious that the facilities there wasn't able to handle so many people at a go. Although we got to \"cook\" 8 dishes, it didn't really felt like you learn much from it.You start out with preparing the ingredient by going to any available stations (there wasn't even enough stations and they had to create a new one just for me). Each stations prepared different ingredients, you could be grinding or chopping any ingredients. Once everyone is done with preparing the ingredients, you are paired up to start \"cooking\", one person will be in-charge of working on the pan, while the other is in-charge of putting in the ingredients and condiments. Everything was done in a rush, you only get about 3-5mins cooking each dish, simply because even before the food is ready they will rush you to combine everyone dished into one big pan. Where the cook, will continue cooking it. So there is no individual taste to the cooking because everyones cooking get combine and the cook will make further changes to enhance the taste. Hence, because everyone preps a different ingredients and rushed to cook the food. You really have no idea what you are cooking because each dish wasn't made step by step, which i guess was more time efficient for the company. So at the end of a day you get a recipe book, but is clueless about how to go about with it back home.I would have hope that it was a more cosy setting with much fewer participants, considering your not paying a bulk/lower cost for it and a more detailed cooking class."

The 'but' is that there were too many participants in our class - almost 30. This was our third cooking class in different venues over several visits to Ubud. The Paon (=Balinese for kitchen) is well designed for approximately 16 participants but individual experience is limited once that number is exceeded. Instead of following the cooking process through from start to finish all tasks are shared.This means that we did not get to follow the flow of ingredients from start to finish.Some chopped, some sliced. some fried and some of the basic processes such as blanching vegetables or extracting coconut milk/cream were bypassed completely. When it came to desserts there was no 'hands on' whatsover - it was simply done in front of us all.The menu was most definitely traditional Balinese and the eventual eating of the meal was delicious but we had no idea of who had had what input into any of the courses.Unfortunately, the class I would highly recommend is closed for 'renovations' at the moment. It had far fewer participants, the instruction was much more personal and we all got to eat the exact meals that we had prepared. For a slightly cheaper price.If you are more interested in cooking than in being entertained, I would very much recommend that you search around for less popular classes. You will more likely get the full experience of Balinese cooking."

The class started at 830. We were staying in Sanur so we did not do the free car pickup in Ubud area. We met at Ubud Palace. We saw the cars luckily otherwise I'm not sure we would have know where to meet since we didn't see anyone with signs. We spent probably 30-45 minutes learning about the different items at the market. We tried different fruits and bought some spices since they were cheap and we knew we weren't getting ripped off. After the market visit you head out to some rice terraces and learn about how to harvest rice and a bit about Bali culture. Our class had 24 people (which at first I was like oh this isn't going to be very personal) but everyone rotated different jobs and got to have their hand in everything. We learned how to make 8 different items then had a big feast. Make sure you have rupiah or dollars (60 dollars so not a great exchange rate) since there is not a credit card machine since it is at a home. After you finish (about 2) they will drop you off back at your hotel or somewhere in Ubud."

There was a nice flow to the class and I was very impressed how organized it was. The only critique I have is that we were the last group to be dropped off by our drive so we had a welcome drink and coffee shoved at us and we were expected to drink them within a few minutes before the class started. I would have liked to have 15 minutes to enjoy the drinks and take a few pictures of the facilities."

Puspa was so accommodating to confirmed my booking thru phone though I'm not really sure if they will really come to my hotel in Ubud to pick me up for that class since it's just verbal. To my surprised they did and on time!! When i met Puspa in the school she was even worried if I'm ok as i arrived to my hotel in Bali at 1am and my pick up time was 8:30am! { yah I just want to spend much of my time during my short vacation }It's one of my bucket list to learn the Balinese dishes and Puspa and Wayan did a great job in explaining everything to us! It was so organized from Pick up to going to the market, the cooking class itself and drop to our hotel. The best part of it was we even cooked it by ourselves and it's sooo yummy!! :) it was a truly great experience!!! Thank you Puspa's team!! You really cook from the heart!!"

We enjoyed Puspa's cooking class during our staying in Ubud and we loved it.The day started in the early morning, when we have been picked up from our hotel and brought to the food market where the guide showed us most of the ingredients that we would have used lately during the class.Afterwards we have been introduce to Puspas's house by her funny husband who explained us the fundamentals of a Balinese family.Then we moved to the open.air kitchen where we had all the ingredients to be used to cook; the group has been divided in smaller ones, each with a different task.At the end we enjoyed a pleasant lunch and we were provided with different receipts to bring back home."

Took the afternoon class with my cousin, which took about 4 hours from start to finish.Price is good for what you get: pick up and drop off at hotel, quick visit of rice fields, cooking class and dinner.The place was neat and with high hygiene standard; we only used fresh ingredients and nothing ready made.Our hosts were friendly and welcoming, we got a number of drinks on the house (juices, tea, coffee, water and beer), as well.It's not the traditional cooking class where everyone has an individual station facing the main chef. It was a collective effort under the direction of our host, and - quite frankly - given the context it is well worth the money (just 16\u00a3). You get to taste as you go, eat everything you cook, which was delicious and filling, plus the social environment gives you a chance to make friends with the other participants.We made soup, 2 salads, 2 mains, 2 sauces and dessert. Everyone then gets the recipes on paperback.Overall an enjoyable experience."

We were greeted by Puspa who gave us a very refreshing drink and then we were taken upstairs to our private kitchen for the afternoon/evening! They also do a group class but I would really recommend booking in for the private class. It was so relaxed and we got to do everything! Puspa left to run the class downstairs and we started prep with our teacher Wayan (not the owner Wayan- who we also met later on) Wayan was a great teacher who guided us through all of the preparation and cooking processes. We made so much food - satay, yellow curry, mushroom soup, steamed tuna, long bean salad and much more. They also catered for me as I do not eat meat and allowed my husband to make chicken satay/chicken curry and for me to make tofu satay/curry. The pace of the lesson was perfect and we were able to use traditional equipment, which was really well explained to us. We then sat down to eat it all and Puspa came in to see how it was going and gave us a beer. We were then left to eat and enjoy all of our creations. Before leaving we were given all of the recipes and I cannot wait to try these out and have friends over. Definitely a highlight of our honeymoon! Thank you Wayan, Puspa & Wayan!"

Our tour guide took us to the door of the house where we were greeted with a delicious lemon drink and taken upstairs to the cooking area. The views from the dining room were amazing and we enjoyed looking out of the windows whilst waiting for the other group to arrive. Before the cooking class started they gave us the recipes and asked if anybody was allergic to any of the ingredients. I am mildly allergic to peanuts and there were no issues with that. I was always informed about what I could and couldn't eat and where other people in the class had allergies to ingredients that only played a minor role in the recipes they removed them altogether for us.The kitchen, despite there being many dishes worked on at one time, was always very organised and there was always something for our 8 and 13 year olds to be doing too. The food was all delicious and I would strongly recommend this class to anyone coming near to it."

Real nice to get information about all the food and we could ask all our question about all the goods, vegetables and food we did not know. Then to the cooking school. At first we thought there were many people, but they aranged that our group of 7 could cook and eat at one side and the other group at the other side. And the other group was very nice too, so we had a great time. We learned to cook different dishes and of course the yellow sauce. It tasted great! Puspa also gives all the recepies and you can always mail here if you have any question later when you are at home. Also Puspa was real nice on another question. We saw in bali all those oil candles in water. She had them as well. When ewe asked here where we could buy them, she got us some. And when she found out she didn t have the wicks she had them delivered to our hotel the next day. Wonderful Puspa. Many thanks and you made Balinese cooking much more accesible. I definitly am going to try this at home."

In the kitchen she tells you the menu and shows the ingredients. Everyone gets busy grinding, chopping and slicing all of that. After making and eating a clear mushroom soup, all the other dishes are cooked in pairs at the stations. Everything is very hygienic and clean, the hostess really does not want any of her guests to be left with a Bali Belly after class which is great. The food is delicious and you get the recipes in a little folder. I would have liked to make everything myself from scratch, but with 7 dishes and a group of 18 people that's probably undoable. But if that's what you expect in a cooking class, then you know this is not the one for you. If you have good basic knowledge of cooking it will be no problem to recreate the dishes in your own kitchen."

Most likely I will never be able to collect the money I spent on this."

The previous reviews detail what happens on the day so I will just summarise and say the class was easy to access (hotel pick up/drop off), the staff (especially Puspa and the young guy who did our market tour) were very friendly, the instruction was very clear, we were all kept busy despite being a big group (about 20), there were good facilities (clean, free drink on arrival, free bottle water) and finally the food was amazing. The class is very good value for money at less than \u00a320 each for a 5.5 hours experience and a 8 course meal."

We were not disappointed. We were picked up at our hotel by the smilling Wayan who drove us to Ubud market for a morning tour with other participants. We were then driven through the countryside surrounding Ubud to the village in which the cooking school is located, in a family compound. Puspa was their to greet us with her wonderful sense of humour and we all got stuck in to a very hands on lesson in several typically Balinese dishes. We also took turns at giving it a go with the traditional motars and pestals. We were lucky to have a very friendly group, and the food was delicious. Very well organised and a memorable experience."

We were first taken to the food market in Ubud and had about a one-hour tour. We tasted some exotic fruits such as snakeskin fruit that we weren't familiar with. The young man who was our guide was great, as were all Balinese people we met. We also saw the temple next to the market. The cooking school is held in the couple's own beautiful family compound. The owners are Puspa and Wayan who were amazing hosts. They both have a great sense of humour and made us feel completely welcome. All the raw ingredients were laid out and everything was very organized and well run. We took turns chopping and mixing and learned to make 7 different dishes. The best part of the day was eating the fantastic food! We were given printouts of the recipes to take home. Even if you're not a cook, we highly recommend this class!"

My mother and I took part in the afternoon class on 8th July, and it was a truly enjoyable and enriching experience, more than just a typical cooking class! Before the class started, we were taken to the family's rice paddy field where we learnt more about traditional rice farming and harvesting in Bali. Upon arriving at the cooking class, we were greeted by the lovely and humourous couple Puspa and Wayan, given a welcome drink and a brief introduction about a typical Balinese home. The cooking class itself was extremely well organised and easy to follow, with a number of helpers besides the main teacher Puspa, to guide us along during the cooking. It was also great that Puspa was extremely vigilant about hand hygiene, reminding us to wash our hands before and after preparing food. I also liked that the recipes for the dishes made during the class were compiled neatly into a booklet and given to us at the end, which makes for easy reference in the future. We were able to enjoy the fruits of our labour at the end of the class, and all the balinese dishes made were very tasty and made an extremely satisfying dinner! I would highly recommend Paon Bali Cooking Class to anyone visiting Bali, it is an experience not to be missed!"

Everything was hands-on in terms preparation and cooking of Balinese food but what impressed us greatly was the cleanliness and focus on ensuring food was always covered and plastic gloves were used with food requiring \"fingerwork\". This protects one from the effects of colours and spices but also from transfer of germs - most impressive as was the consideration and flexibility applied for people with allergies. Puspa's explanations were entertaining and clear and provided a great understanding and superb experience. Would recommend the morning class to enjoy the market and different fruits and vegetables offered there. Incredible value for money and highly recommended."

They collect you from your hotel in Ubud and take you to the market (if doing the morning class) this is a great experience as you get to see the produce first hand - spices, vegetables, metre long cinnamon! You have an opportunity to buy stuff to take home, no need to buy for cooking as they have already arranged ingredients for the class. The driver speaks great English which is handy as he takes you round the market. We also stopped at some beautiful paddy fields. Puspa's husband did a lovely intro to the class when we arrived. He's warm, open and welcoming. The class is well set up and facilities fantastic. We learnt to make around 5-6 dishes and are given the recipes to take home.

The rice field visit was a pleasure.We made 8 dishes - all with phenomenonal flavour and quality ingredients. As a couple we had fun. I dont feel I learnt a lot but it was a good half day.We cooked as a group and my constructive feedback would be:- separate classes for children. We paid a decent fee and as 2 full paying adults had to share a cooking station while young children had one to themselves- beginners and intense classes for those with varying skill sets- opportunity to make your own meal in full. I personally was uncomfortable eating food others had prepared - given I watched them lick fingers and pick noseLovely hosts and fun day - not entirely what had hoped for but good nevertheless. "

We were picked up from the hotel in Ubud on time at 8 15 am and taken to central fruit and vegetable market. Over there the ever helpful and smiling Wayan explained all the local produce and it was very informative. We could also buy spices and herbs. Then Wayan took us to the rice fields and gave us a quick talk on rice harvest. Then the best part of the class. Welcomed to Pushpas home with a chilled refreshing lemonade. It is a traditional Balinese home with a family temple and living quarters. The kitchen is open style and quite spacious to accommodate 18 of us. It overlooks the green lush forests. I have to say Pushpa and her team work in total unity and all through out kitchen is very clean and tidy. Special focus on hygiene. We had to keep washing our hands and use gloves while cooking meat and fish. We cooked 7 dishes and Pushpa is a very good teacher. She's got a good sense of humour and makes the class delightful and informative. We learned to makes curry paste using a traditional mortar n pestle and also peanut sauce. Then we took turns and cooked. It was a pleasure eating all the food we had cooked. We met people from all over the world and meal times were really enjoyable. Paon Bali classes are a truly authentic Balinese experience. So START YOUR ENGINES...if you have attended Pushpas class you will know what I mean!!!!"

Puspa and Wayan are the genuine article, warm and welcoming and their English was excellent. They both have a brilliant sense of humour to boot.I was very impressed by the very high standard of cleanliness/ hygiene. The ingredients are organic and so fresh and the resulting dishes so delicious. Everyone gets to cook too, no waiting and watching its a full hands on experience. The food was yummy, the company outstanding. I cannot recommend this class enough. Whatever else you do in Ubud do not miss doing this class."

I would agree with other reviews on how awesome this cooking class is, but it did not wow me the way i expected it to so I am not giving 5 stars. You guys need to know that I'm will be very truthful and not lenient in this review. The morning tour begins in Ubud fruit market where we were mixed with a few other people and guided around the market. The guide lead us and went around explaining about Balinese spices, fruits and vegetables and culture. It was informative and somewhat interesting but if you are not a cooking and foodie enthusiast, you will find this boring. We headed to the rice paddy and literally took a few steps out of the car before listening to the guide for a while and getting back in to the car. It was disappointing. We had no chance to explore the gorgeous paddy field (why you no include this paon??D:) Plus this guy has been doing this talk twice everyday, so expect little enthusiasm and a monotonous classroom-teacher-like talk. Their house was gorgeously traditional and had jaw-dropping infrastructure: Massive resting area, open air kitchen and dining area overlooking rooftop views of very lovely greenery of the hillside. The class was structured, relaxed and enjoyable. Paon, the humorous and cheeky house wife was all smiles throughout and very informative. She did not pressure us one bit like other cooking class instructors I know - she made everything seem easy peasy. All you need to know is how to hold a knife, spoon and fork. Her helpers actually did more work than us. Not to mention, the result was delicious!!! However, I did not like it when she spent the last 15 minutes pushing good reviews into us on Tripadvisor, it kind of spoiled the experience a little bit. Well, at least she got what she wanted. Budget wise, it's one of, if not the cheapest in Bali so it's definitely great value and worth your time. However you sure don't get a intimate experience as it is very popular and therefore not very engaging. But honestly, for me - meeting 20 people from all around the world was part of the fun. Next time, I would try the green cooking class in Sidemen.... If you have also been to Paon's class, do you agree with my review? Let me know if you do and also things you disagree with me !"

It has become very popular though still keeps some of its personal charm, of course Puspa is beautiful, friendly and funny. The experience is excellent and the half day goes really quick. The course is quiet basic and very educational, you tour the rice fields, and learn about their house and they way they live, differences between spices and difference between rice and cooking methods. Might not suit an advanced cook but still a great experience. I would do it again! Great value. They pick you up and drop you of in Ubud at the Palace, but we are always late so meet them in the Ubud market opposite."

The best part of the evening was that we got to cook some part of all our dishes while having extremely interesting conversations with people from all over the world.

I found this cooking class on Trip Advisor and booked it as soon as I landed in the airport at Denpasar, This class starts around 8:15am with a pick up included if you are staying in the surrounding Ubud area. You are then taken to the local market for around an hour and our guide explained what we would be using in the cooking class, showed us herbs and spices, the different vegetables, even showing us where the 'offerings' are made this is a mainly Hindu area. After the market you are taken to the Rice Paddy field in the village and then go to the family home. The husband and wife team are lovely and a put everyone at ease, explaining everything as we go along. We had a refreshing drink before starting the chopping of the vegetables to start our basic sauces etc. I would highly recommend this class, there were around 20 of us in the group and everyone chatted to everyone and groups were mixed around. We ended the afternoon by eating the food we had cooked and even had room for a little desert. The best thing is that the recipe book is included and I cant wait to get back home and try to make the dishes for myself."

We then went by car to this house where we were going to learn how to cook Balinese food and were greeted by Puspa who also has a great sense of humour. The set up is well planned, very clean and very well organised. Busy operation as we must have been around 20 people attending the class. We learned a lot in a fun way, and meet some lovely people as we interact throughout the course of the morning and we ended up having a great lunch, cooked by all and topped up with a few Bintang. We started with a mushroom soup, followed by yellow curry chicken, steam fish in banana leaves, peanut sauce for satays and gadogado, chicken satays, coconut and snake beans salad and finished with stew banana with coconut and palm sugar. A definitive highlight of our time in Ubud and I highly recommend it to anyone that want to learn some basic but tasty Balinese food, in good spirit and with fun!"

Having been to Bali many times, we were looking for a point of difference, a deeper understanding of the culture beyond beaches, bars and Bintang and we were not disappointed. From our initial foray through the Ubud markets with the charming, warm and funny Wayan, to our cooking class in his home high in the rice fields shared by his effervescent wife Puspa, our talented Bali chef, we were enchanted. The day was an assault on the senses, starting with the noise, bustle and controlled commotion of the Ubud markets, the smells of spices, exotic fruits, vegetables, fishes and meats, and the opportunity to sample some unknown varieties. Wayan was gracious to a fault, offering food and cold spring water, at his expense, throughout the morning.Our trip then to the open, fresh air and tranquility of the paddy fields was a welcome contrast as Wayan explained how the village families worked the land. And then it was off to class..What a wonderful, fun, informative morning! We were greeted with a cool lemon, welcome drink, and ushered to pristine-clean toilets to freshen up before we entered the main kitchen which held about 20 new apprentice Bali cooks from all over the world at their own station. Puspa somehow managed to supervise and coordinate us all, chopping, slicing, mixing, blending, stirring and cooking with exact precision disguised with charming humour and patience.For those who are concerned, the hygiene was first class. We were all compelled to wash our hands at various intervals, plastic gloves were provided for handling fresh meat, and there was always a supply of handwash nearby.In the midst of an explosion of smells and flavours and sights, there was never a dull moment, all culminating in a lunch of 8 dishes prepared by ourselves - with Puspa's help So if you want a taste of Bali, in Puspa's own words as she urged us to switch on the gas cooker...'Start your engines'....Book it now!"

She was very knowledgable about all of the dishes and ingredients and she worked hard to make sure everyone got involved in each stage of preparation and cooking.We ended up with an amazing three course lunch, which was tastier than most restaurants we had been to so far on our trip. We loved the recipe book to take home too - a great touch. Highly recommend Paon Bali!"

            "review": "Late pickup, minimal cooking, large groups. I booked two days before my class and they confirmed that they would pick me up between 8:15-8:25. At 8:30, I had my hotel call them and they said they were on their way but didn't arrive until 8:55. When I asked the driver why he was late, he said, \"no problem, no problem.\" We then spent another ten minutes driving around trying to find another girl who they couldn't find so I didn't meet up with the group until 9:15, even though the class was supposed to start at 8:30. The husband (never got his name!) said that his wife would take me to the market after the cooking class to see what I had missed earlier. There was a nod to \"Bali time\" which shouldn't be the case when you're paying this much money for a professional service. The cooking class was quite large - split into two groups for the market part which was a good idea. I've done quite a few cooking classes but didn't feel like I cooked as much here. I mostly just chopped some vegetables and poured things into a pan. We combined all of our plates into one so you really didn't get to \"taste your own dish.\"That said, the food was really amazing. Everything tastes really good and the program is a well-oiled machine. Water, lemonade, tea and coffee are included and they will drop you off anywhere in Ubud after. The setting is really nice. The class ended with the wife saying \"if you are happy, please tell TripAdvisor. If you are not, please be quiet\" which I always think is poor taste. Before leaving, I went to ask the wife why they were so late in the morning. With a smile on her face, she said that the driver was waiting the whole time at a different hotel for me, even though I double-checked my email and I had written the right one. She also said that I didn't miss anything which was not true and not the point. They gave me a 50.000 IDR refund which was appreciated."

We were picked up promptly and efficiently from our hotel in the morning and taken to the local market in Ubud. Our friendly, informative and very good English speaking guide Wayan explained Balinese food and ingredients and we were able to try various fruit that we don't get in Australia. We then drove out to a terraced rice paddy field for photos and an explanation of how rice is grown. Then we went to the family home of Puspa and Wayan where we were made feel very welcome while indulging with a refreshing lemon juice and a Bali coffee while Puspa told us about the family home. Then the best part. The kitchen was very professionally set up with everyone able to participate with the preparation and cooking of the food. We made several delicious courses of food that I can't wait to try at home. The ladies were very friendly and informative and the flavours of the food were delicious. It is very clean and hygienic. We had a really good group and had good conversation and laughs! A thoroughly enjoyable day and very good value for money. When we decided to do this tour it was because we wanted to experience and learn a little of Balinese culture (we felt we could not do this from a hotel) and we were not disappointed."

The day starts with a visit t the market, where Wayang (Puspa's husband) tries to explain something about spices and fruits but he's not that good at saying something interesting. You just spend about one hour there, but the overall experience is quite poor. Then they drive you at a compound, and here is where the show starts: Wayan explains the guests that here is where his family lives, which is totally untrue. That is just not a house, but a sort of restaurant with a great view on a tropical forest. Again, he spends about half an hour trying to tell something interesting about their balinese familiar life, but the explanation is really poor and lot of things are just fake. That is NOT a balinese house, it's just a well organized place where they pretend to live in to make the overall experience feels like authentic. The group was made of about 20 persons, which is a bit too big to enjoy a real cooking class. The whole thing is a real money machine, I would say quite well organized. Nothing really usefull, neither intimate or relaxing. Puspa is a kind of \"robotic\" boss who does not involve you in the cooking process and makes you part just of an assembly line where things as spontaneity, intimacy, improvisation, that are what makes me love cooking, are not at all in place."

I thought my son would be bored, but he thoroughly enjoyed the day cooking each meal and learning techniques on chopping, pounding and rolling. The food was delicious, the venue, a traditional Bali home was welcoming and the family just beautiful.

We also got to see the rice fields and take pictures. At the class itself we were shown how to make beautiful Balinese dishes and the best part of it is you get to eat all the food you made and take recepies home with you!

The guide is really knowledgeable and speaks good English so we learnt heaps and there's lots of opportunity to ask questions. Also time at the markets to buy things if you want too. (Note if you are New Zealander or Australian, we had no problem bringing peanut sauce and vanilla back home so stock up large while you can - its SO cheap in Bali!). You can also try some of the fruits while you are there. Welcome drink was really yummy, we enjoyed while listening to Wayan's welcome to his home and talk more about Balinese culture, it was really interesting and we weren't expecting that and it was a really nice insight, hes funny too! Wonderful hospitality and lovely hosts. After that it was into the kitchen. They are very professional and run to a strict time frame and schedule. It felt a bit over practiced for me, being in Bali I imagined it would be much more relaxed but it was like being in primary school, all lined up and told what to do and when. Great for my husband and the less skill chefs but I was a little bored. There's lots of staff who do all the running around, setting up equipment and stations and do dishes and prep for you. We made 7 dishes that included yellow curry paste which we used in Sate Chicken, Curry, Peanut Sauce and a few other things. We made Gado Gado (my now fav salad ever), tempe stir-fry a round bean salad, fish in banana leafs and a soup. We got to take away all recipes and all throughout we were told ingredients we could use if we could get hold of something in our home countries. It was served as a buffet lunch and was delicious. I'll defiantly be making these meals at home, they were wonderful. Theres lots of sugar in almost every dish so watch out if you are conscious of that, I was slightly alarmed but tried to forget about it being that I was on holiday! For dessert Puspa made a banana dish and we all watched and sampled at the end (more sugar!). Everything is of a high standard and very clean. Its obvious they know what they are doing, have been doing for a long time as its very structured. There were roughly 25 people on the day we were there so great money to be making in Bali. I think it would be worth while for them to have an advance course as well for the more advance cooks or those looking to learn a little more. I really enjoyed it, and my husband who I dragged along enjoyed it even more than me!! There was lots of solo visitors there and everyone was friendly and interacted so don't feel like you can't come alone. Hotel transfers were fantastic, on time and reliable. I found it hard to find finishing times when I was booking so if you are wondering its about 1.30-2pm in the kitchen so don't expect to be back at your hotel until around 2.30pm. Such an honour to be invited into their home and experience such wonderful hospitality."

This involved all of us helping to chop ingredients, crush them into a paste in the Balinese equivalent of a large mortar and pestle and fry elements of our meal in a wok. Puspa was an enthusiastic and informative teacher with a great sense of humour. She made the whole thing fun. After helping to prepare our meal we all sat down together to eat.

Then we start a trip on morning market, which was really interesting to see and taste some local products. After market trip we went to rice field,where we were told how the rice is grown. After the rice field visit, we finally get to Puspa's home, where we were welcomed by her husband, who told us about culture and life on Bali. Then after we split to two groups and go to the kitchen. The class itself is in friendly atmosphere and is really super easy. If you are looking for some sophisticated class, try something else. This class is really a casual overall on cooking on Bali. I have to say I really enjoyed this cooking class."

We met up with Wayan inside Ubud Market, he explained the traditional temples and offerings to the gods and spirits, we sampled local produce and met Puspa who walked us through the market explaining other produce and spices. We then took a brief tour of a local rice field whilst Puspa and Wayan went to prepare our welcome drinks. After a very informative tour of the rice field we were welcomed to Puspa & Wayan home with a delicious lemon drink. After some explanation of the family culture the cooking class began. Puspa, Wayan and their team of staff were amazing, the food was delicious, the instructions and methods were simple producing some amazing food that we all shared. There were approximately 20 people in our class however it was like we were having personal lessons.I thoroughly recommend this as a \"Must Do\" experience in Bali.Puspa & Wayan are very entertaining and extremely warm and welcoming.Thank you so much Puspa, Wayan & Team :-*"

We all got picked up from our hotels, taken to the market in Ubud and given a tour of all the exotic fruits and veges, we also learned alot about the culture. After the tour we were taken to the rice fields where the tour guide gave us insight on how the rice was harvested. We were than taken to Paon's cooking class in her own home. What a welcoming family and full of humour! They were well organised and hygenic and we got to participate in making all the different dishes. Food was delicious, real authentic Balianese dishes. Fun day was had by everyone! Highly recommend if your in Ubud and you have 5 hours to spare :)"

The class/tour starts with a trip to the market where fruits are explained and sampled. Then onto a rice field with a brief educational history. Then you arrive at one of the most gorgeous homes in Ubud. The instructors husband introduces you to the home, explains the property and offered a brief history to home life in Bali. Finally, the cooking. The Chef, Ms. Puspa, is absolutely amazing! Funny, charming, informative. The food she thought us to make was phenomenal. I really cannot rave enough. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Do NOT miss the opportunity to do this when you are in Bali. Seriously, if I had not left the following day I would have done it a second time!"

We started early at the Ubud markets, where you are guided through the various sections (flowers, meat, spices, vegetables and fruit). En-route to Laplapan village, we stopped to have a brief talk about padi fields and their history, which was an interesting little interlude. When we arrived in Laplapan, we were introduced to \u201cAunty Puspa\u201d, who was our teacher for the cooker course and in whose home the course took place. The course was designed to allow you to cook a full lunchtime meal from start to finish and then eat the meal you\u2019d cooked at the end. The whole course was very well organised, easy to follow and created some delicious food. I would certainly recommend it to anyone of any level of cooking ability, as there is something for everyone. It\u2019s also worth mentioning, that vegetarians are well catered for also."

You know it's going to be of a high standard the minute you enter their home, from the beauty, to the streamlining of the whole program, to the love, humour and appreciation they show their guests. Everyone gets to take a recipe booklet and we all cook a large array of authentic dishes under the guidance of the team.

I understand this is probably to reduce time and have good flow however from a participation perceptive, it lacks engagement.A good old fashioned cooking class however if you go thinking it's Master Chef, you'll be disappointed."

We all thoroughly enjoyed our day and the food we cooked was fantastic. Loved that we got all the recipes to take home and Puspa explained what ingredients we could substitute at home so it would still taste just as amazing.Never thought my husband and daughters would want to do a cooking class while on holiday but it was a highlight of our trip and I would recommend to all. This was money VERY well spent and I would definitely go back again. Thanks \"Aunty\" Puspa xx"

Needless to say Tripadvisor unbias reviews were great. Pushpa, Wayan and their crew are honest, generous, open and loving people. They open their hearts, house and food secrets with us. They made us and the other 15 people feel at home, welcomed and genuinely made helped us understand the meaning and work put into each and every Indonesian grain consumed..... A must do class for couples, singles and food loving people. Basically covers everyone. Would recommend to everyone...."

We met Puspa at the markets in Ubud & we taken on tour. We then met at a rice field & given a very informative explanation of rice production & demand. Then to Paon which is located in Puspa & Wayan's home. We were given a welcome drink on arrival, intro meeting then headed to the kitchen where we were offered tea & coffee. Puspa & Wayan are just gorgeous, both friendly, funny & accommodating. Puspa explained the outline for the afternoon & then we got into it. We were all given jobs to do for the preparation of the meal & it was so much fun. As a family of four we thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it and together we all shared and experienced awesome tasting food - the bonus is we now know how to cook it & are very excited to try the recipes at home. We would highly recommend this class to anybody & it is suitable for all ages. Puspa also goes out of her way to check for food allergies & dietry requirements. On another note: the house is immaculate & the toilets very clean! Thank you Puspa & Wayan!"

We were picked up by our driver in Seminyak and driven to the local fresh markets in Ubud! We were greeted by Puspa who showed us around the markets and gave us local fruits to try! We were then driven out to the rice fields in Ubud and taught how the rice is grown and harvested! Then we were driven to Puspa and Wayan's lovely home in ubud where the cooking class was held! The kitchen was very large accomodating for around 20-30 people! We each had many jobs of chopping the ingredients, cooking the sauces in the multiple fry-pans and even preparing all the food for cooking! The food that we all prepared was AMAZING and so tasty! It was so good to learn about the balienese cooking and we were even given the recipes! Nothing was too hard, the complimentary drinks were flowing from the moment we walked in, the hygiene was impecable and Puspa was VERY aware of illness that may be caused by eating baliense food. The toilets were some of the cleanest toilets we have seen in bali, and we have visited over 6 times! Would reccomend this cooking class to ANYONE, even vegetarians, vegans, young and old!"

We have been taking cooking classes in our many recent trips, to Thailand, Italy, etc. We chose Paon Bali based on the great reviews online and the fact that we could choose between am and pm classes. Responses to my emails were quickly answered.The course itself was interesting though I find a little crowded. I think if each station was individual it would be more interesting and personalized, though we probably wouldn't have enough time for all the meals we prepared. Puspa is very kind and dynamic, she handles the class well with her assistants. Their home is fabulous.In resume, we must admit we simply LOVED eating what we cooked!!!"

The class is slightly bigger than some that I have been on before, so the preparation is split into work stations that you rotate around to get a feel for everything. The actual cooking is done in pairs and is led by Puspa, who is a great host and made us feel very welcome in her home. Overall, a fantastic morning that I would recommend to anybody interested in Balinese food."

There were three of us visiting Bali and two of us had a cooking class on our bucket list. We attended the afternoon class held by Puspa, or Aunty Puspa as she referred to herself. We arrived early and met the very entertaining Wayan and had a sneak preview of the area where we would be preparing and cooking the food. Before starting we were taken away to hear about rice cultivation, a fascinating and informative part of the tour. There were 16 in our group, but we were promised that all would have the opportunity to prepare and cook the eight recipes in the booklet we could take away with us. Wow!! the food was fabulous, Puspa and her staff were right there at all times to assist, and we had a table full of delightful dinner companions that had all worked alongside us.Our group of three organised our own driver so we could do our own thing in the morning before starting the class at 4pm, so missing out on the market visit the morning class does was not an issue. It is totally understandable why this class gets rave reviews - it is fun, informative and yummy."

This time we booked the morning market tour which was both colourful and educational - and the food we made was once again full of the rich flavours and aromas we were introduced to last time at the evening class.As visitors to your family home we always feel welcome and catered for - especially as we are vegetarians. Your new kitchen is spacious and cool to work in and as expected, spotlessly clean - hygiene being such an important factor when cooking with novice chefs!I can highly recommend both your morning and evening classes to anybody with an interest in the preparation and flavours of traditional Balinese dishes - where you are actually 'involved' in the preparation yourself rather than a mere onlooker. The recipes you gave us to take home have been tried and tested a number of times since our visit - we even found a traditional Balinese blender!We love the fact that your classes are as much a social event as a cooking experience - and have enjoyed the company of new friends and conversation over the meal on both occasions. We are coming back for another visit soon and hope to bring our fellow travellers along with us to our 3rd cooking class! Transport, educational information at the market and rice fields, cooking 'hands-on' experience, entertainment and a delicious 'all you can eat' meal including delightful conversation with new friends from all around the world - where else can you do this for such a reasonable price? Wonderful!!"

We weren't sure what to expect or how interested the boys would be at cooking, but the warm welcome with smiles, drinks, and a quick introduction to the way all family temples are set up was a great way to reel all of us in! We were captivated by the colors and smells of the fresh produce and the beauty of the kitchen. The food we prepared was far better than we expected and it was nice to have a better understanding of traditional Balinese food. I have already suggested the Paon Bali Cooking class to my friends that are coming to Bali next week. Collectively we agree, this was our favorite family outting so far! We highly recommend it!"

The day is a combination of a culture, comedy and cooking. It is entertaining and fun. The day we went there were almost 20 people. While at first, we thought that may be too many, it turned out to be lots of fun! We met so many interesting people from around the world.

After that they drove us to a rice padi and explained the whole process of making rice and so on. The cooking class itself was held in a beautiful open kitchen with a lot of space. Everything was explained in perfect English and we cooked a lot of different dishes. As I am allergic to fish I was quit worried about the class but they took incredible care of me and everything I cooked was strictly separated from the dishes who had seafood in them. Puspa (the lady who teaches you) is very friendly and incredibly funny and the whole class is incredibly professional but it still feels really personal. It was a great experience and totally worth the money (350.000 rp)! I would recommend it to absolutely everyone! Lena (&konstantin) from Germany."

The woman even tried to get into the drivers car when we were leaving, despite me ignoring her the whole time she began throwing her items at me.

Highly recommend Paon Bali Cooking School, had the best day!Started out at 8am with free pick up from our Ubud hotel, then after collecting a couple others, we headed to the Ubud markets where our guide showed us the local produce - the markets were a bit of a shock to the system, so gratefully we didnt spend a great deal of time there, but we did pick up some great bargains on spices ($2 for a huge bag of saffron, $2 for a large bunch of vanilla pods). we then headed to Laplapan village where we learned about village life and how the locals farm the different varieties of rice. Then we drove to the cooking school where we were welcomed by Wayan & 'Aunty' Pushpa,who are just the most hilarious and adorable couple. Wayan spoke to us further about Balinese family life which was really interesting. THEN .... we started cooking! We had the best group, and had a ball getting to know other people in the class from all over the world. Cooking is communal, we all pitched in and had turns at doing all the steps in the recipe. it almost felt like we were workers in a Balinese kitchen - but in a good way. We cooked, chatted, drank bintang, laughed and ate great food all day!Everyone was catered for - vegetarian, allergies, sugar free etcWe cooked 8 dishes in total, and all were yummy! My faves were the Tempe Me Goreng & the Kolak Biu (the banana dessert). We were all given a booklet of recipes to take home and told to contact Aunty Pushpa via email if we needed any help when making the dishes at home.Fabulous day, great people, yummy food!

Despite some initial confusion that was NOT the fault of the cooking school, but that of the intermediary travel agency, the school graciously accommodated us the next day. In fact, we were initially supposed to do the class in the morning, but ended up doing the evening class, which my wife and I agreed was likely better. We were picked up from our hotel, given a brief show at and tell at a rice paddy and then taken to the school. The facilities were clean and bright and overlooked a beautiful valley, which only added to the ambiance.The class itself was great and delicious all along. The final meal resulted in many great dishes and we only wish we'd had more space to eat more! Finally, we were given the recipes to take home with us and very much look forward to trying them again at home.I don't hesitate to wholeheartedly recommend this as a great Ubud experience.PS - great bathrooms."

She is very extroverted and enjoys her work. She showed us many of the herbs, spices and produce in the market, explaining their uses and answering questions. Then we saw a rice paddy and talked about the importance of rice in the Balinese diet and culture. Then we went to her school and cooked. Puspa was very good at keeping everyone involved in the tasks, and answering questions. She recommended substitute ingredients for some that may be hard to find at home. Most importantly, she and her staff kept the pace going and the discussion entertaining, while teaching us several very good recipes. Each person got a recipe book to take home, and these dishes are easy to reproduce at home."

I can tell you that it exceeded even these high expectations and it was A LOT of fun!Why was this so great? Here are a few reasons...1. Pickup and dropoff transportation was included if you are staying in Ubud. Starts around 9am and ended about 1:30-2pm. I would also recommend this activity for a day trip from Kuta/Seminyak/Legian.2. Refreshing and tasty welcome drinks, with a clean and beautiful outdoor setting for cooking. Lots of cooking stations in the cool shade, and had spectacular view of the jungle valley. The entire class was professionally orchestrated by friendly staff.3. Puspa (the host and main cooking teacher) was extremely charismatic and had a great sense of humor. My fianc\u00e9 and I were \"newly engaged,\" and we secretly enjoyed being called \"honey bunny\" by her :)4. Tours of the market and rice paddy beforehand were informative and lasted just the right amount of time (not too long and not too short). Their English was easy to understand.5. Prep work and cooking was not overly strenuous or intense, yet still was enough that made you feel fully involved (first-hand) in the authentic cooking techniques and ingredients of native Balinese culture. Quick poll at the end of the class, everyone (20-somethings to 60-somethings) participating were all smiles and very proud of the final result. 6. Despite being somewhat of a picky American eater, the food was absolutely delicious! I especially appreciated that they took great care to avoid risk of \"Bali Belly\" by carefully procuring ingredients and lots of hand washing/sanitation. 24 hours later and I still feel great! Those who were vegetarian or allergic to things like nuts were catered to as well.6 out of 5 stars for a great time! It takes a lot to impress me, and I was very pleased with the whole experience. Will be recommending Paon Bali Cooking Class to all of my friends and family. One of the main highlights of our first trip to Bali. Thank you Puspa and the rest of the staff!"

I live in Bali so I have done a couple of cooking classes, when my sister in law said she wanted to do one I came to trip advisor to find one in Ubud so we could spend a day out, after seeing the reviews we booked in and were not disappointed!The day started at the local markets for a quick tour of the products and produce and some tasting of local fruit which is pretty standard at most classes. We then hopped in cars and headed out to some rice paddies which were beautiful and we got to learn more about the bali lifestyle.On arrival at the Villa for the class we were greeted by Wayan with some delicious frozen lemon drinks (need the recipie for these) Wayan and Puspa are so lovely and friendly with a great sense of humour! Being around them just made me smile! The class itself was fantastic! We got to chop, grind, saute, fry and cook our way through the morning and most of the dishes were actually pretty easy to make (if you have all the ingredients).The food - OMG let me tell you it was all delicious! For days after anything I ate was a disappointment. Everything was so full of flavour and simply mouthwatering, I would book in just to have lunch haha.Since coming home I have actually made the hot and sour soup which was just as good as the one we made on the day, if not better (I added more chilli) which is a first for me as I havent attempted anything from the other classes.I will defiantly try to make the fish, satay, dessert and tempe again as they were my favourites! I just need to get the ingredients when I have time!Must do in Ubud! Highly recommended and I will be back!"

Aunty Puspa took such amazing care of me - she had me drinking her DIVINE ginger tea with honey and allowed me to sit down and watch the cooking and participate when I felt ok. She even brought a mattress out for me to lay on if I was feeling too bad!! I eventually started to feel much better, with the tea and wonderful soup our group had made with her guidance. I was able to enjoy all the meals she showed us how to prepare. I cannot get over how hospitable they were to me... I can't reccomend any better place.

Wayan and Puspa are full of personality and make you feel very welcome in their home \u2013 they were even trying to set up my younger cousin with their daughter! I have done many cooking classes back home in Australia and none of them even compare to this one. It was very hands on, with everyone chopping, blending, peeling and everyone getting a chance to use the traditional 'Bali Blender'. We cooked a huge selection of food, and all got to sample it afterwards, with everyone going back for second and third helpings (there was still food left over!) I would happily pay more than USD$35 for this. All in all, it was a fantastic experience, and I won't hesitate to do it again! Thanks so much Wayan and Puspa!"

Always checking for questions, Puspa was happy to explain what local alternatives we could use to substitute ingredients we otherwise can't get.I would highly recommend for anyone with a spare morning/afternoon who wants to learn the basics of Balinese cooking. We all left with a recipe book and full stomachs."

The kitchens are very well thought out to involve everyone in the cooking process from chopping/slicing/blending preparation and through the whole cooking process. The dishes prepared were excellent. The spice level is toned down for those of us that can't handle much but there are chili sauces available for those to spice it up.

Wayan first took us to the traditional Ubud market to learn how it all runs and we got to try some common Balinese fruits.

We all had plenty of opportunities to prepare the dishes we would eventually share for lunch, and it was well organised. My partner is gluten and dairy free and Puspa was very accommodating for it, always remembering her and making a very slight variation of each dish that she couldn't normally eat, which was fantastic. She also wasn't feeling very well on the day, and Puspa went out of her way to make sure she was as comfortable as possible while being able to still participate in small parts. It was a very enjoyable day and we were able to meet some great fellow tourists from around the world which made the experience even better. Highly recommended!"

The standards of preparation and hygiene were very high and the ingredients excellent. The meal we are on the terrace Was the best meal we have eaten on our trip. Thankyou Puspah and helpers for sharing your kitchen with us."

Like other reviews, we found that the experience was thoroughly enjoyable, from learning about Balinese family home traditions to actually cooking and eating their traditional food. It's certainly something we would never get anywhere else!Puspa was very good in terms of teaching the cooking, she was easy to understand and very entertaining. We didn't get confused at any point and forgot that we were actually starving! She made cooking look easy and enjoyable. The most important aspect of this day for me was how well organised it was, it was extremely clean, very systematic and well planned. We cooked eight dishes (and ate them) in space of approx. 1.5 hours. It was an awesome day and will certainly be back!"

Last time I was there in October 2013 with a friend, now I have taken my boyfriend.Both times it was so lovely there! It's an absolute good experience. If you take the class in the morning they also take you to the local market. For the afternoon class they won't, as there is just souvenirs at the market then and no ingredients for the cooking. They also take you to a rice field and explain you about how they grow rice.Puspa and her family and team are very nice and will welcome you with their big hearts. All is very organised and you will be cooking a few of the local dishes, like a chicken curry, mushroom and vegetable soup, gado gado, fried tempe, satay, tuna in a leaf and so on. And not to forget a freaking good dessert :-)All the time you can have water, coffee and an amazing ginger tea for free. After you cooked the dishes you will obviously eat what you have created together with your group and it is absolutely delicious.At the end, you get all tje recipes and they also tell you what you can use to replace some of the ingredients which you might not be able to buy back home.All I can say is that it is an absolutely good experience also for families. Highly recommended and I would definitely go there again anf again and again!They will pick you up at your hotel if you stay around ubud and of course bring you back there afterwards."

Great cooking facilities with many stoves and big benches for large groups (our group was 16 people and it was excellent). The hosts are lovely. We got a good tour of the markets and rice field with the main highlight set in there very comfortable traditional Bali home (with some nice modern alterations). We should not have eaten breakfast because we are quite a lot of food during the class. All very tasty and clean dishes using traditional cooking methods. You leave with a little recipe pamphlet so you don't have to remember everything. Usually I find a lot of places don't do this one simple thing! Over all, we got a little tired of temples and the shops so this was a fantastic way to spend half a day. I would recommend this to anyone.... You will not be disappointed!"

The family that runs this class are beautiful, kind and hospitable people. They go out of their way to ensure you feel comfortable and that the cooking area is immaculately clean and always prepared for the next dish. The class begins with a tour of the markets, which is always interesting for people who haven't experienced the sights, smells, the hustle and bustle of the market. It then proceeds to a rice field where the process of the rice is explained. Then to the class inside this beautiful family's home. You are welcomed with a refreshing beverage, tea and coffee if you wish and a huge smile and friendly introduction to how a balinese house is run. Then to the kitchen to start the course, prep is divided between the members of the class, it's a fun way to start and get involved. Everyone is made to feel comfortable in this friendly environment. Over the course of the class, you go through several different dishes in which the responsibilities are divided between the members. I was (this year) in a class of around 15, and everybody had a good turn at each and every preparation and cooking activity. Some reviews have complained that the tasks were too simple, however, compared to other balinese cooking classes I know that you are not able to take such a hands on approach. First an entree is made and consumed, a delicious hearty clear soup that fills one's stomach just enough to last through the second bout of cooking. For lunch the class prepares 7-8 dishes in traditional balinese style, mortar and pestling your own curry pastes etc. It's one of the best and most traditional lunches I've had in bali. The food is seriously sensational. After lunch everyone is pretty knackered so the hostess prepares dessert in just a few minutes with a demonstration. Everybody receives a cookbook of the recipes learnt in the class, and a very thankful and warm farewell. I highly recommend this class to anyone who would like an introduction into balinese cuisine and the flavours of this incredible culture. 5/5"

From walking through the local food market and a stop by the edge of a rice field, we were then introduced to the lovely Puspa and Wayan. This great couple welcomed us to their traditional family compound and explained a little of how the Balinese live. After a gorgeous refreshing drink we were led to a special outdoor/indoor kitchen where the magic of Balinese cooking was revealed. The day was full of fun and information and it ended with us eating the delicious meal we had prepared. The flavours are absolutely amazing and I think, with the recipes which we were given, I'm sure I can reproduce the 8 or so various dishes at home.Thank you so so much Puspa and Wayan and the whole Paon Bali team for a truly Balinese experience which I will always remember.

She made sure that everyone got involved with each stage of the cooking and she made everyone feel welcome at her family compound. The seven dishes we made tasted amazing! They were also surprisingly easy to make. As Puspa explained each of the ingredients she suggested substitutes for some of the more exotic Indonesian ingredients so that everyone would be able to make the dishes easily at home. After we all enjoyed the meal we cooked together, Puspa generously insisted that we take home the remaining food to enjoy the next day (which we did, immensely).My friend and I are going to recreate the meal we made at the class for friends in Melbourne this weekend, we enjoyed it so much.

This is a family owned and operated cooking experience, and you really get a feeling of companionship from all of the instructors/hosts. The food was fantastic, and I learned a great deal from the instructors. I'd never really used a mortar and pestle for food preparation (typically opting for food processors when called for in a recipe). While it certainly provides a workout, I do think it helps marry the flavors better. I certainly won't shy away from it in the future.I also had the good fortune of meeting some really friendly people to cook with. The owners were very friendly, and they essentially required mingling of the guests/students, by moving us from one preparation station to another. This provided a natural opportunity to converse and get to know the other in attendance. It allowed for rich conversation during the dinner.Finally, the setting was gorgeous. I don't have the words to properly describe the beauty. So, just trust that you will enjoy the setting."

Our hosts took us into the local markets and showed us the daily shopping that is the life in the country side and we tried lots of local fruits. The rice field info was interesting and made me realise how important rice is to the people who live in these areas.The cooking was the focal of the day and there was nothing that can be critisised except I could have stayed for the evening meal. The photos of the food are exact and if you had smell a vision it would make you want to fly there today. Fantastic people,host and location for a fantastic day away from the bustle and rush of Kuta.

If you are not familiar with Balinese dishes I would suggest you book this for early in your trip as not only do you cook everything but you also get to taste everything so it is a great way of finding out what you like and don't like for the rest of your holiday.We were collected from our accommodation and taken to join a group of about 10 at the market in Ubud first. We were taken around the market and shown all the vegetables, fruit, herbs and spices that are used. We were then taken to the rice paddies by car and the way rice is grown was explained to us, its always very scenic for photos.We were then taken by car to Puspa's home where the classes take place. Puspa has a beautiful home with a huge open air kitchen and dining area at the back looking over the valley. The views are gorgeous. We were given fresh juice drinks firstly and shown the family temples. We then went through to the kitchen and were given aprons and tea and coffee and shown where the fridge was which is stocked with water bottles you can help yourself to. There were about twenty of us on the course and we all got involved in preparing the vegetables, fruit, fish, herbs and spices that were to be used in the 7 courses which we were to cook. It was very well organised and clean. There are banks of gas burners and you work across from your partner, one stirring and cooking, the other adding the ingredients. Everything is then transferred to large bowls and everyone sits down to eat together.It was great fun and really good value, about \u00a318, and from pickup to drop off was about 6 hours. You also come away with all the recipes for the dishes you have made to try out at home. We would highly recommend doing this."

We were taken around the food market in Ubud to start with (picked up from our hotel), where we were told about the types of fruit, veg, herbs and spices that are used in many Balinese dishes. We were then taken briefly to the rice fields before heading on to their lovely home to carry out the class. There were around 25-30 people in the class and we all assisted in the preparation and helped with cooking certain parts of the meal. I think for the money we paid it was extremely good value as we feel we learnt a lot and we also got to eat the meal afterwards, and it's some of the best food we ate whilst we were in Bali. They also give you the receipes for all the courses that we assisted in preparing. All this set in an amazing location with a beautiful view.

This is a half day experience that starts from a morning trip to Ubud market to explain on the ingredients/spices used.I accidentally cut my finger with the knife and immediately they tended to me without me even sounding the slightest 'ouch'. Tell me that is being pampered or what? The food prepared was also not too spicy and would suit everyone's taste for sure.

We then drove to the village of our host via quick stop at a rice field where we were given the opportunity to learn about generations of Balinese rice families rice harvesting and farming. At arrival we received a complimentary refreshing iced lime tea. The husband of our host, Wayan, amused us with anecdotes of his family & home. Free bottled water was available throughout the class along with fresh ginger and lemon tea with honey and Bali coffee.The class is led by the lovely and very enthusiastic Puspa who is engaging and amusing as she teaches us about the Balinese style of cooking. The lesson was well supported by friendly staff so you get to do enough of the fun part of cooking & none of the boring stuff despite actively engaging in the preparation and cooking of the food enabling a delightful and educational experience we all enjoyed. You get to eat a course between cooking - yummy soup. Then 4 dishes that you have created collectively which left us all with full stomachs and happy hearts. My teenage daughters, husband & myself all think the classes was our favourite thing to do in Bali & the food amazingly surprisingly delicious. We shared our class with a couple who we really enjoyed meeting and 5 \u00fcber cool Uni students a mixed bag handled well by the vivascious PuspaThank you Puspa & WayanThank you for returning my sports water bottle to me after I accidently left it at your school. Very kind & thoughtful which reflects your honesty & kindness."

As the cooking school was near to the paddy fields, we also get to learn about the different types of rice grains. The kitchen was clean. The teacher and also the owner was humorous. We had good laughs and a lot of fun while learning to cook the 7 course lunch. Overall, we enjoyed the class and the delicious food we cooked."

If you go in the morning they will take you to the Market for buying the ingredients, what I understand, will make it even better experience.

We did the morning class, which included a market tour and explanation of the system used in Bali in the rice paddies. Both of these were great, and the class itself is exceptional. You get involved in all the process of preparation and cooking, and you are given copies of all the recipes to take away. 10/10 would recommend to anyone, not just \"foodies\"."

We had the opportunity to prepare a 7-course lunch under supervision and some help. For our session, there's a total of ~25 people, which is a bit too many and of course lacks some personal touch. But the hosts tried all they can to make our experience a good one. Do not expect coming back knowing how to cook Indonesian food on your own. This is more a culture experience not a real class per se. In my view, a must do in Ubud."

The day started with a pickup from our accommodation in Ubud and taken to the traditional market for a tour and description of various fruits, vegetables, spices and utensils, then we drove into the hills to see and learn about rice paddies before arriving at Puspa and Wayans lovely home. I work for a cooking school in Far North Queensland, Australia where the maximum number of places is 8 per class so on arrival I was a bit concerned to find 19 students, however Puspa has planned everything so well and is so professional that the day went really smoothly and we all learnt how to do every dish. I particularly liked the tempe and chicken curry with yellow sauce, and enjoyed learning how to make the sate lilit - there is certainly a knack to twisting them around the skewers. We had an excellent day and highly recommend it. In fact some other friends did the class 2 days after us and loved it too. I took some great ideas away with me for our new kitchen and look forward to enjoying some delicious balinese food."

Puspa primarily does the teaching for the cooking portion while other members of her family will provide you with a tour of the markets and rice paddy fields. Throughout the program, you feel welcomed as a member of their family. You learn how traditional ingredients are procured from the early morning markets and you also will visit the rice paddy fields where you get an explaination of how that business is managed and handed down through the generations. I found the content of the program to be very interesting and well organized.After visiting the markets and rice fields, you are greeted by Puspa herself in their traditional Balinese compound. You learn about the way of life in this traditional setting. All of this builds up your understanding and interest in the preparation of food, which is the heart of this program. The food we prepared was delicious and flavorful.Puspa is a great teacher with a wonderful personality and a good sense of humor. You will instantly feel like a member of the family. The teaching format is well done. You start with learning all the ingredients necessary for the dishes you'll prepare. During preparation, you have the opportunity to participate in all aspects of the cooking. You won't use any kitchen power tools, but instead you'll use the traditional grinders and mixing will be done by hand.Finally, all guests will sit at a communal table and eat the meal that you've all prepared. This was the most rewarding part of the program and the food we made was delicious! Swapping stories with other travelers and having great conversations while eating the amazing food that you've prepared together is sure to leave you with a lasting memory. The dining area overlooks a valley and has a gorgeous view.All in all, I felt it was money well-spent. I had a great experience. Thanks Puspa!"

It was great to have a look where the rice from and learn a little bit about rice farming in Ubud. We arrived at Wayan and his beautiful wife's house to a welcome drink which was delicious. Then we went in to the kitchen and began the cooking lesson. I can not compliment Wayan and his family and the staff enough for how welcome they made us feel. They treated us just like family and made us feel at home. It was great to learn how to make traditional Balinese dishes and then take a recipe book home with us at the end of the day. Overall a fantastic day filled with lots of laughter and yummy food. Would highly recommend to everyone to go and visit Wayan and his family at Paon Bali Cooking classes."

There was 20 in our group and we all helped prepare the food, and then cook it and sat down together to eat. My daughter is quite fussy with food, but after this class, and seeing the different ingredients that went into the dishes she was far more adventurous in trying things for the rest of our holiday.

You get a detour in the rice fields, with our driver explaining how rice is planted in Bali. Then you are brought to the main cooking \"school\" which is really a family compound where you will meet Auntie Puspa. After a couple of welcome drinks (lime drink and lemongrass tea) and an introduction to Balinese culture (I will never forget the placenta in the yard and the Balinese MBA!) we were brought to the open area kitchen in the back of the property.The dishes we learned were: Gado-Gado (Blanched vegetables with peanut sauce), Green Been Salad (Urab), Chicken Curry, Chicken Satay, Sour Mushroom and Vegetable Soup, Tempe, plus Sweetened Bananas with coconut sauce for dessert.The students all had to do some light prep work, mainly chopping/slicing vegetables \u2014 the men assigned to initially work on the \u201cBali Blender\u201d, but we all rotated so everyone got to experience it. The class was well coordinated and gave easy instructions! You get to enjoy the fruits of your labor, such delicious meal! We were dropped off at our hotel afterwards! MUST DO IN BALI if you are a foodie and like to fiddle your way in the kitchen! Tip: The dishes used in the course are wonderful. Ask Auntie Puspa if you are interested in buying a few ceramic items to bring back home (She will tell you where you can buy them without having to lose a limb or donate a kidney - LOL). Bali is known for its beautiful ceramics but priced ridiculously high for foreigners. I didn\u2019t go to the famous \u201cJ\u201d ceramic dealer - I went to where she recommended. I bought a gorgeous teapot with matching 4 cups/saucers for a reasonable price. Hand carried all the way back to California by a cranky but willing hubby \u2014 what a trooper, haha!

He took us to Ubud local market to introduce Balinese vegetable and fruit, then he took us to the rice filed to told us the process to grow rice in Bali. The real cooking class start around 10:30am...OMG, Pupsma is so funny and nice. She asked anyone have any food allergy before the class, so I got special prepared food for my lunch as I got allergy to prawn. It was the most fun and enjoyable experience in Bali, we really like it. The food is pretty local and nice. Will highly recommend if you go to Ubud. Must do it."

We thoroughly enjoyed our day at the Paon Bali Cooking class even though none of us are passionate about cooking and food. Four of our family went - two of us in our fifties and our two young adults (18 and 20). Apart from the actual cooking instruction and the meal in Wayan and Puspa's beautiful traditional Balinese home and garden there were many other highlights for us. The people. Wayan is one of the most charming people I have ever met - he had everyone 'eating out of the palm of his hand' within a very short space of time. We really liked Puspa - she's a great organiser - and Nyoman (who also works as a driver and drove us north later on our trip) who took us to the market in the morning. Extra insights. Going to the market, learning about the food there, visiting Wayan's family rice field, learning about rice growing and the family rice paddy succession issues, learning about traditional Balinese extended family life - this was all so informative and interesting. And to top it all, we felt really honoured to have shared a little of Wayan and Puspa's home life - this enriched the whole cooking school experience - much better for us than if it had been somewhere more commercial."

Puspa really makes you feel like a family member all the ingredients are there waiting fir you, there were 26 of us this day, the chopping, slicing, pounding of all the spices etc are shown to you and then its your turn, Puspa explains everything so well that when it is your turn to follow she has made it easy. You are helped every step of the way by Puspa and her helpers and when all cooked we wer asked to sit banquet style and enjoy the fruits of our labor, a wonderful day, if you haven't already done this its a must on your next trip to this wonderful island."

It is extremely well organised so that everyone in a group is able to learn the techniques and participate in cooking an extensive range of dishes which you then enjoy. You also have the opportunity to take a trip to the market and drive through the rice paddies to a small village where Puspa and Wayang welcome you to their home and tell you about their lives and Balinese culture. This is the 2nd time I have been to one of their classes. When I visited 3 or 4 years ago it was a tiny operation with Puspa and Wayan doing all the tour and cooking. It was the highlight of my holiday. Now the groups are larger and they have a small team of drivers and cooking staff to assist, but have managed to expand their house to create a lovely large open air kitchen with multiple burners to ensure everyone's participation and created a comfortable lunch area with a view of rice paddies. Everything was spotless and they catered for people with different dietary needs, creating alternative versions of dishes to ensure the safety and tastes of everyone. A memorable experience that will stay with you long after you leave (with recipes to try at home)."

After the market, we had a talk about the cultivation of rice, and many more bits of information about Balinese culture, while overlooking a gorgeous rice paddy. We were welcomed into a spacious and artful traditional home where our hosts conducted the cooking course with a iced lime \"welcome drink\" to sip while we were educated on the importance of community and good communication in a Balinese village. The cooking class was well orchestrated, clean and entertaining from beginning to end. We prepared 8 dishes and a dessert.

Authentic food and you get to enjoy the process as much as the taste!"

Was looking for a good cooking class as an introduction to Indonesian cooking whilst in Bali for 6 days and stumbled across Paon Bali Cooking Class on TripAdvisor and sounded pretty good from other reviews I'd spotted. Well... after attending on Tuesday afternoon I can officially say that this was one of best (if not THE best) cooking class that I have ever had the luxury to be part of. Puspa & her husband Wayan were so friendly and made us feel very welcome as a guest in their home. The cooking class was above & beyond anything that we could have asked for. Firstly, We were taken to the local market in Ubud in which we got a very detailed tour from Wayan about all the different produce that you can get which is locally grown and the more general (imported) varieties also. Tasting things like Snake fruit (nom nom) and watching whilst rouge chickens run around randomly between stalls. After this, Wayan then drove us to his families rice paddies and explained to us the importance of rice produce in the region, the history and production process from seed to harvesting the rice once ready (very interesting).(And all this before the cooking class even begins!! Amazing)Finally, once we arrive at the lovely home we are greeted by Puspa who has a very happy and big smile on her face giving us a warm (and hilarious) welcome to her home and cooking class. With a delicious lime drink as a welcome treat - yum yum!The cooking class itself is exceptional with clear instructions, guidance and an amazing array of ingredients to use. We all get assigned tasks to do and take it in turns to use the large 'Bali Processor'. With around 7/8 difference dishes to make the class goes by very quickly but is a good pace and keeps you on your toes. Such good fun! And the food at the end is probably the best I have ever tasted. We also met some lovely people on the course with us from Oz and by the end of the evening we were all chatting like long lost friends over a Bintang or 2. This was on of the best experiences that I had whilst I stayed in Ubud and if I ever return I would be very happy to attend this class again. Highly recommend!!Thanks again Puspa & Wayan - we had a lovely time!!"

On Day 6 I had the absolute pleasure of joining the morning class (there is also an afternoon class) at Wayan and Puspa's 'Paon Bali Cooking Class'. One of the drivers from Paon, a lovely young man called Jack I believe, came to my hotel to pick me up and take me to the Ubud Market, where the other class participants congregated and we met Jack our host. We spent a fair bit of time exploring the market and trying some of the many exotic fruits and sweets. Jack explained many things that were being sold at the market stalls and frequently updated us on how much longer it would be before we departed for his house, where the cooking class is actually held.Back in the mini van once again, our next stop was one of the rice padis near Jack and Puspa's village of Laplapan. Interesting facts were shared about the various types of rice grown, how it is grown for domestic consumption only (not for int'l export) and how important it is in the Bali diet.Next stop was Wayan and Puspa's compound. We were welcomed with a refreshing drink and introduced to Puspa for the first time. What a lovely couple they make!!! Warm, friendly, outgoing and extremely hospitable. They have a great sense of humour and share their family story with people they have only just met!!! I see another reviewer has mentioned the story about their MBA daughter...as in Made By Accident!!!I just want to assure you that every precaution is taken to ensure hygiene levels throughout the whole process are taken very seriously. So if you are worried about 'Bali Belly', you need have no concerns. You are in the best of hands with Wayan and Puspa.W & P use top notch suppliers for all their fresh food supplies. The Ubud Market is too risky to buy any supplies for the tourists and so no chances are taken.The cookery class was very well organized. Participants are each given tasks to prepare ingredients to be used...so it is very hands on. Aprons and hand towels are provided. Hand washing with soap is done religiously :)Nine separate dishes are prepared by everyone. By the time everything is cooked it is a veritable feast...with little in the way of leftovers.I loved how the Paon drivers took on the task of cooking the Minced Chicken Grilled on bamboo sticks over a charcoal BBQ. As a reward for their efforts, they too were included in the feast.Attentive staff clear plates throughout and chilled Bintang beer is available for a nominal price.By the time we had finished lunch, the staff had washed all the cooking untensils, plates, glasses and cutlery. So no clearing up has to be done!!It was an exciting activity and you learn a new skill...well worth the effort. For a cost of Rp 350,000 per person, it is phenomenal value for money. And you meet some new friends from other places.I would highly recommend you try Paon Bali Cooking Class. Wayan and Puspa put their heart and soul into making it a memorable time."

We were a group of twenty and Puspa and Wayan made us feel so welcome. Honestly they could go on tour they were so funny and so professional - what a team you are! After the market visit and the rice field we arrived at Laplapan and were warmly greeted. I had two tired young children with me from a late night before and in typical Indonesian style Puspa, Wayan and their staff took them under their wing and kept them entertained. They also made sure they were included in the cooking activities which they loved. The cooking instructions were clear and the staff made sure no-one was left standing with nothing to do. We had a young man in our group who had never cooked before and he had a great time. We ate the food that we cooked and it tasted amazing! This was a real highlight on our trip. My husband and I have been travelling to Indonesia for the last couple of decades and Paon was a real stand out for us. I would definitely do this again in Bali and I would DEFINiTELY recommend this to anyone."

We arrived at Ubud, and joined our group - the 8.30am is popular, but worth it. Broken up into smaller groups you get a first hand education in the Ubud market. Ample time to sample, shop and shoot photos, it was a great start to the day. An unexpected surprise was an education in the local rice paddy and how rice is produced and how important a staple it is in the Balinese culture.Puspa kept saying we would become a family in one day, and she wasn't misleading. There was a myriad of travellers from all edges of the globe, sharing a common activity. There was eightteen of us in total; and the cooking was broken up into stations. First we learnt about the items we would cook. Second was the yellow and peanut sauce, staples in the cuisine for seasoning. Course-by-course we got through cooking the menu, and enjoying it - with a cool Bintang. I would not miss out on this experience. I would also take the time to travel to Ubud to do it. I realise there are other cooking classes around but it was awesome! More value for money (seeing as I can be a frugal travellers at times).The host and hostess were funny, and well spoken - it was such a delight that I would do it again, I would show off and take friends to it, just to continue to brag about how awesome it was."

The visit to the rice fields informs about this very staple ingredient - we take for granted just how we get this food item back at home! The tour then arrives back at Wayan and Puspa's beautiful home and explanations follow about the structure of Balinese families and how they live. All of this happens with great hilarity as Wayan and Puspa's personalities shine through. We had such fun and my friend's agree it was the highlight of their week in Bali."

Appetiser made then eat, main course, eat, then fortunately after our hard work Puspa cooks us dessert. Then eat of course...what else?? Also complimentary water, tea and Bali coffee. The rest rooms are very clean, and there is a wonderful outlook over the eating area. If you are looking to do a cooking class, you seriously must choose this one!!

She also does a great job at recommending you alternatives during the class, so you can replicate this at home if you can't find exactly the same ingredients, which I thought was incredibly helpful.You make 8 dishes, including 1 dessert - which is more than plenty of food! The class cooks all the recipes together, then her staff puts plates it all so the food can be eaten buffet style. There ends up being more than enough so you can easily get a 2nd or 3rd helping (so go to the class hungry!) At the end she also gives you typed up copies of all the recipes you make in the class and encourages you to email her if you have any questions when you get home.I would HIGHLY recommend this class to anyone going to Ubud/Bali - it was definitely a highlight of my entire trip!"

Went out to rice paddies for a discussion on the history of rice and then spent the rest of the day at the superb house of Auntie Puspa. The entire day is worth it for this lady alone - she is bloody hysterical and so knowledgeable and friendly and made you so welcome as did all the staff, there was lots of laughs and fun to be had.They asked me to meet them at The Palace as my place was not easily accessible - told it was close to me - it was not - and just so you know - The Palace is not really a Palace, it is not signposted - it is a roof and \"amphitheatre\" in centre of town - got sooooo lost and arrived ten minutes late frantic I would miss it - they were there patiently waiting. The food was outstanding, and the ease of making it and cleanliness used was remarkable. And the best thing, meeting so many people of different nationalities. Most of the people there were in couples and I was a solo students - absolutely no worries at all - they also organised different things for veggos and while no one had allergies she did ask at the beginning so would definitely make alternates for those people - I will never forget Auntie's \"blender\" and will giggle every time I use it :)"

Puspa helped us create a traditional Balinese meal that tasted as good as it looked! She was an engaging & entertaining host! We made soup for entree, the traditional yellow sauce which is a base for many main meals & a number of mains & finished up being shown a simple but delicious dessert. Great value for money!"

The day started with a pickup at our hotel by Made who then took us on a tour of the Ubud markets learning about and tasting local produce. This was very informative and gave us a good insight into the ingredients we would be using in our cooking class. This was followed by a tour of the rice fields and an explanation of the rice farming techniques in Bali. We then went on to the home of Aunty Puspa (the owner) to start our cooking class. We were welcomed by a cold drink and a brief outline of the day. We had a light morning tea and then into the cooking. There was a large group of people who were all involved in the preparation and cooking of our beautiful 3 course lunch but all of the steps were explained very well and was very hands on. Even our 16 year old son really enjoyed this class and I am hopeful now he might cook a meal or two for the family. I cannot recommend this class enough to anybody that would like an insight into the food and culture of Bali. Great food, great staff and met some lovely people on the day! Also thanks to Nyoman for transporting us back to Legian and passing on further insights into the Balinese culture and lifestyle."

The chef explained all the ingredients and the menu really clearly. Everyone had the opportunity to prepare a part of each dish and it was lots of fun seeing a group of people standing at their own chopping board busy working to prepare an amazing meal. After all the prep was done, we each had a cooking station (in pairs) and we cooked a bit of each dish, which we then combined. When all the cooking was done, we all sat at the dining tables and watched the sunset, as the staff put all the food out on the serving table.The 7 different dishes we made were delicious and there was plenty for us to go back for seconds. I highly recommend this cooking class, as it is very well run and lots of fun."

I get to travel to Europe with artists and when I travel I love to take a cooking class and how to cook at least one and if I am lucky two local dishes when I get back home. Max the owner of the Villa we were staying at (Infinity Villa) recommended Paon Bali Cooking Class and we booked it. We were collected at our villa promptly at 8:30 and driven to Ibud for a guided tour of the Market. We were told about the many offerings that are made daily and how they are created, the spices and local fruits used in the cooking, the type of knives that are used daily, meat and fish counters. Then we were driven to the village and shows the different stages of harvesting the rice and why here are so many geese or were they ducks in the rice fields .... Next time to get to the home of Puspa and her husband Wayan... it was lovely. we were greeted with Ginger & Lemon grass lemon drink, the layout of the home was explained to us, and what is the structure in a typical Balinese household... Both Puspa and Wayan have great sense of homour and so our day in their kitchen began. We were escorted into the open kitchen/dining area. the fresh ingredients were all laid out on the counter (all covered) each ingredient was explained and how we would use it. The class was large and each one of us got a task... chopping, mashing, blending and frying. I got to do a bit of every step ... I loved it and my husband whom has never cooked a meal in his life really enjoyed himself... Maybe I will get that romantic meal after all. The food was delicious, the attendees at the class were wonderful and from all over the world. the whole experience was fantastic and I as I said earlier I do attend quite a few cooking classes but this was one of the best organized kitchen/cooking experiences that I have had in a long time. I would return to Paon Bali cooking class again if I ever get back to Ubud. So much fun."

Large group of people (20) so we learnt nothing and it felt like being in a industrial process with small tasks to do and not cooking. It is a well oiled mechanism that works smoothly. From a cooking perspective it was not at all worth the money, but from other reviews I guess that it must be different when there are less people.That said, it was a great opportunity to meet other lovely people during the class and the owners are great guys. They are very entertaining and we learnt a lot about Balinese home arrangements and family, daily life in Bali, etc.So all in all, disappointed for the cooking but we had a GREAT time."

We chopped, stirred, and sauteed 7 different delicious meals, which were enjoyed on their terrace overlooking the beautiful green backdrop. The hotel pickup and dropoff was much appreciated as well.

The morning was well paced, involved everyone, had plenty of variety and was interspersed with fun activities such as using the large mortar and pestle.

Definitely go for the morning class, as you get a more holistic insight into the culture, with a local market visit, trip to the rice paddies and then time in the kitchen. The hosts, Paspa and Wayan are full of personality and help to make the day special. The groups can be large, there were 20 people in ours, but they handle this really well, taking turns at cooking or assisting. In fact, I felt it was a benefit as when playing 'assistant', you get to chat with the other assistants, rather than focusing on the cooking (and not letting things burn!)."

We then arrived at Puspa's house and were welcomed with a lemon ice drink and Puspa and her husband gave us a tour of their wonderful home. The cooking then began and we all had a different job to do, chopping, grinding etc. The group was a nice size and a great way to interact with others and get to know people from all over the world. We cooked nine dishes including the famous yellow sauce which appears in most balinese dishes and a delicious desert. We split into two groups and sat to eat our feast whilst enjoying the lush jungle view behind us. At the end we were also given all the recipes for todays dishes. Overall this was an amazing experience and since I have arrived home I have stayed in touch with Puspa for more recipes! I will be cooking my own balinese feast this weekend so my family and friends can enjoy the same experience. Thanks Puspa, Wayan and all the staff at Peon Bali!

You get a ton for your money, a full day from 830 am to 2 pm filled with market visits, rice field, and wonderful food. The staff is friendly, facilities are very clean, everyone is knowledgable and there ate very good English skills from all the staff. Perfect experience. So authentic."

We made about 8 dishes and all were very tasty. The hosts are great and it was good to see inside a traditional Balinese house. We've even used the recipes since we've been home, after finding a local Asian supermarket. Would highly recommend it."

It was a really fun night, the atmosphere of the family was fun and lighthearted. All of the food was really tasty. Like other reviewers, I agree in that this was not really a cooking class as it was more of a socialization. There were 12 of us in total and therefore were never sure what we were chopping was for what dish and how the dishes were actually made. Many flavors and sauces were repeated in many dishes. We were treated like fresh students that came with no cooking skills. Despite all of this we had an extremely fun night. Tip: I recommend not booking through a travel agent as we paid an extra $10USD each (pamphlet said $35USD with free pickup in Ubud and we paid $45USD each)."

How different they were.1) the class sizero was 25!! My last class was 10. 2) As a result, we had to be in pairs to do the cooking. My last school, we all had our own cooking station. 3) The first part of the cooking class is simply chopping ingredients. Not actually learning anything.4) we got photo copies of recipes. My last school gave us an actual cookbook, which won't get ruined in my bag as I travel. I know the cooking class a business, but this class was not very personable."

She is smart, well spoken, and yet she can not avoid to leave the \"students\" with the uncomfortable feeling of having learned too little. Recipes are done quickly and just partially, as they are substantially completed by the hyper efficient team that surrounds Paon. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the time I spent there, especially because it was my first encounter with the Balinese food. Everything was new for me. Full of great smells and interesting notions around rice and its harvesting techniques. But from a cooking class I expect to learn how to cook one or two recipes, go in depth, see every angle and detail of what I am doing so to get it right and repeat it once back home. Paon instead provides you with a generous amount of recipes, around 8, all to be done in 1h. Despite the ingredients are quite repetitive, I left confused about what I cooked and sure that I could not repeat the performance if alone at home."

Our hosts were welcoming, knowledgable and helpful and the cooking itself was a really fun experience. Everything flows smoothly and the way one dish transitioned to another was so quick it seemed like magic. If you turned around to look at something, when you turned back the table would be full of clean pots and pans and new ingredients to cook. The attention to cleanliness and food health and safety was outstanding and receiving a book of recipes to take home was a really nice touch. The food itself was great and the balance between socialising and cooking was perfect. If you're someone who fancies themself as the next master chef, this class may not be for you as we did not really go into huge detail about specific techniques or flavour combinations etc. However, if you're someone who wants to learn about Balinese life whilst learning the basics of making delicious food with a bunch of great people, I would definitely recommend this class."

When we arrived at their home we were told about the 4 buildings that a Balinese home has and taught a bit about the Balinese lifestyle.We were talked through the ingredients and then we tried various jobs including chopping, grinding, frying etc using Balinese methods. Veggies and allergies were catered for with various options and Pusba who delivered the cooking was very funny and accommodating. The balance between cooking, chatting with others and eating was perfect and we even got given the recipes to try at home - with alternatives for Balinese ingredients we probably won't find in the UK. Thanks Wayan and Pusba, all our family and friends are waiting for Balinese food when we get home at the end of August!"

I did not learn about flavours / spices / what combination works well / how the food should taste and so on. About 10 of us worked on the same dish, we combined all our food into one big pot, so there was no chance to taste what you had personally made. The final result tasted good, but compared to other classes I have attended in Asia, this was really a dummied down cooking class.I really felt that this was a factory style cooking course - get 20 or more people in - make them smile - take their money and beg them to leave good reviews on trip advisor.

Arrangements were made for us to be picked up from our villa and driven to Ubud. We were met by Made who took us on a meandering walk through the markets where he described the meaning behind the offering baskets and all the various fruit, vegetables and spices. It was a wonderful assault on the senses!After a stop at the family's rice plantation and an explanation of rice farming, we proceeded to the home of Wayan and Puspa who welcomed us like long lost family members. They host the Paon Bali Cooking School from their home compound. Having the layout of the traditional home explained was really fascinating!This was my second visit to Paon - I first came here three years ago. For this trip we wanted to do a cooking class and none on TripAdvisor could compare to the great memories I'd had of Paon. Thrilled to say that it was as fabulous as I remembered! Wayan and Puspa have almost finished doing some building renovations which I understand will be a new outdoor kitchen area and dining space that will beautifully compliment the cultural charm and take advantage of the stunning views. We were shown the beautiful fresh ingredients we would be cooking with and had our menu explained to us. We were provided with an apron and assigned a task of chopping, slicing, grinding and pounding. Then we were led to the kitchen and our own individual cooking area where we cooked one amazing dish after another. This was quite possibly the best meal we had in our entire holiday and we cooked it ourselves!Wayan and (Aunty) Puspa are an absolute delight. It is impossible not to fall in love with them. The setup they have is clean, professional and chock full of Balinese friendliness and charm. This cooking class should be at the top of your list of things to do!- Carolyn, Mark, Shane & Rhonda xx"

Then it was off to the kitchen with Puspar where we chopped and prepared all of the ingredients before cooking a delicious meal. Dietary requirements are catered for and you make quite a spread \u2013 you definitely won\u2019t go away hungry. All in all, this is more than a cookery course as you get an insight into Balinese life in a home environment (albeit, a more industrial kitchen but you would expect that). We took advantage of their free transfers in the Ubud area. A highly recommended experience."

I wanted to do a cooking class while in Ubud and this surpassed my expectations and was so amazing.The total experience by Wayan and Puspa was outstanding. We were welcomed into their home, entertained( they are both very funny) and shown how to cook the most mouthwatering dishes.The course was very professionally run and I had a ball. I was on my own and made to feel very welcome.We had an incredible bunch of wonderful people on the course as well and I had many interesting conversations throughout the time I was there. I didn't want to leave. Thank you so much Wayan and Puspa and you should be NUMBER ONE in the ratings."

There are a variety of takes to complete, unlimited tea and it all takes place with a beautiful backdrop. Perfect activity for an evening in Ubud."

Followed by a tour of the couples home and explanations of a typical Balinese family compound setup- very interesting. We then joined our group of travelers from all over the world! Our chef, Puspa has a huge smile and fun loving attitude! She made cooking so much fun!We are vegetarians and they made sure the entire course that our food was correct. There were also food allergies within the group that she easily accommodated. The class is held outdoors in their backyard open to all the beautiful vegetation and surrounding area. We prepared so many dishes I lost track but one thing is for sure- they were all DELICIOUS!! We were absolutely stuffed by the end but of course wanted to keep eating as it was so good! I would recommend this for singles, couples, families, friends- anyone who wants to have fun and eat authentic Balinese food that you can take credit for making!!"

My wife and I did the afternoon cooking class with Puspa and Wayan while one our honeymoon in Bali, and both agree that this was one of the absolute highlights of the trip. Though the market tour is only for the morning, our trip started (after a pickup at our hotel) with an overview of the rice growing process at a local field, conducted all in English by Wayan (who is full of charm, great humor, and kindness - all of which put us completely at ease and set the tone for a great night!). We then traveled back with the full group to the (beautiful) family home, for a welcome drink and overview of the evening and a bit of description of family life in Bali (plus an assurance, jokingly yet true, that we would not get 'Bali Belly' from this cooking class!).There were ~15 of us in the class, and throughout the course of the night we cooked a full buffet dinner. Puspa and team were very helpful throughout the night with the right level of teaching versus allowing us to do things on our own, and we felt like we picked up a solid beginners level understanding of Balinese cooking. We also were provided with all the recipes for the night to recreate for our friends! Throughout the cooking and dinner we enjoyed the opportunity to mingle with other internationals By the end of the night we were stuffed and happy. The price was 350K IDR per person, plus round trip transportation of about 350K. This truly was a fantastic way to spend the afternoon, and we'd recommend this to any couple or friends traveling through Bali."

We met wonderful people from all over the world in the class so that was a treat in itself! Gede navigated us through the market and we learned about the local fruit and spices. Then we headed up to Paon's village and stopped at a beautiful rice paddies to learn some basics about the cultivation process of rice. Next stop Pupsa and Wayan's home. The minute we arrived we were greeted with such graciousness it was impressive. Fresh juice was served and a little introduction to Balinese life by Wayan. We then were asked to wash our hands and all given aprons and towels. The cooking class was beyond my expectations. Amazingly well organized, very efficient, super clean and hygenic. We wore plastic gloves and also were asked to wash our hands alot. That was a good sign for me. The chopping, dicing, Bali blender, cooking experience was a blast! Pupsa was knowledgeable, very professional and a delight! The food..O.M.G.The best part just being apart of such good energy and meeting lovely people with good karma."

The hospitality was amazing, the food was fresh and probably the best meal we had in Ubud (better than the fanciest restaurants.) It is a truly interactive experience. You learn and laugh the whole time.It starts with a tour an explanation of the rice fields (a must when you are surrounded by them and it is a staple of every meal). Not only is the tour informative, but the scenery is breathtaking. Then you go on to your hosts' home where they explain a bit about a Hindu family unit and housing structure--something you would never know about if you just spent your days roaming the Sacred Monkey Forest and Ubud's streets. The couple brings vibrancy, charm, and lots of corny (but appreciated) jokes to the session. Then the cooking begins...explanation of ingredients, what you'll make and you're off to the races making about 9 different typical dishes. The end result is a top-notch meal you won't forget.Puspa says TripAdvisor is her fairy godmother, so take this review to heart and don't miss paying her a visit! Our Ubud vaction would have been incomplete without it.Fee was 350,000 IDR per person (~$30USD) + 15,000 per Bintang (a must!)"

We were greeted with refreshing drinks, shown a traditional Balinese home and then introduced to the ingredients we would be using. Puspa was knowledgeable, welcoming and humorous! She walked us through each step efficiently, allowing enough hands on experience but also making the process move swiftly. This is a must do in Bali! Thank you Puspa for making us family!"

We were met at the hotel by a driver, who turned out to be one of the school helpers. Taken to a paddy field and had the process of growing rice explained .... there is actually a lot to it!Then we went to the School,to be met by the proprietor's husband and then taken to the school area. The ingredients were laid out beautifully and we were off. We were shown how to make all the sauces and then we cooked the 9 dishes . this was very hot work but good fun. We sat down and were served the food that we had cooked. We can thoroughly recommend this school."

Everything was very well organised with everyone able to experience the preparation of the dishes - very hands on experience. The dishes were then eaten by everyone. This was the best food that we had in Indonesia - everything had so much taste. Don't hesitate to do this class - everything was done perfectly and you will love it."

The visit to the market introduced us to spices herbs and fruit which I would never have tasted otherwise and was very informatitive as well as being pretty informal. The banter was well polished and fun. The tour of the rice field was a little brief but again we learnt abut the different types of rice and how it is harvested. The highlight was of course the cookery course and the while thing was delivered professionally and was so well organised. Basically we cooked in a group in pairs and it was very hands-on. The instructions were clear and my only regret was that because of the style of cooking in Indonesia it was over so quickly! That is a positive though as you realise that with a little preparation you can cook a feast in a very short space of time. The food we prepared was amazing - an explosion of flavours and a variety to tempt all but the most conservative of tastes. At the end we were given a \"booklet\" of recipes we had cooked which in itself is a very valuable tool I have cooked several of the dishes now I am back in the UK, having to adapt some slightly due to missing ingredients but the principle elements are there and the recipes really do work! A great morning and delicious food - not to be missed."

This made for an easy, fun afternoon, with a thoroughly enjoyable meal at the end of the day. The only downside was that I came away without the keenest insight into prepping a meal by oneself but an otherwise highly recommended activity for most ages."

The cooking itself was OK, we did all the prep of veg but we didn't really have much handling of meat or anything like that. It was kind of cooking by numbers, we were really spoon fed every step of the way which didn't suit me, but some of the guys who don't cook probably needed that. The food we ate at the end was fantastic, all ingredients were fresh and the bintang out there was cheap. Overall a deserved 5 stars but be warned that the cooking is a bit hands off if you're experienced."

Ubud market that our guide brought us to was big and full of interesting details. Although it is in the middle of a very touristy part of Ubud, many locals go there for their daily shopping. In one single place we saw many kinds of things that a Balinese family will need in its daily living. Our guide was knowledgeable and made all the difference to understanding the things we saw.Home cooking and a harmonious happy family go hand in hand. I thoroughly enjoyed what Puspa's husband shared in his courtyard about family life.We had a great time in Puspa's kitchen. Jobs like cutting, grinding and cooking were split into small and systematic way. My husband (at first a reluctant participant) and daughter (an apprehensive 13-year-old) were absolute beginners in cooking but because the process was so well-planned, they managed to do everything themselves and thoroughly enjoyed the programme. (Thank you Puspa for being especially encouraging to my daughter and giving her enough attention when needed.)Did we learn real food preparation and cooking? Of course! And learning it in an entertaining way was a bonus. Lunch was our best meal in this trip with a group of friendly people from various countries. Amazing experience."

Don't get me wrong: the staff was very friendly, professional and hospitable and the food we cooked was delicious. The setting was quite charming and the ingredients of high quality and fresh. The kitchen equipment was very good as well.However: the visit to the local market was not so local (it was the morning market on the ubud tourist market location), they ENDLESSLY talked about random things not related to cooking before we actually started cooking (it was a bit of a stand up comedian show at one point) and the group was huge(14 people). If you're looking for a fun day activity and don't care much about the cooking itself but just want to be entertained, I highly recommend this course. However, if you really want to learn to cook in a small group and do everything yourself, you may be better off at another course that's a bit more serious and a bit less of a hype / an entertainment show. I've attended better courses for lower prices.Nevertheless I had fun and it's still worth 4 stars in my opinion. Thanks!P.s. if you're going to attend the morning course, make sure you have some breakfast beforehand. I was expecting to eat throughout the course but we ate nearly everything at lunchtime so I was hungry all morning ;)"

The driver's English was great as he explained all the fruits, veggies and spices that we were to be using during the cooking class. Then we went to the rice fields just outside of ubud and were taught about how the rice grows, is harvested and used. After that we we're talk en to Puspa and Wayans home where we were greeted with a welcome drink and a very inspirational story of traditional Balinese life and culture by mr. Wayan (puspa's husband) the couple are very funny and engaging. Next was the cooking class taught by Puspa. Our whole group was able to do and try everything! We made soooo much food and were all given the recipes to take home. I was even able to have a take away box of left overs. The sanitary protocols were top notch! Something very refreshing to see in an Asian country. My husband and I were very impressed and left totally stuffed by the time we left. This day comes highly recommended for all ages!"

We were met with a delicious welcome drink and our host Wayan gave us an introduction to Balinese life. From there we began our course. Dishes were introduced and then task shared amongst participants. It was a friendly, cooperative group and we shared a table with a lovely Dutch couple and a really interesting Mexican guy who had spent the last 6 months travelling in Asia - so we spent most of our non cooking time swapping travel and food stories. The food we cooked was delicious. All complex enough to be interesting (in flavour) but simple enough that, with some planning and effort, could be replicated at home. Content was delivered with humour and an obvious love for sharing Indonesian culture through food. Would absolutely recommend this course for anyone interested in learning about the role of food in Indonesian families - or if you just like to make and eat delicious food. Better than most of the restaurant food we've eaten here."

Puspa and Wayan are both very warm and friendly and speak English very very well - they were able to answer any question anyone asked, including all sorts of questions about substitutions. I went with a friend who is gluten-free and they were able to accommodate her easily by making a small batch of GF versions of all the recipes that contained gluten - and it wasn't even a big deal, as soon as they knew about the GF restriction they knew immediately how to accommodate. We made 8 different dishes and we got to try all of them - everyone ate until they were full and there was still food leftover. I highly recommend this class to anyone visiting Ubud."

We're a group of 9 fellas in our early 20s and it has been the highlight of our holiday in Bali so far. We started with a visit to a paddy rice field and detailed explanation of the cultivation and harvesting of various types of rice. We then continued to the family home where we were greeted with a delicious lime juice drink. The introduction to the various ingredients and explanation of them was very thorough and informative. We were helped through the prep and cooking of 8 different dishes. The food which became our meal was enjoyed in front of stunning views over the nearby forest. Puspas was incredible, funny and very helpful and the meal as a whole was the best meal I've had in a long time. On leaving we were given a booklet with the recipes for all that we cooked and can't wait to get home and put them into practice. Could not recommend this course any more!"

Vegetarians, vegans and those with allergies were meticulously catered for and their experience was not diminished in any way.

The rice paddy visit was worthwhile, as it again gave us a look into the real Bali, and how the people live and work. The cooking class itself was excellent, and as hands on as one can expect from a tourist class like this. Although you dont get to cook the whole meal youself (As this was be way too time consuming) we got to cook enough to understand the ingredients, and cooking culture in this beautiful country. Wayan and Puspa were so welcoming, and also taught us how Balinese families coexist within the one home. It is also a great way to meet people from other countries and hear their experience of Bali. A great, value for money day- highly recommended to all."

Puspa walk with us explaining each dishes that was to be cooked and the traditional method in making certain dishes. I love how the traditional method of preparing food are being preserved in the Balinese kitchen till this day. The kitchen are well kept and the ingredients are so fresh. There were a group of 13 of us and each of us were given a job to do, be it chopping or slicing or frying, no one was left without a task which is good as I would want to be able to hands on rather than watch a demo. The lunch was absolutely delicious! Each dishes gives you a different taste of spices used and it's not too spicy either for those who cannot take spicy food.

The arrangements to pick us up were easy and Wayan (not Puspa's husband) brought his vehicle. One other couple in our vehicle, Pippa and Tama, and we were off. Not, as we thought, straight to the course, but to stop at the side of the road for a lesson on rice and life in a Balinese village by Wayan (Puspa's husband)Then to Paon with a bunch of others and a welcome by Puspa and her girls. More Details of Balinese village life and we begin. Demonstrate and let us do it was the order of the day. It worked, we started our engines, swapped places with our 'honies' and cooked each part of each course. I need say no more than every morsel was delicious and to think we had done it all. Bintang was available for those who wanted it and a full recipe set was provided. Puspa and Wayan could not have been more helpful, entertaining or hospitable. Everyone came away full and enthused.

Their very friendly staff were so well trained and skilled in what they did, everything was run like clock work in a completely Bali time relaxed way. This is well worth every cent and more, we met cool people, helped cook and eat fantastic food, and I feel closer to Bali than I ever did sitting on a beach, eating at a bar or scootering through stacked up traffic.

What can I say, we had such an awesome morning with Aunty Puspa and along with the laughs and meeting some wonderful people, we both learnt how to prepare and cook authentic Balinese.The morning started with a complimentary pick up from our Ubud hotel for a quick tour of the markets, as this is done late in the morning all the locals have been and gone and don't be put off by the meat you see .. Paon use their own local suppliers .. a quick visit to a rice field then it's off to meet Aunty Puspa in her family compound.What a character, we had so many laughs while learning about how a traditional family compound is set up and operates before all getting stuck into learning about the various ingredients and spices (including what replacements can be used if you can't find the ingredients locally) and then each playing an active role in preparing and cooking our meals.This was a fantastic morning, everyone should try and do this while in Bali."

We were picked up at out resort at no extra cost, and they were punctual, arriving 8:15 on the dot. We had a market your which was a bit of a culture shock, but our guide was excellent. We arrived at the house of puspa, our host, and I honestly don't know where the time went. She was an excellent host, friendly, entertaining, knowledgable, and sweet. The cooking class was very hands on, and there were 20-25 people joining in on the activity. Despite the number, not once did I think the group was too large, and everyone received individual attention. We met and got to know some great people, and the atmosphere was friendly. The food at the end was sensational, and I can't wait to go back home and try it myself. When it was time to pay, we realised we didn't have any bali rupees. Not one to be so disorganised, but it was honest miscalculation. We asked Puspa if we could pay in Australian dollars, and all was fine. We left an extra tip because we were genuinely grateful. If you are considering trying this out, just do it! You won't regret it. There is a reason for all the great reviews. Thank you for a great experience."

We were met by beautifully dressed girls serving icy cold lemon juice which we drank while Wayan and Puspa explained things to us. Then it was on with the cooking - and although there were 18 in my group, we all got to do everything. Then we ate the food - heavenly!!! I am vegetarian and was the only one in the group, but Puspa adapted all the recipes for me. We left at the end of the day with our cookbooks.

Me and my girlfriend took the morning class a few days ago.what can I say about it.We started our day with almost an hour wait on the street waiting for somebody to pick us up. Seeing the market was quite interesting and also the rice fields later on.But when we arrived to the house to start our cooking class things started to speed up. We had a brief explanation of the ingridiants and than we started to cook.or so i thought we would. Since there was more than 15 of us we had to take turns making the preparations and than cooking. You were not able to see or try all of the things ,procedure etc.Than we ate what we cooked and the host quickly made the dessert.We were given complimentary drinks that we had to finish in the car because we were told to leave.probablly because of the afternoon class they also have.This class is nothing more than a money making machine. And to mention that we both got sick like an hour later and that really ruined our stay in ubud for the next two days.Please dont be fouled in taking this class because it feals more like playing around the kitchen.Save your money and pick something else."

We cooked eight dishes and they were all fantastic. Loved the tips Puspa provided for alternative ingredients that may not have been available in Australia.

I really liked that they picked up everyone from their location in small groups, so we could tour the market in an intimate setting and get 1:1 time with the guide. Stopping off in the rice patties also was a real treat, it was our first time seeing them close up and also enabled us to tick it off our list so we didn't have to make a separate trip. Puspa and her husband were adorable, and the information they offered about families in Bali is one that stuck with both me and my friend - don't go to bed with problems, talk about them before going to sleep so you wake up worry free. Also, the variety of food we made was a treat! The menu was so varied everyone can find something that they like, they cater for allergies and the free water throughout was so appreciated. Even $15K Bintangs were cheaper than the grocery store!"

She took us on an interesting tour of the food market explains things like the local fruit, veg etc. it was great to learn a little more about the ingredients we would be using (we got to try some delicious fruit too). We then drove to the rice paddies where her husband, Wayan, explained about the rice production. Then we headed to their house for the cooking. Firstly she explained about the Balinese household and it was good to get an understanding of this culture at home. We then had an intro into the cooking - we were going to cook eight courses! We all got involved in the cooking - not just watching someone do this.... There were 13 of us on the course but it didn't feel over crowded and we all had jobs to do and felt part of it. The food was all authentic Balinese and it was satisfying to eat lunch knowing we'd cooked this ourselves! Our hosts were really lovely, explained everything well and spoke great English. It was very clean and hygienic too. They provided free water and a welcome drink as well as tea and coffee. You could also buy beer to have with lunch.

The cooking course itself was in the private home of Wayan and his wife Puspa, the chef. Learned so much about family traditions and \"Balinese family homes\". The cooking course itself was great. 8 different dishes, all easy to replicate at home. Simple, yet delicious. Puspa is great as a teacher and has a lovely bubbling personality. Unlike other cooking courses we all worked together creating the dishes, instead of everyone preparing their own dish and plate. Got insight in the traditional ways of cooking (eg. fire stove, and \"blender\"). Afterwards we enjoyed all the dishes together at lunchtime.

Puspa and Wayan, the couple who run the class are great, funny and warm people. they take you to their family home in a small village called Laplapan just outside of Ubud. But first to the Ubud market and the rice paddy outside their home to explain the ingredients, and Balinese culture. It's really a window into traditional Balinese family cooking more so than just a class about preparing food. The end product is a meal that was probably the very best we had in all of Bali. We were also very impressed with how professional this small family run operation is. Everything ran right on time, and is very well organized. You may not get to participate in every aspect of the meals preparation - there were about 12 in our group - but if you pay attention you'll learn how everything is made and they give a recipe book at the end of class for you to take home. I will say that if you can skip the trip to the market, you should. It smells rank with trash and most of the ingredients you see there are not used in the class. If your interested in the market better to go on your own for a quick walk through. I've traveled around the world and seen many local markets and this was probably the least impressive and worst smelling one I've seen."

We started the tour at 8:30AM with a group of 7 people exploring the open market of Ubud, learning about the different spices and tasting the various fruits used in Balinese cooking. Our guide and owner, Puspa, was charming and entertaining which made the tour even more special. Along the way, my wife purchased some cute beaded purses for her friends ;)We met up with the rest of group at the rice fields in Ubud for a quick lesson on the rice growing process, and retreated to Puspa's villa thereafter where the real fun began. We were greeted with a ice cold refreshment of lime juice, and given a little background on the typical Balinese home. All hands on in the cooking class! We learned to make the traditional peanut sauce used in many Balinese dishes including chicken satay, curry, tempeh, goda goda to name a few. Please do not hesitate to request a dish or item you want to make. I wanted to learn to make sambal matah which is a spicy sauce seen on many Balinese tables. Puspa was kind enough to give me the recipe at the end of the cooking class.The best part of the class was tasting the finished dishes in an awesome setting overlooking the valleys of Ubud! Amazingly delicious! Don't be afraid to ask for a Bintang or two which was offered during the class! Puspa's Paon Bali cooking class is a must try when visiting Bali!"

After reading other reviews on TA, we decided to book the Paon Cooking Class - we have done other classes in Bali, and so happy that we chose to do the Paon. Wayan & Puspa welcomed us into their home - and kept us entertained throughout the morning. We were collected from our hotel and arrived at the Ubud markets, where we shown the ingredients used in the cooking. From here we were taken to the rice paddies, not far from their home and then the fun started! Besides the fact that the cooking you do is simply delicious, the whole experience was fun and informative. We have already returned home and cooked some of the wonderful food that we experienced in your home. I would definitely rate this as a \"must do\" if you are in Ubud. Thank you again to Wayan & Puspa!"

The most valuable part for me was an opportunity to step inside a Balinese house, to hear some stories of their daily life, to see how they grow rice, spices, make coconut oils and try to use the Balinese blender :) not sure how Puspa and Wayan manage to maintain this level of energy and enthusiasm every day, and also give the vibe to you. I was impressed with the number of kitchen supplies and space they have. The pots were constantly changed and cleaned, the ingredients were fresh and prepared to each of us for every dish. Not to mention the hand cloves and all the hand washing.You can do a cooking course in a lot of places in Ubud. I'm happy I chose Paon Bali.

He was very apprehensive as he doesn't love cooking like I do, although he does love the cooking I do, but he enjoyed going through the markets and was awed by the rice fields. Being a vegetarian he was worried about the impact this would have on what he could eat and prepare, but they catered to both him and another person in our group who had nut allergies so well that he was far more comfortable and dare I say, even enjoyed himself?? For me the class was a little basic however I loved the flavours and learning about their ingredients, and actually how similar they are to what I can find and use at home. The food was amazing and the communal dinning experience was really great to meet our fellow travellers. Overall a fantastic day."

We had an early start from Seminyak with a cooking school arranged driver but it was a pleasant drive to Ubud markets where we met the other participants.A lot of thought has gone into planning the day which led to a seamless experience. I was interested in visiting the markets, the explanation of rice cultivation, cool and hot drinks were offered prior to the start of the class. The location is in a family compound on the outskirts of Ubud was simply amazing. The views into the forested valley from the cooking area were impressive. However, not to be out done the Balinese food was the highlight. Our teacher Puspa and her team were able to cater for the range of food issues and diets of our small group. A feat in itself from a person who didn't realize what needed to be catered for. I was impressed with the hygiene protocols and we were forever washing our hands.After cooking the seven dishes, meals were served in two large communal eating areas. For a small extra charge you could buy a Bintang beer to accompany the authentic, Balinese dishes cooked. I would say the food we cooked on the day was better than restaurant quality. Highly recommended for those who prefer a 'hands on' cooking experience rather than just watching. I have participated in many cooking classes within Asia and this ranks up to the top ones."

They took us to a market, showed us how rice is cultivated then took us to their home to tell us about them and about life in a Balinese family. Their home was so lovely.Making the meal was fun and probably the best meal I ate during my trip.Thank you aunty Puspa and Wayan!"

Pupsa and Wayan treated us all as family and were the perfect hosts and teachers. From the moment we were picked up we felt completely welcomed into their world. The market tour was fantastic and very educational, as was the cooking class itself. Our group was a mixture of couples and single travellers but by the end of the day we felt like one big, happy family. The food we made was some of the best I ate in Bali (if I do say so myself!) and I will definitely be making these recipes countless more times. I cannot recommend this class highly enough, it will be the best $35 you ever spend. Thank you Pupsa and Wayan for one of my favourite experiences in Bali."

We were collected from our hotel in Seminyak & driven in a private car to Ubud (about an hour away). We then got a tour of a Balinese food market - that's an eye opening experience! We were then taken to the home of Wayan and Puspa (stopping on the way to learn about the rice fields in their village). Wayan and Puspa were so accommodating and friendly (and funny!), welcoming us into their home. Out the back they have a fantastic outdoor kitchen set up for the cooking class which they run twice a day. In a group of about 16 participants We cooked 8 Balinese dishes and then got to enjoy eating them too, Everything about the entire day ran so smoothly - they were always one step ahead of us so there was never a delay or a hitch. It was fantastic. The best bit was that afterwards we even got a recipe book to take home. Whilst Wayan & Puspa took great precautions to ensure everything was hygienic and safe, unfortunately my partner got very ill afterwards with Bali belly which put him out of action for the next couple days. It could have been even the smallest piece of bacteria on a piece of food - these things happen so easily to foreigners over there. Would still highly recommend the class :)"

It's not just about the cooking, the guide picks you up from your hotel and takes you to the local market where he lets you sample fruits and talks a lot about the culture and food of the Balinese people. Afterwards they take you to a rice padi and explain how the fields are cultivated and how the families of that village have passed down the plantations through the generations.After this you go to the house where the cooking class takes place. This is a beautiful family home, the husband and wife are welcoming, loving and have a great sense of humour! On arrival you are greeted with a lovely ice cold fresh lemon drink whilst the husband (my apologies, I've forgotten his name) talks you through the meanings behind the buildings in each Balinese home and give you an incite into the way of life on a day to day basis.Afterwards you are gifted with a ginger tea or coffee before commencing cooking. This is all hands on, everyone in the class has a job to do and will swap and change. There are many different dishes to learn, but the organisation of this class is fantastic! 'Aunty Puspa'; the lady of the house, is a brilliant teacher and host. The dishes tasted amazing, the table was laid and we all sat down to eat what we had created afterwards.All in all this was so much more than just a cooking class and exceeded my expectations! I think this is a wonderful experience for friends, families or solo! If you get the opportunity go for it!"

We looked at a variety of different options as there were many, but settled on Paon Bali because it was a cooking class held in a traditional Balinese home and had great reviews. We were picked up at our hotel and taken to the market in Ubud to learn about everything that was sold there. Our guides was extremely informative and pleasant. After leaving the market we headed towards Aunty Paon's house with a stop along the rice paddies for an explanation on how rice is grown and harvested. At the house we met Aunty Paon and got an introduction on how a typical Balinese home is laid out and then we got to cooking. I have to say that the course was done wonderfully and it was a several hour affair taking the time to do everything just right. We had a great time with the group of people we were there with and probably ended up cooking the best meal we had while in Bali! What a great time! Would do it again without a doubt.My husband says- YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED, AUNTY PAON IS THE BEST!!! GO NOW, STOP READING THIS AND GO NOW!!!"

Transport was arranged (for a reasonable extra fee) from Seminyak. We enjoyed the tour of the market and the explanation of the rice paddies. Then it was on to business at the cooking school. The school itself is particularly impressive in terms of functionality. The food preparation areas, traditional cooking areas, ablutions and dining areas are all immaculately clean and modern. We had a relatiely large group of 20 in total and although my initial thoughts were that there wouldn't be much practical involvement were soon dismissed. My daughter was delegated as much responsibility as the adults - which was pleasing as she actually had to apply herself to the task. All participants had to blend, chop, cut, mix ingredients culminating in cooking them; and there was plenty to do. The result was a fantastic full lunch of all the food we had prepared with local teas, coffees and a beer. In all, a great day and one that is ideal for children to participate under the guidance of an adult."

We were then taken out to a rice paddy and he told us some very interesting bits and bobs (none of which I can actually remember). Once back in the school, we were greeted by the man of the house, his gorgeous dog and a very delicious lime drink. He told us about traditional Balinese style houses and family values, which was fascinating. Following this, the cooking kicked off. It was an absolute dream of a spread, and as we were only in a small group, it was really hands on. They made a great effort to remember our names and we really felt at home. The lady of the house and her staff were extremely professional yet welcoming and friendly, and also incredibly informative.

Fresh, clean, organised and so welcoming. Even if you are not crazy about cooking, it is worth spending a day with Puspa just to experience the food and to learn more about the Balinese culture. Our best day in Bali!"

Well organized by the team which is headed by the lovely Puspa. It was one of my 40th birthday presents to attend this class with my partner and best friend and it was one of the highlights of the trip! And the lovely gesture to share a birthday cake brought by my partner with the other cooking class members and Puspa's team was 'the icing on the cake'. Very impressed with the food, explanations and lovely hospitality with great sense of humor. Would recommend this activity to everyone visiting Ubud!"

After staying in Bali for about ten days, stuffing ourselves with a variety of dishes up and down, left to right, our taste buds kept going back to the set of meals we made in this cooking class. For me, there was something about the crunchy bits of fried tempeh glazed with the sweet, savory, soy sauce that I could not shake my head off. While the light and mild taste of the chicken curry remained in my brother-in-law's mind. As for my husband, the wholesomeness of the entire meal, the fragrant spices (raw and after they got cooked) just blew his mind. And as I typed this, the mushroom soup we made as an appetizer got me excited just thinking about it again. Mind you all the meals we learned in the class are simple enough to replicate at home (and yes, the class provide you with recipes to take home). But there was something magical in the class (in the place, the people, the air, whatever you wanna feel it) that turns all the simple meals into a memorable taste. Perhaps the charming, wonderful, comical instructors/hosts, Puspa and Wayan that immediately make everyone feels welcomed (and at home)? Could it be the younger Wayan, who went extra miles to pick us, a group of four, and started cracking some jokes a minute after we all got to know each other? Or maybe the fun, informative trip to the local market and the rice paddy field that adds dynamic to our learning process? And yes, we did got some spices at the market where my sister did most of the bargaining while Puspa navigated us throughout the market. How about the icy, lime-lemongrass drink that greeted us, as we arrive at the authentic Balinese home, where the class took place? Well, my friend, you may have to find out for yourself!All I can say is the cooking class was one of the culinary highlights of our family trip to Bali. As a culinary professional in NYC, I am deeply impressed to see how the whole operation is done, from the structure of the class to the professional quality of the food handling (sanitary/hygiene of the space, the freshness of all ingredients-- raw fish had no smell, coconut milk was made from scratch, etc). And on the personal note, growing up in Indonesia, Balinese cooking is almost like a genre that had always been foreign to try but this experience helped me crack the code. Not only I am proud and excited to see such an educational establishment exists but also huge props to Puspa, Wayan and their team for the great work they have done!"

Here we were guided by \"Auntie\" Puspa (Wayan's wife) and learned about Balinese food and all had a go at chopping, slicing and of course Bali Blending. We made a variety of foods, with peoples dietary requirements considered.

We were collected from our Kuta hotel at 7.30am and driven to the Ubud market. There we were met by our guide and teamed up with two other people who were in our class for the day. We were introduced to Balinese fruit, vegetables and spices. There was plenty of opportunity to sample and buy if you wished.Next we were transported to the cooking school, which is also in Ubud. It is set on the side of a picturesque valley at the back of the family home. The kitchen and dining areas are covered but outdoors and there was a pleasant breeze all day.Paon explained each ingredient and technique clearly, gave us a demonstration then set us to work. As the morning progressed we swapped stations so we all had a go at each step. We made soup, salad, gado gado, curry, satay, fish in banana leaves ....etc.Once we had finished cooking, the food was beautifully laid out on a buffet table and we were encouraged to try everything and to go back for seconds and thirds.After the soup and main course were finished, we were taught how to make banana and jack fruit in coconut milk for dessert.Throughout the morning we were given fresh cold water and ginger and lemongrass tea. Coffee was also offered. Bintang beer was available for purchase. One member of our class was vegetarian and she was catered for with every dish.We finished up at about 2.00pm and were returned to Kuta just after 3.00pm.The day cost us $35 Australian dollars each and another $35 for the round trip from Kuta to Ubud.The whole day was well organized, the staff pleasant and helpful and the venue clean and well-maintained. Paon was the perfect host - she cracked jokes, kept us all working and answered our numerous questions without missing a beat. She even offers a follow-up email service to all her clients when they get back home and cook their Balinese banquet on their own.Like I said in my heading, this is the best activity we've ever done in Bali."

We were staying in Seminyak, so they arranged round-trip transportation for my husband and I for an additional 350.000 IDR. The day started at Ubud Market. We had a guided tour, showing us the fresh fruits, vegetables, spices, and temple offerings. After the market, our group was taken to a rice paddy field to learn how rice is grown and cultivated. Although this part was interesting, my husband and I had already been to Ubud Market and had learned about rice cultivation. Had I known that the day started like this, I would have requested to be picked up later and join the class when cooking began.The cooking class is held at the owner's compound. We were welcome with a delicious frozen lemon drink - very refreshing. Wayan went on to explain the specifics of a Balinese house/compound. That was really interesting. I wanted to ask some questions, but we didn't have an opportunity and I didn't want to take away from the group's cooking time.Our class was rather large, but there were plenty of ingredients and time for everyone to cook. We made 8 different dishes and got to keep the recipes for all of them. It was a lot of fun and Auntie Puspa made sure that we were all on the same page. The explanation was very clear and you could tell that they love what they do. Lunch at the end was delicious! I barely had room for dessert.Overall this was a very unique and fun experience for my husband and I. Paon Bali Cooking School was fantastic and we highly recommend it.

Part cooking class, part performance, part cultural education session, \"Aunty Puspa\" and Wayan have run enough of these classes to really know what they're doing. The class cost 350,000 Rupiah per person and we booked online the night before (receiving very quick responses to our questions). We were picked up from our hotel in Ubud at 8:25am and the morning class concluded at 2pm.As a group of six, we began with a market tour. The small group sizes at this stage are excellent because they enable you to move around the market and hear your guide more easily. We were introduced to interesting fruits and vegetables; however when Puspa took over for the 'spices' section it became less informative and more of a sales pitch. It's completely unnecessary to take a cooking class into the clothing section of the market, but fortunately that didn't last long. Next we drove out to Laplapan village and had a brief lesson on the rice paddies, which I really enjoyed. It was fascinating seeing the different stages of rice production and getting to ask questions about the day to day lives of the villagers.After that, we joined a much larger group at Puspa's house. There were about 17 of us in total. Everyone was treated to a refreshing \"welcome drink\" and Wayan spoke to us for about half an hour about Balinese life and traditions. We then moved to the cooking area for our SECOND welcome drink (coffee or ginger tea), while Puspa explained the ingredients and dishes we would be cooking (roughly eight in total). She also showed us how coconut oil is made. Hygiene is a huge priority, with hand-cleaning and sanitising being constantly promoted, and fresh aprons worn by everyone. Then comes the chopping, with everyone chopping all the ingredients at once. There's never any standing around and you get to move stations when you're done.The kitchen is really well-managed, with individual cooking stations and heaps of staff to pass around ingredients and do the cleaning up. Free icy cold drinking water is provided throughout. Vegetarians are carefully catered for and you're able to work in groups with friends to cook each course. The dishes you make include things like a basic yellow sauce, which you end up using in a lot of meals, and a yummy peanut satay. You end up cooking each dish in pairs and then combining your mixture with the group, so you feel like you have a hand in everything and can be confident when trying it at home.The meals you make are mind-bogglingly delicious. Written copies of each recipe are provided in a nice booklet and Puspa always recommends what ingredients you can use at home to replace the more exotic ones that you may not have access to (e.g. jackfruit). This class was a fun, educational and enjoyable way to spend the morning - I was entertained the whole time and feel equipped to make these incredibly tasty meals on my own at home."

We then all jumped in the cars and were taken to the village rice paddy fields near Puspa's home where her husband explained the traditions and processes for growing rice. Back in the cars and down into the village to Puspa's family compound where were warmly welcomed into Puspa and her husband - who offered a great explanation of Balinese family traditions centring around the family compound and village life. We then got into the cooking course and between the group prepared soup, several mains, followed by a simple but delicious banana and jack fruit desert. We were then driven back to the palace where we were picked up but had the option to be dropped off anywhere we chose in Ubud. We all had a wonderful time and this will certainly stand as one of the highlights of our Balinese holiday. Our 15yr old son who came somewhat reluctantly (err a cooking course with your parents - must be boring!) even commented that he had so much more fun than he'd imagined he would. One other thing of particular note was the attention paid to carefully ensuring that nobody risked leaving with bali-belly - always a risk with fresh meat preparation in the humid Bali climate - Puspa regularly asked everyone to wash their hands and we wore gloves for all the \"hands on\" parts of the preparation. If I could give six stars I'd do it - highly recommended!"

Travelling with my partner and both our mums we thought this would be an activity that suited all ages...can't see either of our mothers (us 30s and 40s, mums 60s and late 70s) tearing down a mountain on push bikes, being thrown around a raft white water rafting or hiking up to the top of the volcano in the dark to watch the sunrise....It was great! From the Ubud food market tour at the beginning, to the rice paddy talk with our instructors lovely funny husband to the cooking instruction, to meet people from all over the world (me picking brains for hot travel tips being my first trip to Ubud) culminating in the spectacular feast at the end :)The welcome drink of icy lemonade and ginger tea or coffee was lovely and much needed in the heat - thankyou!The day was well priced ...I think less than US$35 from 8:30am until 2:30pm, lunch and refrershments included (you could purchase an icy cold beer with lunch at a reasonable price).We left with a print out of all the recipes at the end which is great, our friends having seen our photos can't wait for us to get into the kitchen!The day is well paced...everyone is involved and contributes to the cooking...from chopping, to grinding to frying to stirring, to wrapping etc.The hygeine is terrific...handwashing basin is close, antibacterial gel is supplied as are disposable food handling gloves when handling meat.It was great to see/find out how coconut oil/cream is made.I particularly like that there was a small team of helper staff who cleaned all the pots/pans etc whilst we were cooking...there was quite a lot as we learnt 7 dishes!! Imagine all the dishes! Awesome we just had to take them over to the sink :)I now know how to make delicious satay sauce and the \"yellow sauce\" which forms the base of at least 3 of the dishes we prepared (chicken curry and tuna fish steamed in banana leaf) and bonus it lasts 2-3 weeks in the fridge!At the end of all the cooking there was of course the eating...what a feast! Great to meet and talk with fellow travellers from around the globe also. Our host/instructor and her husband (sorry I forgot your names) were professional, funny, and very likable. I would reccommend this to anyone and will be back next visit to Ubud."

As you walk in to Puspa's home, you are immediately greeted with delicious welcome drinks. The instructor, \"Auntie Puspa\" is incredibly charismatic and hilarious. It's great to watch her interaction with her husband. It is evident that cooking is their passion. The class is perfectly paced as helpers go around to all the stations ensuring that you have a job to do. Everything is explained thoroughly and you learn so many Balinese traditions along the way. It was amazing being able to cook and meet new friends in such a great environment. Even though it rained, it was still so beautiful as the mist rose up from the valleys. We were offered cold beer while we enjoyed an appetizer of mushroom soup (that we all put effort into). We then started to work on our main dishes, including chicken satay and yellow curry. Puspa made sure that despite a big group, you still got to work solely with your partner, so this can definitely be a romantic date night if you want it to be. Overall, the class was done so well. The pace was perfect; we learned a ton! The people were amazing and the food to die for. Can't wait to try out the new recipes at home!"

Found out that this was the first cooking school in Ubud so thought we would give it a go (my husband and I traveling with my parents). It was amazing!!! You go into the family home which is both beautiful and imaculatley clean and cook with a group of people. The family picked us up from our hotel and took us to their village and spoke to us about the rice fields and took us for a tour where they were harvesting the rice, was so great to see. Then we went to the home to start the cooking school. Where the whole group cooked the set meals, which included a large variety of both vegetarian and meat dishes. We sat down family style which was nice to chat with some other travelers. It was by far the BEST meal we had in Ubud and in Bali!! This is a MUST do in Ubud! The best part is that you weren't in a hotel kitchen doing the class you cooking it Bali style!! At the end we got a cook book to remember and share the delicious meals!"

When planning my trip to Ubud, I thought a cooking class would be a good way to learn more about Indonesian cuisine especially since I am vegan and wanted a way to navigate a type of food I little exposure to in the U.S. I had heard that Balinese food in particular is very vegetarian and vegan friendly, so I was thrilled to see that this Paon Bali Cooking Class would tailor the class to any dietary restrictions of its students.I was truly \"wowed\" by this food market tour and home cooking class and consider it the best and most memorable activity I experienced in Bali. The husband and wife team are excellent instructors and make everyone feel welcome in their home and kitchen. I was the only vegetarian/vegan in the class and have some food allergies, so I was very impressed by how Puspa tailored the ingredients of every recipe for me so I was never left out. The result was an amazing lunch that our group prepared and a recipe book to take home filled with everything we made in the class.Since returning home, I have made all of the recipes I learned in the class including the mushroom soup, tempeh goreng, steamed tofu in banana leaves, veggie curry and banana in coconut dessert. This was the best investment I made during my trip and love that I can now cook delicious Indonesian food at home for my family and friends."

Auntie Puspa and her husband are hilarious and incredibly genuine hosts. The dishes we made were the best tasting from my trip even though we went to lots of great restaurants. The class is hands on, so you actually get to cook, and Puspa will also show you how they make fresh coconut oil, and use other traditional Balinese utensils to blend and chop ingredients. We made about 8 dishes in 3 hours total. We were about 20 people total and it was fun to meet new folks. The class also includes a trip to the ubud farmers market and a stop at the rice patties for a richer cultural immersion. This was by far one of my favorite activities in Bali. Because we were welcomed into Puspa's home and she and her husband share some of their Balinese values, you come away with a greater appreciation and understanding for this paradise island and wonderful people."

I have never done this before, and have never thought it would be my thing. Our whole group thought that the activity was excellent. We were greeted at and led through Ubud markets, then we went on to the rice terraces for more food instruction and then to Puspa's compound, which is magnificent. We were welcomed with cool drinks and then began the actual cooking. The staff were amazing and dealt with the adults and kids professionally. Puspa herself was a delight. We prepared and cooked our way through an amazing smorgasboard. At the end we were even given copies of the recipes. It was tremendous and the groups responded warmly to the activity."

The food is amazing and you get to take the recipes home. Everyone is smiling and happy all the time, I'd be surprised if anyone had a bad day here."

We were greeted with refreshing lemonade drinks and a cute two month old puppy. Wayan entertained us and told us about his family and their home. He was so kind and genuine, he made us feel extremely welcome. We were then Shown back to the large kitchen as introduced to the star of the show, Auntie Puspa. This woman is amazing. Her hospitality is wonderful. Their garden is in their yard, where they grow many of the ingredients we used; kafir lime leaves, galangal, tamarind and lemongrass..among many many other things. We had a smallish group, consisting of some vegetarians, some who didn't like chili, some omnivores and some pescatarians. Auntie and her staff were so organiZed and prepared for each type of diet. We all had a chance to grind, \"Bali Blend\" and chop to prepare our meal. The result of our efforts was an absolutely incredible meal..I can honestly say that this was the best meal I have had in Bali. It was all homemade, it was neat to see where all of our ingredients were coming from and Auntie's humor and light spirit all added to the experience and the final product. I loved this experience and was lucky to share it with three girlfriends. This would be a wonderful way to spend girls night. Or a great night with your \"honey bunny\" (as auntie says).

Then to Wyans lovely home where his wife (ex girlfriend) took us through the ingredients we would be using and 8 (!) receipes we would be making. Unlike other reviewers, and despite our class of 11, I really feel we all got a chance to do almost everything involved in every recepie, and that I learnt enough to make these dishes at home. We were given the receipes to take home too. The lunch we made was delicious and there was sooooo much food. Really glad I saved room for the dessert though!

There were approximately 30 people in the class but everything was so organised, it went like clock work. I am very critical of how things are organised and the process but this class could not be faulted.Once cooked we sat down to an amazing lunch. My daughters talk of this day being the highlight of our trip. It was definitely a day I will always remember. On our departure we were given a print out of all the dishes we had made, so we can make them at home.Thank you so much Wayan and Puspa. We thank you both and wish you all the happiness in the world. Michelle, Jessica and Stacey. Xxx"

            "review": "Perfectly lovely introduction to Balinese cookery. I'm an anthropologist and ethnographic food blogger, so taking a cooking class while in Bali was a must. This one lived up to expectations . The market tour was great, as it's a space that is harder to wander into as a tourist, as was the trip to the rice fields (though if you're in Ubud, you've done that already, so it was a tad redundant). \"Pushpa Aunty\" was really adept at managing our crew of 12 (I'd not advise taking this class if it's larger than 12 people though), and the morning went like clockwork. I can't say that we really did much cooking -- a little chopping, a little frying, a little rolling and so on. Just a little taste of everything, but nothing too involved or intense. In general, it was a really nice introduction to Balinese cookery from market to processing your own oil to making your own yellow sauce to preparing a pretty elaborate meal. In that sense, it felt complete. The setting was gorgeous, too: in Wayan and Pushpa's home, where the back garden is set up to accommodate the needs of the class, and you get to see the herb garden that provides (presumably) many ingredients for the course. Pushpa Aunty was also kind enough to send me home with a little food for the family (well, she would have, but I had to dash out when others were still finishing dessert), and some galangal and pandang for my own kitchen garden--sweet of her. I did feel like the initial parts of the day, once we'd arrived at the class site, had a bit more talking than necessary--starting at 830am or so, when you get through the market and ricefields and have rested a bit with your (lovely) welcome drink, you really are ready to stop talking/joking and start cooking! But our hosts were gracious, funny, accommodating, and kind, and the class was as much a space to socialize with others as to learn about Balinese cookery. It\u2019s a good intro, especially if one follows up and actually starts to cook the dishes we\u2019re introduced to\u2014something I certainly intend to do."

It starts with the booking process where all my emails were responded short notice and managed to find a place for the next day.I went from semyak to ubud with a pick up 2.30pm/drop off 8pm to the 4pm class. Taxi was 350.000 but worth this short trip to learn about bali food. Our group was not as big as I heard in previous reviews. 11 of us. 1.,we went to the rice fields for a short introdution of the importance of rice in balinese families.- this was a key point as I had no idea...2. we were welcomed at the hosts house - Puspa and Wayan, the best hosts I have found in any activity done. You must understand this is not just a Cooking Class. This is \"an experience\".So yes they talk about themselves, they explain the housing, tradition of Balinese people.It makes you understand it much better than reading or seeing temples and cerimonies.Then, YEs cooking!I think Puspa organized very well the class, introducing you to the spices, food, cooking process. Also she tells you what to do and swap with your partner,so everybody gets to cook. Obviously, this is not a private cooking lesson otherwise it would take ages to come up with the 5 dishes menu ready. It's a team work or \"family work\" as she called us-family.But at the end, I left their house very full,food was great, specially learning to do the sauces- the basic magic of Bali food.Puspa even organized for me to bring home some food for my boyfriend who missed the class.Thank you Puspa and Wayan.Maria xPortugal"

It gave me a broad introduction and understanding of the meats, vegetables and spices used in Balinese cooking, as well as the preparation and cooking techniques.Totally unexpected and appreciated was the additional explanation of a typical Balinese family compound and the significance of the different dwellings and customs. For our cooking efforts over several hours to culminate in a fabulous feast was a perfect end to the experience. Oh yes, and there was even a fridge with beer and soft drinks available (for an additional cost) for those who enjoyed a 'coldie' with their meal. I took photos of all the individual dishes but didn't make a note of their names.Finally we were given easy to understand recipe pages so we could try to make some of the lovely meals when we returned to our home countries.It was a extremely good 'value for money' class, only about $35 AUD for approx 6 hours, including pick up and drop off to our accommodations."

The hosts are both lovely and are very funny which made the trip enjoyable. If your an experienced cook maybe look for a more advanced course as you don't cook your own dish.Only thing I would say that could be better is the afternoon course should be a little cheaper than the morning one because you miss out on the market tour and the rice fields which we would have liked to see but couldn't due to having to leave Ubud."

Our taxi driver was waiting on time. On the drive up to Ubud the drivers face would light up when talking about his 'bosses' Puspa and Wayan. We arrived at the the rice paddy field to be warmly greeted by Wayan who explained about the process of growing rice. We then jumped back into the taxi and headed to Wayan and Puspa's house. On entering the compound and seeing Puspa waiting to greet us I was overcome with emotion. A beautiful genuine smile on someone welcoming me into their home. We were given cool drinks and Wayan explained a lot about his family and life. It was very interesting and entertaining. We commenced cooking and all 5 of us got involved in grinding pastes and chopping vegetables. We made so many dishes and all sat down to an enjoyable feast afterwards. The course itself was very informative and hands on and the food was delicious. But what makes this course so special is the friendliness and entertainment provided by Wayan and Puspa. This isn't a commercial environment but a couple welcoming you into their home as if you were old friends and cooking and sharing a meal together. What a beautiful family.

The course teaches both the traditional methods for cooking as well as more modern short cuts and substitutions. Puspa is an enthusiastic instructor who clearly has a passion for sharing her culture and food. Of the many dishes we made, 3 were outstanding and all were very good. The logistics of the class itself were very well managed allowing participants to do a lot of the cooking without being bogged down with a lot of prep and clean up. Highly recommend this course!!"

We were not disappointed. It was probably one of our highlights of our whole week and for only $35 AU it was completely worth the money and prob one of the best meals I'd eaten in a long time.It was wonderfully set up. We did the afternoon class and were not too bothered about visiting the market in the morning class so it worked well for us. When we arrived we were greeted with a perfect lime slushy drink - just what the dr ordered! In our group there was only 5 of us and to be honest it worked well in that size. I have read previous reviews regarding bigger groups and couldn't think of anything worse than a group bigger than 8 to do this class, anymore would just be not as much fun, and not feel so personal.They took us up to the rice fields which were great to see and explained how rice was made. Then it was back to the house. The lady explained the set up of a Balinese house which was very interesting. It was great being at her house and not in some hotel restaurant doing it. Amazing views of the valley to see while cooking. A big emphasis on hand hygiene was made which was great as no one wants 'bb' (bali belly) as the lady put it!!We were all given little tasks, turns to cook. The food was definitely not a disappointment. Everything was so fresh, even the oil was made right in front of us - coconut oil - the smell was amazing as was all the pastes. So when we sat down to eat our food there was sooooo much. Fill your stomach to your hearts content. The flavours were all there, so fresh. Now for someone who is not keen on tofu I can certainly say this was the best I've had and I would make it again. Time flew by and before we knew it time was gone, the exp was about 4 hours long. We have decided to re-enact our Balinese cooking class as we just loved all the dishes that we ate.The hosts were just lovely and no question was too stupid. Highly recommend this class and will never forget this experience."

They picked us up from our hotel in Ubud and drove us to a neighboring village (Laplapan) where we got to view the rice paddies. The village was a lot more quaint and peaceful than Ubud itself. We got to make 5 or 6 dishes from scratch, and they were all delicious! They were very organized and helped us prep just enough to keep the class moving. I would highly recommend this class to anybody visiting Ubud. Also, the cooking class is in a family compound, with a nice view of the forest. From what I saw the other cooking classes available in Ubud are in the back of a restaurant."

The food was superb, we were made very welcome and i would recommend people to do this class.Plus you get a delicious meal at the end of it ! A must do in Bali."

The experience is not just about the cooking and how to cook in an up market traditional family village kitchen. Its about experience culture, family values, as the family take the client on a journey. The family invite clients (participants) in as special guests for the day. The facilities are very clean and the presentation is professional. The experience commences with a tour of the local produce market. Much care is taken to ensure clients\u2019 needs are met, and it was nice to see tour guide considering participants levels of tolerance in the busy market place. Requesting feedback from the client was done eloquently throughout the experience. From the market our journey continued to a family farm and rice field. We were provided with an overview of the local farm and a short history lesson of the area. Shortly after this we arrive at the family home and village and met with cool refreshing lime drink. The cooking lesson is completed with demonstration and team participation. Elements are broken down and shared. Our journey commenced in the morning from Sanur with a 7.30 am pick arriving back to the hotel early afternoon. The tour was safe well presented and clean.Thanks so much, the experience was great and well worth the effort for the early start. Also good for families with children from 9 +."

Hands on preparation, 8 different dishes, and then we had the pleasure of eating the best food I have ever tasted on my numerous visits to Bali. I did the morning class yesterday, I was picked up from Bali Ginger Suites in Seminyak who recommended this class, what a fantastic recommendation, I have done a cooking class in Thailand which was most enjoyable but this was more comprehensive with a visit to the markets, the rice padi's, and then a warm welcome to our hosts home with a lovely cool refreshing drink, then the actual cooking, the whole thing was very well organised, informative and fun with great insights into life in Bali. I would recommend this class to anyone no matter what their previous cooking experience is. Thank you for a most enjoyable day!"

There was no trip to the market this time (as I have previously done with another company) which was fine, but I believe the morning class includes this trip. Our group was small - 6, but perhaps typical of the afternoon class? Maybe I was lucky, but it was a particularly cohesive group of strangers who were all lovely and we got along well. The meal was delicious and a lot of fun to make. Puspa and Wayan are very entertaining and learning about their life firsthand is so interesting. The cooking notes provided have been used since my return, as I love the flavours of Balinese cooking. The kuah wong - clear mushroom & vegetable soup is a family favourite. A wonderful experience & highly recommended!"

We participated in the morning session. The market tour is really interesting, the rice field stop is a little long, but still nice. I would suggest that a toilet break before or after the market could be offered, especially for those of us not staying in Ubud. It is a long time before you eat, so perhaps a good idea to have a light breakfast before you leave your accommodation.Puspa really knows how to make the group work well together, I really enjoyed the company of the diverse group (including the poster below me). The atmosphere was really positive and heaps of fun.While Bali itself did not delight me or my husband at all (we'll never be back) this course was one of our favourite holiday experiences to date! Puspa, please come to Australia and run some classes! You will get booked out very fast!"

It abit different in that the classes are quite large (about 16 I think) and you all help to make all the dishes to serve communal style, but it means you get to make and try several different dishes with a larger number of participants (maybe 8 or 9 from what I can remember), and they're all delicious. Its a full 3/4 day, not finishing till about 3pm and includes a market tour and rice paddy field tour with Wayan (Puspa's husband), then the cooking class with Auntie Puspa herself. Wayan and Puspa introduce you to their home at the beginning in a funny welcome speech and the tone of the day is set. The custom build cooking school set in their home compound is fabulous, and the staff are great. We were picked up from town, but if you aren't staying in the Ubud area and want to do an authentic cooking class they can arrange for you to be picked-up from other areas, e.g. Kuta, Seminyak (at an extra cost). We loved it, don't miss it!"

            "review": "One of our favorite experiences. I'm sure there isn't much more I can say about this wonderful cooking class that has not already been said. I'll simply highlight some of the important info.-We were picked up at our villa in the morning and taken to the Ubud market for a walking tour. We got to see local ingredients and products as well as learn about important information about Balinese culture (e.g., making their daily offerings).-After the market we were driven to rice paddies to learn about the importance of rice.-We arrived at the cooking class in a traditional Balinese compound where we were greeted with a cold welcome drink. Puspa (our class instructor) then taught us about the different elements of a traditional family compound.-The actual cooking class included the entire group doing the prep work, the mixing, the frying, etc. We made a soup which we ate first, but then all other parts of the meal were eaten later at the same time.-The food is served buffet style, so you can take as much or as little as you'd like.-We were given free tea, coffee, and water, and you could purchase a cheap Bintang if you wanted one.-Puspa and the staff took care of making the dessert for us.-You are given a copy of all of the recipes at the end.I really thought this cooking class was great. You are given easy instructions (e.g., chop the string beans so that they're this long, put one teaspoon of salt in the pan) so that you can't really mess up. Yet you also have enough independence during the class so that you don't feel like you are being monitored. I thought the size of the group (15 people) was also appropriate. We were divided into two groups during the market tour so that we could move around easily, and there was enough space during the cooking class for everyone to have a place to comfortably work. It was enjoyable to meet and talk to the other group members, especially because we all came from different parts of the world. Of course, the best part of it all was the food. My husband and I decided it was our favorite meal that we had in Bali, and we had some pretty amazing food on our trip. We really enjoy the flavors of Indonesia (hope you like lemongrass and ginger!), so this may not be a favorite meal to someone with different tastes. Finally, I really just have to commend the Paon cooking class on the quality of their class. All of the employees we encountered throughout the day were so kind, helpful, and informative. The ingredients were fresh and the recipes were wonderful choices. They had every detail planned out for us and it helped make us feel like we were in good hands. I was so pleased with this experience and I really could not have asked for more, especially for such a reasonable price. I highly recommend this activity and this cooking class in particular if you are venturing to Bali."

If you are contemplating an Indonesian Cooking class in Bali, Paon Bali Cooking Class is an absolute must. A trip to the market to purchase fresh produce and an insight into ingredients used in everyday Indonesian cooking, a visit to a rice field to learn how rice is grown and harvested and then on to Puspa's family compound for the cooking class. This was a very hands on class with plenty of opportunity to chop, grind and cook the most divine recipes. You fwr ro cook approx 8 - 10 recipes and then eat everything you've made. And the added bonus - we got to take the recipes home. Puspa is so passionate about Indonesian cooking and by the end of the class you feel as though you are part of her family."

We have done a few cooking courses through Asia and this would rate as our top experience. Auntie Puspa is a charismatic, fun teacher with a great sense of humour. She runs an extremely slick operation. We did the course with 4 couples in total and this was a great number of people. We learnt to make some fantastic dishes that were easy enough even if you aren't particularly good in the kitchen. The setting for the class is lovely and we thoroughly enjoyed eating the meal we had cooked (6 dishes) in this quaint garden kitchen. At $35 AUD per person this course is not cheap by Asian standards and we have done far cheaper and very good ones in Vietnam and Thailand; but as it was the best one we have done, we didn't feel ripped off."

The kitchen hands were prompt in cleaning stuff and organising pans for us to cook one dish after other. Overall I can recommend this course.

Having a considerable background in professional cooking I got nominated to do the course but thought it would be another boring Asian cooking class- but not to be. From the time we were picked up and taken on a tour of the Ubud markets to the end of the cooking class and sitting down to lunch it was a great experience and I learnt to cook Balinese style and walked away with another notch in the apron. Cooking with fresh ingredients makes so much difference rather than most in powder or dried form. Our class was conducted professionally and our hosts were just great."

From the time we were picked up to the time we were dropped off, we not only learned about Balinese food, but also the life of a Balinese family in the village of Ubud and how they interact with their natural surroundings. The sweet lady Wayan took us for a fabulous tour of the market. Being a Hindu from Malaysia, where our cultures and practices have so many similarities, there was still always that little bit more that we could learn and discover from the market tour itself. Did you know that there is a \u201cgreater galangal\u201d and a \u201clesser galangal\u201d? Well, if you don\u2019t, then this is the thing to do.Next was Wayan and his jokes. Despite the lengthy and amusing jokes, we learnt a lot about padi, beras and nasi and its varieties. Soon, we were introduced to the marvelous lady boss, Puspa, who humored us to no end. We learnt the secrets of Balinese cooking and ate the sumptuous food we all made ourselves. I must say, we also had guests from other countries that all made up a very happy \u201cfamily\u201d for six hours or so. Sure, you can pick up a recipe book at a bookstore or Google the specific recipes for cooking, but none of that can replace our experience here. The experience at this cooking class is one of a kind and a must do in Ubud."

Puspa's husband Wayan gave detailed and humorous explanation of farming rice, as well as the Balinese home and the spiritual and cultural reasons behind the architecture. Puspa also shared in detail the traditional cooking tools and methods. The cooking class did not feel crowded, Puspa ensured that everyone had good view of the demonstration and rotated the tasks. This meant that we all had a go but also time to relax and observe others. Otherwise cooking all 8 dishes yourself would be too much. Puspa and Wayan are a great couple with excellent humour.

We created numerous dishes ranging from the basic yellow spice paste to and tasty yellow chicken curry. Vegetarians are catered for with a number of options available. All the hard work of preparation is done for you so you can concentrate on the finer points of the dish. The pace of the day is relaxed with the starter followed by a bit more cooking, then the main. Throughout the day you have plenty of time to chat with other budding chefs at the table or in the kitchen. You even get to have a bintang beer once the major cooking is organised. The day flew by and the meal was authentic Balinese food of a very high standard. All the ingredients were fresh and of high quality. This family run business takes your enjoyment seriously, but with a humorous twist as Pupsa and her husband (he calls himself her boyfriend) clearly love what they do. I have done cooking courses in a number of countries and this was the best by far. Thank you Pupsa and all your people. 10 out of 10. thanks Rick and Marianne, Australia"

Very traditional cooking methods used,excellent hosts with market visit, lots of cultural information about Balinese family life, food etc.The hands on experience of the cooking class was made fun by our hosts, we got to meet other people of all nationalities. The setting for the class was beautiful, well organised so that everyone in the group was able to prepare and cook ingredients. Once finished the dishes were really lovely and the only authentic Balinese food we have eaten so far. To take away we were given the recipes and the skills to try these dishes for ourselves. Would strongly recommend the day !"

We each enjoyed the day thoroughly. The food was delicious! I was very happy to hear the menu was chicken and tuna for the day as I dont eat red meat. Every dish was fantastic and I have printed out my photos of each dish to put with my recipes to try to replicate one each week. The market visit was so educational even after being to the Ubud markets many times this visit was excellent. The rice fields visit also very interesting. Our driver was lovely too. Wayan gave a wonderfully interesting and funny explanation of the family compound and of course his story of being adopted was very interesting. Puspa was the best part I must say she is adorable and so funny. Calling us all \"hunny bunnies\" and had such great control and organisational skills. We were a large group of people from all countries and she managed us perfectly. We all helped and got along together it was such fun. A nice cold bintang was given to us at one stage and was gratefully received. I cannot fault this class my only suggestion would be to put the recipes into some sort of plastic cover to keep in better condition when bringing them home. I will be back next time with my next travelling companions for sure."

Puspa & Wayan run a very well organised activity that delivers in spades. Sitting out in their lovely home overlooking a verdant valley, eating gorgeous Balinese food that I'd help make (along with 10 others), accompanied by an ice cold Bintang I couldn't help thinking that I'd happily pay to come & eat such lovely food in this beautiful environment even if it was only a restaurant...but this is so much more. Brill tour of Ubud food market led by the charming Ni Wayan who was able to tell us so much about the medicinal & health qualities of the food we were going to prepare & eat. Then a very funny exposition of family & village life from Wayan, the co-owner of PBCC, all wrapped up in a fascinating explanation of rice growing in Bali. After a delicious welcoming cold lime juice Puspa & her great team took over. I really didn't see how we were going to cook 8 dishes & all get a fair go. I reckoned without Puspa's powers of organisation & orchestration - she is amazing! And very funny. It all flew by so too soon we had to say goodbye to each other (Canada, HK, Singapore, London, Bundaberg & Melbourne). My favourites were the Tempe (who would have thought!!) Me Goreng & the Gado Gado, others were going for the Ckicken Coconut Curry, the Snake Bean Salad or Sate. Truth is, it was all delicious. Last word for the totally yum Kolak Biu, Boiled Banana (who knew!) in Palm Sugar Syrup with an excellent cup of Bali Coffee. I did this with my sister who has been to many cooking schools around the world - she says this is up there with the best. Don't miss this great day - two young lads in our group were having a great time so it's good for all."

I've been on a few tours that explain Balinese family life and this is the most informative one yet. Wayan and Puspa deliver it in an engaging and humorous manner. The lovely Puspa then guides you on a well organised and clean cooking class for eight dishes. I must confess to consulting my watch and wondering if we had sufficient time. I was to be pleasantly surprised. Students prepare and cook each dish before handing over to her staff to simmer and plate-up. The students then move onto the next dish or pause to eat the previously cooked meals. Very slick. I assumed that we would cover the usual meals - beef rendang and satay sticks. Again I was to be pleasantly surprised. The eight dishes are an excellent variety that would suit most palates. Students are given the eight recipes at the end. A great experience for all ages."

My husband doesn't like to cook so I went on my own and had an amazing day. The tour of the markets, especially the spice market, was great. Also I learnt things I didn't know about the rice growing in Bali from the rice field visit. When we arrived at the cooking class we were met by Puspa at the doorway to her and Wayan's beautiful family compound. After a brief chat by her regarding traditional Balinese culture & the architecture of their compound, we walked to the back garden where the cooking classes are held. Everything was spotlessly clean and well laid out. There were 16 of us on that day in June (including 2 beautiful children). We all had plenty of 'hands-on' time grinding spices, making satays, and everything necessary to prepare the many dishes.. There was a vegetarian couple amongst us and Puspa, without any fuss, just adjusted their ingredients to suit their needs. We all sat down after the cooking and enjoyed the fabulous food. Anybody with a big appetite will not be left wanting here!!. It was an absolutely fabulous class, full of laughter and great food. Recipes given before you leave. You won't be disappointed if you choose Paon."

We had a market tour in Ubud and a talk at the Rice fields prior to the cooking course at their home. A group of 15 of us were guided through the preparation and cooking of 6 meals , adjusting menus for people with dietary requirements (vegetarian) and food allergies.

I had my reservations about attending a cooking class, but am glad that I finally went ahead with it. The day started with a trip to the local Ubud market where Wayan introduced to us the array of Balinese spices, fruits and foodstuffs on sale. This was followed by a trip to the paddy fields where we were given an informative explanation on the subak system, then the house compound of Wayan and Puspa where we were served ice-cold lime juice as our lovely hosts explained the layout and symbolism of the compound. The mise-en-scene of the class was great -- and while this may seem like an unimportant detail, it truly set an unforgettable backdrop to the class. The entire thing was very Balinese, from the soft gamelan music in the background, Puspa's elegant batik kebaya to the lush jungle backdrop. It felt like a true blue Balinese experience!I was a little downbeat during the start of the class as my camera battery had unexpectedly died on me, but Puspa's infectious optimism cheered me up in no time. Wayan and Puspa were superb hosts and kept things breezy with their jokes and laughter. It was especially delightful to see them jokingly chide one another, which tickled me to no end. Before long, everyone had already warmed up to Puspa as we segued from dish to dish.On the day I visited, we cooked a total of ten dishes (including dessert), all of which I thoroughly enjoyed. The pace was nice and breezy but not slow, and everyone was kept busy throughout the class -- even the kids were involved! We were all, at some point in time, chopping or grinding or stir-frying and no one was left out of the action! The class similarly caters to all, be it novice wannabes or experienced cooks. Despite being a beginner, I found myself being engaged and involved throughout and the procedures were simple enough to follow. The final dishes were superb, too. I'm unsure as to whether the menu changes daily, but I particularly enjoyed the sate lilit and fried tempeh we cooked on that day. It took all the self restraint in me to stop myself from taking a third helping! The dessert -- an uncomplicated dish of bananas and jackfruit cooked in palm sugar -- also left me wanting more, and I thoroughly enjoyed it despite not being a fan of jackfruit. A recipe, thoughtfully compiled together, was provided after the class and I'll be sure to try out the dishes at home!The day ended with a flat camera battery, a full tummy and a satisfied smile. I'll definitely recommend this class to all travellers to Bali, especially those based in Ubud. You simply can't miss it!"

The hosts are extremely friendly, welcoming and funny and it's a great opportunity to meet other travellers and get to know them in a casual setting. I really enjoyed the market tour, particularly as the guide explained how Balinese offerings worked as I had been wondering this since I arrived and saw them all over the streets. The rice fields were beautiful and it was very interesting to hear how the rice is produced to feed huge families all year round. To be honest I was actually dreading the actual cooking part because I know nothing and I mean NOTHING about food, ingredients and cooking. However it turned out I had nothing to worry about because the jobs we were given were very simple and well explained so that even I could handle it. The flip side of this I would imagine is that for an experienced cook or someone who is very interested in learning how to prepare a full Balinese meal, you don't really get that experience. The day is more about a cultural insight and a casual lesson, but this suited me perfectly and was exactly what I wanted. I would have hated to feel under pressure to prepare a meal by myself which others would be eating. Instead, we all contributed to making a number of dishes which we could choose from in a buffet style. The location of the house is beautiful and it was a really really wonderful day, I am very glad I took this class."

Then you will enter in real Balinese house where you will understand role of every buildings and temple in Balinese life. Next you will see, taste, touch every ingredients use to cook. You will work together, Balinese family and other countries students of the cooking class to prepare the best lunch that you will eat in Bali. You will never forget this human experience."

They ask beforehand so they can accomodate those people.We ate about 1PM i think and we got back to our hotel at 2PM.Highly recommend. We were recommending it to other people we met during the rest of our trip."

We have been to six countries and are now in Bali at the end of our trip. Our travel agent planned this cooking class and we didn't know what to expect. We did another cooking class at a restaurant in Vietnam that was lots of fun. Well, Paon was just as awesome! The really cool part (besides the best meal we have had in two and a half months) is that you go to the owner's actual home and get to see a traditional Balinese home before you cook. The owner, Puspa, is so funny and endearing and really makes you feel at home. She is an excellent chef and has great people helping her and ultimately the client cooks. It was just the right amount of hands-on without being too intense. They explained all of the dishes to us very well and the cooking moved very smoothly with the dishes coming together superbly. It was the best meal we have eaten in six countries. Also, there beautiful garden is a great setting to cook and then enjoy. If you are looking for an authentic Balinese experience, this is a great choice!"

Pickup from hotel, market ingredient tour, rice paddy explanation from husband Wayan (very charming), then on to his and wife Puspa's family home. A home tour (explaining the different buildings) then on to the outdoor kitchen where the equally charming Puspa awaits. A morning of chatting, learning, cooking and feasting. The host family want you to feel welcome, as evidenced by the help yourself to drinks (Bingtang costs a little more, but you fix it all up at the end so transactions don't taint the family atmosphere). A lot of fun, all hygienic (gloves and hand sanitizer throughout). And at the end you all sit to eat the delicious meal you've prepared (two starters, a salad, two mains, a dessert). Best tip... Have a small breakfast. At the end, we had to go shopping for a hammock, and the helpful driver dropped us at just such a shop. A memorable experience."

Our arrival at Puspa's home was warm and friendly and refreshing with a welcome drink and an interesting explanation of how the traditional family home/compound layout works in Bali.Our cooking instructions were detailed, simple and clear to follow for a novice like me and if you had more technical questions then our trainer could answer those too.It is a team cooking format so each person is given tasks but you receive all the recipes so you can easily practice at home and the trainer ensures everyone has equal opportunities to cook.It is professionally run, very high standards of hygiene and you leave feeling full of your yummy food and happy about life!Go do it!"

Just be aware that the facilities have been prepared to have up to 20 participants and really, this is way too much. The day I took the class we were 19! Everything take more time and you can not have much contact with the owners mor the other participants. With so many participants, the price should be half of what it is, because it is a complete different dynamic compared to 4 to 6 people classes.I strongly recommend the other one, more time is spend to visit the family compound, more hands on during cooking preparation and much more interaction is possible with the family."

In the market, we learned about local produce, fruit, fish, meats, and spices. Then we were off to the rice fields were we met up with Wayan and learned about the rice fields, how each family removed the jungle to claim the land for rice, and the ongoing planting cycle for white, red, and black rice that is still used in 2013. Next we went to the beautiful family compound where Puspa greeted us with cold drinks and explained how each family compound is designed and laid out. After drinking our refreshing fruit drink, it was time to wash up and begin cooking eight different courses. What a treat! Puspa is a master at leading students through the learning process, dividing up the work while ensuring each student has a chance to participate in creating the different dishes. The class was FUN and the participants enjoyed working together to cook amazing food. We had a delightful time and LOVED the food we made.

The tour starts at the Balinese market area, where they show you the different vegetables and fruits they have, and the flowers they use as offerings to the temple. Next they show you the rice fields and tell you how the plant rice and what are the different stages of the planting. Finally we go to Puspa and Wayan's home, they show you their home which is built according to the Balinese tradition, explain you a bit about the culture, then starts the cooking. You cook 8 different dishes, and get to do a bit of all the steps of the preparation. You eat your 8 course meal and then they offer you the ride back. Everyone was very nice and accommodating, and this is not only about food, but also of the Balinese culture and traditions, which we wouldn't know elsewhere. I recommend it to everyone, it's also suitable for kids."

Your culinary adventure starts by unlocking some of the key ingredients that makes cooking Balinese dishes seem so easy once you know the secrets. Wayan will take you on a tour of some rice fields which only takes 5 Bali minutes lol. You will then be taken to the home of Puspa & Wayan and be warmly greeted, you will then begin your class in a very clean, hygienic environment, you will cook a variety of different dishes, Peanut Sauce, Yellow Chicken Curry, Satay Sticks, Clear Mushroom Soup, Bean Curd, and the list goes on. You will eat what you cook WOW great food. You will also be given Recipes and notes of what you cook to take home. DONT MISS THIS COOKING CLASS it is the best in Ubud as I and my wife have been to two others. The cost is 350.000RP about $33.00 AUS Dollars, Bintang laid on for free but at $1 AUS each it is polite to give a tip at the end to help pay for the Bintang."

Pupsa and Wayan are consummate hosts exuding friendless and a desire to share their love of Bali and its food. The food preparation is fun and informative, and paced very well. Nothing is hurried and when one sits down to eat it is somewhat of a shock to realize how much the group has cooked. The food and the menu choices (all nine of them) are wonderful. Highly recommended, even for those who are no 'foodies'! Great value all round."

From there it was off to the rice fields to meet Wayan and get an understanding of the history of the fields and their sizes handed down through the generations. Next it was off to Wayan and Aunties home, a wonderful welcome drink and Wayan explained the layout of the compound, the homes, temples and meeting rooms. Next it was Aunties turn to take the reins and lead us off to the cooknig area. All the wonderful fresh ingredients!! We all did our share of prep and cooking under watchful guidance, the smells were fabulous! The food excellent! the hosts amazing! A definate must if you love cooking and enjoy Balinese food.

The family went above and beyond in their inclusion of everyone in the kitchen and home... We learned how to cook about 8 dishes.... At the end of class They even handed us packets with step by step instructions on how to cook each and everyone of the dishes.... My husband and I will absolutely be making some of these dishes at home... The meals was delicious and the hosts were incredible, they truly went above and beyond... In fact, Wayan even offered to take the guests on a tour of their village after the class was over... This was truly a unique and unforgettable experience."

They are a group of proffesionals and friendly people. We cooked more than 6 dishes in 6hours which was pretty surprising because time flew when we really enjoy. I have to say my favourite would be the welcoming ice lime juice, the curry chicken and the balinese satay. Seriously, this cooking class is fully recommended for all ages! Mr. Wayan and Aunty Puspa take cooking to the next level, they bring laughters and joy. Thank you very much Aunty Puspa & Mr. wayan! :)"

The hosts are a husband and wife team who are welcoming, funny and knowledgeable. One thing I felt was truly excellent was the way the school worked to include those with specific dietary needs. I have an allergy as did one other member of the class and our hosts went out of their way to adjust the dishes so we wouldn't miss out. They also created some less spicy dishes for the children in the group too. This is a great class for all, and a really enjoyable experience that not only teaches you about Balinese cooking, but also about the culture of this wonderful place."

At the Paon Bali class there were around 20 or so people making things pretty cramped. It was a fun afternoon/evening with bottled water and beer in endless supply. For me I would have preferred to have had a smaller class and learnt more about the spices, cooking teachnique so I could take these skills home.

The dishes we cooked (8 in total) came out gorgeous thanks to Puspa\u2019s clear instructions.

A good opportunity for some impressive photos!We were then taken to Wayan's home, the setting for the cooking class, and introduced to his wife Puspa, our guide throughout the cooking experience.The rest of the day was spent preparing, cooking and being educated about the traditional ingredients and cooking methods of the balinese. A very hands on experience. We then sat down as a group and were able to taste all of our cooking from the day, and may I add this was the best meal we had in Bali throughout our whole stay. Just so fresh, simple and extremely tasty!For our first day in Ubud, this was a great way to kickstart our holiday. We left feeling very humble to be able to enter a traditional balinese home having spent the day with such warm and welcoming people. Definitely recommend Paon cooking class whether your a fellow foodie or just interested!"

Food was pretty complicated to cook (I have done many cooking classes & unfortantly I won't be making these at home) so many spices & ingredients , don't get me wrong the food was amazing but I'm into more practical cooking I would have loved to have learnt how to make a traditional nasi goring or something that you could whip up at home. If highly recommend this course as a great night out & to see what goes into making those amazing Bali flavours!"

They explained more to us about Balinese culture in the half-day we spent with them than a licensed tour guide did during a full day. They took us to the market and taught us about all the foods, kitchen tools, and spices we would be using in the class. Next they brought us to their village rice fields and taught us all about the growing and harvesting of this Balinese staple. Finally, we went to their home, and prepared a delicious 8-course meal. The course was extremely professional with outstanding explanations on every detail. Walan and Puspa are so friendly, cheerful, and the two of them are quite hilarious. I will miss them when I leave Bali, because they really did make me feel like a part of their family."

Okay this was one of the most enjoyable events I did while visiting Ubud.The family of Wayan and Papuspa are so funny, kind and gave our group a wonderful day. This is more than a cooking class. We learned about shopping in the market for food, flowers and cooking supplies. We then went to a rice field to learn about rice from planting to harvest and then off to their beautiful house. We were taught a little history about their culture and living arrangements of the Balinese while we sipped a beautiful and delicious beverage.Puspa, a very beautiful and knowledgeable chef, took over and taught us how to cook 7 traditional dishes. Her home is beautiful and the menu she chose was amazing. She gave us so much information about ingredients and how to make many traditional Balinese dishes.Add this to your list!"

This cooking class was the most memorable experience of the entire trip. After a private tour of the family rice fields by Wayan, we were warmly welcomed to Puspa and Wayan's family compound to create a 10 course meal, which we then ate over looking the jungle to the tune of the neighboring geckos. Puspa and Wayan (and the rest of the staff) made us feel like family. They were so charming, and we felt so welcome in the beautiful compound. The food was arguably the best food we ate in Indonesia, and we were sent home with a recipe book, which we managed to recreate in Oxford, England last weekend. Would highly recommend this experience and the number 1 most memorable and romantic thing to do in Bali. Best cooking class and authentic Balinese cooking experience in Bali."

I really enjoyed this day and must say that Wayan and Puspa are just lovely (as are the other staff). It is so well organised and gives you a great introduction into Balinese culture, from the markets, the rice paddies, their village and day to day life. Both Wayan and Puspa are so welcoming and make you feel like part of a big family. The food we cooked was lovely and it was great to try food that I normally wouldn't try eg, tempe. I would recommend this course and who knows, I may even try to cook something at home myself."

            "review": "Second visit... and I'll be back!. My first opportunity to meet Wayan and Puspa was last year in March, when my best friend an I decided to try our hand at playing chef for the day. We had such an amazing experience, I convinced my husband to join me for my second time round.Wayan himself \u2013 Paon Cooking School owner \u2013 collected us from our Ubud hotel and jumped out the car to greet us with a big welcoming hug. He knew I had come last year and was so pleased I had chosen them once again. A short drive to Ubud Place, where we meet up with our new found friends for the day and the gorgeous Made (our tour guide and assistant from last year) leads us to the morning Market, but not before she gets a big hug from me. The Market is exactly what I remembered from last year and Made doesn\u2019t leave out a single explanation. This time Made helps me make some purchases that I was sorry I didn't get last year.We finish our Market tour and the group splits into two cars to make our way to Laplapan Village for Wayan\u2019s explanation of his village\u2019s rice fields. There are some children playing in the rice fields with long sticks in the close distance and Wayan tells us they are trying to catch dragonflies with the sticky substance (from fruit) on the end of the stick to use like glue. I wander away from the group and approach the children; I ask to take their photo and offer them a sweet each. They eagerly come to me with their hands out and thank me many times. As I rejoin the group, Wayan asks where his sweet is.We jump back in the cars and take another quick drive to Wayan and Puspa\u2019s village, where we play in their kitchen for the day. As we enter their compound, Puspa is right there to greet us giving me a kiss on each cheek. A lemon welcome drink given to each guest, we relax on their \u201cmeeting room\u201d platform and find out more about Wayan and Puspa\u2019s life story before being taken into their kitchen, their home, their family.I was pleased to see that the profits made from their business obviously went straight back into the family compound and improving the area used for the cooking class. Since last year they had built a new toilet facility and put a brand new roof over the kitchen area. They were very proud to share this with me.Straight to it, Aprons on, knife in hand we chop; pestle in hand, we grind \u2013 mixing and creating so many flavours and aromas that will result in our amazing menu for the day. Together, all participants take on a role in the kitchen to contribute in some way to each and every dish we will later share for lunch. The menu includes: Clear Mushroom and Vegetable Soup (Sup Jamur), Base Gede \u2013 Basic Yellow Sauce (Bumbu Kuning), Be Siap Mesanten \u2013 Chicken in Coconut Curry (Kare Ayam), Sate Siap \u2013 Minced Chicken Grilled on Bamboo Sticks ( Sate Lilit Ayam), Kacang Me Santok \u2013 Vegetable in Peanut Sauce (Gado Gado), Coconut and Snake Bean Salad (Jukut Urab), Pepesan Be Pasih \u2013 Steamed Fish in Banana Leaves (Pepes Ikan), Tempe Me Goreng \u2013 Deep Fried Tempe in Sweet Soy Sauce (Tempe Kering), Kolak Bui \u2013 Boiled Banana in Palm Sugar Syrup (Kolak Pisang).This was the exact same menu I tried last year, but just as good and what made it even better, is that Puspa helped me make some minor variations to my dishes so that I could try something different. Of course she checked for any allergies prior and one of the participants was allergic to banana, so the dessert dish had Balinese Sweet Potato substituted for the banana, which I also tried for something different \u2013 YUM!The group separates (in no particular order) to two tables and we enjoy our first course \u2013 the soup. Some idle chit chat and getting to know one another, we learn in our group there are three people from Estonia, one from Finland, two from West Germany, two from Singapore and us two Aussies... and that was just our table. There were another five people on the other table.Every single person\u2019s soup bowl bone dry, Puspa ushers us back into the kitchen to continue our cooking. What seems like only a few moments later, we are told to take our seats and a feast is quickly delivered to our table. There is SO...MUCH...FOOD! We pass the platters around and fill our plates with a little bit of everything. Hardly any room left for seconds, but feeling bad that we have left so much food, the platters do the rounds again for just a little more. We share stories with each other about our own countries and experiences and before you know it, the time has ticked away into the late afternoon.Puspa knows we are bursting at the seams, but who could resist that delicious and simple dessert \u2013 it literally takes minutes to whip up. A drink of coffee or tea to go with it, our day together winds down and the group prepares to go their separate ways. Puspa tells us their driver will take us back to our hotel in Kuta, but \u201cno worry, no hurry\u201d. Nyoman drives us all the way back to Kuta, with our suitcase safely still in the back of Wayan\u2019s car.Although this was my second visit, it was just as special if not more as the first. Wayan and Puspa were so happy for me to be there and mentioned this many times throughout the day, that they made me feel like I was, in fact, their special guest. They both treated me and hubby like family, and I can confidently say that if you show genuine care and respect for their family and business, you will be well looked after.Hubby had his reservations (pardon the pun) about this day and really only agreed to come along to keep me happy. However, he did more work in the kitchen than me \u2013 I used the excuse that I\u2019ve done it before and needed to take the photos \u2013 and he got to meet and chat with many really friendly people. Wayan took an instant liking to hubby, which immediately put him at ease. He tells me he would definitely do it again. I would definitely do it again... maybe my mum will join me next time?If you're considering doing a cooking class, you really must choose this one!"

            "review": "Good introduction to Balinese cuisine. We were referred to this activity by the manager of our Ubud hotel and we thank him for suggesting such an engaging excursion.The Paon Bali Cooking Class is available in mornings to prepare lunch or in late afternoons to prepare dinner. If you go to the morning session, as we did, a trip to the local food market is included.We were collected from the hotel but had to wait a long time hanging around in a temple in the city for other participants to arrive. Once we set off for the market, the excitement began to build. The guide was very pleasant and spoke clearly, but the smells and sounds (and flies) at the maket were oppressive and I felt we spent a bit long there, even though I enjoyed his descriptions of all the various fruits and spices. It was great being able to taste a few things and see the knives and other kitchen utensils on display. Time was allowed for people to buy a few things as we went around but some opted just to take in the layout and come back later to get some souvenirs.Next, we visited a rice paddy and listened to a presentation by the husband of the cooking class lady (by the side of the road). It was well organised and authoritative ad he established an easy rapport with the group in that situation.Finally we were taken to the location of the cooking class and while we sipped on a welcome drink the hosts explained the structure of a Balinese family compound before escorting us to the open verandah beside the garden where the class was conducted.There were up-front presentations by the hostess to begin with but soon a older, gentler fellow was our teacher and he was assisted by another couple of people helping keep an eye on us and whisking off what we had chopped to keep everything very efficiently organised.A touch I particularly enjoyed was the inclusion of quiet gamelan music being played live near the dining area. A very special detail for enhancing the cultural experience.Eight items were prepared and tasted. The class was pacy but there was always the opportunity to go to take water or beer whenever you wished. Beers were charged at the end of the day but water, tea and coffee was included.I won't spoil the surprise by listing the details of the dishes but I will say it was value for money. I was surprised that a receipt was not provided though.Another thing that disappointed me was that we did not get to eat our own portions as it all got put in one big pot at the end then you served yourself from the centre of the table.I would recommend this activity to others. Everyone in our session seemed well satisfied both with their education and the lunch."

Wayan is such a lovely man, with a great sense of humour. We met Puspa at the family home. The cooking area out the back is very professional and very clean. It was a very entertaining class with Puspa who is very good at keeping everyone on task and also entertained with her jokes. Puspa loves to be in photo's and always gives the camera a big beautiful smile. After cooking a variety of dishes we sat down around a large table and endulged in some delicious food. The day ended with us receiving a recipe book of all of the meals we created. I have no hesitation in recommending Paon Cooking Class. Thank you Puspa and Wayan. From Samantha and Graham x"

The group of would-be cooks was made up of people from Finland, Holland, Egypt, Mexico, Australia, France, Ireland and UK. We all mixed well because of the approach taken by Puspa who ensured we all got hands on. The hosts catered for everyone's taste and preference in foods. Some were total vegetarians, other's ate no meat but took fish and one has an allergy to seafood. Nothing fased our hosts. We made nine dishes in total covering starter, main courses and salads and dessert. I learnt a great deal about ingredients I had seen before as well as ones new to me. Working and eating in the lovely incense-scented garden was sheer joy, as was the fun way that Puspa dealt with us. I will definately source the ingredients at home and make some of the dishes.

Wayan's wife Puspa runs the cooking school and he explained to us how rice farming works before we went to their home.

Puspa is fun and engaging and makes sure everyone is doing something. We learned a ton about Balinese cooking and then ate some incredible food. The class was very hands on which was nice since some classes are just demos. I also really liked that at the end, Puspa asked us for honest feedback.

We were picked up at our villa in Seminyak by a taxi (only $30 return) and taken to Ubud - a 90 minute drive. After a visit to nearby padi fields we went to the class venue and were met by the owner \"Auntie\" Puspa and her staff who made us (4 in total) very welcome with cool drinks waiting. She explained the setup of her home then we were ushered to the cooking area. A very pretty venue with views of the fields, and a kitchen garden. As it was a small group we all had plenty of opportunity to chop, pound and cook taking turns at the various tasks. Auntie explained all the ingredients and encouraged us to taste (and take photos) as we went along. Bottled water was available at no cost whenever required - a necessity in the humidity here :-)We made a total of 8 dishes over the next 3 hours or so and were made to feel 'at home' at all times. The food was all delicious and the staff were all very friendly and accommodating. Auntie made sure everything was kept clean and hygienic and the place was spotless. A really magical experience the whole way through. We consider ourselves 'foodies' and we thoroughly enjoyed every minute. You can't beat the freshness of the ingredients used and the resultant dishes were truly authentic. For A$35 each you could have a drink and entr\u00e9e at KuDeTa or you could have a Balinese experience that you'll treasure forever!"

It was interesting to go on the market tour and also see the rice being harvested. When we arrived at their house I had to lie down on the verandah, as I was not feeling well, while they were explaining about their traditional houses. Wayan gave me some ice in a towel to put on my neck. He also made up a bed for me to lie down if I felt bad during the class. I managed to watch the class and also have a few mouthfuls of each dish just to taste. Pushpa also tried to give me some money back as I had not eaten very much.The class was made a lot of fun due to the banter between Pushpa and Wayan. I can hardly wait to try the dishes now that I am back home."

I specifically chose this cookery class out of the many that are available in Bali as it was held in their house and not in a hotel or in some 'kitchen' in town and I definately wasn't disappointed!Was so nice to see our hosts in their home and learn lots about their way of life & family.The class started with a trip to the local market.....walking through all the areas, fruit, meat, fish, vegetables, spices and our hosts explaining about all the different key ingredients to BAlinese cooking. Next stop their rice paddies.....and an explanation about ownership, irrigation systems and growing rice. Finally to their home and preparing and cooking lunch together. There was about 15 of us and together we made the most wonderful wonderful food......which we then got to eat! yummy!! Our hosts Puspa and Wayne were pure joy to be with....great hosts and 'teachers', funny, warm and friendly....what more can I say apart from a GREAT BIG THANK YOU! We were so inspired that since coming home we've bought a couple of BAlinese cookery books, sourced some of the more unknown ingredients and now prepare Balinese food at home!Puspa & Wayne are an absolute delight!"

Our group included a family of 4 20 something year olds, 2 50-60year olds and an 85 yr old grandmother. All had a good time. The market trip was interesting though nothing particularly new; a visit to rice paddies to see a harvest and trying our hand at threshing then to Laplapan village where Pushpa runs a cheerfully vigorous and authentic cooking program in her home which includes a tour of the compound and her vegetable garden. We were 15 all told and there was plenty of hands on experience cutting, pounding and cooking 5 magnificent dishes. The vegetarian member of our party was catered for. Some of the best food we have enjoyed so far and in a beautiful traditional Balinese house compound hosted by genuinely friendly people who are very good at their job. And very good value for money."

They picked us up at our hotel, took us to the food market, then showed us their rice patty plantation, then took us into their family compounds to educated us on Balinese families & culture, & then took us to the kitchen to teach us how to cook traditional balinese food. The cooking was fun, food was good, and the Subawa family are such happy & warm people...extremely pleasant to be around. The Kitchen was clean & we used gloves to chop and cook, so we were able to eat our food with little fear of Bali-Belly (which is not something i can say about every place we went to during our Bali trip!). We really enjoyed this experience and we would definitely recommend it to all of our friends who are travelling to the area."

This concern was unfounded though, Puspa really knows her stuff and suddenly it all comes together, all the chopping and mixing begins to form amazing, aromatic perfumes, beautiful, vibrant colours and wonderful flavours.By the time you sit down to eat with the others the ice cold Bintang is very welcome and then you can't believe that the food you cooked can taste so amazing.This was the highlight of my trip and a surprise at the end was a couple of boxes of the dishes to share with my wife in the evening.Puspa and Wayan are fantastic hosts - warm, friendly, happy, professional, funny and very knowledgable.

Wayan did explain many things about balinese cooking and even their traditions. And it was an amazing experience The Market - forget the European standards. :) Then we went to Laplapan village to rice fields. Wayan did explain about rice growing, it's importance in balinese life. Shortly we arrived at his lovely house, welcomed by Paon (his wife and main cook) and refreshing drinks. Before start cooking we got a tour around their garden where they grow vegetables. And then lots of fun with chopping, mixing, frying, peeling, boiling, stiring, steaming, crushing, tasting and so on.... And in the end we made so much food. I was very full with yummy balinese food. So tasty and made by me and others in cooking class. We aso got little book with all recepies in the end. It was 7 yummy spent hours. Very friendly atmosphere ( all day long u get cold or hot drinks too). And to add- it is peaceful because house is in the village ( nice view when u have the lunch). Recommended 100% and more. ;)"

There were in total 17 people for the cooking class, and her and her family managed it so that every one of us got a chance to cook. The result was possibly the best lunch I've had in Bali. Yummm! They also made their own coconut oil, and I asked and was given two bottles to take home.Highly recommended, fun experience!"

From the moment we were picked up, by a young Wayan, from our hotel, taken to the market, then the picturesque drive to the lovely village a talk about life in the village and the rice paddies, we had fun and lots of conversation. We were invited in to their lovely home/ outside kitchen and dining area. The herbs and spices are grown here and smell beautiful. The menu was very authentic. This is hands on with all participants preparing and cooking food. The kitchen is very clean. We were all in need of a Bintang ( hot day) and we really enjoyed eating what we had created. We arrived back to the hotel very full , with a booklet containing recipes for us to try at home! Great value, great fun, it's a must do."

The day started with a tour of the local market which was very interesting and offered some great photographic opportunities and we were then taken to the rice fields to meet Wayan who explained about the growing process. We then went to his family compound where the cooking took place. It was amazing to cook in such beautiful surroundings and learn about how Balinese families live. We had expected the class to be more hands on as we experienced in Thailand but that said, it was very interesting and the warmth of Puspa & Wayan together made it a very memorable experience which we would highly recommend. The food we helped cook was delicious and we are planning to cook some of the dishes when back in the UK!"

After pick up from our Hotel, Maya Fusion, we were taken to the fruit & vege markets in Ubud at 830 am, kept in small groups whilst we were given the introduction to local produce, spices, and fruit. After that we were taken out to a small village maybe 5 minutes from Ubud, where we met our host, Wayan and Puspa, .Wayan then explains the way the family lives, ,, their religious beliefs, all mixed in with great humour.. then the cooking preparation begins for the 9 dishes we are to prepare and consume later.Everyone of the 16 of us got to work on each dish, and as we had the nite before eaten at a very tradional Indonesian Restaurant, Miro,s, we were now creating the dishes we had enjoyed the night before.Our friends had done another cooking class in Ubud as had a few of the others and they all heaped praise on Paon.as the best experience by far.We had to forego the rice paddy visit as it was raining for most of the day, but that did little to dampen our enthusiasm.After an amazing feast of 9 courses, with a few Bintangs (extra cost) we were delivered back to our property by about 230pm..Book in advance this is a must for those who like to get involved in local culture and cuisine."

The beginning of the tour is a hands-on look through the local food market. I have travelled extensively through many third world countries (including my own heritage) and am certainly not a travel snob. HOWEVER! These markets were absolutely awful and had no business being part of this experience. It is only for this reason I simply could not give the full five stars that the rest of the tour deserves."

Then they drove us to a rice plantation and explained how do they grow it. Then went to Paon house where in the back has a quite big space for cooking. We were quite a big group in the morning, around 15-20 people and I was personally concerned that I wont be able to do any cooking, but far from reality, they know what they are doing, there is space for everyone and the couple are wonderful hosts. Just a piece of advise, if you'd like to cook in petit commitee, you may want to join the afternoon classes. Finally, the setting for the lunch has amaizing views to Ubud nature, so all in all one of the best experiences that I take from my trip."

We had an amazing day at the Paon Cooking Class, starting with a visit at 8:30 to the fruit/vege/meat market where we were able to sample some of the local fruits such as mangosteens and rambutan. This was followed by a visit to the rice padi fields and then we were welcomed into the home of Wayan and Puspa who run the cooking school. They have a great setup - the cooking school is outdoors in their compound in a beautiful green tranquil garden and everything is so clean and very professional. Hygiene is of a very high standard. We saw how coconut oil was made then used some in our cooking. The recipes (which you get to take home) were so yum and included satay, gado gado, curry. The group was small (about 11-12) and the best thing was that Puspa doesn't just show you how to to cook - you get to do everything yourself. After the cooking we sat down to relax and enjoy the food with a bintang and its was such a nice lunch, a great group of people and our hosts were just so welcoming and lovely. You absolutely get your moneys worth and more. Highly recommend this for anyone. I took my 13 year old daughter (who wasnt really looking forward to going) and she thought it was great too. Thank you so much Puspa and Wayan for your hospitality."

To call this a Cooking Class is to do it a disservice;First up, if you are staying within the Ubud area they will pick you up from your hotel, you then head to the Ubud Market for a walk through and explanation of many of the foods you will be working with later on. Your guide will show you through the fruit and vegetable section explaining many of the exotic foods you had always been too scared to try.Next up you will head out to the rice fields near Wayan and Puspa's home compound - Wayan will explain the process of growing the rice, and his infectious smile and laugh will put you in a great mood for the day.You will then head to the family compound where \"Aunty\" Puspa takes you on a tour of their family compound and shows you the amazing spice and food garden they maintain.Now its onto the cooking - I won't spoil it for you but you will basically be preparring a banquet feast for yourself and your fellow classmates. All up we made 8 different meals and also a dessert item.You get to prepare all the food items, then cook them all - Puspa has her army of helpers to make sure nothing goes too badly. You might worry that you can't cook, but the key you will learn with most of these Balinese dishes is that they are very hard to muck up, it is mostly stirring and frying. They are simple meals that make the food the star rather than fancy cooking techniques.This is not a quick experience - all up with were with them for about 7 hours from early morning to early afternoon; so when you think about the experience you are getting for such a small price it is a definate must do.Please book early though - Puspa has been known to be booked out months in advance."

After looking around a bit we decided to try Paon Bali, based on the reviews we read on TripAdvisor. Although it was a 2 hour drive from our villa in Jimbaran Hills, it was most certainly worth it.We did the afternoon class, which starts at 4pm. Upon arriving at Paon Bali we were taken for a quick ride to the local rice fields and given a good explanation of the rice growing process and the local ownership structure of the land. Beyond the educational value, the views were simply stunning.We then returned to the house of Wayan and Puspa and Wayan took us for a tour of the compound, beginning with a thorough explanation of the family temple, which was enlightening. We then moved on to an explanation of the other structures and the way the compound was set up.Things really got interesting when we started to prepare our dishes and work with the various ingredients - some known to us, some not. We first saw how to harvest coconut oil, then got a walkthrough of the garden, and then started chopping and prepping. Our group had nine people so it was a great size to do some work, learn some things, cook a bit, but also socialise and relax with other couples in the group.The food was amazing and the process was good fun. But the highlight of the evening had to be our cooking host, Puspa. She was an absolute crack-up! Friendly, funny, smart, experienced - she made the day for us. We read another review here about her comment at the end of the night about recommending the class to our friends as she needs to pay her mortgage - clearly, this person didn't get her sense of humour. She was self deprecating and was just a great part of our day.Oh, and by the way, they have great facilities and very modern and clean bathrooms.If you can get to Ubud, we highly recommend this class. For $35/person (well, $45 for us after all our Bintangs!) you couldn't even eat our in Ubud for the amount and quality of food you get at Paon Bali."

It culminated in the enjoyment of what we had made for lunch and I can't wait now to make some of these dishes at home!Definitely recommened participating in this class, a fantastic day out, good value for money and lots of fun."

Puspa is very good about moving everyone around to try cooking different foods with different techniques so you not only learn a lot, but have the opportunity to chat with lots of different people. I am a vegetarian and they were incredibly accommodating. If you like cooking even just a little, you will have a great time with Puspa and crew. This was also by far the best food I ate in bali. Awesome :)In addition to the cooking, you also take a tour of the local food market and rice paddies where Wayan (who is absolutely adorable) shares great stories and information about the local ways. Truly a great day."

We were lucky enough to have a small class of just 3, since it was rain season and tourists are fewer. Aunty Puspa was tonnes of fun and a great guide to cooking, and ensured everyone was involved in all the dishes. They allow plenty of flexibility with meals, concerning food dislikes and allergies, which was wonderful and meant you could come away with more of a learning experience. Aunty Puspa also explains some good substitutes since it can be hard to find some ingredients.The guides through the rice fields and the market are buckets of fun, and it was a good way to learn a little about the culture and the area. If you do any one thing in Ubud, do this!Thank you, Wayan and Puspa and everyone at Paon Bali Cooking Class!!"

At the time I came across this opportunity on trip advisor, there were 496 excellent reviews, so I figured it must be good. When you register for this class, the staff arrange to pick you up at your hotel, take you on a market tour of the Ubud market, take you on a brief tour of a rice field that the family owns part of, then on to the cooking class, then they drop you off again when its all over. I was picked up from my hotel in central Ubud at 8:15am and dropped off again about 2:30pm. Do not plan to go shopping at the market on your tour as prices are inflated \"tourist price\" and there is not time for bartering. If you are in a wheelchair, this probably won't work for you. I myself was recovering from knee-surgery so walked with a brace and crutch and found the whole tour/class disability friendly. The market can be difficult to navigate as the food stalls are on the lower floor which require going up and down at least 1 flight of steps. The brief rice field tour was flat and on pavement. Wayan and Puspa and their assistants were wonderful hosts; the class takes place in their family compound which they give you a brief tour of upon arrival, there are a few steps at the front door and going into the kitchen. The open-air but well shaded kitchen area was very clean and they made use of traditional equipment for cooking but joked that when participants would get home, we would use food processors instead of hand grinders...which I probably will. During the class, all participants (my class had about 15 students) get an opportunity to prepare and cook all aspects of the meal. While I took this trip to Bali with my husband, he and I went our separate ways on the day of the class. Other students were friendly and this was a great way to meet people from Australia, Netherlands, Austria, USA. The food was the best Balinese food I ate in the 12 days I was in Bali and by far the best presentation...and believe me I ate Balinese food at every meal. Unlimited supply of bottled water is provided inclusive of price, bintang beer is also offered at a modest price. No regrets and worth the price!"

Then it was off to Puspa's place. Puspa is a warm, generous and vivacious lady who wholeheartedly welcomes you into her home. The cooking methods are easy and everyone gets involved.

We were welcomed with a cool refreshing drink and aprons. Then we listened as Puspar explained the different Balinese ingredients for the dishes that we would be cooking. Her English is fantastic, no one had any trouble understanding her. Since the class was on the larger side (15 people), we were all given different prepping tasks since there were not enough cutting or cooking stations. However, this is not an issue because anyone who is standing around is asked to add a quarter spoon of salt, peppers, etc. We all had the opportunity to participate in cooking several dishes such as chicken satay, mushroom soup, stir-fried tofu, and tuna wraps - all were delicious. Then the main event of eating our dishes was eagerly awaited by all. We stuffed ourselves silly and my sister even asked for more rice. Wayan played musical instrument for our listening pleasure whilst eating. This is a must-do in Ubud!"

The couple who run the course are friendly and good fun, the day is informative with the market visit, the rice field talk and then a very hands on time of cooking, chatting and eating. As someone else said, you don't cook one thing from start to finish - we had 15 in our group but it was fine as all of us were preparing/chopping initially, then there were five cooking stations so they asked for five volunteers at a time to cook, others added drops of this or sprinkles of spice while the five were cooking and then it kept rotating throughout the different dishes we were preparing. Lots of hands on time, noone was fighting for time and overall very good. Lovely to be in their own traditional Bali home while you do you this too, rather than in a hotel. Lovely couple, lovely course!"

Our group of six senior Australians booked this activity based on Trip Advisor reviews we had read.We heartily agree that this is the best cooking and cultural activity in Bali. Yes, it's our number one, and we have said this to all our Australian contacts who may visit Bali in the future.As hosts and educators, Puspar and Wayan are the best. We learned much of Balinese culture we had no former knowledge of. Don't miss it. The best $35 you could spend on a tourism activity."

Wayan and Puspar responded immediately and confirmed dates, prices and organised transport (with two excellent drivers) to and from Legian. They even had us picked up early so we could spend the morning discovering Ubud, before attending the class. For those who think cooking classes are for the elderly and retired, revise these thoughts....most of the attendees in our class were young couples. This has to be one of the best experiences I have had in Bali for the following reasons: the entire experience is so well organised, it's great fun, the hosts are just wonderful, the food was delicious AND it's 100% Balinese - not a European take on Balinese cooking. The facilities are excellent and Wayan and Puspar's home and garden are beautiful. This is not an experience that one should miss. Then you too will understand what a \"Bali blender\" and an \"MBA\" are!"

Wayan & Puspar are warm and welcoming hosts, and their team is friendly and attentive. The whole experience is convenient, interactive and thoroughly enjoyable. Right from the ease of being picked up at our hotel, having an informative visit to some rice fields, through to being welcomed into their home, and fabulous garden kitchen, through to the preparation, cooking, presentation and dining on 7 wonderful authentic Balinese dishes - everything has been thought of. The ingredients are all really fresh and the facilities and utensils are very clean. There are many thoughtful touches, and everyone gets involved in the food preparation, to having live accompanying music, to being shown how to separate the oil from the fresh coconut water. Even the herbs are picked straight from the garden. It is interactive, informative, and entertaining.This is an authentic experience that is well worth having. Thanks Wayan, Puspar and team!"

Enjoying a couple of beers to accompany the food we'd just cooked and getting to sit on the special 'honeymoon' table with a view of the surrounding countryside as the sun went down is something we'll never forget. Thank you also to Puspa for returning our camera which we left behind, so so kind of you. Highly recommended!"

My friend and I were fortunate to book into Paon Bali morning cooking class in March 2012, which we arranged ourselves over the phone once we had arrived. We had done some research beforehand and the website and reviews provided information suggesting to us that it would be the most likely educational, personalised, fun and cultural experience in comparison to the others (which were mainly restaurant based) - it was all that and so much more! The pickup from our hotel, to the Ubud Market Tour (where we were able to purchase ingredients to take home), the cultural explanations of foods, dress and offerings and the information about village life, only to finish up with cooking, eating and sharing the day with some fantastic people! Puspar is a beautiful woman and Wayan is a wonderful gentleman; proud of their culture and honest in sharing their life story. They invited us into their home and world and showered us with so much hospitality and gratitude, I felt like I was a part of their family. The lovely assistants, including Made, were so warm and friendly making the experience even more pleasurable. The group of participants were very different, but we all got along so well, learning from and about each other - by the end of the day it was like we had known each other for such a long time. The benefits of this day far outweighed the skills we learnt in cooking traditional foods and tasting the yummy dishes we created! Not to mention, the cost was unbelievably outstanding value for money - far cheaper than others and you could not put a $ value on what I gained during this day. I would participate in this experience, over and over again. In fact, we are planning another trip Feb 2013 and I have convinced my husband to come with me this time... CAN'T WAIT!"

They are funny, speak English very well and seem to enjoy their work despite cooking the same meal 7-days a week for the past 3-years...twice a day!! They'll arrange a pickup from your hotel, take you to the market and show you around and explain various things you'll find at the market..making sure you can taste the various fruits and advising you not to taste some others (like the boiled sardines) due to \"Bali Belly\" risk. After visiting the market we drove to a local rice paddy and were told all about the process of growing and harvesting rice in Bali. Very interesting. We then were driven a short distance to Puspa & Wayan's home and welcomed warmly into their (large) home and the family life and house architecture was explained. Finally we moved to the kitchen and began cooking...this is where it got really good.Having done many cooking classes in different countries, I've seen different ways of doing it. In this way Puspa explained how to do certain aspects of the preparation and then had enough stations setup for about 1/2 to 3/4 of our group (we were ~20) to work diligently on the same task...then all the food from the stations were combined together and we moved to a different part of the (outdoor) kitchen where the same process was repeated (with a different item to prepare).After several hours preparing, we sit at tables of 10 people or so and enjoy our hard cooked meal that consisted of many, many typical (and delicious) Indonesian meals.If you have an allergy, intolerance or food preference (e.g. vegetarian) that's no problem. Just be prepared to be asked in front of the whole group \"who has allergies\" or \"who is vegetarian\".Return transfer to hotel (or spa for us) also included.We were picked up at 8:40am (supposed to have been 8:15) and returned at 3:00pm."

We then met Wayan at the rice paddies, who gave us a bit of history about the rice paddies and the pivotal role they play in the eating habits of the Balinese.Then over to Paon Bali, where we met Wayan's wife, Puspa, who was a fantastic host and very charismatic and approachable. The whole team at Paon Bali were fantastic, everything was organised perfectly and the food we cooked was delicious (naturally!). The menu we made up consisted of clear mushroom soup, gado-gado, sate, chicken curry and fried tempe, amongst other things. I would definitely recommend this course."

We had done a cooking class last time we came to Bali and hadn't actually done any of the cooking, more just watched.This was a completely different experience. We booked the class via the website where Puspa was very reliable and easy to deal with. It was $35 per person and they also arranged for us to be picked up from our hotel in Legian. The car only cost $30 return for the 3 of us and they also let us spend the afternoon in Ubud and return at our convenience.Once we arrived in Ubud, Puspa met us at the market and took us through the food section pointing out some different spices and fruits and allowing us to tast them. We were then taken to look at the village where Puspa and Wayan live and we were shown the beautiful rice paddies. Once taken to Paon cooking class, which is actually where Wayan & Puspa's family live we were given a very detailed description of a typical Balinese house. It was very interesting and Wayan is quite a character.All the staff were very polite and spoke excellent english so If anyone had any allergies or were vegetarian they were well cared for.It was really great fun as we were shown all the ingredients and then took part in all the processes of the cooking under guidance. The food was amazing and needless to say we left in a very happy food coma. We finished the class at about 2pm.Wayan and Puspa were amazing hosts and this course was a phenomenal experience."

We called up Paon who advised us that they were fully booked for the rest of the week and the only availabilities were that morning. We agreed to this anyway and Puspa was kind enough to organise transport for us (since we were staying in Seminyak). We got there a bit late but was taken to the markets and the rice fields where we met Wayan and everybody else in the class. Wayan was just too cute and funny. Afterwards, we were taken to his house and introduced to his wife Puspa who was the teacher. She was ever so friendly and knew her food. The cooking class was pretty hands on and everybody participated in the cooking. We then all sat down to eat the food we made. It was the most delicious Balinese food we have ever had. And to think we made it ourselves with organic and locally grown products?!! I would definitely recommend this for a true Balinese cultural experience :-)"

This is not just a very good hands on cooking class, but also a real look in the Balanese lifestyle and nature. We were told many interesting facts about the Rice fields and the family compound. Both these two are super friendly and good English speakers. Cooking wise, you will not be disappointed, as the only 100% vegetarian, I was catered for and the meal was excellent.... Highly recommended for serious foodies and general tourists."

They are proud of their culture and family which adds so much warmth and authenticity to this class. The market visit, the rice paddy stop and being serenaded by Wayan while we were cooking are simply wonderful memories that we took away from that day. In addition to the recipes which I can not wait to try at home! The class logistics were well put together, very organized and you get to participate as much or as little as you like. And in the end, you get to taste the fruit of your labour which is absolutely delicious. You will not be disappointed!!!"

For $35 per head my husband and I were picked up from our hotel at 8.30 , visited the local food market , to learn about the vegetables and fruit we would be preparing . I was able to buy bags of the freshest vanilla beans to bring back home for myself and my foodie friends . We were then amen to the families rice padi to learn about rice production , embarrassingly I wasn't aware how rice was grown , my husband loved this part as an engineer , he enjoyed seeing the irrigation , pumping operation. We were then taken to the family's beautiful home where we learnt a small insight into traditional Balinese family life structure.The cooking experience followed , which was very hands on , lots of chopping , stirring , pounding , mixing , all in all we covered 7 dishes ,which were printed in a recipe book to bring home. Puspa is a delightful teacher , personality plus , patient and clear in her instructions.We're cooking 3 of the dishes this weekend for friends and can't wait!Following the prep and cooking we all sat down at beautifully set tables looking out to glorious country views to eat the wonderful lunch we had all prepared , delicious! We were then driven back to our hotel 7 hours later , price wise this cookery class is indeed a bargain.Have no hesitation in encouraging any visitor to Ubud to attend Paon Cooking SchoolThank you Puspa and Wayan John and Jane"

This is an excellent opportunity to see something of Balinese life and also learn something about local cooking techniques. The first part of the class was a not very instructive tour of the food section of the local market; not the highlight of the day. Then a short drive to paddy fields outside the small village of Laplapan, about ten minutes out of Ubud. There we met Wayan who gave us a short presentation about the land use system used by the villagers. It was obvious he enjoyed what he was doing and made us feel very welcome in this beautiful setting.The off to home of Wayan and, his wife, Puspa. The home is a traditional Balinese family compound and whist we enjoyed a welcome drink Wayan and Puspa talked to us about the way a Balinese family compound is laid out and how it works. Very interesting.Off to the lower level of the compound where the cooking facilities are located; a clean and lovely setting.Puspa and her staff showed us how to prepare the ingredients that were going to be used to make the nine (or was it ten) dishes we were going to cook. After much slicing, chopping and pulverizing, the ingredients were ready and we started to cook.There were about twelve people in the class and we all had plenty of opportunity to be involved in all aspects of preparing the dishes. Very hands on and lots of fun.Once the cooking was done we settled down to eat a wonderful lunch in a delightful setting overlooking the forest.Wayan and Puspa are both lovely people who do all they can to make this a truly wonderful experience that is much more than just a cooking class."

I have been to Bali four times now and Paon Bali Cooking Class is one of the best activities I have done in Bali.Puspa and Wayan, the hosts are just delightful. You are picked up from your accommodation and taken to the Ubud Market and meet up with Puspa and the rest of the group. Puspa gives you a guided tour of the market where you see all the ingredients you will be using later for sale. You also see all the general merchandise and clothing that the locals buy. You are not hassled by stall holders as Puspa commands great respect in the market.You are then taken to Wayan and Puspa's village about 10 minutes out of Ubud where Wayan shows you the rice paddies and explains the Balinese rice growing and harvesting cycles, very informative and interesting. From there it's on to Wayan & Puspa's family compound where you are given a lovely welcome drink and the layout of the home and family traditions are explained. After this it is the actual preparation of the food and cooking. There are a number of staff who help with the preparation, instruction and cleaning up.At the end, you get to eat all the wonderful dishes you have helped to create.Complimentary water is provided throughout the tour and class and various teas (the ginger tea with honey is great) and Bali Kopi is also provided. Bintang is available for purchase to have with your culinary masterpieces at the end!The recipes of all the dishes you helped prepare are given out at the conclusion of the class so you can practice your new-found cooking skills at home.The class is suitable for all ages from teenagers upwards, our group included my 17 y/o nephew and his girlfriend and they loved it, not bored at all! The tour/class is fabulous and well worth the 350,000 Rupiah (under $40 AUD), the meal alone is worth that!It is a good idea to book ahead to avoid disappointment as class sizes are limited due to the size of the facilities. Our group size was 12 which is pretty much the maximum; we had a friend who wanted to join us at the last minute but they could not accommodate him. I recommend the morning class as it includes the Ubud Market tour.There may be other more intense, smaller Balinese cooking classes better suited to the hard core foodie out there but Paon Bali is a great all round fun culinary and cultural experience.I can't recommend it highly enough!Enjoy!"

Three of us, two foodies and one not, totally enjoyed the very special hospitality of Wayan, Puspa and their wonderful helpers. \"Paon Bali Cooking Class\" is not the standard cooking class visitors might expect. We began with a morning trip to the Ubud Market and learned much more about its produce, how it operates and its role in the life of Ubud and the surrounding villages, than we had in all of our own earlier visits. We then proceeded to Laplaplan. Wayan's talk about the rice paddies, how they are managed and their centrality to the life and culture of the village was really interesting, as was his information about the steps now taken to ensure the sustainability of Bali's rice paddies into the future. Our next stop was Wayan's home where we were served icy lemon drinks and met his lovely wife and chef extraordinaire, Puspa. Wayan and Puspa shared the story of their own lives together and of how the families in the village live and try to work as one for the good of all. We had walked and driven past so many family compounds and now we were beginning to understand what Balinese family life was all about. And then there was the cooking class. What a fantastic experience. The food handling standards and general cleanliness were extremely high. (Puspa: No one gets BB in my home!\") We learned heaps about the local ingredients and all made a hands on contribution to the most amazing Balinese feast. Puspa made suggestions for substitutions for ingredients that some might find hard to get in their home countries and we received copies of all the meals we cooked to take home. It was almost a full day - 8.15am to around 3.00pm and we were superbly looked after for every minute of it. It was the stand out day of our holiday. Our only suggestion would be that Wayan and Puspa keep the numbers down to around 10 per group, even if this means slightly increasing the cost. There were 9 in our group. That was a good size. The three of us agreed that with a bigger group some of the \"essence\" of the experience might have been lost."

This was not just a cooking class but an insight into the Balinese everyday lifestyle.First we met 'Aunty' Puspa in the market where we learnt about where people do their everyday shopping. We also had the opportunity to try fruits that we have never had the opportunity (or the guts) to try before, with Aunty Puspa showing us which part is actually edible and warning us before we bit into something sour -thankfully! Then we were taken to the rice fields where we learnt about the rice paddy tradition from Wayan and the life cycle of rice. I found it such an eye opener to learn about where rice comes from (I'm so used to seeing only the end product in a plastic packet) and how much work actually goes into producing such a basic food staple. I now realise how much I take rice for granted!After that, we were taken to Wayan and Puspa's home. We were given delicious welcome drinks and further explanation of the Balinese housing arangments/ family traditions -which was made all the more enjoyable by Wayan's and Puspa's sense of humour. Then the cooking began!Firstly, I have to say that the facilities there were immaculately clean, with the staff clearing dishes and preparing ingredients with clockwork precision -so much so, that it was effortless and effective in ensuring that the more tedious aspects of cooking (ie- clean up) did not spoil guests' experience. Everyone was encouraged to get involved and before you know it, we had a banquet!! Oh and most importantly, Aunty Puspa was able to cater for allergies/food intolerances within an instant! No really, there's not many programs that can easily cater for someone who is gluten free, dairy free, nut free and vegetarian, but Aunty Puspa did without batting an eyelid! My mother and myself did not feel at all on the outer or any less involved in the experience. We were given tofu and tempeh alternatives and the food we produced was sooooo delicious!!!!!!!! It was an amazing experience! Anyone wanting to get out of the tourist bubble and learn about how the Balinese actually live, as well as eat delicious food, regardless of how many dietary exceptions you have, DO THIS PROGRAM!"

The class was the perfect way to learn the basics of Balinese cooking: very professional and also fun and entertaining, nice and clean setting, great recipes, authentic and delicious food. And it was more than just cooking as the class provided unique access to a Balinese home and the opportunity to learn more about their culture. A must do in Ubud!"

You get it all, the rice paddies, wet market, visit to village temple, fantastic food and unbelievably entertaining and knowledgable hosts. All this in an authentic local village.

Loved every minute of it from the market tour, then onto a visit to the Rice Fields and then to the home of our hosts, Wayan and Puspa. Lovely couple and quite the comedy act. The cooking session was fantastic, interesting, fun and informative. The food we cooked was the freshest and tastiest we have had and we felt quite the 'Masterchefs'. Everything made from scratch (no packets like we use at home) and the whole cooking experience was a hands on one. Highly recommend this cooking day. One of the most enjoyable things we did in Bali. Wayan and Puspa were the perfect hosts."

I was very pleasantly surprised to find out my cooking class, arranged by my driver was in a village home kitchen not in a restaurant. My delight was magnified as the day progressed. Firstly: 8.15 pick up from my accomodation, just after breakfast. Then an opportunity to puruse the market with someone who knew what was what and her way around.Showing us new and not so new ingredients we would be using throughout our cooking experience. A big plus for any tourist. Yes I am a tourist, but one who loves to cook, shop and eat, so this was my idea of a dream day.Then we left and our delightful driver told us of many wonderous things along the journey, which was a few miles out of Ubud.Next: stopped beside a rice paddy with a couple of other cars with tourists/cooking companions.This is where my journey took on new meaning. We were not just shown & told how a rice paddy operates but the impact of pesticides (now they are almost organically grown) on the soil, but the loss of such a valuable commodity (rice paddies) to the Balinese people, when hotels are built in the food bowl area.(This has now been corrected by UNESCO and is no longer to continue) Wayan was a funny, passionate host who realises that people can make a difference albeit one at a time. He is intelligent man who understands progress but not at the expense of his culture. (I really believe we could learn a great deal from the Balinese people). This was a true learning experience in the field. But the learning continued throughout the day. Not contrived or pushy, infact downright interesting and a real joy to be a part of. Do I sound like I fell in love with Bali on my first visit? Sure I did, what wasn't to love except what tourists have created in Kuta?I digresse, Next: Meeting the amazing team in a most beautiful setting,the family home. we started with a cool drink then a hot drink and both were equally delicious. Then we progressed to learning about the compounds for the entire families. A wonderful introduction to family life in Bali and how it happens. Interesting and a good insight to how life looks in a Bali home.Next: Cooking with Puspa.....wow, 8 courses, I am good but did we have the time and skills to achieve such an extensive menu...sure did...we all cooked, co-operated, laughed, chopped, stirred and learned the basics of Balinese food and cooking. Of course Puspa made it simple, no dishes and the Balinese blender....you will have to see that for yourself.......Next we...all 18 tourists sat down and ate what we had prepared.......Sate, fish, gao gado, yellow curry, salad, Banana and Jackfruit dessert......yummmmmm. The food was amazing if I do say so myself (loved the yellow chicken curry). The company equally amazing and the experience priceless. The entire day was less than $35 AUS, fantastic value in any country. Also a trip back to my acommodation with the delightful Wayan, along the scenic route of course with an informative and interesting commentary. Wow what a day....!!!!!I believe that such warmth and hospitality exists, because the family is passionate about their culture. Well done to each and everyone who attended, spread the word as it is one experience that will stay with me and my family (through my cooking) for many years to come. Thank you in particular to Wayan and Puspa. You and your family and home are not a tourist attraction, you are life in Bali........giving, happy and blessed, I will return thankyou....Lizz"

The food is shown from raw ingredients (also growing beside you in the family garden) to being sliced and cooked and then eaten. You get a chance to have a go at everything and also the final feast is huge. What a wonderful way to learn about true Balinese life."

Hubby and I recently did this cooking course and found it quite good - there were 12 in our group (we did the afternoon class so didn't get to do the market tour). We assisted with cooking a number of dishes and were given the recipes afterwards.Then came the disappointing bit - the lady who runs the class (Puspa) had quite a bit to say about the fact that she needs everyone's support to pay her bills and mortgage etc.Now, I realise that this is Bali and that this kind of thing is not unusual and it generally doesn't bother me as the majority of Balinese do need our assistance. But if anyone does the math - the owners of this business are most definately NOT in this category and to be honest we found it offensive. The class is held twice a day and some reviewers have said there were 20 or more in their groups. At 350,000rp (approx AU$35) per person - this works out to be a hell of a lot of money coming in - and very little outlay except for the ingredients and a couple of staff who assist. And to equate this even further, the average wage in Bali is about AU$140 PER MONTH. I am the first one to give credit to people who start businesses and make a go of it - good for them - but please, don't then plead poor.I'm sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this class for the pure fact that the owners are downright greedy - all I can hope is that they are spreading their wealth around with others less fortunate than themselves."

To call it a cooking class is truly to not give the full sense of the experience as you are instructed about rice growing, Balinese family structure, and of course cooking. And it is all done in the most welcoming of environments as you listen to them instruct and inform while also talking about their own lives; it is truly amazing that such a thing exists that allows a visitor to feel at home with a family like this. As Wayan drive us back to our hotel and I asked where to find a certain cooking instrument, he insisted he would try to find one for me so that I wasn't ripped off in the market. If you are in Bali and wild like a truly authentic couple of hours and a delicious meal, you can do no better than this."

Puspa and Wayan's Paon Bali Cooking Class is hands-down the best choice. From the moment we were invited into our host's home, it was an immersion into Balinese culture and hospitality the likes of which I would have never expected from a tourist concern. Puspa took charge, a great idea when it comes to dealing with students, distributed a welcome drink, told stories, explained facts, and got everyone into a cooking mood. I believe the team at Paon Bali have an instinctive way of matching their personalities to that of the group. The cooking proceeded well, with many photos taken and many instances of laughter. The cooling downpour was welcome, after which we were able to sample the fruits of our labors. I think for myself, someone who has led student trips to many parts of the globe, this was probably the most satisfying experience of all the cultural experiences one can book. The students, initially somewhat skeptical of the idea, ended up loving it and describing it as one of their favorite experiences on the trip. Highly, highly recommended."

Best thing we did - and when we go back to Ubud, we'd definately do this again. Absolutely amazing day!!While the format is probably similar to other classes, what sets this one apart is the atmosphere, the friendly, relaxed, warm welcome and the ability of the hosts to bring the group together.The day starts with pickup from your hotel, and you are dropped at the market for a detailed tour, talking about spices and vegetables that you will be working with later.A short drive in air-conditioned cars and you are taken up through the countryside to the village - with a short stop to talk about the rice paddies which was very interesting.Greeted with a delicious refreshing drink at the family compound, Wayan and Puspa are delightful hosts, breaking the ice with stories about how they met, the layout of the compound, and their culture.The cooking class was great fun - everyone was given different jobs to do and the group worked really well together. We all had turns at cooking different dishes. Everything was clean and hygenic.Needless to say, the food was delicious - and we were all given copies of the recipes to take home with us.I would definately do this class again, it is great value for money and an amazing insight into Balinese culture. If you are not sure if you really want to do this, go ahead and book - because you won't regret it!"

This is far more than just a cookery course, from the moment you step into the market, then to the rice paddies to learn first hand about the fields and the interaction between the villagers, their crops and their neighbours and then to their home where you are welcomed with a 'Welcome drink'. This course is definitely a great experience for both men and women and is a really fun interactive day and good value for money. The meal that you eat at the end of it is really awesome. This is the 3rd time I have done this course with different friends and everytime we have all loved the experience. Well done Puspa and Wayan.... this course is really 'a course with a difference'. I wish you great success with your venture."

Tour of the market, then back in the car and a tour of a rice paddy. We then were welcomed at the home of Puspa and her husband, who gave us a informative insight into the traditions of Balinese culture and Hinduism, Once the cooking started, it was all hands to the pumps, with everyone being gainfully employed chopping, slicing and cutting. We were a large group, about 20 in total, but it still felt personal. Every task was overseen with a smile by Puspa and her team. Together, we rustled up soups, salads, mains and desserts (about 9 in total) which we then devoured round a couple of tables in the kitchen / garden of their house. The food was gorgeous and the instruction was superb. Puspas and her husband are real characters and their warmth and enthusiasm is as plentiful as the dishes we created. As with all other reviews here, I would highly recommend the Paon cooking class."

They explained their home and then we went down to the kitchen and started cooking. There was at least 7 dishes prepared and everyone got to help out all the time. We were kept very busy and then when dinner was served it was fantastic meeting people and interacting with them. There was free water the whole time or beer (15,000rp). Also tea & coffee. The dessert was amazing, loved it - boiled bananas. 350,000 rp well spent, went from 4pm - 8:30pm and we hired a nanny to look after our kids who I would also highly recommend. She did a great job. They pick you up from your hotel and drop you home. Loved both of them, they were so funny and enjoyable. We didn't book, rang that afternoon for the next day which was fully booked so did it the same day. There was maybe 20 people, but the kitchen is large enough for everyone.Oh and the bathroom facilities are in great order too. :)"

Didn\u2019t book until we arrived in Bali and as this course is gaining in popularity it would be advisable to book before leaving home if you are short on time We opted for the afternoon course as not that interested in the market tour. Our pick up was from our hotel in Ubud and was surprised when received a phone call to let us know they were held up in traffic on Monkey Forest Road and would be a few minutes late even Puspa apologised to us when we arrived at her home. After a warm welcome and cold drink from Puspa and Wayan we were taken into the kitchen area which was extremely clean and well set up to begin our journey into the smells and taste of Bali. Puspa very thoughtful asks if anyone has an allergy to any food or is vegetarian or how hot they like their chillies. All the ingredients are set out on display and we are told which dish the ingredients are for and given a full description of each, then it is onto chopping everything in preparation for cooking. Everyone is given to opportunity to work at the various workstations, we had 11 in our group and had 11 workstations so everyone had a task. When everything is chopped to Puspa and her staff\u2019s satisfaction it is onto cooking the first dish Clear Mushroom and Vegetable Soup, 4 people are given this task while the rest of the group supervise. In a few minutes we all seem to be sitting down having a bowl of this delicious soup, then it is onto cooking the remaining courses all of which we thoroughly enjoy eating. Everyone agreed that it was entertaining and the best food we had eaten in Bali. Puspa, Wayan you are great hosts well done."

First you meet at the old palace in the centre of Ubud,followed by a short food and general market visit,by car to a rice growing area for a briefing and then on to the operators private home in the hills for cooking and lunch.You start at 8:30am (which if coming from Seminyak is a big ask) and finish around 2pm.Our group of eight joined about another twelve from all over the world.The instruction is hands on - everyone is involved in defferent roles all the way from initial preparation to eating.We enjoyed the whole experience and I have a few observations.At USD 35/person its very cheaply priced for what it is; six hours was a bit long - four hours of cooking would have been better;the market at Ubud is poor and disappointing; water and beer is available - Coke would have been nice. Puspa who runs the school oozes personality and is delightful - her support staff equally as good.A visit to a private home was worth the money in itself.Transport provided was first rate.This is an experience I would recommend although its more mid level family food than top draw.A great way to learn some basic Asian cooking skills.In our case we spent a lot of time and money getting from Seminyak to Ubud which on reflection we would have been better to consider a more locally based cooking school in Seminyak.For us we wanted to see Ubud anyway so it all made sense.We had a great day!"

We stopped at a rice field where the process of rice growing was explained. We were greeted at Puspa and Wayan's house with a cool drink and an explanation of a traditional village layout and traditions. I had imagined a cooking class might be an indoor demonstration. This was so much better! Held inside the traditional village complex with open style pavilions and lots of open to the outdoors areas, we could still look out into the Ubud valley next to us. The class was 'hands on'. There were multiple chopping stations and 3 or 4 of us at a time chopped the gulangal, garlic, chilli, and other ingredients ourselves. We could participate or observe, however we liked. Around six dishes were prepared - Sup Jamur (mushroom and vege soup), Bumbu Kuning (yellow sauce), Kare Ayam (chicken in coconut curry), Sate Lilit Ayam (chicken on sticks), Gado Gado (veges in peanut sauce), Jukut Urab (coconut and snake bean salad), Pepes Ikan (fish in banana leaves), Tempe Kering (tempe in sweet soy sauce), then dessert - Kolak Pisang (banana in palm sugar syrup).

Unlike a pizza or the ubiquitous nasi goreng, genuine Balinese food is not widely available at the usual visitor haunts. The best Balinese food we had was at Villa Semana in Ubud where we stayed and by taking matters into our hands and signing up for a Balinese cooking class with Paon which we found out about on Tripadvisor. Gosh! When I called Paon, the classes were fully booked and we could only get on a class 3 days later. To avoid disappointment, I suggest booking in advance. So off we went to visit the local market and rice paddy fields to get to know the ingredients we would be using later on. It was quite a large group (14 of us from all parts of the world) but by the end of the class, we were all having fun and exchanging contact details. The star of the show is, of course, Puspa, the gregarious and engaging chef herself. She cajoled, teased and bullied the group (especially the lazy men like myself) into trying their hands at making what turned out to be a wide variety of surprisingly tasty Balinese dishes. Puspa has a nice dedicated kitchen set up for the cooking classes at the back of their family home overlooking lush green hills. I particularly admired her traditional wood fire cooking area and the fact she makes her own organic cooking oil! With the help of her friendly staff, everything proceeded smoothly under her watchful eye. For me, a day well fed is a day well spent. Definitely recommended."

Pupsa, a former cooking teacher, then taught (and helped us) prepare the most wonderful dishes for our lunch.

I've done rafting, snorkeling, mountain biking, elephant rides and been to 3 very chic weddings and eaten and some of the best restaurants in Bali but this experiance would be hands down without a doubt the most enriching, exciting and fun Experiance we have had in Bali.Meeting Wyan in the village fields to explain how rice is grown and harvested and how the village works was exciting enough for me but when we were welcomed into his home by his wife Puspa with a welcome drink, I knew we had picked the right Experiance for us. Wyan explained the traditional Balinese house and howmit worked and symbols of their religion, this really showed how beautiful and welcoming the Balinese people really are. We then moved out to the cooking class area where Puspa's 2 assisatants were busy preparing for the class, more drinks and into the class we dived. Luckily enough on this day it was just us and another couple which made the whole Experiance even more personal and we got more attention.Another highlight of the day was the storm that came in and caused the power to black out for quite some time this didn't bother Puspa and her team one bit as we were now cooking like \"Bali Before\" it really added to the experiance with the torches and candles coming out. The ingredients are fresh and tasty, coconut oil hand made that day, techniques traditional and all very hands on, with absolute guidance by Puspa and her assitants all the way.Sitting down to eat all our handy work in the outside dining room in the storm was just amazing and the food so tasty.We look forward to our next trip and this time taking our friends and family to meet Aunty & Uncle for another fantastic class.We can't recommend this Experiance enough a must do ubud Experiance."

Easy hands-on participation made the experience practical and memorable. Enjoying the many yummy Balinese dishes we prepared topped it off! Be careful of being persuaded to take a class in Kuta. Many operators, taxis and concierges try to convince one to consider the cooking schools in Kuta, but I am delighted that we stuck to our guns and enjoyed the day at Paon Bali cooking school.Authentic, humorous, clean, fantastic!Book in advance, they are quite booked up in season."

My girlfriend had to convince me to do this, but I'm glad she did as it was great fun.We started by going to the UBUD locals market to see the vegetables and spices we would be cooking with then got take to the home of Puspa (wife) and Wayan (husband) in a village set near the rice paddies of UBUD. Surprisingly, there were 4 or 5 other guys there who all enjoyed it. We got taught 9 different recipes including how to grind the spices from scratch and everyone was heavily involved in the cooking. They are very conscious of food safety and refrigerate all of the meat and fish so the tourists do not get sick.The best bit was the eating - we all enjoyed a 9 course meal - fantastic meal - one of the best we had in Bali (compliments to the chefs). All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Puspa was very entertaining also.A great experience."

Big Thanks to Wayan and Pusps for a wonderful day, absolutely worth taking the time to enjoy this experience. We were told about this cooking class by relatives who know Wayan and Puspa and we were keen to learn some new cooking skills. We thouroughly enjoyed learning about the different ingredients, the rice fields, techiques for traditional Balinese style cooking and to be so welcomed so warmly into Wayan and Puspa's home compound was just unforgettable. We were told to make ourself at home, to be relaxed and to enjoy our day, for this we feel priviledged.The lovely chef who helped us with cooking we remember him as 'Mr one for luck' made our day funny as well as imformative. We made some unbelievable dishes which we were able to have for lunch and they tasted fantastic.Wayan and Pupsa have a beautiful home and fantastic cooking skills, all their staff are also very helpful. Nothing is too much problem. We learnt so much and have used our new knowledge quite a bit since we have been home. Please please please just go and see for yourself, you will not be dissapointed."

I only had 1.5 days in Ubud and was really looking forward to my cooking class...it did not dissappoint!Very well organised and professionally executed programme with a generous touch of warm hospitality from the funny and knowledgeable Wayan and his very lovely and culinary Goddess of a wife - Puspa. We started our day with a visit to the local market learning about local spices and ingredients used typically in Balinese cooking. Followed by a visit to the Padi fields in the village where Wayan and Puspa lives. The expanse of the padi fields against the clear blue skies was a sight to behold.Wayan and Puspa warmly welcomed us into their home where our cooking class was to be conducted. I was greatly humbled by their generosity in sharing their home and culture and wanting to keep it alive for all to experience. Their passion and love for what they do emanates through every little task that they perform.Puspa clearly very comfortable conducting the class and deftly experienced around the kitchen made everything seem so easy and everyone in the group gets a go at preparing each dish from scratch to finish. Her wonderful kitchen helpers moved around effortlessly preparing the ingredients and getting them ready for us to literally make a mess of, and helping to clean up after. The luscious greenery and foliage makes a beautiful setting as we cooked and learnt the art of Balinese cuisine in the wonderful open kitchen within their backyard. 99% of the ingredients were prepared from scratch and i loved that there were no modern kitchen equipment and everything had to be made by hand...and indeed with love and passion that Puspa imparts her knowledge to us.The food was absolutely divine! Definitely an experience not to be missed and i would go back again for another class in a heartbeat!"

I felt very \"at home\"... relaxed and able to ask questions when needed/wanted to, no pressure to do anything I didn't feel comfortable with. Learnt about the dishes (including the Balinese way of grinding, mixing and cooking) and also a lot about the local way of life. The visit to the markets and the rice paddy also added to the experience. Group of about twelve so a great place to meet other travelers and plenty of time throughout the class and whilst downing the delicious and tasty dishes to get to know each other/have a good laugh.

We chose Puspa and Wayans' class by chance, and boy was it a great decision to join. We were first picked up at our hotel, and taken to a rice terrace in the village to learn about rice production there. (only briefly, not enough to make you yawn!), then taken to the teacher's own home in a village in Ubud, where we were greeted with refreshing drinks and the lovely Puspa. She and her husband Wayan are comics as well as chefs, and introduced us to their Balinese home and lifestyle in a very entertaining way. We were then treated to coffee and tea, and mingled with the other people in our class, who were wonderful. We then learned about the core ingredients of our meal, and proceeded to prepare and cook together, each person getting a different communal task. I had taken other tourist cooking classes in Asia, but the communal and relaxed feel of this one really stood out; we cooked everything together as a group, most of us with beers in our hands! There was non-stop laughter, and when all of our food had been prepared (time flew during the process), we had an excellent dinner together. The food itself was delicious, and I am very happy to now hold the recipes for everything, especially the delicious Gado-Gado. Puspa is an excellent and spirited teacher, never missing a chance to make us laugh and feel at home in her home. I would recommend this class to anyone of any age or cooking ability!"

Then on to Puspa and Wayan's home for a fantastic, fun cooking class where everyone gained hands on experience preparing and cooking the ingredients. There were about 10 in our class and we all enjoyed a delicious lunch of our own cooking. For all the fellow obsessive hygiene nuts in Bali, I have to say I was a little hesitant that the class was not being held in a stainless steel hotel kitchen but I should not have worried. Hygiene was a top priority with hand washing, hand sanitiser, plastic gloves, aprons etc. Every aspect of the class and facilities were professional and spotlessly clean. Puspa is a delight and her staff fantastic. A great experience we would all thoroughly recommend."

Four of us went to cooking school this morning and when they first told us they were taking us to the market, but not buying any food, we were disappointed. We have been to Asia many times and were familiar with most everything in the market. But the woman had a way about her that was fun and by the time we got in the van to head to the home of the owners of the cooking school, we were anticipating a good class. First, we went out in the rice fields for an explanation of the village, the rice and the area. Then to the home, which was a beautiful compound but not over the top. Puspa & Wayan each had a little talk with us, offered us welcome drinks and then we headed to the kitchen. We were a fairly big group of people from all over the world and soon Puspa had us chopping frying and grinding by hand. It is impossible to describe how good the eight dishes we made were, but let's just say, if you have the opportunity to go to their school, don't miss it. We left with printing clear english recipes for the dishes, an offer of extra bottles of water, and transportation both ways was included. So much fun & delicious, what more can you ask for?"

We went as a family my daughter who is nine and loves cooking and my son who is twelve. I was so amazed at how my son got right into the whole experience. He really enjoyed the day. The hosts were so happy friendly and explained every step in detail. You actually got really involved in the whole thing from cutting up the ingredients to cooking everything. Finally you get to sit down to an amazing banquet with everyone else to eat all the dishes. The day starts with a trip to the markets then a stop at the rice fields to find all about how the farmers pick the rice and get it ready for eating. The kids had a chance to bash the rice stalks and then sift the rice to get rid of the husks.You are then taken to their home and are made to feel like part of the family. The whole tour takes about five hours. The price is very good for what you get.I would recommend this cooking class for anyone who loves food and wants to learn about how to cook Indonesian food. The hosts are great dealing with children so the tour is a must for families. There are a lot of cooking classes in Ubud at the hotels which do not give you a real introduction to how people live and cook in their own homes. The hosts really cared about cleanliness in preparing the food.Do not think about do it. You will love it like we did."

The welcome is genuinely warm - somehow Puspa and Wayan manage to make you feel like this is a family occasion they've planned all year, rather than something they do all the time.

Next a quick trip to the rice field to learn a little about rice growing, and then onto the family compound. This is the best bit, as you see how the Balinese live, and come to understand a little about Balinese family life, told in a very amusing style. Your hosts are a real family, so you get a genuine experience, without some of the polish of other tourist cooking classes. The cooking is done in the backyard of the compound which is lovely, clean and open. The food is fantastic, with a selection of simple dishes that give you a great foundation for Indonesian cooking back at home. Thank you Puspan, Wayan and the whole team for a great day!"

Wayan is a proud man of stature in his own right, with a wicked sense of humour and Puspa is also fun to be with as she imparts with her very extensive culunary secrets.

I love cooking, especially finding new ways of cooking to get new flavours and dishes so took the chance to take this course while I was recently in Bali. In a nutshell the day involves a trip to Ubud Market, a trip to the local village and rice paddy with explanation about how the village operates including the family units, dispute resolution and so on, which was fascinating. Then you're taken to the home of the hosts - or the family compound, this is explained over a welcome drink and then you start with the food!Overall it's several dishes - a few mains, sate, soup, some salads and dessert. You get a copy of all recipes at the end.To me, it was the perfect amount of cooking versus not cooking. Everyone was assigned some preparation tasks, then the dishes were cooked sequentially with 3 or 4 people from the group cooking each meal under instruction and others helping with the additional ingredients such as soy sauce, palm sugar or seasoning. We stopped briefly for the soup starter then continued with the main courses which we sat down to eat as a group, which was pleasant. Meanwhile the class helpers were preparing other foods or tidying up. Ginger and Lemongrass tea and Bali coffee were offered before and after the cooking and all through bottled water was available free.The food was delicious and somehow even more enjoyable based on the fact that as a group we had prepared it all. I'm excited to see how I get on with the recipes on home turf.I'd happily recommend to other Bali visitors.Another aside, I had to arrange transport from my hotel to Ubud, and the Paon Bali people organised this for me. The driver was flexible enough to allow me the extra time to stop in Ubud and take a look around before heading back to my hotel. Great on the flexibility and much appreciated."

We were collected from our hotel by a very nice young driver and taken to Ubud where we met Puspar. Her wonderful warm smile instantly made us feel very welcome. We walked the market and were then taken to the rice paddy and learnt a little about all the commodities offered at both places. We were then taken to their private residence and boy did we cook! When we were told exactly what we going to do I wondered how we were ever going to pull it off but there was a very nice group of local people to assist us and we managed to put together a very lovely meal with their help. Our group are vegetarian and we were guaranteed 100% vegetarian and it certainly was. Unfortunately as we were about to eat an terrible storm broke and Wayan was quite worried about us getting wet but we were fine he put down the bamboo sides and fussed around making sure we were all kept dry, in fact it added to the whole experience. Everywhere was beautifully clean and well ordered it was just lovely to be in their own home cooking!Thank you so much Puspar, Wayan and all of your staff and driver.For anyone out there wondering whether or not to do it, I would say, take the plunge, it is just a lovely day."

She introduced us to the local spices and produce. On the way to her house, we had an unexpected stop in the rice fields, where her husband (Wayan?) provided a great introduction to Bali rice farming. Upon arriving at Puspa's house, we were warmly greeted as if we were old friends. Wayan explained the how and why of a traditional Balinese home orientation. Once we entered the kitchen area, Puspa explained the menu, showed us all the ingredients, equipped us with aprons, and put us to work. Most of the work was done by her excellent support staff, and we were allowed to do as much or as little of the food preparation as we wanted. Every sense was sated. Paon Bali Cooking Class is one of those rare offerings where expectations were greatly exceeded. We now consider Puspa a friend, and look forward to a 2nd visit for the \"2nd visit\" menu."

It proved to go beyond the expectations of 'just' a cooking class. The group was larger than I expected but it worked really well, everyone was able to chop, grind, stir etc some people didn't want to do the hands on which was good as they didn't have to. I greatly enjoyed the hospitality of the owners having the class in their own home, it felt so much more personal because of that. I'm sure I'll do the class again next time when I'm in Ubud."

If you are looking for a Balinese cooking experience where you can learn where to source and how to use the ingredients, then prepare an array of delicious dishes in a clean, comfortable welcoming environment this cooking class is it. The value and experience for the money is outstanding.Husband and wife Wayan and Puspa, who run this class have all the elements for an authentic balinese experience. Our group was met to begin the day with Made who walked us through the local Ubud market and explained the ingredients we would be using, she answered all our questions and expertly guided us. After a short van ride we met with Wayan at the village temple where he explained some local customs and then talked us through the rice growing process. An extremely entertaining and charming man. We then were driven to Wayan and Puspa's house and were made to feel at home immediately. Wayan and Puspa introduced us to some of their family customs again with entertaining charm. Together with their competent staff we all chopped, stirred, ground, mixed, sliced, tossed, fried, boiled and prepared 8 wonderful dishes. The information imparted included the substitutes and alternatives in order to adapt the process which was very helpful.The results were truly amazing, every single dish was delicious and we all felt as though we had produced them.The facilities at their beautiful home met our needs well, undercover areas for cooking and dining within their lovely garden and access to a clean comfortable bathroom added to the overall experience. In addition, nothing was too much trouble, unlimited access to bottled water was encouraged and demonstration and explanation of additional recipes and techniques were no problem.I had only been back from holidays 1 day and have already made 2 of the 8 dishes which my family (with a 14 and a 16 year old) have enjoyed.All of our group felt strongly about recommending this cooking class."

I had no idea what I was in for, and, frankly, I was a bit skeptical of how much I'd enjoy this activity. However, I was proven wrong by Pupsa and her husband (what a charming couple, by the way)! Our day included a visit to a local market, where we got to try local fruits and meet some of the local vendors. Although the rain was pouring rather hard that day, the trip to the market was great, as we got a taste of what life might be like for some of the locals.After going to the market with Pupsa, we met her husband, who showed us the rice fields. He even provided us with the communal aspects of rice growing, which was really interesting. Finally, we were taken to Pupsa and her husband's home, which is a traditional Balinese home (meaning, multiple generations live on the property, in addition to the presence of a temple). Although we did get to participate in much of the cooking, Pupsa really simplifies the process so that you have a chance to really enjoy yourself (and you don't spend the entire time cooking) - you get to talk to the other parties participating in the class, you are offered drinks, and you get to taste your creation.For those of you looking for a hardcore cooking class, you may be disappointed. However, for those of you looking for a fun experience and a taste of local life, I would highly recommend Pupsa and the Paon Bali Cooking Class!"

Where we started off with amazing welcome drinks which were so refreshing. Then after some laughs we headed into the backyard to cook & learn. The view is mind blowing, and wow what a place to sit & have lunch with new friends. The boys LOVED it, so if your worried about your partner like I was - dont be!!! It was a fabulous experience & there was not a thing we would ask Wayan & Puspa to change about their cooking class. It is a memory that will last forever and the meal was FANTASTIC!!!If you want to know what you will be cooking you can email them prior to attending & ask what the menu will be.Thankyou Wayan and Puspa for such an experience and I miss you and your beautiful Bali already!!! We will be recommending your class to all.TIRAMI KASI Tam & Sam"

The value here is exceptional, paon pick you up from the hotel and take you to their amazing outdoor kitchen at their family home amongst the hills of ubud 600m above sea level. We had an 8 piece menu with amazing curries, satay and tempe and tofu. The class is very well designed and the group cooks as a group, taking turns at different things such as prep, cooking etc instead of everyone cooking their own meals. Once done, you sit down for a magnificent feast overlooking the hills. The family who run this are so nice, I had a bad headache when I got there and they were very caring, offering me tea with ginger and honey and water, which made me feel right at home.All in all a magic experience and one we would do again and again. Just terrific. And they give you all the recipes to try at home. Can't recommend highly enough."

BUT the experience we had in our cooking class was awesome. We have 10 people in our session, all with different needs, some vegetarian, some nut allergies, and then there was me, the team of staff ensured that my food did not come in contact with the items i was allergic to, they had alternatives to everything. As all of the duties of chopping and cooking of the food was shared amongst everyone, they still ensured i was made part of this experience. The food was awesome, everyone at the table tried my dishes, and were quite surprised to the amount of flavour it had especially given the main ingredients are from the onion family.I would recommend this cooking class to anyone, it does not matter if you have allergies or are just plain fussy, the food was fantastic, the atmosphere was awesome and it was an experience that i would recommend to anyone.Give it a go, you will not be disappointed... :)"

We were picked up from our hotel and were taken to the market to meet up with the rest of the group. It was a good size group as there were 7 of us. Being the low season for the tourist in the area, we thought that was a good size, not over crowded. We went through the market, learning the Balinese fruits, vegetables, herbs etc. Then we were taken to the rice paddies to meet up with the boss, Wayan, who then proceeded to explain the process of their rice harvest and ceremonies. After a few 'Balinese' 20 minutes, we were taken to the house for the cooking lesson. The 'house' comprises of few 'houses' on a plot of land which has at least a couple of generations living there. The kitchen was well structured for the class. Everyone of us has participation in preparation for the menu. Puspa was informative and good in giving instructions to guide us in every step of cooking each dish. The entree was well timed before we proceeded to the main and then the dessert. We have ample time to interact with each other and generally we all have a great time. At the end of the cooking class, we were given the recipes of what we have learned to cook. We have thoroughly enjoyed our time at Paon Bali and would recommend it for any person with or without cooking skill. Note to self: do not bite into raw nutmeg."

I didn't expect to cook a lot so I didn't leave disappointed but I got to do more than I was expecting. I'm a chef by trade so I didn't care if I did a lot, I just wanted to watch and learn more about their basic techniques. I enjoyed the early morning guided tour of the local Ubud market, it was very interesting. I was the only one who tried any of the sweets being offered in the stalls - I think the others were wary of Bali belly or something but I was glad I did. Then onto a rice paddy where Puspa's husband Wayan explained the rice growing and then we were welcomed into their home with a beautifully chilled drink! We were shown how to make coconut oil, given a small tour of what some of the ingredients look like while it's still a plant and then we got chopping and cooking. Our group were not as keen to cook so it gave me the opportunity to jump in more which was fine. It was hot and I totally understand. There is a clean bathroom and they offer unlimited free cold bottled water. You can purchase a beer for only 15,000IDR ($1.50!) too. Our meal included soup, curry, salads, satay and much more and even a dessert. It was the best Balinese meal that we had on our trip and someone else said so too. What impressed me the most was how well they treated my 2 yr old toddler. They watched and played with him (he played with their kids) for hours and even fed him, all without charging me which is why I gave a large tip because they were so warm and welcoming. I really felt that it was one of our best days in Bali."

I managed to escape the tourist route (although this cooking class is a popular tourist activity) to spend some time in a quiet village just a few minutes outside of Ubud\u2019s commercial area. The tour appropriately began at the market where Puspa met us and introduced us to local produce and ingredients. Nyoman, Puspa\u2019s husband, met our group at the farm where he gave us an introduction into village life in Bali. In Bali, every villager is given a patch of land to farm but farming, as an activity, is communal. It was harvest season and some of the rice stalks were just reaped. Ducks roamed freely, pecking at stray grains. The highlight of the course, of course, is the cooking class with Puspa. She introduced us to local ingredients and showed us the proper way to prepare them for cooking. I had my first taste of tempe, which I now love!

You help prepare some of the dishes, with half of the work done by the participants and most of the cooking is finished off by the Paon staff. You get enough of an idea of the cooking processes, but no minute is wasted, so when you are eating your food, the Paon staff get ready for the next course. Given the time constraints I think this is a good solution as you get enough hands-on experience to have an understanding of how the cooking process works. I just left the table and had a look from time to time to see how the cooking was progressing and asked lots of questions. This course is different to the Casa Luna cooking course as it focuses a bit more on general Balinese cultural aspects and has slightly more hands-on action. Casa Luna focuses more on theory. You are also cooking in a beautiful environment, overlooking a beautiful valley and rice fields, so in that respect it can be more classified as a 'tour', not just a cooking class. Recipes and cooking style and experience are different enough not to feel as if you are doubling up if you were to visit both cooking schools. If you can, attend both!"

I like that we were able to try these different foods as part of the tour as it is not something I would normally do. We then head up to the rice fields and Wayan gave us a quick 5 min (15 min Bali time) explanation on how the locals live and how the grow their rice. Very interesting and Wayan has a wicked sense of humour. Then its to Wayan and Puspa's family home. Wayan and Puspa gave a brief rundown on their homes and family history. We move out the back into a lovely outdoor kitchen, magnificent views and the tables are setup up with an array of wonderful vegetables and fruit. In total we cooked 9 dishes. Awesome. At the end of the class they give you a copy of all the dishes you had created. Hopefully I can recreate at home. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone who enjoys cooking."

There were 5 other attendees which made for a very nice small group. Puspa and Wayan are contagiously enthisiastic about their home and their cooking. I enjoyed the visit to the market, the visit to the rice paddies, and the cooking. All six of us had the opportunity to pitch in and help with the chopping, mixing, and cooking. It was just enough participation to be fun and not to be work, The end result was delicious. I recommend this activity for a fun day in Bali."

The conditions did not deter Puspa our host and she even managed to get the driver to find umbrellas for those in our group (around 15) who did not bring one.We huddled around listening to descriptions of spices and condiments at stalls, what they are used for, how much to use and how to use them. Some of us purchased some fruit and bakery items from the markets and Puspa helped us to speak with the owners of the stalls for this. It was a great experience.Off to Puspa's village and a tour of the rice paddies which have been in the family for 100 generations. Puspa's husband Wyan told us about species, growing, stages and harvesting. Then what is done with the rice after that. He even spoke about village life and the way issues are dealt with, discussions are had, decisions are made in the village.We were then taken to Puspa and Wyan's own home - an immaculate series of pavilions and temple. We were advised about the family living structure, family housing compound and how families make decisions / sort out problems etc. In other words, the social fabric of Balinese life. It was absolutely evident to me that this is something a non-Balinese person could never do anything but talk about. This was real true life experience being shared.Drinks abounded - from the hand made ginger tea from the garden to the beer and bottled water - it just kept flowing. The recipes were plentiful and we even made our own cold pressed coconut oil on the open fire stove to use in the cooking of dishes. We tended the mortar and pestle to pound the spices for the paste, chopped copious amounts of vegetables, spices and condiments, stirred, tasted, enjoyed the stories and each others company. Through it all, we inhaled the amazing aroma of what we were creating for our lunch. There were 9 dishes in total.Puspa has a few helpers for the group including a chef to enable a large number of people to be catered for. These people are all willing to answer questions and contribute to the learning experience. They blend into the group and are part of the tour.I cannot recommend the Paon Cooking School highly enough. It was by far the best activity I did whilst in Bali - I also did an Eco-Cycling tour which was up there too but this was amongst Balinese people willing to share their culture with others.It is a pleasure to write a glowing review for Puspa as I believe she has made a good business out of something that she absolutely loves to do - cook and socialise!!"

We took our teenage children, one sick with bali belly. They fussed around her, trying to make her comfortable. In a country where wages are very low, I feel that people that work hard with an honest, friendly & caring disposition, should be rewarded for their efforts. Do not hesitate, if you are considering a cooking class, book with Paon, you will not be disapointed. Best day in Bali so far."

Didnt tell the family until the day before because I knew that they would greet this with cries of dismay, having zero interest in cooking. However they all got into it after a few minutes of sulking and enjoyed the opening tour of the markets as well. Our hosts were charming and amusing and made such an effort to make everyone comfortable that they were won over. They chopped, pounded spices and cooked admirably and ate with great enthusiasm despite the heat of the day. I would recommend these guys, they try very hard to make sure its a good day and I felt they earned every cent plus saved us having to buy dinner (we were FULL). A lovey day.

These two are absolutely amazing and share such beautiful passion for each other and their family. They apologised for being a little sad as their 'King' (Wayan's father) had passed away only the day before. They talked about their family life and how they met and were married...

Being strict vegetarians, I was skeptical of Puspa being able to cater to our requests. But she did! It began with several emails to her explaining our requirements and also my apprehensions/ reservations. Pushpa was very prompt and patient with her replies, and assured me that we would cook only veg dishes. She accommodated us in the afternoon session. And were we in for a surprise!We'd agreed to be picked up at our villa, but our plans changed, and she had arranged for us to be picked up at the Ubud market. The ride was pleasant, with her nephew giving us a short guided tour of the market, as we drove to the family's paddy field, where Puspa's husband Wayan received us. He gave us a history of his village, about growing paddy, the irrigation systems. This introduction over, we drove to Wayan and Puspa's beautiful home, where they have their cooking school. A welcome drink greeted us as we got off our car, and while sipping that cool refresher, Wayan took us through the family 'temple' and explained the architecture and belief behind building Balinese houses a particular style! It was VERY interesting getting to understand their culture from a local! About 15 minutes later, we were introduced to Puspa, who greeted us with another refresher - lemongrass tea and ginger with honey! She took us to her cooking pad, which was quite something else! Set cozily in the open, with a separate area for cooking and dining. This is where the surprise came in - my sister in law and I were the only ones at the afternoon session!! This was not something we expected, and it came as a wonderful surprise. A private class, it was!We set to work immediately, and when Puspa said 'hands-on' cooking, she meant every word of it - from chopping every tiny bit of ingredient, to pounding it over in the traditional mortar-pestle, to the actual cooking! She had her Sous-Chef help us though. We began cooking by around 4:00pm; by 9:00pm, our husbands and my nephew joined us for a delicious Balinese dinner! My personal favourites were the vegetable soup, and the boiled banana and jackfruit dessert!It is an experience that I cannot recommend enough. Puspa was a teacher at a cooking school prior to setting up her cooking school. She is an AMAZING teacher - taking us through the nuances of each ingredient, and techniques - and an even better cook!! If you are as serious and as keen on cooking as my sister in law and I were, Paon Cooking Class is the place for you. If you are there to enjoy a relaxed evening out in the open, and feast your senses on a wonderful cuisine while enjoying the sunset, well, Paon has it all for you!Thank you Puspa and Wayan, for a very memorable experience!Cost: Very reasonable. Includes pick up and drop at your villa/ hotel Experience: One for a lifetimeDishes/ Cooking class: Delicious. And definitely picked up a few techniques"

There was one other family with us (a father and two teenagers) so there were lots of opportunities for chopping but most of the work was done by the helpers. The food was excellent and we were given copies of the recipes to take with us. We did not follow the recipes while preparing the dishes though so I do think it might be hard to replicate the food at home as the owner kept adding a little bit more of this or that etc."

It takes place in the couples home and you hence learn about Balinese life and the importance of home and family. The pick up and drop off was most welcome as was the Bintang! The course itself is highly entertaining and we laughed as well as learned. Also helped that everyone else on the course was very friendly and good company. I can't recommend it highly enough."

Firstly it is actually at Puspa's & Wayan's home,so you actually get to see and understand more about the Balinese way of life. The food you cook and eat is the best meal we ate in Ubud it was a true Balinese experience. We had many laughs together and my 17yr old daughter and I will go again next year. You truly should take the opportunity I promise you will not be disappointed."

They warmly welcome you into their home, their kitchen and their world - and what a special place to receive an invite! It's a terrific learning experience and so much fun to be a part of.

We then returned to the family's compound to get into the cooking. We learnt how to cook several meals, after which we sat down to have a wonderful lunch. The family who run the school were lovely, very entertaining & we had a fantastic experience. We would consider going again next time we visit Bali, chosing another menu option for variety."

We also saw ducks cleaning up the rice fields and leaving droppings to add to the fertilizer. They are trying to go green as much as possible. Progress is being made as many locals exress the need is now. Arrival at the school in their home was being greeted by a very excited dog. We spent the day learning several dishes and knowing the spices used. We were able to taste along the way and had a lunch like nothing I have tasted in Bali the past week.

The reviews explain very well the events of the day and Puspa and Wayan are gracious, wonderful hosts, and the food is, well, even better than you expected because YOU have played a part into bringing it to the table . Puspa and Wayan understand well that there's more to tourism than museums, hotel pools, and the beach. They combine Indonesian culture with Indonesian cooking and make the \"event\" one well worth your tourist dollar. Besides, you've come this far, most likely because you have a bit of curiosity of this island you've landed on, and while you're here, you have to eat so why not enjoy the local cuisine. Combine the two and voila, Paon Bali Cooking Class. The added bonus is you get to enjoy the company of many other folks from around the world who are also here to enjoy the same experience. Being around a big table sharing a wonderful meal together, one you have helped prepare, is priceless. Note that is a hands-on experience though you are not required to help; you're free to watch and enjoy. In essence, you make of it what you want. In 2010 I took cooking class offered by Casa Luna and it was mostly a demonstration; there were way too many people in attendance to keep you focused on the demonstration and we all couldn't fit around where the demonstration was taking place. The food was just as good but the cooking experience was of no comparison. Bon Apetit!"

Then it was back to their family compound for cooking and eating. Wayan once again gave us a good explanation of the Balinese family organization in his family's compound. Then Puspa took over with the cooking session, first of all setting out all of the ingredients for each of the eight dishes we would be making. We helped with the chopping and stirring through each of the dishes - lots of hands on opportunities as they keep the group to a maximum of eight.

I contacted them by email when we arrived in Ubud and asked if we could learn some different dishes second time around! No problem - we did a very different menu and again enjoyed every minute of our time with these special people.We went to an afternoon class this time - so no market trip - which if you haven't been before is not to be missed! Puspa and Wayan have done some enlarging of their kitchen since we last visited them and the improvements have given them much more room, both for cooking and enjoying the meal you prepare afterwards. The whole session is very professionally run and is definitely very \"hands on\" - the food you prepare is delicious and you get a recipe book to take home so you can cook the dishes at home.We would most definitely recommend Paon Bali as a great place to spend half a day while you are in Ubud (or elsewhere in Bali, as pick up can be negotiated from other towns). Keep up the great work Puspa and Wayan - you are fantastic people and we hope to see you next time we are in Ubud!!"

Didn't think I would enjoy a cooking class on when on holidays but Wayan and Puspa were delightful, giving us an understanding of Balinese life and how to cook great Balinese dishes. They were very welcoming to there home and would recommend this to anyone. Word of advice though, if you are based in the south part of the island (Kuta, Seminyak etc) give at least 1 1/2 hours to travel to Ubud as the traffic in Bali is horrendous!"

Puspa is so great and energetic. I loved every minute of this class. After the market we went up to the rice patties near their house. Wayan gave us a lot of great information about the village and the land before taking us back to their house for the class. Every item we made was so good and full of flavor. We made soup, sauces, tempeh, tofu, tuna, chicken satay, peanut saunce, gado gado and a banana dessert that wasn't over the top but a nice finish to the meal. The pace of the class is perfect and broken up just enough. We were all involved start to finish in their lovely outdoor kitchen. If you are thinking at all about taking a cooking class while in Ubud.....this is the one to take! This was honestly the best meal I had while in Bali. Thank you Puspa for a wonderful day."

I visited with my boyfriend but unfortunatly had to leave half way through as we were not feeling well. But we were so impressed with how lovely the couple were that I wanted to say thank you and to compliment them. We only were able to attend the morning which involved the market trip. So fascinating and the lady who showed us round was very knowledable and clearly knew lots of people there so we could try all the fruit and veg. We then went just north of Ubud to the paddy fields and her husband taught us about the fields and harvest. Really interesting and he was very friendly and engaging. Then back to their charming house where you learn about how families and homes work plus get to sip on some lovely refreshing drinks. all wonderful. We had to leave before the cooking begun but it looked great and we were most disappointed to miss out. I would recommend."

The recipes are easy to reproduce once you get home, and you will just have a great day with these funny and beautiful people.

We spent a day with Puspa and Wayan at their cooking school outside Ubud recently, and it was one of those rare days one knows will change the way you view things forever. Having been fans of Balinese and Indonesian cooking for ages, but never able to figure out how those tastes and textures are brought into being, our visit did one crucial thing: it made it clear that it can indeed be done. You see it getting done, you help to do it, and there it is. The magic is not reduced, but made accessible.Even if this is not your aim. the lunch you end up eating is worth more than the price of the class."

Well I can't say enough great things about the morning we just had!We were picked up at 8:30am and brought to the Ubud Market where we met the rest of our classmates along with a few of the staff from the PMCC. We spent roughly 45 minutes walking through the Ubud Market, where a woman explained and pointed out the various cooking ingredients we would be using throughout our class. Although they do not buy from the market themselves and organically grow their produce, it was neat to see the break down of Vanilla, tempe, tofu, peppers, chillies, and even the fruits they use.Following the Ubud Market experience, Wayon, the owner of the school brought us to his villages rice paddies where he explained how they grew and harvested the rice. Wayon did an amazing job of not only speaking about where and how rice came about, but gave us an incredible insight to Balinese families, village traditions, and a cultural perspective unlike I had gotten before. Wayon brought us into his home, where we also met his wife, and co-operater of the school. They shared their home with us and explained the layout of traditional homes there.Next the cooking class. It was very interactive and hands on. We chopped up our ingredients, mixed them together, boiled them, sauted, and brought together an incredible meal of various flavours and textures.Our menu consisted of Clear mushroom and Veggie Soup, Basic yellow sauce, minced chicken grilled on bamboo stick, chicken in coconut curry, veggies in peanut sauce, coconut and snake bean salad, steamed tuna in banana leaf, deep fried tempe in sweet soya sauce, and boiled banana in palm sugar syrup.It was amazing! We were proud of what we could create from scratch. The veggies were from their personal organic garden, the meat bought from a producer. The kitchen was spacious, clean and the equipment in excellent shape. The staff friendly, knowledgeable and helpful with answering questions. Their home was the perfect place to experience a Balinese Cooking Experience!"

We then went to their family compound (in a little village outside Ubud) and spent an enjoyable day preparing, cooking and eating. Puspa and Wayan were excellent hosts. I turned up sunburnt and they plied me with fresh aloe vera and a refreshing welcoming drink. We prepared 8 dishes, all of which were delicious (easily as good if not better than the best I have eaten in Bali) Everyone had a different favorite dish so there is something there for everyone. There were 8 of us in the class which was a good number of people and meant we were able to get involved in all the stages of preparation. This was a highlight of my trip. It was so much fun that I went back to do a second class the next day. If you are thinking about doing a cooking class I can highly recommend this one."

There our guide took us through the various spices, herbs, food and then pointed out that they do not buy their meat from the market. This is to make sure that no one gets Bali Belly from the class. It was then on to the rice paddies where it was explained how the village looks after the rice crop etc.Once we got to their house they took us through the compound and explained the different rooms which you never get to see from the road.Then on to the cooking. As there were only four of us it was hands on for every course, the explainations were very good and clear and it was lots of fun. I do like cooking asian food at home and this class gave me so many good tips to help me and the receipe book is easy to read and understand. We got to eat what we prepared, they did the cooking, which was good on an open fire, and there was so much food we could not get through it all. They had no probelm in letting us take photos as we went. Do take sun screen as some of the prep is in the sun, and a hat would be good to. Good walking shoes for the market as there are some steep steps. I managed with the help of my husband as I do have a minor mobility problem."

Wayan picked us up at our villa around 8:30 and took us to the market where we met others from the group. We quickly moved past the tourist areas of the market to the fruit, vegetable, spice, and meat areas. We stopped at various stalls for a short talk about local ingredients, complete with tastings.After the market, we departed for a short drive to the rice paddies. We received a fascinating overview of the cultivation process, the tiered canal system, and the village division of labor. Wayan was a very informative and warm guide.From the rice paddy, it was another short drive to Wayan's home. We received a welcome drink along with an introduction to Balinese family life. We spent the heart of the day enjoying cooking and eating a half-dozen recipes. We chopped, stirred, pounded, and prepared everything from the basic sauces to the final dishes, all at Puspa's expert direction and a steady supply of bottled water and Bintang beer.After we completed all the preparations, the 15 of us sat at two large outdoor tables and feasted on our creations. Although the class was billed to last from 8:30 to 2:00, the great conversation and delicious food pushed our departure time closer to 3:00. There was no rush by our gracious hosts.If you have any interest in learning about Balinese culture, playing a bit in the kitchen, and eating some amazing food, this one is a no-brainer and, at about US$40 per person, an amazing bargain."

The venue for our cooking school was just perfect - a traditional Balinese house compound. We learnt a lot about Balinese families as well as the ingredients we used in our cooking experience.

Five of us did the afternoon cooking class, which began with a morning trip to a side of the markets we hadn't ventured into, then a break (which we predictably spent shopping) before being picked up to learn to cook. The class takes place in the home compound of Wayan and Puspa, who are welcoming, charming and very funny - none of which changes over the whole evening. Puspa and her helpers introduced us to the ingredients, set us chopping, mixing, stirring and eating, all the while maintaing a stream of informative patter and showing traditional cooking methods - including options for vegetarians. The whole group sat down to eat together which felt very festive. We ate our 3 course meal, breaking in between to prepare the next - and to digest a little to make room for more. Eating food we'd helped to prepare (noone could make that many dishes in that time on their own!) as the sun was setting and welcome to stay late (after which they dropped us back at our villa), we had a wonderful time and would recommend this class to everyone. It is head and shoulders above the cooking classes we saw in action at various restaurants and hotels. 6 stars if it was possible."

This is an excellent day and must-do for anyone spending time in or around Ubud. Our hosts were funny, kind and went out of their way to make the day a great and hassle-free experience. Starting early (but not too early!) we enjoyed a tour of the Ubud markets, a trip out to the rice paddies to learn how rice is cultivated, then to the family home where we were treated to an insight into the way local families live. After that, of course, was the cooking class itself.What was particularly impressive about the class was the ease with which every taste and ability was catered for. In our class there was a vegetarian, someone who couldn't eat onions, and someone who couldn't eat spicy food. These potential difficulties were dealt with brilliantly - alternative dishes were prepared seamlessly and no-one was made to feel like they were causing a hassle or any trouble at all.The food itself is delicious and at the end of the day you receive a copy of the recipes needed to cook it at home. You'll also learn about the Balinese garden and many of the ingredients to make it easier to replicate this style of cooking yourself. The class includes transfers to and from your hotel (or anywhere else nearby you want to go) and beer, coffee and other drinks are available during the class."

All the reviews are pretty much spot on so I won\u2019t repeat it all again\u2026 Sure, the food is great and the day is fun but meeting Wayan & Puspa and being so warmly welcomed into their home was the highlight of the day. From the first minute of meeting this dynamic and entertaining couple, you instantly feel both welcomed and humbled. As Wayan explains on entering their home, you are honorary family for the day and both he and his wife along with their support staff, make sure that you feel part of the family experience for the duration of the course.From the tour of the Ubud market, you are then taken to Laplapan and to the local school for a quick tour before then being invited into the family home for welcome drinks, a brief background into Balinese tradition and culture and then a day of cooking. I note some negative reviews on here about the length of the course \u2013 yes, it does take a while as all of the dishes are prepared from scratch (including the coconut oil) in the traditional manner, so pack some snacks just in case you get peckish. We also felt a little unsure about the school tour \u2013 we were unaware this was part of the proceedings and weren\u2019t quite sure what to do so do note that this is part of the package, albeit for only a few minutes. All in all, I learnt more about Balinese culture and tradition in this morning session than on four trips to Bali combined so for me, it was worth every penny.The food was tasty and Puspa was happy to advise on less authentic substitutes to use back home; a full copy of the recipes are provided at the end to take home which was great. If you want a really hands-on, highbrow cooking class, this may not be for you but if you want to be part of a family home whilst learning some of Bali\u2019s most well-known dishes (chicken satay, chicken curry, peanut sauce, steamed fish, sambal etc) then you\u2019ll enjoy the day - you\u2019ll also make two new wonderful Balinese friends in the process."

Maybe an idea to do this early on in the trip as we'd been to the market but hadn't seen all of it and all it has to offer till after this tour. They split the group in two to at no point did we feel we were losing out due to being part of a big group. Afterwards they take you closer to the village outside Ubud and Wayan explained how they grow rice and why they are trying to go organic. Wayan and his wife Puspa who leads class are characters themselves and it is worth going on this course just to meet them. How they do this day in day out with the energy they showed I have no idea. Afterwards they take you back to their home and explain the layout of Balinese homes and families. This is done in a very relaxed environment and both are full wit and smiles. After you begin to cook and learn the basics of Balinese cooking. To be honest you don't do so much cooking, but you do get a good overview. You get fed and watered well before the main courses are served and I can say all the food was the best we experience on Bali. If you think Balinese food is not that good get yourself on this course as it is as it should be, if not better."

We cooked all the traditional balinese dishes one usually sees at the restaurants such as gado gado. We cooked ourselves a hearty lunch and Puspa even packed up the leftovers for me to bring back to my sister at the only. The only minor quibble I have is that the events of the day went by rather slowly, but I guess I'm just too much of city dweller. Overall, a wonderful experience. Highly recommended!!"

Puspa (aka Honey-Bunnee) and Wayan are wonderful hosts together with their staff of assistants.Wayan provided exceelent insights into Balinese familty culture whilst Puspa provided \"hands-on\" authentic Balinese cooking recipes and techniques. My wife and 4 other ladies participated in the cooking classes whilst I kicked back, Bintang at the ready chewing the fat with Wayan.It turned out to be a great day finishing with an extremely tasty meal prepared by the cooking \"students\"I would can sincerely recommend the visit to UBUD as being well worth the ride from (in our case) Legian."

This group size of 6 seems considerably smaller than the average sizes I have read about on here, and as a result, we had a very personal experience.Wayan and Puspa gave us a fantastic welcome to their home, a great introduction to Balinese life and some fantastic menus to take away and try at home.It is true that you don't do a great deal beyond chopping, pounding, stirring and tasting but the menu is so extensive that I think it would be difficult to do anything more in the time.For me the value of this course was to see some of the techniques and be able to take them away to recreate at home.A wonderful experience to be recommended to any foodies."

I have been to Bali many times now, and been to several Cooking Classes in the many locations- PAON Bali was the next one to try while we were in Ubud. This was the most informative and pleasant day I think I have spent in Bali. Wayan and Puspa are a real joy to be near. The local and cultural information, the passion about their village (Laplapan) and the farming practices were all a highlight to a fantastic occasion in June. I loved the chance to learn more of the information on family ,communities, the house and compound- and then the cooking WOW I loved every bit of this day. Puspa is a delight as a cooking teacher, Wayan is funny and passionate about heritage and culture. I can only hope that this venture in tourism just keeps getting better and better as more people discover PAON. Please stay as you are, and dont get as commercial as other courses in Bali. For an informative chat- ask Wayan about the charity work he supports also. Very moving. I will be going back with a group next time- as I want everyone to know that there is more to Bali than Bintang and beach! By the way; a great lunch is included too."

I decided to go on this \"cooking class\" because I met a group of international tourists who had been on the course on their very first day in Bali. I have lived in Ubud for 5 years and it seemed to me that they had understood the essence of Bali in a very short time. I was NOT disappointed. With Puspa we were in the hands of someone with a love and passion for Balinese cooking; we chopped vegetables and blended spices, helped cook several dishes, at EVERYTHING and came home with easy to understand recipes.Her husband Wayan gave us background on the most precious, vital things to know about Balinese culture - why the rice cultivation system still works, despite inroads from tourism, how every Hindu home and village is constructed, how they are ensuring the future of their children's education and the return of their farm land to organic methods.Honestly, I discovered so many things that I had not quite understood, although I have lived here for five years. And the food was amazing!!"

Our day with them was the highlight of our week in Bali and exposed us what life is like among the Balinese today--not simply the tourist cliches. The food was fantastic, probably the best Balinese food we ate during our week, and everyone who attended the class (about 10 people) played an integral role in preparing it: from chopping garlic and shallots, to stir frying tempeh. The day begins at Ubud's bustling and aromatic market. Then a visit to the rice paddies outside Wayan and Puspa's village (Laplapan) and then a tour of the town school. Afterwards, we gathered at their beautiful home for lime juice and a brief lecture on Balinese family customs and religious traditions. Most of the day, though, was spent cooking and learning to prepare the essential dishes in Balinese cuisine. I found the instructions in preparing Balinese peanut sauce and the basic yellow curry sauce particularly helpful. I simply cannot understand those reviewers who accused our hosts of focusing too much on Balinese culture and not enough on cooking. For shame! Cooking and culture go hand in hand and it is impossible to appreciate one without the other. Needless to say, the majority of the day was spent around the cutting boards, stoves and hearth. By the time we returned to our hotel, the four of us were dead tired from all of the time on our feet. Tired yes, but also very full and inspired to continue exploring Balinese food and culture at home. Three cheers for Wayan and Puspa!"

We booked all by email, Wayan was very prompt in replying. Cost was 350,000 rupiah plus 300,000 rp (per car) for pick up and drop off from our hotel in Kuta.The day started with a trip to the Ubud markets, yukkkkk. Thankfully Wayan assured us they did not buy their produce from there. We then took a trip up to the villages rice paddies and Wayan told us all about the importance of the rice paddies to the families and villages. It was really interesting to hear about.We were then taken to Wayan and Puspas house, there a nice welcome drink and some more chatting about their house and how the locals live. We then went into their outdoor kitchen (spotless) and after a tea or coffee we started on the prep for our lunch. There were about 12 of us and all were given chopping peeling slicing of the various ingredients. Then a demo of how to make coconut oil on the wood fire, how to use the giant mortar and pestle, then we finished off making the mushroom soup. Delicious!!!Then we all chipped in for a bit of stirring to finish off our other dishes - we made 8 in total. You dont make your own dishes in this class its kind of like shared cooking, with Puspa instructing and helping. The food was gorgeous, fresh, tasty and different, we loved itFinshed at 2pm and were taken back to Kuta. the class was suitable for anyone, young or old. You dont have to be a good cook to participate.Wayan and Puspa were lovely and its nice to know that they are both very generous donators within their village"

Our guide introduced us to local spices, produce, flowers and baskets for offerings and clothing. Then we were transported to some beautiful rice paddies. Wayan explained the differences in the sizes of the different patties, the canal system, etc.After our trip to the rice patties, we were transported to Wayan and Puspa's home. We were greeted with a refreshing lemon welcome drink. They spent 10 minutes explaining the structure of a typical Balinese compound and their family history. The discussion ended with your choice of tea or coffee.Finally, we made our way into the kitchen. Puspa explained what we were going to cook and immediately put us to work. Our group of 18, simultaneously worked on different dishes. Puspa and her staff were extremely organized and made sure everyone had enough to do. After we completed the prep work, Puspa explained the ins and outs of a Balinese kitchen. We were even given a demonstration of how to make coconut oil.The meal we made was delicious and we had a lot of leftover food. Trust me-you will not need dinner. All in all we made 1 soup, 6 entrees/salads and 1 dessert. For 35 USD, this cooking class is an unbelievable deal.

Once picked up by Wayan we were driven to village rice paddies and given informative talk on the workings of the village and irrigation by Wayan we were then driven to & welcomed into the beautiful home of Wayan & Puspa with a refreshing drink for one informative fun filled arvo/evening. Puspa and staff were excellent hosts and teachers and made sure everyone participated in the preparation of a scrumptious bali feast which we all sat down at the completion of cooking and enjoyed after our fun filled night we were given copies of the recipes This was a definate highlite of our trip and would return to do it all again a big thankyou to all at Paon Bali Cooking Class"

A place that you get to know people from different countries, get to learn the culture of Balinese Family and d cooking of course. Puspa and Wayang were a good host, made us feel like we know them for so long or rather like a family. The cooking session itself was great, the dishes were great, enjoying our lunch with nice panorama surrounding, it was awesome...miss them now...So much laughter and Joy , really highly recommended place to visit in Ubud!"

The chef Wayan picked me up from the hotel, the drove to the local markets to see how its done. Luckily they have already purchased their food as it is pretty amazing what they sell and the conditions the food is often in. More of an eye opener more than anything else. Then we go up to Wayans village and he shows us around and how the village operates, how each family has a rice patty plot and how they cultivate it. They you actually go to Wayan and his wife Puspa's home to cook! You are taught all about the culture and cooking, it is really quite amazing. they are both very funny and accommodating and make sure you get involved in the preparation of the meals. A very well though out day and it does go all day so if you were thinking of a quick half day it is not. You also get a lift back to the hotel. All of this for half the cost of a nice meal out back at home. I could not recommend anything higher in ubud if looking for something to do."

Puspa and Waylan take you on a wonderful journey that includes Balinese Cooking in their home (where you are a 'participant' not just an \"onlooker\") but the day begins with a trip through the Farmers Market to learn more about the food and spices that you will be working with; a stop at a rice field to see and hear about how complex something so small as a grain of rice is to plant and harvest; then finally being a guest in their home.I learned so much about Balinese culture in these few hours, not to mention meeting wonderful people.This makes a trip to Bali a unique and memorable experience. I will return and urge everyone that really wants to learn about the culture to do the same."

Superb tasting.Ten of us in the class began at the market, then learned about rice in the fields near wayan's home compound, then learned about family, religion marriage, and the family temple and family life in the gorgeous village and inside the lovely compound of wayan's that includes his great uncle who is nearly a hundred years old.He and his wife were welcoming and the set up in the back for the cooking is great. You each have jobs of mostly chopping, then several demos, then you get a chance to help prepare which ever dish you like....all were yummy.Steamed tuna, gaddo gaddo with divine peanut sauce, chicken curry with this miraculous yellow sauce you grind up and put in every dish almost, long bean salad, satay in the Balinese style cooked ogre coconut husks, fried bananas, rice and tea. It is very well paced and extremely tasty and if you do not eat it all, can even take some home...it is very very reasonably priced too and they pick you up.I made back the fee by going back to the market to the vendor they recommended and buying some things the next day.Loved the staff who helped, the food, the magical setting, meeting the family..loved it all."

The food we cook was absolutely delicous, at the end of each course I just looked -wondering how I managed to create something so wonderful.Even if you not into cooking then I would say just go for the food. Its worth every penny. Also we found out that the husband teaches english to the village children (60+) every weekend. If I had known that before I left for Bali I would have taken some of my son's first books with me to help him. So if you haven't left for Bali yet maybe you could take some first language books with you for him."

The shopping experience was wonderful - seeing herbs & spices difficult to find or afford back home in plentiful supply, the whole chickens being cut up by a cleaver, fresh fish in baskets, temple offerings being put together & the fresh fruit & veg was amazing.The class itself takes place in their home, after a visit to their rice field which was being cultivated by nine hard working women. The meals our group cooked were a culinary delight & easy to prepare with each person being given a task from chopping temeph & tofu to slicing shallots, garlic & other vegetables.All in all, the most fantastic cooking class I have done to date & I would thoroughly recommend to all. As a vegetarian, there were plenty of choices & the hosts were nothing short of hospitable. I wish them both every success with their venture."

We next traveled to their house, where we were given a welcome drink and an explanation of a Balinese house (fascinating!). Then we began with a tour/explanation and then started cooking. The class was large and different people were charged with different tasks. I enjoyed this because we were able to mingle with various groups but it may not be ideal for some - I did not see all parts of any dish, so if that's your goal you may be disappointed.Then we sat down to eat - wow! The food was just terrific and the table was full of interesting people; I really enjoyed the conversation of a very varied group.Wayan and Puspa were lovely hosts - one of the people in the class had been injured in a motorcycle accident, and Wayan administered first aid so graciously! Wayan drove me back and welcomed me to visit again to his house! I had hoped for a great cultural experience but got so much more due to Wayan and Puspa's incredible graciousness - they made it a day to remember."

The family was very welcoming and kind, they taught us a lot about the culture, rice and some of the basic ingredients included in the cooking. But, all the cooking I did was chop garlic, chillies and stir a pot. I was not a big fan of this, particularly because I can't help compare it to other classes I've taken where I learned about the ingredients, cooking style and was required to make all of my own dishes... If you are looking for a casual view into Bali culture and have a fun large meal with lots of people, than this is great. If you are looking for a proper cooking class which will increase your cooking skills and awareness of Bali ingredients then.. maybe try elsewhere."

That was a great experience! We then went to the house where the cooking class would take place. The owners of the class (and house) were extremely welcoming and made you feel right at home. Since we did the afternoon class (started at 4pm) we (my husband and I) were the only ones, which made it even better because we got to do all of the cooking! All of the ingredients that we used were fresh and some were even organic! I loved that the kitchen was kept very clean all of the time. We made about 7 different dishes that were all very good and manageable to make once I came back to the States. My husband is not a big fan of cooking but he even had a great time!

The variety of dishes cooked is excellent. We had a little production line going in the gaden kitchen and Puspa explained excellently how the dishes were coming together. Everything was delicious and it was a truly wonderful experience and day out. I would have one small criticism - there were 18in our group, and I feel that was slightly too many - a few people didn't get a chance to do much more than a bit of veg chopping - and eating of course. I think a limit of around 12 would be better, but that's being really picky! Highly recommended, and you get to take all the receipes away too in a beautifully presented folder."

I am so glad that I did. Visiting the market was not just about identifying spices, vegetables and fruit, but also to share an insight into offerings and even how to get into the fruit without getting it all over yourself! There was a little bit of discussion about the rice paddies but I found that other tours gave a more detailed explanation, particularly the Bali Nature Herbal Walk, but the information was complimentary. We also talked about traditional compounds, their layout and composition. Again, other tours covered this, such as the Eco Bali Cycling Tour but it was good to see it from another perspective.But the real experience was the cooking! This was no cooking demonstration, everyone had a part to play - chopping, grinding, mixing, cooking and tasting. I'm no expert but they do get you to work to your skill and interest level. We even had two children on the course and they were given tasks such as stirring and grinding. It really is a class for everyone.The culmination of our endeavours was a feast - and it was worth it! I couldn't agree more that this was the best Balinese food I had tasted and to know that I was a part of it made it taste even better!One word of warning though, they do run on Bali time. A few of us were a bit worried when the pick up was late and even asked our hotels to call to confirm. We needn't have feared though as they did arrive. Of course, by running on Bali time they were patient to take us through everything and didn't rush us out the door to get us back to our hotel by 1:30pm. We got back around 3pm. So if you book the morning trip, expect to be out most of the day.Wayan, Puspa and the other members of the team all made us feel extremely welcome. It was a fantastic experience and I thoroughly recommend it!"

Starting with a trip to the market, visit to the village rice fields and then the 9 course cooking and eating experience, this was a day to remember. Having heard about other cookery experiences form travellers then I would suggest that this is the one to go for. There is lots of information to take in right through the day and if you are not in the mood to listen and take in the culture and traditions of the hosts then stay on the beach; but if you are ready to immerse yourself in the day then this will feature high in your memories of Bali. Our tip is to arrange a one way transfer from the organisers at the start oif the day then take the opportunity to go into Ubud after the school ends in the afternoon; spend 4 or 5 hours cruising the shops and stalls, grab some dinner and arrange a taxi back to your base."

From the time the driver picked us up in Kuta till the moment he dropped us back.Visits to all food markets,rice paddies and information about the family compounds all very interesting>Puspa and Wayan went out of their way to include everybody and offered as much hands on as people wanted to experience.It was a very hot day and they were continually looking out for everyone and made a point of speaking to everyone individually and finding out a little about them as well as sharing alot of themselves.I would liken it to visiting a family you already knew ,the friendly banter amongst the staff and shared anecdotes made for a very enjoyable day for everyone ,even those who arent that into cooking.I have noted that other reviewers have thought the class size too large,however ours was 20 people and that added to the fun mix I thought. I wonder if people would be happy to pay alot more for a guaranteed small class size .We also gained alot of interesting travel info from our fellow classmates whom we wold not have otherwise met.Thankyou Puspa and Wayan and all your great staff for a wonderful day and we will think of you when we try and recreate your dishes!"

Great meal!My only criticism would be that they need to be careful about numbers. There were 20 people in our class and I would have enjoyed it even more if there had of been a max of 10-12 people. So my advise would be to ask how many bookings they have for the day you want to go. It was also a slightly long winded experience. But I still can't fault it for the food, hospitiality, organisation and experience."

This meant that it wax not as hands on as expected and a lot of people missed out on doing some things. It also meant the day dragged on two hours later than expected, and I had to cancel later plans.Having said that, the food and experience was lovely and I will assume the 'overbooking' was a one-off. As long as the classes are small and run on time, then I would recommend this for a cultural experience."

After reading such amazing reviews, we were really looking forward to our cooking class and taking our new knowledge back to our friends at home.We were picked up at 7am from Legian and taken to the markets in Ubud where we were shown around and given the opportunity to try different fruits and look at the various stalls. This was interesting to see. After that we hopped in a van and headed to the hosts family rice paddy. There we got to see how many people were actually in our group, around 20 not including some young children. We stood out the front looking at the rice paddy for around 45 minutes which was nice, but a little over done. The host was incredibly friendly and welcoming, and continued to reassure us that the size of our group wouldn't impact on the interactiveness of the day. We then went onto his family home where we were shown around and given a cool drink. By this stage we were getting peckish and were more than ready to get our hands working in the kitchen! More waiting, more showing around and more talking. Finally we head into the kitchen. But with over 20 of us there was little to do, we were all put at a chopping station. The group prepared each meal together. Well by prepared I mean, we got to chop or grate an item each. Then they were cooked by one or two willing volunteers and the hosts wife while we all stood around and watched. Given the size of the class we were given little opportunity to be interactive. Standing around watching other people cook grew more and more tedious so most people sat and waited around chatting with each other while our hunger grew more and more. The first opportunity were were given to eat was at 2.30, and we were all ravenous!!!!It truly was a waste of time, as it was not a hands on experience. I would have learned more watching Ready Steady Cook. The class has obviously become so popular that they have increased the class size. I think that perhaps if the class was small it would have been much better. Also, having young children running around and crying did not help!"

We found this cooking school on Trip advisor, booked months in advance and were very much looking forward to the experience promised by its reviews. We could not have been more disappointed.There were 20 people in our group, 10 more people than they should have had. The hosts were friendly and welcoming that was where our enjoyment ended.We were taken to the markets & introduced to some Balinese ingredients, after which were taken to shops and asked if we wanted to buy anything from the guides friend. We were shown the family rice paddies, the host explained how these are run, which was interesting but unnecessary long. It was not at all interactive, the only thing I actually did all day was grate some coconut (which I had already mastered as a child). We went with another couple and met a couple on the day , we as well as all the others in the very large school spent most of the day with nothing to do and gradually becoming more and more hungry.We left Legian@ 7am and did not eat until 2:30pm. I expected to come home & have the knowledge & skills to prepare a beautiful Indonesian meal for my friends and family...but they would be bored with grated coconut.Re-reading the reviews again I cant believe it was the same place, maybe they have become too greedy and increased the class sized beyond their capacity, but it certainly was not something I would recommend to anyone. This was not a cooking school, we learned nothing and wasted a day on our beautiful holiday in beautiful Bali."

From there you stop at his family's personal rice paddy where he explains the process of making rice from growing the plants to maintaining them all the way to harvesting and cooking the rice. \u00a0The paddies themselves are a beautiful green-yellow during March and this was a perfect time to take pictures.After touring the paddies Wayan's wife Puspa was our personal guide through the local food markets where she explained the differences between strainers and hats, spices and herbs, and fruits and vegatables. \u00a0The cooking class itself was bomb! \u00a0Puspa, an expert chef, was very detailed in every step with documentation to accompany every recipe. There was about nine of us in the group and everyone had a chance to participate. I am slightly incompetent when it comes to food preparation and especially onion chopping but luckily there were other staff members to help out. The end dishes were, seriously, the most delicious Balinese dishes you've ever had in your life. There was chicken, rice, curry sauce, peanut sauce, vegetables and dessert beyond this world.\u00a0One of the most valuable parts of the class though is just being taken inside their home. It was really fascinating to learn about the architecture of their house and the traditions of Balinese families. We would highly recommend Paon Bali Cooking Class to anyone visiting Bali!!"

You see what effort and intricacy and love goes into the food, and Puspa and Wayan teach you in a way so it's easily manageable and you can cook it at home.

They have a great sense of humour as well.The actual cooking class was in their home, and with only a small group, it was very good. The food was amazing, and excellent value for money. If you ever want to do a cooking class, this one is a must.The only thing that I would like to add is, that they offer you beer and water, but there was no mention of paying for the beer until the end, so I would think a sign on the fridge saying that the beer is 15,000 rph but water free of charge, would of saved any people embarrassment if they didnt have the cash with them. I am sure everybody would be quite willing to pay for it, as it was cold and very reasonably priced, but just to know that it wasnt included in the lunch would of been nice to know.

We were first introduced to all our other participants from around the world and toured the market, learning all about the different foods, vegetables, meat and spicesWe were transported in an air conditioned vehicle from the market to the rice fields, where Wayan explained some of the history of the rice in Bali and the canal system to irrigate the rice fields\u2026.. along with the day to day operation and the management of the fields.We were introduced to the different ingredients for each dish that \u201cwe\u201d would be preparing\u2026\u2026..chopping, grinding and stirring \u2026\u2026\u2026which made the most amazing Indonesian meal that one could ever dream about.Puspa and Wayan make one feel so comfortable in their home\u2026\u2026. from the first thirst quenching drink to the last cup of tea or coffee\u2026.I enjoyed the cooking course so much that I booked another class for the next week before the end of my vacation\u2026.don\u2019t worry about taking notes as they provide a nice booklet with all the recipes in it.This is a must to do \u2026\u2026\u2026..and when I return to Bali, I will do the course again."

We booked to attend this popular class well before our trip, and I'm so glad we did.On my last trip to Bali I attended a cooking class in Munduk, at a resort there- just me, an interpreter, and a cook. That was fun, but I hardly touched the food and spent most of my time in frantic note-taking.The Paon Bali class was so much better. Puspa and Wayan have a very smoothly running system, and they have excellent planning and people skills.Since they both have admirable English, there was no interpreter needed, and the day's activities flowed smoothly along. The market trip was informative, and I found the ricefield visit fascinating. It also gave Puspa a chance to get the immense heap of raw ingredients assembled!They have an excellent setup at the rear of their family compound, with a lovely open-air kitchen that has loads of space for groups, as well as two open dining areas, sited to catch the afternoon breezes as you eat the gorgeous food you have helped prepare. We enjoyed the whole experience, and there was no need for note-taking, as the students are given a complete set of recipes.Puspa and Wayan have given a great deal of thought and effort to their venture, and it deserves the success it has enjoyed. It is so good to see hardworking and intelligent people like these, both charming and entertaining,doing something they so obviously enjoy. Even for those who are more interested in eating than in cooking, this is a worthwhile way to spend a day in Bali, and very good value."

            "review": "Unlike anything else you'll experience in Bali!. After finding this class featured on TripAdvisor, I contacted Puspa by email through the Paon Bali website and was able to get two spots for one of their morning classes. We specifically wanted to join a morning class so that we could visit the markets. I have been to Ubud many times before and while I am happy nowadays to forgo the crazy atmosphere of the Art Markets in all its hot and dirty glory, seeing them early in the morning when the place is filled with happy locals going about their morning fruit, veg and fresh meat shopping was an entirely new experience! While I don't know how they go about the afternoon class, if you are happy to miss out on your sleep in (we were picked up just after 7.00am in Kuta) then choosing the morning class really is a must!After a really good drive (by Bali standards!) up to Ubud, we arrived at the Art Markets where we were soon joined by Puspa and the rest of the group - two young Australian girls, two women from Alaska, a guy traveling solo from Manhattan, a young couple from Hong Kong and a man from France. We made for an eclectic group but everyone was chatty and open to sharing travel stories and most importantly, a love of food! While it was a bigger group than we had anticipated (and apparently they can have even larger classes during the peak seasons) the social aspect really made the day for us - so don't despair if you end up in a larger group than you expected!Puspa is a real powerhouse woman with perfect English and a beautiful smiling face - she really goes out of her way to make your day fun and educational. The day begins with a tour of the markets, as Puspa explains what the fresh produce is used for, where it is grown and most importantly lets us try the weird and wonderful fruits! We were the only 'tourists' in the market so it was great hearing the Indonesian banter and seeing everyone go about their day to day business - a rare glimpse at real Balinese life in such a touristy area. After the market tour, we were taken to the rice paddies of Puspa and Wayan's village where Wayan explained the incredible process of growing rice the traditional way. His insight is as entertaining as his wicked sense of humour! (Make sure you have your sunscreen on at this point though because you're standing in the sun for a fair while!) Next, it's back down the road to Puspa and Wayan's family home where their purpose built outdoor kitchen is waiting for the sensory overload to begin! The colours and scents are just amazing as every helps to prepare and cook the food. I personally think the class should be renamed the 'Paon Bali Chatting and Woofing Class' as I seemed to do far more of that than cook! - but it is completely up to you how involved you get in the cooking. I did plenty of chopping and grinding and stirring, and then at other times I enjoyed getting to know the other group members and taking plenty of wonderful photos! The final meal is to die for and certainly the best Indonesian food I have ever eaten in Bali (washed down of course with a lovely cold Bintang!). You're given copies of the recipes to take home too so you can (try) and recreate the magic at home, albeit without the wonderful fresh and organic ingredients they grow in their own garden!Puspa and Wayan are just the sweetest couple and you really feel like family by the end of the day - both have so much to share about traditional life of the Balinese, and their cultural insights leave you with so much more appreciation of their way of life. I have been to Bali many times before but never have I experienced a day trip like this before - grab your camera and your appetite and get yourself in a Paon Bali Cooking class the next time you're in Bali for an experience unlike any other!"

I have a culinary back ground & decided I didn't want to be shown the ropes by a European influenced chef ... We decided after great referrals from trip advisor we would chance Paon cooking class... I have to tell you I was not disappointed, It was the highlight of our trip to Ubud (including the surrounding lush rice paddies & undulating mountains & valleys). Our hosts Puspa & Wyan go beyond what you would expect from a regular cooking school. We were picked up on time from our Villa then ushered by a driver (included in cost) to the local Ubud markets. Met by Puspa & shown through with an enthusiastic attitude that immediately had the group of nine in the palm of her magic hands. I purchased 500g of vanilla beans from one of Puspa's recommended suppliers with the suggestion that I should bargain ( well priced) and which I later successfully passed through Australian customs with. We were then whisked of to the the area of Laplapan where our hosts family & village members work their rice paddies that have been passed down through generations. This gave a good insight to how these fields are managed & worked. Then our group were ferried to our hosts family home & compound, After refreshments using bottled water & a brief and some times amusing history of how their life functions we were taken to an area which seemed dedicated to their cooking classes ( spotlessly clean) complete with traditional cooking fire. Our class was informative with local produce & entertaining, followed by a feast of the freshly cooked menu we helped produce.After an entertaining class & lunch with some of our co-hort class members we were offered to feel free to stay on & chat which would have been well pass our due time, however we all decide to say good-bye & be dropped off at our individual digs. Thank you to Puspa, Wyan & staff who all added to a memorable day.. & great Value....."

We were taken through the Ubud markets by Puspa and shown all the different types of indigenous fruits, vegetables, and spices soo interesting! Then we were driven to the rice fields in the Laplapan village and were taught about how rice is grown,harvested, and sold. Then we went to their home and made the most amaaazing food! This is a great hands on class that you are able to learn all about traditional Balinese foods and sauces and ways of preparing food and you eat incredibly yummy food!

This is a lovely area, and lovely people. They offer free transport.If not requested otherwise, newbies will be started on a shawl/wallhanging (a cotton sheet of approx. 150x50cm). This can be done in one day (10AM to 5PM)Widya can also support other wishes; while I was there, there was a lady making placemats and a man making a batik T-shirt.He explained step-by-step what to do, and I got to experiment on a scrap before I started on my shawl. I got to encorporate my own drawing in the decorations, but he also has a stack of ready designs.Both the canting-technique and the stamping-technique are used for applying wax to the work, and the color is added both by selectively painting directly onto the cloth and by dipping. Widya is a caring, outgoing person, who loved to joke with me, and who was serious when needed. Lunch can be brought, or they can order an excellent lunch for quite reasonable prices."

Husband and wife Wayan and Puspa are knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. The whole day was awesome - from the markets, to the rice paddies to their house for lots of learning, cooking and eating.Food is organic where possible and even my non-cooking partner had an great time. Involvement is up to you - you can get in there and chop, fry and mix, or stand back and watch. I am vegetarian and was well catered for. A classmate has celiac disease and was well looked after too. I loved every moment of the day, although Wayan talked a little too much for my attention span, and highly recommend this class. We saw some other classes, but this was by far the most popular and holistic. - If getting transport to the class from out of Ubud beware of the steep transportation fee. Classmates paid 300,000IDR each return from Kuta for the day, organised by Paon Bali. A better idea would be to go to Ubud the day before for 50 IDR in a minivan, stay the night in a homestay for around 200,000IDR, do the course and then catch a 6pm bus back to Kuta or Denpasar etc."

We had a great time and really appreciated the modest price of the course and the fact that vegetarian meals were served. Puspa paid special attention to the vegetarian meal ensuring no cross contamination with the meat dishes.I would definitely do the class again. I offer the following notes on the day not to \"break Puspa's life\", just to prepare her guests so they know what to expect. First, I was under the impression that it would just be me and my husband cooking at their lovely home. The class ended up being quite large - about 15 people. Everyone was really nice and we made great friends, so, in the end this was not a drawback, only different from what I had anticipated. About the ingredients: Although you go through the market and see ingredients, you don't actually BUY the ingredients from the market. Same with the offering. You see them being prepared for sale, but you don't make one (or buy one) and offer it. (This was just a little thing that I was hoping to participate in...). I was interested in this class over the Bimbu Bali class because some of the ingredients were coming from their organic home garden. We did get to see a small garden (mostly herbs and spices) within their compound, but did not get to see any larger garden. In the end I didn't know what was purchased and what was home grown. However, the day was so full adding a trip to the garden might have been too much!As for the cooking, mostly you are chopping and stirring. You can do as much or as little as you like. Puspa has numerous helpers on staff who do most of the labor and can help you out if you don't know what you are doing. However, if you, like me, are looking forward to making your own coconut oil please know this part of the meal is done entirely without student assistance. Before you arrive to the house the coconuts have been prepared. You do get to witness one of Puspa's staff members heating the coconut oil and water mixture over a traditional fire and then separating the oil from the water, but there is no student participation. A final note on cooking: we made around 8 different dishes. At Bimbu Bali they claim to make about 25 (I say claim because I didn't do that course!)In the end we had a lovely day, were stuffed with excellent food, and were worn out!"

She welcomed us and then proceded to walk us through the markets describing uses for different baskets, foods and spices. I love all the colours with bright red chillies, purple eggplants, orange carrots and all the shades of green! We then jumped back in the car and were driven out to their village area Laplapan where Puspa's husband Wayan talked us through how the families co-ordinate the rice fields and how the baby ducks learn to look for a coloured flag so they don't wander off into the wrong fields. Both Wayan and Puspa speak very good english and have a wonderful, playful banter with each other throughout their talks. We are then welcomed to their beautiful home and we have a cold drink and are told about the living compound. The outdoor cooking area is amazing, its clean and well organized and Puspa describes and shows us all the ingredients we need to cook our dishes. My girls, aged 6 and 9 loved grinding up the nuts, garlic, chilli and ginger to make the sate sauce and also helped to cut up tempe and tofu and had the very important job of tearing up the kaffir lime leaves! We then got to sit at the outdoor table overlooking the valley and feast on the gastronomical delights we had created. It was such a wonderful day and I will take my girlfriends back when I return in March. So if you are looking for a holistic cooking school in a Balinese home set in a traditional village then I can highly recommend Paon."

We met Puspa our host and the other people that were doing the cooking class. The markets were a great way to see local produce and goods that were sold. Puspa told you eveything about the markets and gave you a free taste test. After the markets we went to local rice paddies were we meet Wayan, Puspas husband. Wayan explained how the rice is cultivated and how the land is used it is a great way to learn about the rice paddies. Wayan kindly answered any of your questions. We were then taken to Puspas and Wayans home, they made you feel like you were at your own home. Wayan explained the traditional balinese household what each part was used for and some other interseting balinese traditions. After the talking was done it was time for some cooking! The outdoor kitchen is fantastic lots of room and really clean. I thought my family and i were just goin to watch how to cook balinese food, but we also got to get involved preparing and cooking the food.

Whats even better is that everyone there loves food and is so keen and interested in learning what ingredients are used and how the food is cooked, this makes you feel so relaxed and comfortable. After the food was prepared we got to sit back and relax while Puspa and the other cooks cook your amazing lunch. I meet so much differnt and interseting people. The food was amazing and you know exactly what is in the food because you helped cook it! If you are a vegetarian or you do not like something Puspa will make somthing seperate just for you. Puspa is a great host and cooking teacher and you learn heaps from her. If you love cooking or food this is a must do! This is a food lovers paradise! Its a great experience and a really good day. Puspa and Wayan are incredibly kind hearted people who provide you with a fantastic day, entertainment, information and of course cooking skills! If you are visiting bali you have to do this! Thankyou so much to Wayan and Puspa for inviting my family and i into your home teaching us so much and giving us a great day with heaps of cooking skills! Thankyou for the best dessert ever puspa!

My husband and I decided to stay one night in Ubud to do the cooking class as we read great reviews and our expectations were exceeded! The trip around the market is informative and you can even try Balinese fruit and sweets made locally. The visit to the rice paddy was interesting as it gives you insight into how rice is cultivated. Then off to cook! Wayan and Puspa were extremely welcoming and made us feel at home in their house. We cooked 8 dishes and everyone gets involved which is great! The best part was sitting down at the end and enjoying food you have helped to make. It is so satisfying and we were able to take copies of the recipes home with us! All ingredients were fresh and they used mineral water to make the dishes, so no need to worry about getting Bali belly!I have recommended this to friends as it is a must to do when you go to Bali."

They shared with us some of their traditions, before inviting us to roll up our sleeves and get busy chopping, slicing and stirring as we cook a banquet of traditional Balinese food. Along the way, Ibu Puspa explained to us the nature of Balinese cooking and the ingredients we were working with.

My partner and I visited the Paon Bali Cooking School at the beginning of January, and can say that it was definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Bali. Upon being picked up in the morning by Wayan we were informed that the other members of the group had cancelled due to the bad weather and that we would be the only two for the morning class, so we would be given a private class for around $35 AUD each! Firstly we were taken to the Ubud local market where Wayan showed us where the locals shopped for produce - very interesting side to the otherwise tourist trap of Ubud market. Wayan then took us to his village where we were taken to the rice paddies where we were given an explanation of how rice grows, which was very interesting. Then the main attraction - the food! Puspa greeted us at their home in Laplaplan village and went through the dishes we would be creating, from basic sauce to tempeh and Pepes Ikan (tuna in banana leaves). All the food was extremely hygenic, using bottled water for all cooking, and the end result was absolutely delicious - the best authentic Balinese food we had the whole trip! If you're in Bali definitely give Paon a go, you will not be dissapointed."

The Paon Cooking Class was recommended by a friend, and we're so glad we booked. Wayan's driver collected us from Sanur (and hour's drive away) and took us to the padi near Laplaplan, where we were met by Wayan. Wayan is the most delightful host: he took time to show us (my husband and two teenage girls) the padis and explain how rice is planted & harvested, and how the community shares much of the work and water to keep the local economy spinning along. Next we drove to Wayan's house in Laplaplan village. Puspa was not able to be with us on this day, but Wayan and his amazing chef Nyoman took care of everything. As this was a dinner class, we didn't go to the markets, but instead had a very comprehensive tour of the padis, and then a thorough guide to and explanation of each of the shrines in the temple part of Wayan and Puspa's house. We were very interested in this and Wayan took plenty of time to explain the details. In the meantime, Nyoman had prepared the dinner ingredients, ready for us to commence cooking. Nyoman took over at this point and delegated a chopping or slicing job to each of us. We all participated in preparing a great range of dishes, and \"basic sauce\" to make spicy mushroom soup, gado gado (FANTASTIC), tuna in banana leaves, chicken curry, vegetables, tempe, and jackfruit dessert.All this takes place in Wayan's beautiful outdoor kitchen and dining area overlooking a lush valley. Just magic. We had plenty of time to chat with Wayan during dinner, and felt completely at home. Wayan made us feel like very welcome dinner guests. Thanks for one of the most memorable holiday experiences our family has had!"

The day was fantastic, from the local markets in the morning to being invited into the beautiful home of Wayan and \"Aunty\" Puspa, everything felt genuine. If you are contemplating doing a cooking course in Bali, we can't recommend this enough. Only thing to be aware of is the classes are relatively large, our group turned out to be around 15 people. Not a negative but something to be aware of up front (in case you are expecting it to just be the two you, which we were!!)."

Starting with a visit to the local's market we perused spices, veggies and fruit. I was introduced to the Mangosteen and I will be dreaming of this fruit for a long time. I had a special request to make sambal matah and they picked up the fresh ginger flowers to make it. Vegetarian's are welcome and lucky for us the other 2 people in our class were also veggies so it was no problem and we made an incredible vegetarian curry. Other highlights included tuna steamed in a banana leaf, homemade coconut oil, long beans and tempe. Puspa and her husband were friendly and informative.l immediately felt at home in the kitchen and we all were chopping, grinding and cooking shortly after we arrived. The rain came down and the delicious aromas filled the air and then we filled our bellies with an incredible feast. I highly recommend this class and the entire experience was delightful."

Puspa is a lovely teacher and a great educator and coupled with Wayan they make a perfect team!The candleit dinner in which you cooked yourself is such a reward and is almost as good as the 5 star restruants in Bali!

It turned out that I was the only person that signed up for that day, so I had the complete attention of Wayan and his chef the entire time. He picked me up around 9am and the first stop was the local market. Nothing too earth-shattering, but it was really helpful to \"see behind the curtain\" of Balinese daily life. He also gladly answered any question I had. After the market, we went to the rice paddy in Laplapan Village, where Wayan explained how a village operates, including the leadership, communication among the people, how emergencies are handled, etc. His English is superb, by the way.There was a slight technical difficult that morning, so I didn't get to actual cook anything until 3pm or so. But Wayan was extremely apologetic about the delay, and it worth the wait anyway.It was me, the chef, and Wayan in the open-air kitchen at his house in Laplapan Village. There he has a garden where most of the vegetables and herbs are grown. The kitchen equipment was decent; better pots/pans and knives are customary in the US, but obviously the equipment was more than sufficient. The ambiance was impeccable and gorgeous.We cooked the following dishes: sweet and sour tempe; clear-broth chicken soup; steamed fish in banana leaf; chicken curry; Indonesian version of Bananas Foster; and several more. The directions were a little rushed at times, even for just one person, so I can see how it might be difficult to catch every detail in a class with 4-6 people. But I managed to write down some pretty good notes and get some good videos and pictures. Wayan also gave me hard copies of the recipes, though some had errors in them. There's plenty of time to fill in the blanks if you miss anything too.Then I ate the excellent food, and I can't wait to cook it at home. After eating, Wayan and I spoke about the various initiatives he participates in: providing school supplies and shoes to some of the poorer students in Bali; educating the village about litter and the environmental impact; and a variety of other incredibly impressive initiatives.I can't stress enough how valuable this experience was. I hope Wayan reads this and remembers \"Jay,\" and I hope you get a chance to visit the Paon Cooking Class in Bali. Get out of the tourist trap and do it."

This is very informative and again you gain a little insight in to the workings and local customos of the community.On arriving at Puspa and Wyan's modest home you are given a cold drink, the structure and lay out of the typical Balinese home is explained, and the cooking part of the day begins.A brief introduction to Balinese/Indonesian cooking ingredients and a walk through the yet to be fully established vegie and herb garden gives an insight into the ingredients that will be used in the days cooking.We were a large group of nine. There isn't a cooking station for each person, or even a pair. Previous reviewers state that Puspa gives evey one a job. Mine was to seperate the small healthy looking lemon basil leaves from the ones that wouldn't be used for cooking. My friend chopped and diced vegies.There are two hot plates where we crowded around to watch someone deep fry Tempe. The process was suddenly halted as they had not filled the gas bottles. We all didn't get the opportunity to prepare the chilli componant as they had forgotten to re stock food handling gloves.If you are not a cook, and want more of a demonstrration then you will enjoy this. I prefer a cooking lesson where every one makes a small portion of each dish. Yes, I understand time constaints, not every one can distil pure coconut oil, or grind spices for hours. Maggi powder stock was used, as well as diced chicken breasts. Not traditional in my experiences.The cooking is to western standards, and as well caters to the western palate. You are given a cook book at the end of the day. It is a bit of a mish mash, poorly set out and laking in quantities required to create the dishes in the book.Don't get me wrong as I am sure all of you Paon fans are hissing at this review. It is a nice day out, plenty of food and a great price. These guys are so successful in what they are doing. Going by the other reviews they are doing a great job. I think they are in danger of growing too fast and perhpas the small cooking groups are a thing of the past given the popularity.I would like to see more traditonal dishes made and infact Puspa was almost looking a little bored with it all. Talking to Puspa It appears to have been the same dishes over a long period of time."

After looking on Trip Advisor we decided on this one at Ubud as it seemed the most interesting.when booking our class, I heard a rooster crowing in the background and thought \" this is unique, it must be good\" and we were not disappointed.More than I expected, we were shown the markets and all the food that is there for the locals... chicken and fish lying out with the flys and dogs looking on :)Wayan and Puspa are the best hosts and Puspa is a dream to cook with, she will ensure you participate with the preparation in a fun environment in their home.If a cooking class is what you are after, you MUST do this!!

I took a course this past October while travelling solo through Bali and Lombok. I was picked up on time from my airport by Puspa and her husband who were incredibly cheerful. Our first stop was the Ubud market where Puspa introduced us to a variety of local produce and other goods. She is an absolute delight to be around. She's funny, charming and ALWAYS has a smile on her face. We then went to the local rice fields where her husband (I believe his name is Wayan) provided us TONS of knowledge about farming. He was also incredibly pleasant and happy to be around. After the rice fields, we went back to their family compound (which was beautiful) and began cooking. Puspa is an EXCELLENT instructor who always took her time explaining things to us. She was always happy to answer our questions and made us feel so welcome. I learned so much from that course. It was fantastic. The Paon Bali cooking class was definitely a great adventure that I would recommend to anyone. Thank you so much Puspa for a great day!!!!"

Puspa knew everyone there and helped negotiate \"local\" prices as we passed everything from textiles to sculptures to food! She evn tought us all about the different offerings that you see all over Bali! From there, we hit the rice terraces where Wayan explained how they grow, their seasons and how the land itself is devided... Not only beautiful, but also an insiders view on their culture and the way things really work there.The actual cooking class was held at their home in their beautiful outdoor kitchen surounded by nature itself in their organic garden. The food was amazing and they give you the recepies to take home so you can recreate your Bali experience when you get home! Puspa and Wayan are amazing people and we are so happy to have met them and been given the opportunity to experience not just their cooking style, but their life style and wonderfull personalities! I HIGHLY recomend spending a day with them! You will not regret it!!!"

The trip to the market was informative (and eye opening...some of the products looked like Bali belly waiting to happen, but thankfully we didn't buy ours there), we toured their village and learned about farming rice, then we were taken to Puspa & Wayan's home where after a bit more learning about Balinese culture and their organic garden, we began cooking. We had a group of about 9 of us, all having chosen this class from the Trip Advisor reviews, and really worked well together to make a fantastic lunch. It really was some of the best food I had in a month in Indonesia. Overall, the best cooking class I've taken!"

            "review": "Exceptional Food. Hospitable Hosts. Must do Activity in Ubud.. I read most of the reviews for this Paon Bali Cooking Class and wondered what the owners of this class paid to the students to gush so much about this activity. I will say this, they didn't pay me anything and I'm still rating this as 5 stars (dots in tripadvisor).Firstly, Puspa and Wayan are hard-working, generous and yet unbelievably genuine people. They're a tag team Ubud-introducing, cooking hero-duo. They deserve all the accolades that the reviewers on here have bestowed onto them. Puspa was the one that answered my phone call when I requested that we start our cooking adventure a little later than the usual 7:30AM since our friends were traveling in from Seminyak that morning and they of course were eagerly accommodating. \"A friend\" of Wayan and Puspa picked us up at the Komeneka at Bisma (free pick-ups in Ubud) at 8:45AM. All co-workers or employees are called \"friends\" in Bali. They promptly adjoined us to the marketplace tour that was already in progress with the rest of the group in the center of Ubud. Puspa was a charming Vanna White as she proudly introduced to us the unique Balinese ingredients that we would be using later in the day. The marketplace was in an open-air yet enclosed area with fruit, vegetable, flower, meat and tourist knick-knack stands. It was a bustling place but vendors weren't aggressive and it seemed like most people were busy making their little baskets of flowers for the day's offerings. Stray dogs were bold enough to shop the floors of the raw meat areas for any fallen pieces.We were shuttled to local rice paddies where Wayan explained how the Balinese family systems maintain their plots of land planted with rice paddies. He briefly explained how the rice is planted, when they harvest, how they make sure which rice seeds to plant for the next season. We then walked from the rice paddies to Wayan and Puspa's home. They provided cool, refreshing drinks as they then explained the family compound.The cooking experience itself is a bit less hands-on than some cooking classes I've taken here in the states, but I think was perfectly appropriate for the setting. Most of the ingredients were already cleaned and peeled and just needed some final chopping before cooking. Before starting each dish, Puspa would put all the needed ingredients together on a plate so we can get a visual of what's needed to create each dish. These were great photo opportunities to remember what went into each dish if you were to try to recreate any of these dishes at home. You weren't assigned to just one dish, you just helped out in chopping or manning a pan wherever you were needed. In the end we had a feast that honestly was the best meal we had in Bali. Mind you, we did go to all ranges of places to eat ranging from Mosaic in Ubud, to Chandi in Seminyak, to seafood in Jimbaran - and I still say that the feast that Puspa and Wayan guided us in cooking in their home was honestly the best tasting and most satisfying meal during this entire trip in Bali.For those interested, here are some dishes that we cooked:- Peanut sauce- Basic Balinese sauce (base for curries)- Tempe Manis- Mushroom soup (tasted a bit like a tom yum)- Chicken Curry (using the Basic Balinese Sauce)- Chicken Sate- Steamed tuna in Banana leaves- Banana Mango Dessert"

The other classes were good but not as enjoyable and memorable as the class Puspa and her husband Wayan offers in their home.We got to experience the whole thing; from strolling through the Ubud market where Puspa introduces all of the fresh vegetables, fruit, spices and fish that you can use for cooking to the overview of life working a rice field with Wayan in their village.Wayan and Puspa then invite us lucky guests into their home and explain the Balinese family compound, their way of life, their beliefs in reincarnation...everything you need to understand the typical family in Bali.We had a really nice group of people and many of us shared our travel stories or information on what to do and see in Bali. This, I feel, is one of the most special experiences of the class. You meet new people, share laughs, cook together and then have new friends at the end of the afternoon.The food preparation and cooking was very relaxing and enjoyable, everybody pitched in and took turns chopping, grinding, frying, grilling. You name, we all did it.We made chicken curry, mushroom soup, chicken satay, urab, gado gado, tempe, pepes ikan and then a banana jackfruit dessert with shredded coconut and palm sugar. Everything was truly exquisite! We were all quiet while we fed forkfuls of scrumptious and perfectly spiced Balinese food into our mouths. There was enough food to feed 20 people!After lunch we all relaxed and enjoyed our dessert with tea and coffee. I was sad to leave Puspa and Wayan's home. We could have stayed all day talking, laughing and of course eating.Do yourself a favor and do something unique on your next visit to Bali, book a class at Paon. You will not only take with you some amazing new recipes home but an awesome experience and new friends."

We thought this time we should experience some culture, and both love cooking so this class made perfect sense. The hustle and bustle of the morning market, and different sights and smells was an experience, and we had plenty of time to buy things such as spices, material, scarves or whatever else may interest you. Be aware though, if you want a good deal make sure you buy things when Puspa is with you. When we returned to the market after the cooking class to take a second look the prices were definitely 'tourist prices'.The cooking itself was great, as its shows you how easy it is to make tasty balinese dishes, so good too for people who have no cooking skills whatsoever!Puspa and Wayan were incredibly friendly and welcoming, and know how to make you feel comfortable.

We did the afternoon cooking class on the 8th of September and we really had the most amazing time. Initially we wanted to do the cooking class in the morning but there was no longer any place left, I only called the day before so my mistake, because they do not want to exceed a certain number of participants due to possibly having a negative impact on the quality of the course (which is a good thing). Wayan picked us up at our hotel and then had to pickup some other persons who would join us. We drove to his village and he gave some explanation about the rice fields and how they are maintained. We then went to his house where we met Puspa. She went on to explain the house temple and the layout of their house and the kitchen. After a welcome drink it was time to get to it. We started off chopping the ingredients. Once this was done we started with the real cooking, contrary to other cooking classes we had to do everything so not just chopping. We will have a lot of good luck after this cooking class because Puspa always added a bit more spices \"for good luck\" as she tells us. ;-)After having made the first course we enjoyed eating it and I must say this was one of the best Indonesian we ate during our holiday (maybe the effort of making it has put a subjective view on this...). We proceeded to make the main course and dessert. Unfortunatly a part of our group had an appointment where they had to be, so instead of taking us all back to the hotel, Wayan went to drop them off at their appointment and then came back and waited until we were ready to leave. Talk about service.This was a very very nice experience which I have no problem recommending to anybody. If you can spare the time and you like Indonesian food/cooking make sure you plan this cooking class in your schedule. You won't regret it!"

Disclaimer: we haven't tried any of the other cooking classes on the island, so we don't know whether this one is truly superior to others. That said, we were part of a group of 10 people who took Puspa and Wayan's cooking class. We all thought it was the highlight of our stay on this island. Pros: Opportunity to get a true taste of the Balinese culture, including standing next to local women offering sacrifices, in depth knowledge of how the rules of the local village are made and adhered to and the intricacies of the rice paddies. To enjoy a leisurely and wonderful Balinese meal (the lunch was so big that we didn't bother with dinner that night). To learn how to cook some delightful Balinese dishes. They were GREAT.  To get a guided tour through the Ubud market. Very interesting and tasty...we learned a lot more because Puspa was with us and offered us samples to try.  To meet some truly lovely, generous and interesting Balinese people. Puspa and Wayan are gems.  Cons: None other than the fact that the lunch we had would have been so much better had it been accompanied by a cold Balinese beer. Turns out that our hosts would have given us some beer had we thought about asking! But we suggest picking up some cold Bintang beer at the market and bringing it to the lunch. Other points worth noting-- Although the entire event was scheduled from 9-1, our group finally meandered away from the table a little after 3 P.M. And we could have stayed later! - It was the very best value of all the other kinds of day trips that we saw offered. - We signed up by contacting them by e-mail. They were VERY responsive and made the arrangements very quickly. - If time permits, try to stay in Ubud and do some exploring there. You can arrange for transportation back to the coastal hotels with Puspa & Wayan at only a modest additional fee. They are very accommodating."

Both Puspa and Wayan speak excellent English and are wonderful characters --- there is a lot of laughter, joking and fun in the cooking process.

My father and I were joined by a family of five and a solo traveller, which made for a lovely, quiet class. We were picked up at our hotel by Wayan and Puspa themselves, who were full of apologies at being a full two minutes late. On the way to the markets we joked and talked.At the markets, Puspa taught us all about the different spices and ingredients we would be using (and didnt mind waiting for us to do a quick spot of shopping). We were then taken to the rice fields where Wayan taught us about the connections between rice paddys and Balinese family culture. After that, most of us were taken to their house - the car was too small for all of us so Puspa drove me on her motorbike, which was so much fun.At the house, we were invited into the family temple (which is a huge deal), and given really delicious welcome drinks. After that, we commenced cooking. Each person was given jobs (e.g. one person made the peanut sauce, one person chopped vegetables, one person cooked chicken) and together we made a wonderful (and huge) meal, of Balinese food. Puspa even helped one boy make a seperate soup after discovering he didn't like mushrooms. Overall, I totally recommend this class. It is such a good way to learn more about the culture, and also have fun. If you're a serious cook, it probably isn't for you. But if you are looking for a good day out, and also to learn more about Balinese food and culture, it's perfect."

Puspa and Wayan are great cultural ambassadors for Bali.The day starts when they pick you up and take you to the market in Ubud. There Puspa shows you around, describing the ingredients for sale, and the people who sell them. She even allows a little time for some bargaining with the non-food vendors.From there her husband, Wayan, drives to a spot near their village with a beautiful view among the rice paddies and offers a brief sociology lesson on life in Bali. He does a fine job, and goes out of his way to answer all of your questions.Then it's back to their home. Here Wayan leads you through the elements of a typical Balinese village home, as well as the intricacies of the Hinduism practiced by most residents of the island. Very interesting. They even show you around the family shrine.Finally Puspa takes back over, tours you through her garden, and then gets everybody to work on making a fabulous lunch. The food, and its preparation were a real treat. The view from their yard is incredible. They also had the nicest smelling western-style bathroom I encountered on the entire island (something I know my fellow Westerners can appreciate.) :-)I learned so much about Bali, and got to eat such great food.

Wayan and Puspa pick you up from your hotel at the appointed time and you start with a visit with Puspa to the markets, where she keeps up and extremely informative and amusing commentary on all that is to be bought in the fruit and vegetable market - it's a wonderful experience to shop with a local and find out all those things that you don't know how to ask about when your Indonesian is as bad as mine! Wayan picks you up at the end of the market tour and takes you back to their home compound - then off to look at his family rice paddy and hear a bit about how rice is grown and the responsibilities of a village member before returning to their lovely home compound to begin cooking lunch. Puspa is a natural teacher who soon gets everyone involved in learning to cook Bali-style. Both Puspa and Wayan speak excellent English --- and there are lots of laughs and fun in the cooking process. The outdoor kitchen is immaculate and the food is really delicious. Puspa limits her class numbers because she doesn't want anyone \"just looking, looking\" as she put it! and I think this is one of the keys to her success! You get copies of all the recipes to take away with you so you can recreate the food at home. We loved the whole experience guys, and hope to return again next year to learn to make some different dishes to add to our repertoire."

Paon-Bali (Puspa and her funny and charming husband) are the hosts of hosts. This cooking class is more than just cooking - it is the market (morning classes only), the rice-field trip and discussion of village life and, of course, the class itself. But it is more than that - you are warmly welcomed into the family and genuinely so. You feel like a true guest - not a paying customer.The class, it is hands-on all the way - no 'watching here'! Puspa is reassuring all the way, but is always asking how you want the food to taste - taste-testing is a common theme throughout the class. Once you have finished making the food and you make your way to the table with fabulous views over the gully, Puspa weaves her magic and 'your' food is presented back to you in a beautifully decorative style - it looks too good to eat! But wait til you try some - you won't be able to stop!! I loved it, can not recommend it enough, and will definitely be back to visit my new friends Puspa and Weyan"

We had the morning class, so we visited the market where we could see all the ingredients the Indonesians use in their kitchen, (and also buy some), then we had a small walk in the rice fields where we had the chance to hear about the every day life in the village. When we arrived in our hosts house, our welcome drinks were expecting for us and the cooking started! We used chili, made peanut sauce, grained coco, and wrapped tuna in banana leaf! All delicious, with the help of hour hosts of course!"

They were charming and warm and taught us more about village life in Bali than I had ever learned in my prior three trips to the island. The visit to the open market in Ubud was fun, colorful, full of local smells and offered a glimpse of where locals shop. From there, Wayan drove our group to their village in Laplanan and helped us understand farming and village governance. We then joined Puspa in her kitchen and learned the basics of spices, local foods, and technique. After a few hours of preparing and cooking several dishes from soup to dessert, we enjoyed our work by eating and savoring every delicious bite. I would highly recommend trying Paon Bali."

We were then taken on a tour of the rice fields and then finally to the village of Laplapan to start our cooking course.

It was a morning class in Aug 2010, Wayan picks you up early and takes you to a local market and explain the different foods for sale and how the market is ran which is really interesting. We were then taken to his village and given a bit of a tour of Laplapan.The cooking class itself takes place inside the home of Wayan and Puspa. Unfortunately we never got to meet Puspa as she was away at family ceremony. The cooking itself was extremely well run and we made around 7-8 different dishes which tasted great. Wayan made us feel very welcome throughout the day and explained to us a lot about the Balinese culture that you wouldn't always find out. The guy is a legend. The whole session was a real experience and Paon Bali Cooking Class have an excellent set up and a genuine passion for what they do. A must for when you are in Bali."

That way you get to know the real indonesian life style. She teaches on fancy hotels sometimes but has started her own business about a year ago (2009 or so).I went early in the morning, so they first take you to the market to show around and learn about spices. Then they take everyone back and while Puspa is preparing welcome drinks, her husband shows the rice fields and explain how is the day-by-day life on the village. When we were back at their house, Puspa was making the daily offerings and they explained how it is for us, and how the family compound works. After a really nice coconut water drink, the class begins. It\u00b4s very hands on, everyone helps a bit. Puspa showed also her plants, where she gets most of the ingridients. Feel free to ask many questions, especially about their culture, she\u00b4ll be more than happy to answer them. As time goes by, the class makes delicious dishes and at the end we had a feast. I felt like being a guest at a local\u00b4s house, wt made the lesson so special. Oh, sing Imagine by John Lennon to Puspa. It\u00b4s her favorite song and she sings it whenever she\u00b4s cooking!"

Puspa and Wayan\u2019s Balinese Cooking Class in their home in the gorgeous lush lolly green rice paddy fields of Laplapan is an experience not to be missed. Wayan met me in Ubud in the morning then Puspa took us on a tour of the colourful local market where we had the opportunity to smell, sniff, taste and feel, the glorious abundance of fresh topical fruit, herbs and spices. What I liked the most about this class was that I had an inside view of the way the Balinese people live. Wayan took us on a tour of his family temple and explained a little a about his culture and customs which added a richness and roundness to the cooking that was to come later. Puspa took us on a tour of her organic kitchen garden, coming from a colder climate I found it so interesting to see vanilla, ginger, tumeric and many other spices growing. Under Puspa\u2019s guidance in her beautiful \u2018backyard kitchen\u2019 with the most stunning views, we cooked, chopped, sliced, talked, laughed, tasted and looked. We sat down to 6 traditional Balinese dishes followed by dessert and tea; Puspa supplied written recipes at the finish of the course. When we had finished lunch Wayan took us on a tour of his village showing us the rice paddy fields and talked about farming techniques including organic rice growing, village life, water, customs and ceremonies. Puspa and Wayan are delightful, their generosity, hospitality and warmth will be something that I will treasure and especially so now that I can cook their dishes in my home. I stayed in Kuta and organised a driver to take me to Ubud (which is around 1 hour from Kuta), it was not expensive, cheaper than a taxi. Wayan picked me up at Ubud. If you are thinking of doing a cooking class in Bali I would thoroughly recommend Paon Bali Cooking Class with Puspa and Wayan. www.paon-bali.com."

Although I enjoy Indonesian food I was not sure that I wanted to spend half a day in a cooking class - but I'm SO glad I did! This was so much more than a cooking class. First we toured the Ubud central market with Puspa learning about ingredients (and bartering - a real art!) and buying mangosteens, soursop and jackfruit just to try. Then, with Wayan driving, we dropped Puspa at home while Wayan took us up the road to his village's rice paddies and explained all sorts of things about their management, village governance, irrigation, local feeling about the bombings... he invited us to ask anything about Bali and we did!Next Wayan took us to his and Puspa's home and first took us into their family temple area and explained something about each structure and its purpose, as well as a quick look at Balinese spiritual beliefs. After all that we got down to the actual cooking, with preparation already completed by Puspa and Nyoman. A highlight for us was that Puspa was happy to teach us to cook her dishes completely without chilli, which while no doubt less than authentic, was a definite help to our inflamed internal systems! But I have no doubt that if you love chilli, she would love this inclusion. Wayan and Puspa were so relaxed yet informative, I found this to be one of my highlight experiences of my first trip to Bali, and I've been recommending it to everyone I know who's thinking of going to Bali."

The warmth, hospitality, information, and delicious food made was brilliant. Puspa used just a little chilli in response to our request and we sat down for a fragrant, fresh and delicious meal we'll never forget. Before lunch Wayan showed us the workings of local rice paddies and explained so many interesting stories about Balinese culture and way of life. Sensational!"

I had the most fabulous day with Puspa and Wayan doing the cooking class in August 2010, it was hands on which none of the others offered seemed to be and well worth the money. Wayan and Puspa were both knowledgeable and welcoming. The morning started with a visit to the markets and a walk through with Puspa and an introduction to the produce available. We then visited their village where Wayan talked to us about Bali and the way the village works and the process of rice farming. Following this we headed to their home where we were welcomed and introduced to Balinese life. They welcomed us to the temple area in their home and Puspa completed the ceremonies before we headed off to get on with the cooking! We made a series of traditional balinese dishes with organic ingrediants fresh from their garden which was fun and tasted great! Puspa was well aware of the sensitivities of our stomachs and had made sure she bought all meat from a reputable butcher, the hygiene standards were well on par with that expected. We got the recipes to keep at the end of the day. Overall it was a fabulous day, filled with laughter and a warmth that is often hard to find Puspa and Wayan were fabulous and i now feel that i have friends in Ubud should i return... Would highly recommend this to anyone interested in a culutral experience in Ubud."

We learned a lot about the local people and their food.After that stop we went to Puspas and Wayans family compound in the village of Laplapan. We were very friendly welcomed by Puspa. Afterwards Wayan explained everything about their family compound, the family temple and rituals and their honeymoon suite.Now Puspa led us to the cooking facility. They have a wonderful garden with a great view down a valley with plenty of rain forest and rice paddies. The kitchen was clean and well organized. After having a refreshing water coconut we were introduced by Puspa to the different ingredients and the procedure of making fresh coconut oil. Then self-cooking started with making all the tasty food like chicken curry, Gado Gado with peanut butter sauce, etc. Puspa explained all in english, we had a lot of fun and she also cared a lot about us during our final lunch. On our way back Wayan even drove us to some local villages nearby Ubud, that are famous for crafts like kite building, silver-forging, cause we liked to. Fabulous!It was a absolutely satisfying day with lot of fun and learning much of the local balinese lifestyle. Food was tasty, the kitchen clean, Puspa and Wayan wonderful."

First let me say that it was wonderful and everyone should run, not walk and sign up for the class. Even if you are not interested in cooking! Puspa and Wayan the owners are so warm and inviting you will never want to leave!I signed up for the afternoon class and Wayan one of the owners/chauffeur/helper picked me up on time. He drove me and the other class attendees to their village Laplapan in Ubud, Bali. He toured us around the village and showed us the rice fields where they are trying to turn the fields organic. We were able to stop and take pictures as well as just enjoy the magnificent view from the fields. On the tour of the village he explained a lot of things about Bali and the villages that you don't get on most tours.After the rice fields we arrived at Wayan and Puspas home. Wayan gave us a tour of their home and explained about the temples, and the traditions of the Balinese people inside their homes. We also saw their organic garden. It was wonderful to be able to go into someone's home and see how they really live. I really enjoyed the explanation about the Balinese culture. We cooked about 5 or 6 different things and it was fun and very friendly atmosphere. Puspa the chef/wife/boss is so nice and she gives great instruction about the ingredients you are using. I loved the fact that almost 99% of the food used comes from their organic garden. Many of the ingredients used, such as turmeric, I had never seen before in its natural state. During the cooking process we all took turns chopping and stirring and tasting. You can cook as much as you or just sit and chit chat if you want. Puspa is very laid back and your wish is her command. She was even able to accommodate my request for a vegetarian option.When the meal was done we sat down and ate the best meal I have ever had in Bali! We made traditional Balinese and Indonesian dishes. I am excited to know that I will be able to go home and re-create these dishes in my kitchen.If you take the morning tour you are able to tour the market with Puspa to see how and what she buys as well how to bargain with the shopkeepers. That's worth the price alone. Also the morning tour includes the process of how she makes the coconut oil which is used in a lot of the dishes. At the conclusion of the meal they give you all of the recipes to take home. They even had a vegetarian recipe for me which I thought was very nice. The price of this tour is much less than you would pay for most of the cooking classes held in many of the hotels. Plus you don't get to see a real village and go into someone's home to view a real Balinese kitchen. I stayed two weeks in Bali and this class was the highlight of my trip. If I ever come back I would take this class again just for the delicious food and to be in the company of Puspa and Wayan. When I took the class I was staying in Ubud but I am sure that they can do pick ups from other parts of the island also just call and ask."

I also have to give a hands up for Nyoman who is very welcoming and friendly."

We booked 24 hours by e mail and we where collected on time from an agreed place in town ( we are staying in the rice fields where cars cannot get to)IWayan took us to the rice terraces and told us all about the rice, its production and answered all our questions.We then went to cook. We where with one other family from Holland who were very nice and the 8 of us cooked bits together and bits separately. IWayan adapted the menu for us as we are vegetarian and even changed the soup to noodle soup which was fantastic as the kids don't like mushrooms.You get to do lots of chopping and mixing and grinding and all of the cooking between you.Each person has a chopping station and there are 4 rings for cooking which were shared and was enough for 8 people - 4 cooking and 4 mixing etc.You never got to cook a whole meal only bits and then it was passed on. I don't thing in 1/2 a day there was any other way and we really enjoyed this experience but I wanted to explain it as I think some people may think that you cook every dish yourself.You are given a recipe book at the end and ours was changed for the noodle soup too.After you have cooked they show you how to make a blessing for the gods and then you eat together as a group.There is lots of food and it all tasted good - not sure Ill be able to repeat but will try.They offer beer and water is provided free. beer is 40,000IDR each bottle.All in all an excellent day that I would recommend - but only if the class size stays at 8 or below.One last thing - everything is very clean and all the food is covered from foods while you are preparing or while it is waiting to be eaten.Clean toilets and hand washing available and encouraged also plastic gloves provided when you need to use your hands for shared bits with hand mixing."

My boyfriend and I booked this cooking class at short notice through Whatsapp. We were staying in a villa 400m along the road and had walked by and seen their sign. On the day of the class we had to check out of our villa so they very kindly let us store our luggage in their compound.Because our villa was so close we walked along at 8.15. We were super lucky being the only 2 people in the class that morning. We were taken to a local market to explore the produce before being driven back to the cooking school for a delicious breakfast and welcome drink. We were shown how to make an offering which was really interesting and added an extra element to the day, before we started cooking.I'm vegetarian and my boyfriend eats meat and they were able to accommodate my dietary requirements. We spent the rest of the morning cooking many delicious meals under the watchful eye and guidance of the staff. Water was provided throughout the day.The best part of the day was lunch time when we were able to enjoy all of the delicious food we'd cooked. We were amazed by the flavours of everything and can't wait to recreate the dishes at home after being given both a vegetarian and meat recipe book.We were finished by around 1pm but we hadn't arranged our driver to pick us up until 2pm so we were able to stay at the compound and get to meet the whole family. This really added something special to the day as were were able to learn a lot about the Balinese culture, compounds, work, daily life etc which we would never have learnt any other way. It was so nice getting to know everyone in such a chilled and welcoming environment. It's a day we will never forget and it was an absolutely amazing experience. I recommend this class to everyone, as theres much more to it than just cooking."

Fortunately, this cooking course would appear to be a totally different type of cooking course. After getting picked up from our various hotels, we ventured into the bustling morning market of Ubud where we were shown around by our guide. He introduced us to the different spices, vegetables and other ingredients that we would be using to cook with. We arrived at the Balinese family home where the course would take place after visiting a rice paddy field. Over the next hour or so we were shown how to use ingredients and made many different meals which we then sat down to enjoy our delicious creations.I would recommend this experience to anyone, regardless of their cooking ability. The way the family welcomed us into their home would add a cultural knowledge to those who would participate in the course. "

Although previous reviews have praised this cooking class, I was a little concerned about the lack of reviews. However, there was no need to be. All previous reviews reflect the high standards of this class. The family (mainly the brothers) take very good care of you throughout always going to that extra effort to help you, answer your questions and generally make you feel at home. We attended the afternoon session. So I can't comment on the market tour, but if it was anything like the rest of the day, I'm sure it would have been great fun and very informative. After finding the class through tripadvisor, we booked over whatsapp using the number on the website. We were picked up by one of the brothers and first taken to a tour of the rice fields, before returning to their compound home to start the cooking class. All ingredients supplied, with great instruction throughout. You will learn not just the cooking methods, but about the individual ingredients and their culture. At the end of cooking class, you will have prepared several meals which you can then enjoy. As this was an afternoon class, this effectively became our dinner and lovely it was. Overall I really can't find out any faults. You will have a great day, learn and laugh and enjoy some great food for the price of an average meal. Don't look anywhere else and book it now!"

Our host and chef picked us up, showed us to the traditional market, rice field, daily offering rituals, and taught us cooking all by himself (with the help of his wife, lovely family!). Throughout the day, he was extremely courteous and always answer our questions, made sure we are comfortable. -Home style cooking; all the dishes he taught us at the class were (mostly) made from scratch by us, including the sauce, so other than he fact that it might be difficult to find the ingredients in the states, it felt very doable and easy to follow. -Great food! Not only that he made sure we all had hands on experience with the cooking, he made sure the flavors are good and suitable for everyone. The food we made was some the best and most authentic we had during our stay. -Clean facilities; even though it was a very family oriented set up (the class takes place at his home/compound house) the kitchen, bathroom, and dining areas were all very clean and well maintained. Cons:I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience and can honestly find nothing serious as a con. Overall highly recommended! Even though it is not as popular or renowned as other older cooking schools, but the sincerity and the quality of Jeding cooking school will definitely give you a memorable experience. "

I was picked up at my villa by Nyoman who was welcoming, professional and very informative; we proceeded to the local market where Nyoman explained the produce, much of which was to be used in the meal we were to prepare later. We then drove to a stunning location where I was educated on how many of the herbs, spices, coffee and cocoa grow. It was most informative and the tasting plater of teas and coffees was a refreshing touch after a stroll through the lush gardens.We then drove to Nyomans family home which is in the traditional style with a little temple and a beautiful courtyard. The space where the cooking class is held is wonderful, clean, open and really nice to be in. I was shown how to make the daily offerings and enjoyed a tasty iced tea and fruit before we got started on the cooking.I had a great time preparing all the dishes; Nyoman and his lovely wife were excellent teachers, the ingredients were fresh, colourful and smelled amazing. The end result was seriously the best food I have had in Bali hands down and one of the tastiest meals I have had in a long time, my mouth is watering just thinking about it:-)This is a small family business run by a beautiful couple in their beautiful home and you feel the warm heart of the Balinese people not some tourist trap.I will be back again and can't wait to learn more traditional cooking.

Then arrived at the place in the middle of rice paddies. We were received with a drink and were taught how to make balinese offerings. The cooking class was hands on very interactive. Very organised and professional. Greatly explained and relaxed. Then we had all the delicious lunch we prepared including dessert. Recipes provided. The plus was that we went with our two little daughters and the staff was very accommodating and kind, relaxed about the girls being around. Thanks very much for the excellent morning we had."

We were picked up from our hotel (in an air conditioned van) and from there the adventure began.The class started with a tour of the local Ubud market to see (not purchase) the types of ingredients used in traditional Balinese cooking. From there we jumped back in the van and headed to the cooking class location set in a beautiful rice paddy. The classes were small groups (6 people in ours) so everyone had a chance to ask questions and be involved. Our guide/teacher Ketut was fantastic - he answered all our questions and explained everything in detail in great English, he even made lots of jokes, which made the day very entertaining. We made 8 dishes in total and got to sit down at the end and enjoy the lunch we had made as a group.I would recommend this cooking class for anyone wanting a fun and enjoyable morning with delicious food! We were picked up at 8:30 and dropped back to our hotel around 1:45pm. "

We then went to the rice fields and were taught aboht rice and then we walked to the cooking class which was in the middle of the rice fields. I am vegetarian and the meat was substituted with tempeh or tofu but same flavours were used to that the dishes were similar. We cooked soup, curry and other dishes as well as dessert. They cater for all food allergies and preferences and everything was delicious! We met some really awesome people too which made the experience even better! Loved our drivers and the cooking guides and everyone else who helped out. Really glad we took this class and even got to take home a recipe book with everything we made!

The food was lovely and the buffet to feast on all that we had cooked was a good way to end the day. Teachers are fab and helpful and create a great atmosphere. Our group was lovely too and we met some fab people. The only drawback and reason I haven't given five stars is the market experience was a bit of a let down. We weren't given much of an explanation about foods at all and this stretched to the rice fields. It clearly depends on the guide however, having read other reviews. Would recommend."

It's a different set-up to cooking classes I've been to before. Rather than choosing a course for yourself, you prepare a buffet together with about 10 other people, so you're all working together rather than separately. Although this may take away a little bit of the \"personal\" aspect of making your own food, it does mean you can prepare a greater variety of dishes in the same time. Plus the food was great, so I can't complain! We also did a tour of the local market, and got to see the best places to buy particular ingredients."

Anyone can easily go here but it was nice to have the different produce explained to us. We then drove out to the location for the course, for which we took a short walk through the rice fields. We were greeted with a welcome drink and taught how to make offerings (a nice touch - especially as there are some courses just for this which charge $50 for the day!). Once we were onto the cooking, everyone got a chance to be involved in every dish and everything was arranged so smoothly that you turned round and the next section had already been set up ready to go. Staff spoke good English and were helpful. We finished by sitting down to eat our delicious banquet together before being dropped back to our hotel along with a recipe book. Highly recommended."

The food was delicious and well presented and the staff made every bit of the session more enjoyable! Hygienic and beautiful setting, eating amongst the rice fields. Potentially the favourite thing we did in Ubud! Would highly recommend!"

We got collected from our homestay and went to the morning market to see how the local people trade their fresh produce and other goodies, so nice to experience the \"real people\" in their everyday living. We then went off to our stunning outdoor kitchen in the middle of rice paddies ( you cannot ask for a more beautiful view!) our hosts, Made and Wayan were so lovely and welcoming! Everything was nice and clean and well organized, we even made our own offering before we started cooking. The food was delicious, the atmosphere and the help from the hosts great! We also had a real good time meeting new people in the group and we had lots of fun. This is something I would recommend doing, it is worth every memory! Thank you Canting Bali Cooking!"

I learned a lot about rice, Balinese culture, and cooking! The instructors were clear about instructions and spoke pretty good English. The food was delicious. The rides to and from my hotel made everything easy. They also took photos for me while I was cooking so I have some great pictures of myself cooking.

This is about a 10 min drive up into the hills above Ubud. iMade owns the land and the cooking school and he runs a great school. We learnt to cook 10 dishes from scratch and we were given the recipes and online support for when we cook it at home.. We first went to the market in Ubud to identify foods that we would be likely to use during the class. I must say that the famous peanut satay sauce - that is amazing in Bali - is taught at this school. I have never tasted Satay as good as how they cook it in Bali anywhere else in the world. I have since come home and made chicken sticks with the peanut satay sauce and they have tasted EXACTLY LIKE BALI. So great to know how to make this. My family love it! Anyway this was a highlight of my whole holiday and great to be able to nip up into the hills and cook in a beautiful setting. The class took about 4 hours and I met some beautiful people who were also learning with me. We all sat down to a grand lunch and totally enjoyed ourselves. This cooking school is very clean and safe. I hope you go and experience it for yourself when you travel to Ubud."

Suparta and Made, two nice, friendly adn professional staff from Canting Cooking totally made our day! A German girl, a Canadian girl, an Argentinean couple and I myself from Hong Kong 5 people joined the class on March 28, 2016 morning. It was such a delightful morning. We went to the Ubud market to learn how Balinese shop for food. If not for them who told us the market is closed after 10am, we would never know the area which is renowned for souvenirs sells fresh food in the morning. We love that they patiently explained to us in detail what food and ingredients we would use in the cooking. We gathered so much local knowledge because of them. It is so good that we are more than tourists. We love too location of the school. It is surrounded by trees and rice field. All we saw was greenery. It made us extra happy. Cooking equipment is adequate and professional. The area is well covered so we didn\u2019t feel very hot. I like that it is open rather than air-conditioned. They gave us a cinnamon lemon grass drink to welcome us which is such a lovely gesture. We had offering learning class to start our class. I love this part very much. Offering is an integral part of Balinese culture. We honour this culture by making our own offering before preparing a meal. And we made our offering in a traditional way using bamboo sticks rather than staplers. We got to choose and arrange the flowers ourselves too. We made99% of the condiments and food from scratch by ourselves. We are so happy. It is always good to know where the food in our meal comes from. We together did the chop, cut, mix, grind and cook to make a collective meal. This arrangement works very well. They offer alternative to vegetarians like me, which is so thoughtful and very important. I really appreciate this. We cooked 8 authentic delicious Balinese dishes. We enjoyed the process as well as the end result. I highly recommend this cooking class to travellers. It offers an understanding of Balinese culture and gourmet. The two staff are so nice and have such local knowledge that you will want to befriend them."

We made a lot of different recipes, everyone participated in every dish, switching in pairs (so you really got to learn all of them) and we had a small group of seven people. I called the day before and then they had no one enlisted, they told me that the maximum amount of people in one group was six. Seven was fine though, and I think there was even equipment for eight. They said all the food we couldn't eat (it was that much, even with second helpings) would be for the family and we got all the recipes when the class was finished. I would recommend to get up early though (you get picked up around 8am) and do the morning course because the visit to the local market was also great! The market starts at four in the morning and terminates at 10am, so the afternoon class can't go. My boyfriend and I have been traveling in Asia for almost five months and been to numerous local markets but we still learned some things (and bought some real cheap Luwak coffee!). All in all a great day, and you probably won't need dinner!"

All my questions could be answered and we actually took something away here. Fully confident that we can recreate something alike at home (no of course not the same, never is at home). We actually were only the 2 of us which was awesome. The morning class was more busy with 19 total, they then split the group in two and have more assistance. We highly recommend this cooking class.

The market visit in the morning was informative and enjoyable but the main fun comes when you arrive to the kitchen! Situated in the middle of a rice paddie field, the kitchen is outside and very well organised! And the food!!... The food was incredible! The staff, who are friendly and speak fantastic English, help you to create an array of colourful and very tasty dishes! All served buffet style at the end of trip! Overall the experience was fantastic and I would hugely recommend that you take the time to do this cooking class! Thank you everyone at Canting Bali!"

We had a truly wonderful time, it was so enjoyable and worth every penny.After hotel pick up, we went to visit the market and see how locals buy all of their cooking ingredients and we learned about some of the ingredients we later used in the class. Then we were driven to the cooking class itself, about half an hour drive from Ubud centre but it was a very enjoyable (air conditioned) scenic journey. The class is located in an absolutely stunning area, out in the open amongst the rice paddies. It was beautiful and meant we had an amazing view to enjoy whilst cooking/eating. We were given a delicious welcome drink and introduction, and then we were taught briefly how to make simple offerings from coconut leaves, which was lovely.We made 8 different amazing dishes, in our case all vegetarian (they have a great selection). The teachers were incredibly friendly and very helpful, they showed us exactly what to do and were very patient with us. We were assisted with cooking but it was still hands on, it was a good balance of us cooking and being helped. We had so much fun and learnt so much. We were given all the recipes to take home too so that's very exciting!After we'd cooked we sat down to eat, everything was absolutely delicious - truly amazing food! Honestly just had the best time at this class, everyone was so nice, the food was incredible, and the whole experience was lovely. Really good value for money too - 350K IDR each - less then you'd pay for the meal itself in some places, not to mention the class too!Loved it!"

Take the morning class:8:30am to get a tour of the market where they will walk you through some of the ingredients and indeed some of the other items you'll stumble upon.They'll pick you up from your hotel but the part I liked most was where it took place. You're set in the middle of rice fields in open plan kitchens. You'll begin by making an offering basket of flowers and greeted by some of the friendliest people you can imagine.Great value for money. If you can book direct instead of the agents on Ubud main street, you can probably get the price down. 250000R-350000R, better value than some of the ones nearer to our Villa.We made 2 curries, a soup, desert, 4 other dishes and they gave us a booklet with all info to take home so if you're feeling a little tired from the early rise like I was and didn't remember every step, they had me covered. Unlike other classes, there was no waiting time between dishes. When we were finishing one, the next meal was being prepped on the table behind us. You'll get into every detail...I just loved it!"

If you take the afternoon class you'll skip that part.Before preparation of the multiple course meal the friendly staff will tell you everything about all the ingredients you are going to use if they haven't done that already on the market! After that you'll start cutting and slicing them. Then step by step they will let you make the recipes. Think about a really nice soup, a salade, some skewers with chicken or tuna and so on.... you'll will eat your fingers because of the fine taste of it all! If you asked me this is a real \"must do\" during your stay in Ubud!!! You won't be disappointed! And last but not least it's worth the money."

And a lot you can do yourself. First a little tour on the ubud fresh market. After that we continue. Our class began. Of making a offering which is ofcourse more difficult than it looks like. Chopping, frying cooking, pounding. By cooking one of you is the assistant and one does the cooking. Which ofcourse was fun, hells kitchen yell\" yes chef\" was often heard. There were also two lovely kids and they did enjoy too.Overall i was very happy and the food taste soooo good. Thanks to our master chef Koman who ofcourse really was the master brain. Overall a really nice day.Later i will place some photo's"

The cooking class itself took place in a village nearby in the middle of rice fields (the rice you're going to cook comes from those fields). We cooked about 9 different Balinese dishes from soup to desert and everyone got to participate in everything unlike in other cooking classes. As some people were vegetarian we always cooked different versions, so don't worry if you don't eat fish or meat. The food was delicious and the guys were always happy to answer questions.

We were picked up at 8am and taken to the markets, this part of the day I found to be unnecessary as we weren't buying the ingredients because they had already done that. Maybe we felt this way because we have already seen the markets several times, also it was a lot of 'this is this and we will use that later' basically all that could be said for vegetables and spices. When we arrived at the cooking place we were given a welcome drink, some form of cold tea which was nice. The area itself is surrounded by beautiful rice fields! We got to cook around 8 dishes all using traditional Balinese methods. The cooking instructors were very good and explained everything. The best part of the day was sitting down and eating all the delicious food we had all prepared, luckily we were only in a group of 5 so there was so much food! I would definitely recommend this cooking experience we really enjoyed ourselves!"

They pick you up in the morning and whisk you to the market, pointing out all the vendors specialties and local foods. I could have spent more time here in the market( great for photo ops) but there was cooking to be done. We were transported with a small group of others from various locations to a one level elevated building smack in the middle of a lovely rice field. With open sides to the buildings it gave a feeling of openness and serenity surrounded by the lush green. We started our day by drinking tea and learning to make one of the offerings that you see so frequently in Indonesia. We were given a quick rundown of various ingredients used in Indonesian cooking and their importance. Our head Chef was great! We then paired off and made 6 or 7 dishes. Soup, Spicy/Sweet Tempeh, Tofu Curry, Fish Satay(Skewer), Grilled Fish in Banana Leaf, Mixed Veggies and Coconut Cake with palm sugar for dessert. AMAZING!!! The feeling of sitting down to eat a meal we made with our fellow chefs was so fun and rewarding. As a parting gift you are given a printout of all the dishes you made and their recipes to take home. Wonderful experience and a great class!!! Indonesian cooking is so unique, taking a class like this helps connect you to their culture."

            "review": "True Balinese experience, Hands-on. After much research I decided to book this cooking class among so many others due of the added market and the organic farm visit. It turns out to be a great choice choosing this cooking school. Disclaimer: if you are truly princess and do not like to get into the farm and country side maybe this is not for u. A lot of hands on and getting hands dirty. But it's worth it. We booked weeks in advanced and got some discount via booking it online. Pick up on the day was on time. The van was quite OLD and little uncomfortable, but it's very clean and the driver was very careful. After picking everybody from other hotels we were greeted by our guide in the local market. We get to see the local produce and tried some of fruits and local cake. After that we took quite a journey on the road before reaching the organic farm which is just at the back garden of our cooking class. Our guide took us through the garden and we get to pick the vegetables (ie: carrots, chilies, bok choy..etc) that we need for later. Cooking utensils and ingredients are all well prepared and washed for us. We get a booklet of recipes, a free balinese aprons and a welcome drink. We cooked many dishes and ate our own meals. It was fun by using the local grinder and the traditional way of cooking. Pros: easy to follow recipes, helpful and friendly staffs, meals are delicious, great and authentic balinese experience Cons: pick up van was quite old and uncomfortable, only 1 bottle of water is provided (you might want to bring your own water or else u can order extra drink there). Recommended if you like a true balinese experience "

What an excellent experience from the online booking to the confirmation, the pick up at the hotel, the visit to the market and of course the ambiance at the class. We went to the market in the morning on the way to the farm, and tried local fruits with our guide. When we arrived at the farm, Made our Chef, welcomed us with a nice refreshing drink. We went to the farm to collect some vegetables and fresh herb to use them for the class. He introduced us to the staff and then we started to cook. We went over 6 Indonesian recipes including a banana pudding. The food was so fresh, the quality and the taste were just amazing. The staff was so helpful, always here to assist you during the cooking class. Also super friendly and funny! I would definitely recommend this place as it is ran by a community in a small village. The general feeling after 6 hours on site was simply relaxing, peaceful and yummy! Hope I will be able to cook the same dishes back home ! Terimakasi baniak"

The day started with a short visit to the local market where we wandered around talking about some Balinese cooking ingredients; spices, roots, veggies and fruits. We had a chance to sample some of the fruits (jackfruit, snakeskin fruit) as well as a few prepared foods made in front of our eyes and presented on banana leaves. Our guide who would later be our cooking teacher was happy to answer questions and judging by the prices he paid for what we ate - the whole experience was pretty authentic! We then moved on to the farm where (after a welcome drink) we toured the gorgeous grounds first. More alike to gardens than a farm to my eyes with winding paths, pergolas and beautiful trees throughout. We ate passion fruit right from the vine and stopped to smell, look at and talk about the various spices, fruits, and veggies as well as some less obvious things such as cacao and coffee. Then we started cooking! The class was divided into two sessions with mealtime in between and was very comfortably paced. All of the washing and difficult prep (peeling etc) was done for us so our time was focused on preparing the six different dishes. We had been given a recipe book for the day and I happily made notes and snapped photos as I worked with my partner at our station. We were lucky with only 5 class members that day, the maximum here is 12.Sukuda (our guide) was an excellent cook who's infectious laugh and calm demeanour set us at ease quickly. The class was a perfect balance of us cooking and the staff making sure everything went smoothly, taking over when needed. He was happy to answer questions and correct mistakes usually before they happened. He is young and energetic but clearly has been doing this for some time. Thanks Sukuda!Lastly I should note that they are extremely accommodating of vegetarian and vegan diets with an entirely separate book and recipe changes where needed. As often happens, the non-veg folks were very curious to try the delicious things we were making.Overall this was an unforgettable day in a beautiful place with kind and talented staff. Treat yourself to a visit to this organic farm and cooking school!!"

The instructor explained all the spices, ingredients and cooking techniques. The food was far better than any of the dozens of restaurants I have tried in Bali. The portions were generous. There were several courses including dessert. We alternated between cooking and eating. It was paced nicely and allowed for conversations among the students. There are several staff members who assist with washing the produce and clearing pots/pans. It leaves you able to focus on chopping, cooking and eating. I highly recommend this cooking school!"

Our group began our day at a local market learning about the different fruits and veggies that we'd be cooking with. Next we headed to the beautiful location of the class, a group owned organic farm. Once at the farm we were given little baskets to collect various herbs and vegetables that we were going to use in our cooking. This provided a great opportunity to learn more about Balinese agriculture and my kids loved seeing where their food came from. Once we went back to the classroom area we found each station was fully prepared with our ingredients for the first two of six dishes that we were to make. The instructors found the perfect balance of guiding us and letting us try things on our own. Upon finishing the first two dishes we sat down to eat, complete with rice from their own farm. We then set off to make the last four recipes, which included an amazing curry that served as base for two recipes. The process of the curry; from chopping to grinding in the mortar and pestle was so fun for my kids. Each and everyone of the dishes was delicious and the chicken curry was the best that I've had during all our time here in Bali. We left with full bellies and happy souls. The entire day felt well thought out and we were well taken care of. Every detail was considered in making it an excellent experience- from the recipes and the plan for cooking, to the hand washing stations and clean restrooms. It was truly a pleasure taking this class and I'd do it again in a heartbeat."

Wonderful attention to detail was paid to virtually every aspect of this cooking experience - taking you to the market, explaining different spices, showing you around the quaint organic farm and letting you pick ingredients. Although it is a cooking class, everything is washed and basically prepared for you - you chop and dice and use the mortar and pestle and grate, then add the ingredients to the pots, but there's no peeling vegetables or any of the tiresome prep work. The atmosphere is also very welcoming: you cook two or three dishes out in the open with a partner, then eat, then cook again, with beautiful Balinese music playing in the backdrop. There are a few things that can be improved: during the transfer, I think more effort could be made to explain different aspects of Balinese life (it was only when I asked and prodded that I learnt about some cultural traditions), and photos (or hand-drawn pictures) could have been included in the cook books so you have a basic idea of what your meals are supposed to look like. But these are small recommendations given that the staff (who are all from the same family) go to the effort of catering for meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans, and really are doing something so positive for their community."

We picked our own vegetables and herbs from the garden to cook our meal. We cooked a staggering total of 6 dishes, with a break to eat in between. The flavors were a wake-up call for me. I need to figure out how to integrate lemongrass, galangal, and limes into my cooking back home! The curry was especially amazing. There were two courses, for vegetarians and non-vegetarians, and they proceeded smoothly side-by-side. Only 3 groups were in the class (each from different continents), so we enjoyed the chance to get to know each other. We got to take home cookbooks at the end of the class.A very educational experience and an opportunity to enjoy food more authentic than what you'll find in any restaurant!"

Luckily there was only one more pickup after us, a lovely couple from Poland, so there were only the 4 of us in total and it felt really quite private. We were about to pass through the Tegalalang rice terrace around 940am so the driver very kindly offered to stop to let us take photos. It was a good time to stop as it was very quiet there and not much was yet open. The market stop was at a very small market and while we got to sample some interesting things like snakeskin fruit and a glutinous rice/pumpkin sweet I've probably visited some more interesting markets as part of other cooking classes I've done. I did like visiting a market that locals attend though, and our instructor so very kindly helped me buy a small jackfruit to try later, and I really appreciated that! It took quite a while to arrive at the grounds itself and it is a bumpy ride in patches but well worth it. The gardens are just beautiful and it was great to pick our own veggies to cook with (though I think we didn't even use half of what was picked in the end) and to try some of the local fruits that were in season. It was a long, slow walk and I was impatient to get started with the cooking but once I let myself relax and be on 'Bali time' I really enjoyed it. The cooking was good fun but I'd say it's geared towards beginner/intermediate cooks so if you know your way around the kitchen, ask for the advanced course. I thought the dishes were delicious and paced well - it felt like a bit of a degustation in a way - 2 salad courses cooked then eaten, followed by a chicken curry and sate lilit (minced pork satay) cooked and eaten, followed by dessert of fried banana. All were very tasty meals but often the instructor would say \"now taste it and make sure it is well balanced\". I found this some times hard to do, as we don't know what these dishes are supposed to taste like - so I would ask him to taste ours (as other instructors have done in other courses we have done) to let us know if it was balanced, so maybe something they could add in the recipe book is words like \"salty-sour-spicy\" or words to describe the sorts of flavours we should be looking to accent. What I loved most is that it gave us an understanding of what traditional Balinese foods are like - so for the rest of our trip we could appreciate and recognise what fresh herbs were used and where the flavours come from - and why and how the vegetables are cooked that way. 2 thumbs up from us for a lovely day spent!"

We stopped at a market on the way where we were able to look around, take some photos and get an explanation of some of the ingredients used in Balinese cooking. After that we were taken to the farm for the class. Our class was very small, just me and a couple from Australia. We were first given a drink and allowed to relax and talk with each other for a few minutes. We got our own aprons and cook books containing all the recipes we would make. The cook books and aprons were ours to keep. Then we got a tour of the farm and picked some of the vegetables we would use in cooking. We were set up at two person cooking stations although I had my own since there were only three of us. We first made two dishes, then had them served. After eating we made four more dishes! There was more than enough food and all of it was absolutely delicious. I was in Bali with my wife who was taking a two week pottery workshop so I had to come up with activities for myself. I had looked on Tripadvisor for the best cooking schools and contacted the top listed ones. The others were already full so I picked this one. I'm very glad I got this one because I can't imagine the others could have been any better. The people at the cooking school were all very friendly and helpful. We've used some of the recipes in the cook book since we got home. Just do this, you can't go wrong!"

They are very well organized and had all of the ingredients set up and ready ahead of time except the ones we picked fresh from the farm. They also had a detailed recipe book for you to keep and pen for you to write notes to yourself if you had things to add which made it much more likely I will repeat these recipes at home! We did the vegetarian option and the recipes we made were delicious and diverse! We would cook a few, take a break to eat and enjoy, and then cook a few more. They have a great system and were wonderful to talk with. They had very good English and so we learned a lot from them about cooking and their culture during our time there. They were also very friendly and fun!"

You get to taste some local fruits as well as a good explanation of local herbs and spices. After the market we arrived at the beautiful farm. It is a really nice and quite place, where your instructor will guide you through the farm and will let you pick some needed veggies and spices for the cooking class. The cooking class is well guided and all the people are genuinely friendly. Overall a fantastic experience! If you are looking for a cooking class during your stay in Ubud: look no further. There pick- and drop off service is great and included in the price."

It entails local market orientation - sampling of local produce - organic farm exploration, learning of various produce, sampling, picking ingredients (from veggies to roots like ginger & turmeric!), enjoying the fresh air in the farm (You MUST try the cocoa fruit and Passion fruit!) - Step by Step preparation and cooking (No SHORT CUT! which is nice... we cut & pound everything ourselves!) - Savoring our own Cooking - Enjoying the nice ambiance in the farm....

I was picked up bright and early from my hotel and visited the local market to explore how the locals shop for items to prepare for the day. The class was held at a beautiful organic farm where I picked the vegetables used in the dishes we made and I was the only student in the class. The instructor was very knowledgeable and communicated very well about how to prepare each dish. I appreciated that got to prepare 2 dishes and then ate them before preparing the next few dishes. They were able to accommodate my vegan lifestyle and everything came out beautifully. I was given a booklet with all recipes that we prepared and the apron I wore during class as keepsakes. I had so much food leftover that I took it back to eat later in the day. Not to mention eating your meal in such beautiful surroundings. It made for a wonderful experience."

And this one was just as wonderful but in a different way. The trip to the market was not amazing--besides showing us-\"here's the market\" we didn't get introduced to new vegetables or foods. We did on our own buy some donut like things and saw some interesting carts and lots of beautiful fruits and vegetables, but more of a tour by someone knowledgeable would have been better. When we arrived to the farm, we walked down all of the rows and saw the plants growing, were taught how to pick each fruit/vegetable/herb to get the delicious ones, and sampled a bit as we went. We all loved this. Really interesting to see the plants they come from. Then we made our meals. We had 2 omnivores, 1 pescetarian and 1 vegan and they accommodated us all. We needed some help here and there (particularly on the grinding of the garlic and onions for the paste) and I'm sure our meals turned out better b/c of their help. Really, really lovely day and one of our highlights."

Then we were given our aprons and recipe book ( which you keep) and the lessons started. Working as couples we each had a very good \"helper\". We cooked 4 dishes altogether and dessert. After 2 dishes you get to eat your masterpieces , then you cook 2 more and once again enjoy those meals. absolutely delicious, then dessert. Yum! The staff were wonderful, with good sense of humour.

My husband and I met Wayan and a small group of fellow adventurers at the outdoor market and proceeded to explore the tastes, smells and colors there. We then took a beautiful drive to the farm and were greeted with warm, welcoming smiles by the team of people supporting our cooking class. We strolled through the lovely organic garden and picked baskets of fresh ingredients for our meal. The cooking stations and open pavilion where the magic would happen were very clean and inviting (as were the restrooms!). We paired up and got busy making truly delicious dishes. There was lots of laughter and play as well as great instruction. The recipes were simple and when we sat to eat, there were many exclamations of appreciation. Yum! Our small group and the instructors bonded and spent time in conversation after the meal was over. It was hard to leave this beautiful environment and people when the day was over. We could easily make these recipes back home, especially with the little book of recipes and information they sent us home with. A really wonderful day that we can't recommend highly enough!"

There were six dishes to be cooked, which were done so that we cooked two dishes and ate before continuing with the next two dishes.Every dish was delicious, including those that used ingredients we would not normally have considered cooking with. It was obvious that this has been well thought out and planned by the staff, they were most helpful and laughed along with us as the class went on. The class area was traditional in style, very clean and hygienic, undercover and well suited to the setting. Kitchen Facilities were of a high standard with hand washing basins to the side. There are good clean toilet facilities on site also.

Before we went to the farm, we went to a local market and had a bit fruit tasting, like snake fruit, mangostein etc. Then it was about thirty minute drive to the destination. First they showed me around the farm, there were various kinds of veggies, herbs and fruit. We picked some that'll be used later for cooking. There were six dishes divided into three sessions, after each session you can rest a bit and eat the food while it's still warm. All were pretty simple dished yet so delicious. My favorite two were mixed veg and curry. First time made the curry from scratch. Goes perfect with rice! The class comes with the recipes and a apron that u can bring homeThe place is very quite n beautiful. The trip got a bit bumpy after going off the main road and into the mountain. We passed by two small villages there, surprised to see them cuz it was far out from the road I'd say. Loved to see the Hindu temples as well.The staff were all very friendly and welcoming. The owner couldn't speak much English, but he was really nice and hospitable. After the class, he took me to Pura Gunung Kawi (a temple), there weren't many people there, so I got to take my time looking around, taking some photos. It was cool and sacred. Overall, I'd love to go back again and learn more tasty Balinese dishes :)"

From the moment we were picked up outside of Ubud, we knew this trip was going to be memorable. Riding through the back roads of Bali in a little van with only two other tourists and a driver, we were on our way to a village market where the rural life felt very much untouched from the western world we came from. From there, we continued to the cooking school where we were greeted with smiles from the wonderful staff. The tour of the farm, descriptions of the different plants, and guidance they provided for picking the fresh fruit and produce was wonderful. Then using the food that we just picked in new and interesting recipes resulted in some truly delicious dishes. Throughout the entire trip, the staff did everything in their power to ensure we were relaxed and enjoying ourselves.

Everything is streamlined to make the experience as easy as possible. I am a terrible cook and yet I never felt like I was going to make a mistake thanks to the helpful guidance of the chefs. Sign up for this place and enjoy!!!"

We made a couple different dishes but we didn't mind repeating some of the ones we had already cooked as they are so delicious.All the staff are fantastic, with so much knowledge of all ingredients, helping us with prep and cooking and lots of joking and laughter all day.Such a great day out of main Ubud in cooler temperature. Nice to be on organic farm supporting the local community.Would we return again next year.... ABSOLUTELY."

We got pick up at our hotel, visited the local market, learned the variety of spices, went to a little farm and picked some fresh vegetables for our cooking ingredients. The instructor was very kind and patient, he provided a Balinese cooking book and an apron for each of us. The surrounding area was green and airy which gave a relaxing atmosphere. The instructor was also really communicative and gladly gave tips for the substitute spices/herb if we want to cook it in our country. Overall, we really enjoyed this cooking class and recommend it to those who love cooking and want to try cooking Balinese food.We have cooked again some of the recipes back in our home, and it still remind us about this wonderful cooking class in Bali."

We then picked organic veggies from his garden and learned about the different plants. We had the vegan menu and it was really tasty. So full up so be careful eating too much rice!

Got some good insights from him on the way there and back. I'm vegetarian so it was perfect for me that there was the opportunity to cook just vegetarian. A lot of preparation is done for you and the girls are there to assist you with pounding and chopping. There was heaps of food and plenty to take away. Perfect as it was just before Nyepi so I had food for that day sorted. I would have liked to have heard how we could do this at home. Easier ways to prepare spices etc. Made was a good instructor. He had a cold and wasn't being careful enough with hygiene for me. Just a small criticism. As a community project it is excellent and great to see other areas of Bali.

It was neat knowing that what you're cooking and eating is hand picked fresh by you in their garden. The recipes were flavorful and delicious.

Have done 2 cooking classes before and this one really stands out, in a good way.After pickup from the hotel and a 30min drive you visit a market where you meet a guide to give you an intro to Balinese produce. Good time to ask questions and in our case the guide also paid for some fruits to sample.Then a short drive to the farm, you pass the Tegallalang Rice Paddies on the way.The same guide took us around the organic farm to explain about the different fruits and veg and we had to harvest it ourselves. Really liked this part and he was very knowledgeable. Also impressed by the fact that you use so many organic ingredients in the class.After that we cooked 2 dishes, ate them, cooked 3 dishes, ate them, cooked dessert and sat down to eat that as well. The cook (not the guide, although he also helped with cooking) was very easy to understand with good English and friendly as well. There is staff to do the dishes and help chopping/grinding stuff. If you prefer to do it yourself it's totally fine. They are there to speed it along and let you skip the 'stir on medium heat for 10mins' part. Option to buy some sodas or other drinks. Had some lovely ginger something something soda for about 30k.You get to keep the apron and the recipe book. Lesson was 360k after one discount and included pickup and one bottle of water."

My visit was actually a year ago but I have refrained from writing a review until I have gathered more information and experiences from other cooking schools around. I am now ready to give my 2 cents worth!This is the furthest cooking school/farm from Ubud. For the moment, it is the least unadulterated from the typical tourist caterers. The market they take you to is the actual Tegallalang market where the locals shop. The farm has a nice, neat organic garden with a hint of manure in the air (not so pretty and clean as to warrant the question \"How is this organic?\"). It is owned and run by locals with local villagers as their staff so you know you're contributing to the area's economy instead of to some western expatriate. The cooking experience is very hands-on and retains its true Balinese flavours and style.A wonderful way to spend the day with family and coming away with memorable experiences!"

I can highly highly recommend this cooking class!You will spend the day in a lush organic garden cooking delicious dishes from plants you have harvested yourself. The cooking instructor has a detailed knowledge about all ingredients and Balinese cuisine. Most importantly, he shared all the little hints which make Balinese food so special but you will never find in any book. I can strongly recommend to choose the vegetarian option, as the dishes are much more special. We made Tempe sweet sour, tempe curry, Gado gado with extra yummy peanut sauce, bumbum Bali sauce, steamed coconut tofu dumplings, sweet corn and tofu fritters and fried bananas. Yummy!Anyway, in both cases you will get a recipe book that also includes descriptions of the ingredients and how you can replace them by something available back home.You get picked up from your place and visit a local market on the way to the farm that is located in the highlands halfway to the volcano. On the way, we also stopped at the rice terraces and at a Luvak coffee tasting. Kind of nice of them to do that.If you want to learn to cook Balinese food, do it here!"

            "review": "A Really Enjoyable Day out With A Great Company. The organic cooking farm is located in a village called Banjar Patas, Tegallalang which is a 40 minute drive from Ubud. It is an Organic farm with cooking class facilities that is run by the local villagers. All profits are returned to the village. The main Chef has great English as he previously worked on a cruise ship. So the details:- The company picks you and the other guests up in an air conditioned bus from your hotel around 8.30am in Ubud.- You then drive for about 30 minutes to a market near the farm.- The market is boring and I think it is just an attempt to support the locals in that village.- Then 5 mins later they stop at a nice view of the terraced paddy fields where you can get some nice photos.- Then 5 minutes later you arrive at the farm and are greeted by the chef.- You sit down at the already prepared table and are served tea and coffee while the chef explains how the day goes.- At the table is your cooking apron which is really nice and you get to keep it and there is the booklet of recipes that you refer to when cooking. It also lists alternative ingredients that you can get in Australia.- They then walk you round the organic garden and instruct you what veg and herbs you need to pick for your meal. The young man who walked us around was a very nice guy.- Once you get back, you can order drinks like soft drinks and beers at an extra cost if you are thirsty for something other than water, tea or coffee.- Then the cooking starts. I believe we cooked 6 different things. 3 things I absolutely loved and the other 3 things I didn\u2019t like.- About half of the ingredients are already prepped, cut and ready to go and you have to cut and prep the other half, which I liked.- Each station had one or two people cooking and a girl was assigned to each station to take all the dirty pots and pans and wash them and bring them back so your work station was always pretty clear.- The cooking is split up into two parts. You cook a few dishes, then sit and eat. Then you cook a few more dishes and sit and eat again. I couldn\u2019t eat all of mine and gave it to the young man who was helping me. He was delighted and grateful.- The course finishes at 3pm and you are dropped back to Ubud.I didn\u2019t stay till 3 though because I had to be back in Ubud by 2.30pm, so they kindly organised for me to cook my meals in a different order and a bit quicker (they gave me my own private chef to help just me) and they arranged for a driver to bring me back to Ubud early charging an extra $10 which I was more than happy to pay. I was really grateful that they were so happy to make alternative arrangements for me and it was no trouble.All in all a really nice day out and would highly recommend to anyone."

Beware most restaurants in Bali, as Monsanto Frankenfoods are endemic. We loved that this school uses all organic veggies, and loved being walked around their garden, picking the ingredients we would use in our cooking. Spray their mosquito repellent on before this tour, lest you be eaten.We appreciated how staff would take care of repetitive tasks once we had learned them, and would do things for us if we were too caught up in conversation.Our host remembered all 4 of our names, and our preferences and conversations through the day.Recommendations to the school:- read client emails sent prior to the course. We let you know that we're avoiding gluten, yet were both served gluten pancakes. Truly health conscious places in Ubud understand that most people have some level of sensitivity to gluten, whether they're aware of it or not. They therefore serve many gluten free options.- be even more health conscious. This includes using stainless steel or cast iron instead of aluminium pots. Using stainless steel strainers rather than plastic. Keeping the flies off using reed baskets rather than oestrogen boosting cling film. Most of your clients are health conscious, so being organic isn't enough.- give more time between the two courses. We all felt stuffed by having to eat our meals about an hour apart.- organise your staff better. The young market chap arrived late. The market trip wasn't worth including, especially since all ingredients are sourced from your excellent organic veggie garden."

As the class is based on a farm it's bit of a drive out of Ubud but we stopped at the Tegalalang markets and wandered around the fruit and vege stalls. No other tourists here, just locals going about their business. We haggled for bananas with sign language and admired the old fashioned scales used to weigh the produce.The farm is set up in the mountains in lush green forest. We were given a basket and taken around the gardens to pick our own veges including bok choy, beans, carrots and lemongrass. These were then washed and used for our first dish. Wayan was our main instructor and he spoke great English, he was assisted by a group of staff who kept us all organised and on track. Unlike some cooking classes everyone had a board and knife and there was a double gas burner for every couple. We really cooked the food we then ate! The ingredients were all ready but we chopped and diced, and used a mortar and pestle to make the paste. We were all given a great recipe book with a glossary and other information about Balinese food. There were also specific books and menus for vegetarians. We made 2 vegetarian dishes, pork on lemongrass skewers, chicken curry and tuna with a raw sambal. All delicious. The staff showed us the ingredients for a banana black rice dessert but then made it for us. While there were 6 dishes overall the amount of food and the time available was beautifully organised so we didn't feel over full.Just a note about insects- do remember your mosquito repellent as they can be fierce. There are always a lot of flies where ever you eat in Bali, the farm used sticky fly paper to distract the flies from the food and there was a real focus on covering food and having hand washing facilities close by.I would highly recommend this cooking class for something a bit different to the Ubud based classes- the setting, the people and the food."

There were 7 of us (a family of four, 2 women traveling together, and me) and we had a vegetarian, a pescatarian, and a vegan (and someone who didn't like lemongrass or ginger) and they were able to accommodate all of us.They picked me up at my hotel around 7:30 and we first went to the market. At the market someone explains to you what different spices and ingredients are just to show you around and let you get a feel for things. Then we headed off to the farm, which is tucked away in a small village outside of Ubud's hustle and bustle.At the farm you get some time to relax before things start and they treat you to ginger tea or Balinese coffee. Then we paired up (we were an odd number so I got paired with the instructor) and we were led around the garden armed with a basket and a knife to collect the ingredients for the day. Then the staff clean and prepare our ingredients on separate plates for each dish.You work in pairs or the staff help you (if you were alone like me). We learned to make 5 dishes (plus making spice paste and peanut sauce from scratch) and the meal is split into 2 sections. My dishes were: gado-gado, sweet and sour tempe, corn fritters, steamed corn dumplings, and a tofu and tempe curry. They also make a black rice pudding dessert for you.The instructions were clear, it was really nice to have all the ingredients laid out for you, and everyone was very friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed making the food with ingredients we had collected straight from the garden. They also include possible substitutions in the cookbook for various spices and plants that you might have trouble finding in your home country. I 100% recommend this experience and would probably do it again if I come back."

I had such a great time, from discovering real traditional Balinese market where we had a lesson on Balinese local products to picking our own ingredients to use from the ground to the pot.Its not hard to find a cooking class in Ubud as most of the restaurants offer this, but I wanted an experience that I would remember spending with my young cousin.We picked, prepared and cooked six traditional Balinese dishes, which included, chicken, tuna, pork and vegetarian meals.Our host Wayan was a delight, knowledgeable, friendly and a great sense of humour he made us feel at home and is an excellent cook himself. We were very lucky to have a great group from different parts of the world who all shared the same love for good food and produce. To have the chance to eat vegetables and herbs and spices straight from the ground was a taste sensation.This is a great day out for all the family. The cost of roughly Aud$47.00, awesome value for money. A must do."

Highlights:Communication the day before was great and easy as you can text with whatsappWayan the cooking instructor was awsome, fun and informative. His helpers were great and helped make sure you got personal supervision.The farm was beautiful and everyone enjoyed walking around and picking their vegetables for cooking Food and menu were great as was the atmosphere. You could also buy beers and local drinks using farm produceMinor improvements: the market we were taken too was awful and put you off food so recommend that they think where they take you. Also we didn't learn anything here as the guy not particularly informativeA water bottle was provided though this was very small and suggest that bigger bottles be provided as it is hot We also seemed to finish early and didn't ge to to make dessert and were home closer to 2pm than 3pmSmall things go a long way so i suggest to the operators to not cut corners or risk losing out in this highly competitive market. Overall however great experience!! "

Ismadi was a great teacher and everyone who helped made me feel right at home . Luckily I was the only person on the course that morning so I worked slowly and carefully and ate my produce mindfully .

From the time we got picked up, we were so pleased with the friendliness of our driver, Dewa and then we were guided by Wayan at the local market where we were introduced to many different local fruits we don't normally get in Australia. They all speak good English which was helpful for non Indonesian speaker. During the cooking class itself, we made 2 entr\u00e9es, 3 main dishes and 1 dessert.

We also liked the fact that it was an organic farm. We were collected from our villa at 7.30 and taken to a local food market, where different spices were explained to us. Next we went to the farm, which was in a beautiful setting, very serene, and it was great to pick the vegetables that we would be using to cook with. The owner is passionate about his organic produce and took us on a tour of the gardens explaining the different plants that we saw. On to the cooking. We cooked 6 dishes in all, the first 2 which we then ate, followed by the next 4. A great selection of Tempe, vegetables, pork, fish, chicken and rice for the non vegans. Anything that we couldn't eat was given to us to take home. Both the vegan and the meat dishes that we prepared were delicious. The instructions were clear, and everyone was very helpful. The cooking school was a covered area in the gardens, and very well set out, with everything we needed at hand. I highly recommend this experience to anyone wishing for a days cooking with a difference, as it was a really enjoyable experience. We are confident we can recreate what we learnt at home with the recipe books we were given, and we bought some spices there at a very reasonable price to help us do this."

My friend is vegetarian so we cooked the vegetarian menu. (That was no problem although the others cooked the meat menu) And what can I say... it was delicious.

We were recommended to go to Bali Farm by a local - he reckoned all the other cookery schools are not authentic and so we decided to go with this one. It was far better AND cheaper than the others we looked at.We were collected by a driver and the owner (who acted as a translator) who first took us to a local market (not central Ubud market as its too touristy) and then into the farm. I wanted to buy some coffee beans for a friend and he kindly let us stop off at a local coffee plantation on the way to the Bali Farm cookery class.When we got there, we were given a welcome drink and some delicious banana pancakes! We then proceeded to go to the garden and we picked various fresh herbs and vegetables that we would need for our cookery class.I believe the class can take 14 people at any one time, however as we were visiting in low season, there was only 4 of us which was great.We cooked some delicious dishes which we ate for lunch - and we actually cooked everything ourselves, with just some guidance from one of the trainers. We did everything except wash up !!! This place is run by a close family and the Owner is really passionate about what he is providing to tourists - he wants us to experience \"real\" Bali.They also sell lots of lovely spices (including vanilla pods) at a fraction of the price you would pay in the UK ! We had a great day out and would highly recommend to others - thank you!"

I loved that idea as well as sitting outside to eat the meal. The one thing I didn't however like is the flies but they put these special papers out and the flies immediately were attracted to them. We ended up doing the vegetarian option but they offer meat options as well. I did like the fact that the tour came and got us from our villa then took us to the market and explained all the spices to you first before taking you to the cooking class. Also after you are finished with the cooking class they have a little shop that you can basically get every kind of spice offered in the class. If you have the time to do this then it's def a must do attraction."

The farm setting is such a tranquil place, it's really interesting to see food growing that I can't grow in my own home country. The baby pineapple trees were very cute too.For the cooking, you start by making two cold dishes and then you can eat them, then it's back to the cooking area and three main courses. We started by making a 'base' paste and made a chicken curry, pork skewers and a tuna dish with a delicious raw salad accompaniment. There were only three of us in the class on the day I went and we had so much food we couldn't eat it all! You can take home any leftovers if you want to.Finally we made desert which was sliced fried banana which was simple but yummy. Served with fresh coconut and a syrup.I cannot recommend this day out enough - the people are incredibly warm and friendly throughout and funny too.

We were recommended by our friends to take on another cooking class but the Organic Farm component caught my eyes and I am very glad we took THIS cooking class and not the other.We were picked up from our hotel at 7.30am and there was a group of 10 of us cooking that day. After all the pickups, we were driven to a local market in Tegallalang. It was such a wonderful experience being in a local market where tourists were minimum and the locals were just getting on their days. We were met by someone from the farm and he gave us a tour around the market. He also spoke about why they chose to include this local market as part of their cooking class, introduction to spices and herbs used in local cuisine. We were given free time to explore the market. FYI, as this is not a tourist market, English is not widely spoken. Lots of pointing and fingers gestures to gather pricing of goods. Part of the cultural fun!After the market tour we were taken to the farm where we got to tour this massive organic farm, picked the vegetables and herbs we needed in the cooking and getting to fast FRESH vegetables off the vines! Never tasted a fresher cucumber my whole life where it just on the vines a few seconds before I took a bite!Wayan our host was so lovely and we learnt heaps of knowledge on fruits and vegetables and the Balinese dishes we learnt to cook. We made 2 entree dishes, a Balinese vegetable salad and Sweet and Sour Tempe. OMG, the sweet and sour tempe was to die for! Never expect 2 amateurs to cook up a storm and serving up delectable Balinese dishes!The organic farm and Balinese cooking are definitely winner's combo. It is also a great experience for children to learn where their food come from. There were 2 children in our group and they probably were the happiest in the whole group; so much to see and learn. Definitely an overall sensory experience!There are many cooking classes out there with good ratings but THIS is the BEST as you can't find another cooking class run by the farmers who will wow you with their warm hospitality and fresh produce. They are so willing to share that you get to bring home a recipe book of all the dishes cooked and a list of alternative ingredients you could use back home when local Balinese ingredients are hard to come by. Definitely worth every cents paid for the class!"

As a first-time solo traveller, I wanted to make sure I kept myself busy through my trip and experienced the true essence of Bali. I did a lot of research, trying to find the best cooking class in/around Ubud (believe me, there are many!). This is the only class I could find on an organic farm where you actually learn about how different veggies are grown. You even get to pick your own fresh veggies for cooking!Wayan and his whole family are so great. They are friendly, funny and always ready to answer questions. He responded immediately to my queries and was very accessible even before the class. Our trip to the traditional market was fun. We had time to learn about traditional Balinese spices as well as wander about on our own to take pictures, etc. The farm is about a 30 minute drive from the traditional market. The setting is absolutely beautiful - peaceful, green, cool. We cooked a salad, a starter, (you get to eat these before you start cooking the rest which is great as the food smells absolutely delicious), 2 mains and a side of satay - much much more than I would have imagined they would teach us in one class.The best part is that this is a family owned business. Everyone is involved; everyone goes out of their way to make sure we have a good time. And they never accept more than 10-12 students each class so you're sure to have an intimate, personalised session.There's nothing I can say to fault this cooking class. I honestly had the best day and would definitely recommend this class. I really got to immerse myself in the true Balinese culture, with the local people, ingredients and food. It's great value for money, too! I know I would definitely go back!"

We had a small group of 6 people that day preparing 5 dishes each, cooked in couples and ate together (starters in the first round and mains in the second). All ingredients were well prepared in advance and help was provided to everyone who needed to finish approx. the same time (although cooking experience in our group was very different).

Another reviewer was definitely not exaggerating, this is the future for the world.At 27USD p.p, it is very reasonably priced. The setting is beautiful, the staff are great and the food you cook is delicious - you can even take the leftovers home. We learned how to cook 6 authentic Balinese dishes and they have a recipe book prepared for you to follow and take home. Another great thing is that the classes will never get too large (10-12 people max). Honestly, it's worth every penny."

Being shown local produce, meeting local growers, picking the ingredients fresh from the field and being taught the essential spices in cooking was fantastic. Wayan engage everyone in the preparation and cooking of 5 different dishes and although we all had different skill sets we were able to complete our meals to a restaurant standard. Importantly unlike other classes attended the staff at this cooking school gave us information about what to use as an alternative ingredient (local to our country of origin) which means we can now replicate these dishes and others at home. It was the best activity we done in Bali and value for money. I have already recommended Balinese Farm Cooking to our friends. Wayan keep it up your on a winner!"

At the local market and also at the organic farm we learned a lot about the different spices and ingredients they use in Bali. The cooking school is in such a nice location outside of busy Ubud and the garden in which we picked our own beans, chilies and other vegetables is pretty big. Two people always share one stove and it was so much fun to cook the different dishes and of course eat them later on. Everything was sooooo delicious and we were so full after eating everything we cooked. Everybody who worked at the cooking school was so nice and helpful and we highly recommend this school. Thank you Wayan and your whole family for this wonderful day."

This family run farm and kitchen is set in a beautiful area outside of the hustle and bustle of Ubud central. The brothers, Ketut and Wayan make you feel welcome from the get go. Unlike other cooking courses that take you to Ubud market, this course takes you to a small local market with no tourists (other than the group). Once at the farm, you are led through the garden where you pick your own ingredients and local plants are pointed out and explained. After that it's off to the open air kitchen for an incredibly informative and well presented cooking lesson. Before starting, you are instructed to taste all the individual spice ingredients to get a better understanding of their purpose in the recipe. You will make 6 recipes, all of them absolutely delicious. You also receive a small cooking book, with thorough recipes that also suggest alternative ingredients should you not be able to find some of them in your home country. This was truly one of the highlights of our trip. An amazing experience, highly recommended!"

We were picked up from our accommodation in the morning, spent time at a local market then onto the school. The setting is wonderful - out in the country, very quiet and surrounded by organic produce and fruit trees. First we picked our own vegetables, etc then set about cooking. An easy experience with Wayang offering comments and help when needed. The food was truly delicious - 6 dishes and dessert. We were returned to our accommodation about 3.00pm after a wonderful day. A very unique experience compared to being enclosed by the usual four walls. It is also a community-type project benefiting the local people in the area. If you are thinking of doing this, please don't hesitate as it is a wonderful experience while in Bali."

We were picked up at our hotel at 7am and driven out into the country, stopping at a local traditional market to explore and learn about the foods available. The Organic Farm was a peaceful place where we strolled around with our hosts, selecting fresh produce to be used in our cooking. I enjoyed hearing about new veggies and spices and the passion of Wayan and his extended family for organic farming was very evident. There were just 6 of us in the well equipped kitchen building which was open on all sides so we were surrounded by the farm atmosphere. None of us were expert cooks but our instructors were clear and patient and after slicing and dicing we turned out an array of wonderful Balinese dishes. I can honestly say this was the most authentic and tasty Balinese food I've had in the past week. I totally recommend this experience without hesitation."

Ketut and Wayan have created a wonderful concept that is not beholden to corporate control!This was without a doubt one of the best tourist experiences Bali has to offer. We were picked up where we were staying by Ketut and taken to a small local farmers market. The local market visit demonstrated the heart and mind of true Balinese, who do not hawk their goods to tourists as in lesser, larger markets. During the market visit, Ketut explained some of the differences between the local herbs and spices compared with those you might find at home and he offered us samples of some exotic fruits to try.Then on to the farm! The farm tour was both interactive and interesting to see. Guest get to pick the produce they will cook with later. The produce is being grown proudly in a sustainable fashion without resort to pesticides which will poison our eco system and our bodies!The cooking class itself was hands-on, entertaining and educational and it was great to interact with the staff and fellow travelers who enhanced the day. Wayan was our cooking instructor and was knowledgeable, friendly and witty. We cooked several dishes and can't wait to go home and recreate them!

If you are not staying in Ubud, Ketut and one of his drivers will come and collect you from your hotel for a small additional fee. My family (2 adults and 2 children, aged 13 and 12), were staying in Kerobokan, and the trip to Ubud took a long while, however we had the wonderful company of Ketut who was so friendly and genuinely interested in knowing more about us and sharing his own experiences around how he came to start up his business. Ketut is very passionate about organic farming and changing perceptions in the wider community around the reliance upon pesticides to produce acceptable looking fruit. Our first stop was at a local market in Ubud. Here we had a look through to see all of the locally grown produce and an explanation of the types of ingredients that we would be cooking with that day. We were able to try a few fruits including snake fruit (which interestingly has a taste not dissimilar to pineapple). We then had a quick stop at the beautiful rice terraces in Ubud. A little further on, we arrived at the farm, where an outdoor kitchen is set up and we were welcomed by Ketut's family and given a refreshing ginger and lemongrass tea and had an opportunity to meet the other participants of the cooking school as they arrived. We spent some time harvesting ingredients around the farm and were given clear explanations of the various fruits and vegetables in season and how they are typically used. Our boys were given a treat by being invited to climb a papaya tree and pick some fruit, which they took home with them at the end of the day. Once we were set with our ingredients, we were provided with cookbooks and aprons and set about cooking our 5 dishes (dessert was cooked for us). We cooked a couple of dishes at a time, and then ate, so we were eating right throughout the day. The dishes varied with a number of vegetarian dishes as well as some meat and fish, so there was something to suit all tastes. The great thing about this cooking school is that you do the cooking yourself, all hands on, even grinding the curry paste. Wyan, our instructor was always on hand to direct us and help if we needed it. He was very entertaining and always had a big smile on his face, so the whole experience was made to be incredibly fun."

The next morning we were woken up with a plate of fresh fruit from the farm. We then got taken to the market where we would meet the rest of the class. The market was not really special and we've seen better ones but we got told a lot of information about the roots and vegetables used in traditional balinese and Indonesian dishes. We already knew most of the information but for most people this was a nice add to the dayThen of to the farm. We got to pick al our ingredients for the dishes that we were going to make. This was very nice! After we were done the veggies got cleaned for us and we could start cookingThe cooking you mostly have to do by yourself. You work in pairs so the work is equally split. Our teacher walked by frequently and so did the ladies who also helped a lot! The dishes were very good and tasty! The whole experience was a real add for the vacation and we hope we can do the vegetarian course some day! What i liked the most of the day is that you can pick your veggies by yourself and because you work in pairs you get to eat your own dishes ( some people like very spicy some don't) Nice finishing touch: you get to keep your apron and a little cookbook with the dishes you made that day"

We decided to go with this company initially because of the positive reviews and because we were able to cook the dishes ourselves, as opposed to watching someone else. We were picked up by Ketut who had very good English - he is very passionate about Balinese culture and preserving Ubud for everyone to enjoy. A very interesting man to converse with! He is well travelled and extremely knowledgeable - mapping out substitute ingredients for the recipes where local ingredients may not be available. We were very happy with this because we plan to recreate some of the dishes to impress our friends! We opted for the Luwak coffee (coined cat poo cappuccino!) stop off instead of the markets (prior to the class) which was actually really nice all things considered - the views are absolutely breath taking. After the markets/coffee stop, we drove 20 minutes or so out of Ubud, to the farm. The farm has all organic produce which you pick yourselves - that was a nice experience in itself. The group is relatively small (8-10 people) so it was easy to listen to his family as we walked around the farm picking our ingredients. We cooked 5 dishes all up - it was a lot of food and all very yummy. They have vegetarian alternatives as well.Cooking is done in pairs at your own station, which is situated in an open air area in the middle of the farm - everyone is set up in a U shape. The setting is lovely. His family run the cooking school and are very pleasant to be around. Ketut also has a homestay offering (one room) which sounds very authentic in comparison to others. You can teach english to the local school kids and help the farmers in the morning collect vegetables in the rice paddies. Well worth getting in touch with him if this is something you are interested in - I would have loved to do it if I had more time in Ubud."

When we got to the farm we were offered a welcome drink before being given a tour around the farm. Our guide and chef for the day, Komang, was great. We were able to pick some of the greens that we needed from the farm. They took them away to wash and I'm not convinced that it as the same greens that came out. However, that didn't matter at all! The recipes were very authentic and easy to follow and the instruction and guidance from Komang and the other staff was fantastic.The reason I chose this class over the others featured on Tripadvisor was that it is very hands on. You cook in pairs so have plenty of opportunity to get involved. The others I read about seems to be more like a presentation.After all the hard work you sit down and enjoy the lovely dishes that you have cooked.

We chose to do the Cook and Stay option for $50US (child was half price) which is great value when compared to the cooking class for $35 which is average price for cooking classes in Ubud. For the extra few $ we were given a room for the night and breakfast and lunch as well as a market tour and cooking class. Great value. We arrived by our own transport at 5pm- i think they will pick you up if you come from Ubud. It would be best to arrive a bit earlier, maybe 4pm if you can. We planned to do the cooking class for lunch the next day but on arrival we decided to do it that night and we were glad we did. That way we had a class to ourselves rather than with the people who come for the class during the day.We were welcomed by Wayan, Wayan and Ketut and had a nice herbal tea welcome drink and set our bags in the room. We then went to the cooking school across the road and had a look around. Wayan explained about the place and the plants and we picked ingredients for our dinner from the garden. Most of the stuff we picked went into the Urab dish we made. We had our 3 year old daughter and Wayan brought his daughter of similar age along and they had a great time playing in the garden. He was great at including her in the class. We cooked 2 dishes, urab and sweet and sour tempe that were delicious, then ate those (rice and water provided) then cooked 3 more dishes and ate those! By this time it was late and we were full so we decided to leave the dessert for the next day and went to bed. The cooking class was great. I was planning to do another cooking class in Ubud on my own (without the family) but i didn't feel like I needed to after this class as it was broad and I felt like it covered some great dishes. Our room was in a house that seemed to not have anyone living in it but i'm not sure. It was clean and comfortable and had a decent ensuite with a good shower. The bathroom was better than some in the hotels we stayed in! We were happy with the room. The next morning we opted to get up early and take a trip to the markets where we met up with the group doing the lunch cooking class that day. We learned about some of the local fruits and ingredients and tried a few snacks sold there. Then we went back to the farm for breakfast. After breakfast we watched a special event going on at the house we stayed at- a local cooking competition showcasing the regions produce. There were govt officials there and we met the local elected member who was very friendly (also named Wayan), Then we went for a walk down the street and back to the farm for lunch (yum) and to cook our dessert. Our daughter made friends with another little girl there. We were driven to Ubud after lunch.We very much enjoyed the experience and we felt welcomed and comfortable the whole time. This is a really great enterprise. We were told a group of 13 people set up the organic farm and cooking school to bring tourism to the village. It is a very genuine experience.And very well set up and run. The food is fresh and clean and the kitchen staff and teachers were friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend it."

Then he took us to a great little market and introduced us to some of the locals, and explained different ingredients to us.After the market we continued onto a coffee plantation which was very cool with the most astonishing views. Then we met our instructor Wayan who made us feel extremely welcome. And we picked our own veggies which was great, Wayan also showed and explained to us the different plants and what the Balinese people use them for. We cooked so many different things, all which are fantastic-I made my curry to spicy!!. I will definitely be back this was the highlight of my trip to Bali, it was a welcoming experience away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas."

Although our pickup was a little bit delayed our overall experience was awesome.First we went to one of the local markets and our guide explained some of the vegetables and spices. Purchasing them was not part of the trip.Afterwards we drove to the farm were a very comprehensive collection of vegetables and fruits is grown. They tell you a lot about them and let you harvest some of it which is afterwards used for the cooking.The cooking course itself was easy to follow and well organised. The outcome was very delicious and by far to much to add rice to every dish ;)You can pick between veggie and standard recipes.The staff was friendly and their english was quite good.I totally recommend this tour!"

I would recommend this to anybody including family with children early on in your travel in bali. Journey started with a visit to local fruit and vegetable market, then we moved to the family farm where we picked and collected our ingredients, and finally we started the long and exciting process of cooking a five course meal. I have rarely done an activity where I cannot fault the organizers. This was the case here. Other than the choice of dessert (red rice sweet dish) that was not to our taste, everything else was memorable. This ranks as one of the best and most fun experience in our stay on the island. Also you feel you are doing a great action as you are supporting a local entrepreneurial family who gives back to its community. Of course everything you see and eat is organic and you even feel good on the inside after this day."

Great clear instructions, excellent equipment and delicious recipes. A lovely fresh fruit drink was served with the food also. This also included a cook book plus an apron.

We were picked up from our hotel in Seminyak and driven to the market where we had the chance to taste and learn about foods and how they were used in Balinese dishes. Next, we arrived at the lovely farm where we were warmly greeted and given a tour of all the organic produce that is grown there. All the staff were very friendly and the instructions when cooking were clear. We made 4 dishes in all, which were all delicious, and were given a recipe book and the chance to purchase organic herbs and spices from the farm. Our instructor told us stories about how the farm began and how he is using it to change and help the surrounding community! It is growing from strength to strength. Well worth a visit! Tip - don't eat breakfast!"

The environment is relaxing and fresh, even the farm still in growing process but all very nature and refreshing. Last July was my second visit and I saw they've made a lot of progress on farm, on the way they set up the stove and cooking class table which now more nice and more organize. And have the recipe book upgrade too. So i guess they really pay attention to uplift customer' satisfaction. and that's make the most of it. I would come again and learn to cook another dishes."

My Dad and I booked the cooking school and it's hard to choose with so many options but we are so glad we picked this one.From booking, Wayan was very kind and helpful. We were picked up on time and personally, we both loved the smaller market we visited. It was far more local and the guide was fantastic. Next we moved on to the farm and had a great tour around the organic found where we learnt a lot about different vegetables and farming techniques and collected some veg for our cooking. We then got to have a tea wheel looking over the incredible gardens- it was such a good relaxing day. Then we cooked. First 2 dishes, then eating and then the final 3 dishes. Doing it this way was so much better as you could really appreciate all the dishes. We both cook a lot but found the school very informative and just the right pace so you had time to enjoy and learn more as you cooked. We then has desert cooked by the teachers. We also bought some of their locally produced spices. Overall it was a great day and we loved the atmosphere, staff and food we Had. I really hope I can come back again when I'm back in Bali. Perfect cooking school and garden. One tip, book online and make sure you bring your printed receipt as proof if you've paid online so you can give it to Wayan."

With 2 of us being vegetarian, we asked whether this could be catered for and the owners were friendly and accommodating. Ketut, the owner was very passionate about organic farming and cooking and spoke fondly of his village, family and travels. He is very passionate about helping his community and leaving a legacy. A word of advice, eat a small brekky as it's an early pick up and mid-morning before you eat your first meal. We visited a small local market on the way there and we also made a coffee stop on the way after requesting it as we had not had brekky and Ketut was happy to arrange this. Once there, we took a tour of the organic garden and picked some fresh ingredients for our cooking. We were also provided a refreshing beverage on arrival. The farm was beautifully laid out and the cooking area and seating were well presented. There was also clean toilet facilities on site. We were each given a cook book and there was a vegetarian and regular version available. The food we made was absolutely delicious. We had a lot of fun and also learnt a lot. This would have been one of our most memorable activities and I highly recommend it! Ketut and his family are delightful and Ketut I really enjoyed our chat near the new spice building during our break. A great day and great value! :)"

They will pick you up early morning and take you to a small local market for ingredients. After the market you drive up to the farm where you will walk through the gardens picking fresh veggies for your meal. Once everything is picked you get to spend a few hours cooking some of the most delicious Indonesian meals. I would highly recommend this to anyone going to bali. It's one of my favorite memories! My only suggestion would be that you eat a small breakfast before you go. We were picked up at 7:30am and I didn't eat before we left and it was tough waiting to eat until 11 when the first meal was done. Other than that bring a smile and enjoy an amazing day with inspiring people."

Not just a normal cooking lesson, but a complete one to experience Balinese style of cooking.My partner and I have done cooking classes in Malaysia and Vietnam and this was another good experience in a relaxed and informative atmosphere. Cost was 400K rupiah or 35USD and well worth it. Pickup from Ubud was around 7.45am and drop off 3.30pm and the time passed reasonably quickly.PROS:- Booking experience was simple. Called Wayan (lovely guy) who booked us in over the phone and confirmed everything via text.- Pickup was pretty much on time and drive to farm was fairly easy in airconditioned van (maybe 45min excl. the stop at the market)- At the farm you pick various vegetables and learn about the different foods (v. informative)- We are fish eating vegetarians and Wayan and the team easily adapted the menu to suit our needs - The foods, cooking and instructions are spot on. The prep and cooking are pretty relaxed (didnt feel too pressured) and the team are there to help out and answer questions or tell you about the dishes etc- You make a couple of dishes then eat, then make more then eat again. Really delicious (the meat eaters loved our food!). Not sure if we as group took too long but the team made the dessert for us - no matter as it was nice to be waited on - the team are very patient and happy to talkCONS:- the stop at local market was a little disappointing. Its reasonably small and not very diverse - mainly local mothers/grandmas selling a small selection of the same vegetables. Overall, we'd recommend the class (8.5/10) and had a great day with great people in Wayan and team."

I chose this class because it was in a village outside of Ubud, so we were treated to a nice scenic tour through the lovely rice terraces and countryside outside of town to and from the farm. Pick up and drop off from accommodation in Ubud was convenient with pleasant drivers. The first stop, at the market wasn't really necessary or informative. On arrival at the farm (large garden) Wayan gave us a tour of his farm which was a good ice breaker. Then we cooked for 3-4 hours which included a basic Balinese spice paste plus 5 savoury dishes, stopping to eat lunch during this time! It was a bit rushed trying to get all the dishes done, and unfortunately we didn't have time to make any desserts (the staff made them and we got to sample). However I had a great day and the take home recipe book will be used very shortly :)"

Before the trip, we were planning the itinerary and wanted to have different kind of activities for our 5days there.We chanced upon this with excellent comments. So, decided to put that in.Not just a normal cooking lesson, but a complete one to experience Balinese style of cooking.First experience with the team already given me a very good impression. Wayan was the one I contacted for the booking. He was super patience with all my query. And provided the kind of assurance that we really looked forward to. We were met by one of the staff ( forgotten his name ) early in the morning who brought us to the local market. It was an eye opening for us especially the children who only know of modern supermarket back home.Touring round the organic farm was another hilight. We received so much information ( tour conducted by Putu ) while moving round the farm. Not a very big farm but we actually spend quite a bit of time there as there were so many things to explore. Different kind of veg, fruit trees, spices etc etc.the staff was so patience in explaining to us and never rush to finish it off.Then we were introduced to Kutuk, the handsome chef ! A very inspired guy. As we learn the various cooking technics from him, he patiently explain each ingredient to us and tell us story of how they start up with this school.We ate what we cooked ! Dish by dish. I can't described the feeling here but you really got to try this. You will not regret.The whole cooking class were so seamlessly conducted with the chef and the supporting staffs whom helped prepare and clearing.Thumbs up !Will recommend to friends whoever wants to visit Bali. This is one of the activities you should not missed.Once again, big thanks to Wayan, Kutuk, Putu and the guy who brought us to the market, as well as all the support staffs !"

I was picked up in morning from my home stay, we picked 3 more people on the way...we stopped at the Tegallalang local market to learn about ingredients and then continued our drive through the lush green countryside to reach pemulan Bali, the organic farm! It was breathtakingly beautiful, lush green all around. We got to pick our own ingredients from the farm that was used in cooking. We cooked some traditional Balinese and Indonesian food and ate them too. One of the best meals I had in Bali.. All in all I just loved being there and cooking with them. The staff are warm and friendly and Jhon is a fun instructor! For me this is a must have experience when in Bali.."

After reading reviews on tripadvisor, I contacted Jhon prior to booking and he was very prompt regarding my inquiries. We even got a discount for booking early! ($5 off for booking early). Class is at $35usd, and they can pick you up at your hotel too. This class is cheaper than the one offered in Seminyak so it's value for money alright. Although it was a 2 hr drive from Seminyak, Ketut, our driver was very pleasant to talk with and he was very eager to explain Balinese culture. Once we got to the farm, we found ourselves loving the place! The cooking stations is in one open pavillion in the center of their very lovely farm. You get to pick your veggies and herbs that will be used for cooking. The menu was a very good mix of authentic Indonesian food, and it was one of the best meals we've had while on vacation! There were 2 vegetable dishes, 1 fish dish, 1 chicken and 1 pork dish and dessert. You get the recipe booklet and apron for free too. A lot of the crew at the farm seemed to be related too, so it's nice to see getting family involved in their business. Everybody was just very friendly. We had an awesome day, and Jhon is such a good cooking instructor, with a good sense of humor to boot. Thanks for making our holiday memorable. We really had fun! P.S. They also have a mini shop for spices and some handy cooking utensils."

We were picked up from our villa and transported to the organic farm which is located in the countryside on a beautiful property full of organic produce that is gathered and used in the cooking class! The instructor speaks good English and is clear with his instructions as well as his transcribing of recipes in the booklet you get to take with you which includes all recipes plus the website address with additional recipes. The food was amazing and the teacher was more than accomodating to my partner who could not eat the meat dishes and substituted meat for tofu and Tempe. If you are looking to do a cooking class in Bali, please support this one, it is done from the heart and helps members of the community by providing wholesome food made with love and also an exchange type deal for English speakers who volunteer to teach English to those who cannot afford schooling costs. After the day finished around 230 we asked if we could be taken to a shop in Ubud before being taken to villa to which he was very accomodating and did not charge any extra.....a very enjoyable experience that I woulda love to do again a++"

The quiet seclusion, beautifully landscaped garden, outdoor cooking pavilion, bamboo music -- everything was perfect. We got to cook a good variety of dishes (6 in total, plus the bumbu base sauce), and our instructor, Wayan Jhon, explained all the ingredients and cooking concepts in great detail. When he learned that I love chayote (coko), he told me how the Balinese use it in their food and so now I have even more ways to make it! In addition to cooking, the staff also introduced their organic farm concept to us, all the different fruits and vegetables that they grow, and even let us pick some of the vegetables we used in our meal. Everything was so fresh and the food we made was some of the best (if not the best) we had in Bali. For anyone going to Bali, I highly recommend making time to check out this farm and taking the cooking class -- you won't regret it!"

We got to see and walk around the farm and learn about their organic farming techniques. We cooked 5 courses and it was one of the best meals I've had that I can remember. The day ended at 3:30pm and we were then given a surprise trip to the farmer's friend's cafe (Bali Pulina Agro-Tourism) overlooking the rice paddies where they make authentic Luwak coffee (which is apparently hard to come by as most are not the real thing). We took in beautiful views and were able to say we tried real Luwak coffee. Highly recommend this activity if you have the time."

That being said, maybe it would have been different if Wayan himself was teaching the class and not his kind, but inexperienced brother/relative.I don't want to knock what they are doing but the market tour was a joke. It was pretty much, this is eggplant. This is garlic, this is ginger, this is tumeric. If you don't know what these items are, or if you have kids who might have fun wandering around the farm picking their own vegetables, this might be the class for you. For myself, I'm a professional chef and wanted to learn A LOT more about the local cuisine and methods. This was not the class for me. I asked what some of the vegetables/fruits I didn't recognize from the local markets were and they weren't able to tell me because they didn't know the names in English. That's ok, not big deal. But the class/day was super slow paced and the menu items were not varied enough. This is not to say I did not learn anything at all. It was good to see some of the way they prepare the basic gede spice mix. But all in all, I think I could have spent my time in another class which would have been more well suited for me.Pros: On the way from the market to the farm they were kind enough to stop at the rice terrace so everyone could take a photo. It was nice to walk around the farm and see the vegetable growing in their naturally. The staff was kind and tried their best. I met some nice people who were also taking the class. Cons: I felt like I was being taught how to cook by an assistant who was not passionate about cooking. Forget the market tour, total joke, not even a good market that you could wander off on your own. For the price, they charge for things like beers and sodas. Only take this class if you are a beginner in Asian flavors or you have small children who want to participate."

As we left the market we were told that we were going to visit a coffee plantation on the way and enjoy the view as there was another group coming from seminyak. At 9am (two hours after pick up) we finally drove to the farm where we waited more time for the other group. Finally by 10.30 we started the boring tour around the garden as three hours after pick up we are just wanting to get things moving a little bit and get to the reason we were all there... Cooking! An hour went by discussing the produce on the farm in which we had already pretty much heard it all at the market anyway and we finally got to the cooking! The chef was knowledgable in the local ingredients but lacked any real cooking or teaching skills as he basically just came to our bench and chopped something and walked away expecting us to know what we wants us to do. Never explaining anything to the whole group. Food was okay nothing special, was put off my too much stuffing around In the beginning and got dropped off back at home around 4.30 as the driver was lazy and wouldn't take us home until he was ready.

After visiting the local market to learn about different vegetables and spices, you arrive at the farm where you carry a basket around and pick different vegetables and spices from the gardens as a guide explains to you what eat plant does. You get a chance to see the plants as they are grown and what different vegetables like various ginger roots look like. The ingredients we harvested from the farm composed about one-fifth of the food we ate, with the rest being already supplied either from the local market or picked earlier at the farm. I felt like we got a good education about the ingredients we were using.We cooked seven dishes in total. We ate our first dish around 10:30am and ate our last dish around 1:30pm. We were stuffed and were given leftovers to take home to eat for dinner. We didn't need to buy any other meals that day. Everything was super delicious. The chicken curry was maybe the best dish we ate in Bali. The bad part about this is that it made us critical of all of the other food we ate in Bali! The instructors were fantastic and very nice. They explained clearly what we were doing. There are a number of helpers at the cooking area and inside a prep area. Most of the vegetable cleaning, dish washing, and some of the prep work is done for you by the helpers. There were times when they maybe helped too much, such as preparing the batter for the fried bananas (pisang goreng) when we would have wanted to do that. But all of the dirty work is done for you so that you can focus on the fun of cooking. They give you a cookbook with recipes where you can take notes as you cook. My only complaint is that the cookbook was not very detailed, and we spent a good amount of time writing notes that should have already been in the cookbook.I cannot recommend this cooking class enough. What a fantastic day with wonderful people, great food, and great instruction."

Everyone gets a cookbook and then he runs around turning everyone's stoves on and off and saying 'add this! cut this!'My personal preference for a cooking class is one with more instruction and explanation upfront and then more independent cooking. That being said, if this is your first cooking class, you will probably love it! It was a lot of fun and great to meet the other participants."

All of the staff at the School are helpful, friendly and just lovely. Ketut is a great instructor with the right amount of fun and passion for Balinese cooking!

The farm is gorgeous, the class was great, some hands on, all of the drudge work done by others so you actually get through 7 courses during the day. My two complaints: the spices sold at the end are overpriced, and everything is priced in US dollars. If you pay in IDR, they give an astonishingly bad rate of 1:10,000, instead of the 1:12,600 it should be. Its a cheap and stupid move, that i hope they will soon correct."

Wayan Jhon and his staff were incredible fun to be around. Clear and serious when touring the local market and the farm to let us pick our produce and when describing the recipes. Fun and full of personality when helping us cook them. These are clearly folks who enjoy what they do and they make the whole experience a joy.And the food? The food was great too. We didn't need any dinner after all the meals we cooked and ate by mid afternoon. It's a good thing that the food is prepared conscientiously to be healthy; it's far too tempting for self control.Any place can teach you the details of the cuisine. Balinese Farm Cooking lets you experience the land and the people from which the cuisine originates."

Not only are the classes deliberately kept small (10 pax maximum), the class itself is set in a really nice organic farm and participants are taken around the farm to harvest their own herbs and vegetables which they cook during the class. Wayan, our chef explained that they're the only ones that have adopted this concept in Bali so far.Before the farm tour and harvesting, you're served a complimentary drink then led around the farm. Remember your mosquito repellent! Everyone in our group were bitten repeatedly because nobody thought to apply any.Then we broke away into groups of two. Each couple were assigned a cooking and prep station. First we made Bese Gede, a traditional Balinese paste that is used in practically every dish, followed by 4 savory dishes and a dessert. By the time it came to the dessert, we were all so tired we opted for the staff to make the pisang goreng on our behalf while we lazed around.The farm and kitchen itself is located about 30 minutes north of Ubud but return transportation is provided.The only gripe we had was the market tour. There were 8 participants and the guide seemed interested only in talking to and showing the front 4 participants around the market. We could not hear most of what she was saying. Also from the little we did hear, it seemed she was merely pointing out produce and going \"this is an eggplant\" and \"that is an onion\". The cooking class would be a 5-star experience if not for the market tour."

The Balinese Farm Cooking & Organic Farm stays a cut above that; it's that good an experience.Not only did we learn to cook a plethora of delicious Balinese cooking, but also get to eat them all. By the end of the day, we were thoroughly satisfied at the delicious meal we cooked. Before the cooking session, we were taken around the organic farm to harvest the raw ingredients, something which has inspired me to grow my own farm someday.The location of the farm is nestled within the Ubud greenery and once it started raining, cooking those delicious meal outdoors became an even more memorable experience.If you crave for some lesser food like a Coke, you can vend such stuff there as well but then again, why would you?"

The pick up in Ubud was around 7-7:30, because the farm is a few km up the Mountain. On the way to the farm you will visit a local market, but you will just go over it with a guide. All the needed ingredients grow on their farm. As soon as you arrive at the farm you have a tour around and will pick some ingredients with the chef. Don't think this is a 'smelly' farm, it is really pretty! It was build by the local farmers to grow organic veggies. However, since the marked for organic food on Bali is fairly small they created the cooking class with some chefs from Ubud. Now most of their products are used for the cooking classes. Also the facilities are extremely good and modern.We cooked in total 5 dishes. However, since we just did the beginner class, the first dish was just a paste which was used later on for some other dishes and the last dish, fried banana, was done by the chef. Nevertheless, it was a very nice day and we were really full. At about 3pm we were back at our hotel.The the way, you can keep the very nice receipt book and the used apron!"

The market was semi interesting, and we then headed to the farm to start cooking... Or so we thought. We had to wait for the rest of our group to arrive which took almost an hour/two. They did provide us welcome drinks however which allowed us to have time to chat to the other people on the tour. We then picked our own veg from the garden which was good, however the chef kept on repeating himself and it started to get a bit annoying. After lengthy (repetitive) talks about the herbs and spices used in Indonesian cooking we finally started cooking at 11:30 (5 hours after we were picked up). Throughout the day the chef kept on repeating himself (in broken English) - which was very annoying but eventually my boyfriend and I just made a joke out of it to keep us sane and we ended up having a good laugh. The food that we cooked completely saved the day- everything we made was delicious and came out perfect - and was very easy to make. Everyone enjoyed it!! We also bought some Balinese saffron and they kindly gave us an extra recipe book to take home as presents for family. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Great day to look back on and very glad we did it, however I would suggest they shorten the day considerably so there isn't so much waiting around and maybe changing up the chefs a bit too. Would recommend also eating a big breakfast before hand!"

There were only four people in the course in total, which allowed for plenty of discussions about food and food production in the gardens as well as Balinese culture in general. Our main host, Made, and the team made our experience very memorable, as we were given a guided tour through the organic gardens and were able to pick our own ingredients (Made\u2019s knowledge of plants greatly enhanced this experience). In fact, we selected this particular cooking course over the others because of this unique selling point. Furthermore, as vegetarians their willingness to help prepare vegetarian or meat dishes according to the wishes of the participants was important for us. In total, we prepared four meals and were given our own recipe book and apron to take home. The food was tasty and portions were large so it was difficult to finish them all! At one point we even had some light musical entertainment on flutes and xylophone, played by the some of the other workers. The cool thing was that the music had not been planned as part of the tourist event that we took part in\u2014we just happened to be lucky to listen to it.The entire experience from the punctual hotel pick up, through the market tour and later the garden tour, to the cooking itself was extremely professional. I would highly recommend this particular cooking course."

As a couple on honeymoon, we were very lucky to be the only ones on this course the day we went, making it a very enjoyable experience for us both. First we were picked up from our hotel by a very friendly local named Nyoman and taken to the food market. The market was an eye opening experience for us; there were so many different things available and Nyoman was a very interesting guide. When we got to the farm, we were taken around the grounds and shown a large selection of the vast amounts of produce they grow on site. We picked a few vegetables which we were then to cook with. It was such a beautiful place; it felt like real Bali and it was nice to get away from the crowds and the heat in the busy streets of Ubud. The cooking class itself was in an open-sided bamboo structure. We were each given a recipe book which we were then shown how to make 5 different dishes from, including a dessert. The food was simple enough to create, as we are not keen cooks ourselves but we still found it quite easy to follow, especially with such a good instructor! The food was delicious; before the course, my husband didn\u2019t like coconut and I didn\u2019t like banana. By the end of the day, we had both decided otherwise! We bought a few spices from the farm so that we could recreate some of the dishes at home - these were very reasonably priced.On our way back to the hotel, Nyoman took us to see where Kopi Luwak (coffee) comes from. There were stunning views out over the valley of rice fields and we enjoyed trying their different types of coffee while looking out. A great way to end our trip! We left our hotel at around 07:30, returned at around 14:00 and had our fill of more food than we could have wanted \u2013 I would say that\u2019s definite value for money!"

Staff were very responsive, from booking (which I did in Australia) to arrival to finish. We were super lucky that we were the only participants on the day we booked, so we had a special private experience. But even if we were in a larger group I believe the staff would have shown the same investment in its visitors as they showed to us. After coming back from the local market, with a short stop at the Rice Terrace Caf\u00e9 for some amazing views of terraced rice fields Ubud is famous for, we were greeted by Made (who we enjoyed seeing again at our hotel where he also works). He had a chat with us while we relaxed with a refreshing glass of ginger and lemongrass tea. Made then took us around the farm, not only talking about the produce and growing products but also about farming life and general Balinese culture. It was interesting to learn what vegetables are also used for medicines by the locals given that visiting a doctor or hospital is very expensive for many of the locals. The tour around the farm probably took around an hour, and we cut some things for use during our cooking and even ate some things right from picking. We then spent the rest of the day with Ketut for the cooking. The cooking \"hut\" was beautiful and added to the local traditional feel of the place, as well as provided much needed shade from the sun. Ketut is clearly passionate about growing organically, cooking, and maintaining local culture in his life. He is a very peaceful man and a gentle soul. We enjoyed his company so much that we asked him to be our driver for the week (his main job is driving \u2013 I think he volunteers at the farm because he believes in it, loves the atmosphere, and is intrinsically motivated to help the farm grow). Ketut has worked in kitchens in Bali and overseas (London, Perth), and you should ask him why he chooses to stay now in Ubud.We cooked four or five things from the recipe book (you get to keep the recipe book and your apron, which is a nice touch). Everything was sooooo yummy. I was glad I did not eat breakfast that day, and we were so full from the day that we did not need dinner. Ketut explained what ingredients could be substituted for other things if we were having trouble finding the listed ingredients back home. I cannot wait to make these dishes again when I return home. The two women helping Ketut were also lovely. They could not speak English as well as Ketut but have the same interest in the farm and in cooking and in guest interaction, but Ketut encouraged them to explain to us the making of the dessert, which they did a fine job with. After the cooking, Ketut took us to another organic farm owned by a friend of his who produces luwak coffee among other coffees and vegetables. This farm has a fantastic view of and is one of Ketut\u2019s favorite places to sit and stare at nature. The day was a big treat for us, not just in terms of the food! Great value as well!"

Very chatty and friendly like all the locals. Very good English. Very informative.The 20 minute drive to the farm and cooking school takes you away from tourist bali and into real bali. I was met by Mada Retu and began with a tour of the farm. I've been involved with permaculture for nearly 30 years and the organic farm is based on local knowledge and good design. I would call it permaculture but that word wasn't in their vocabulary. The farm is also very beautiful thanks to nyoman gardening skills and artistic flair. You get to graze on the plants which was great. Also gives you an idea of heat for the chillies you'll be using later. The birds eye chillies are exactly what you'd expect. Strong! Mada also told me about medicinal uses for plants such as guava leaf tea for bali belly. I haven't needed that so hygiene is good at the school. The only disappointment was that the durian was not in season. I shall just have to come back.The cooking class took 4 or 5 hours with a half hour break. I was surprised how well organised it was. you get a 40 page cookbook and all the prep work was done which i appreciated: I know how to cut shallots thanks. Yes they call a shallot a shallot. Not a spring onion in sight :)We made 5 courses including satay lilit using lemongrass stalks as skewers. I'm not going into detail. Do yourself a favour and book the course to get the secrets. You'll learn heaps. The locals will en trance you. And you'll get an amazing feed worth way more than the whole day out has costed. "

An absolutely brilliant experience, went with a mate who was a little unsure at the idea of doing a cooking course, but by the end of it we were both raving about it.Picked from your hotel you are driven out to a rural food market, this thing is huge, we walked around for half an hour and probably didn't see a quarter of it, also we were the only tourists there and I'm fairly sure not many spoke english. Your guide takes you through and shows you the various foods, and where the food is a bit exotic gives you an idea of western equivalents, he also purchases a few treats for you to try.From here you travel out to the guides home, he introduces you to some of his family and then gives you a tour of the layout typical to Balinese ancestral homes.It's then a quick walk out into the farmland behind, each section is owned by an individual farmer but the area is maintained as a collective. You are given a run down of the various crops grown, and pick a few vegetables to be used in the cooking.The kitchen itself is an open air kitchen on the hill overlooking the farms, you are given a run down of the recipes and ingredients and then its a hands on experience for there onwards.The results are amazing, the food tastes fantastic and it almost spoils you from trying the same foods at restaurants because you could only expect disappointment.I would strongly recommend this experience to everyone, you have the options of Meat, Vegetarian or Vegan experiences so there is something for everyone. Side note, I'm a vegetarian and my mate is definitely not, despite this he came on the vegetarian experience with me and still found it amazing."

We had heard stories from others that had attended cooking classes around Ubud, and did honestly not know what to expect. We were in every aspect positively surprised. First of, the driver were on time for the pickup. As Balinese have a more relaxed relation to time than westerners, it is always with anticipation I face pickups like this. But this time the driver where on time, and ha already done another pickup before coming to our place. We had, in our initial booking, requested to be in a group of no more than 10 people. As it turned out it was just the three of us that day, and that gave us opportunity to do every task along the way. The farm is an hours drive from Ubud, but I would highly recommend to take the trip instead of doing a home cooking inside Ubud. The farm is organically run, and they use no pestilence on their produce. On the way there we stopped at a local market to view the different produce for sale there. It was nice and the driver gave us a good walk through the market and answered all our questions about different fruits and veggies. Up at the farm we got a tour of the farm with information about the plants and trees. We got to know about herb use of the spices as we picked our own greens from the garden. Instead of buying at the local market it was really cool to handpick the different ingredients for the cooking. We then did five dishes first two that we ate, then two more and finally we did a dessert. The place was clean, the instructor spoke good English, the knives were sharp and everyone smiled and had a good time. I have no hesitation to give them full score and will go back there for another visit."

Then we arrived at the farm, everyone was very nice, the set-up is amazing, we picked our own vegetables and then we cooked. The food was better than any food I've had since I got here. I would recommend this to anyone."

The farm itself is amazingly beautiful..all kinds of vegetables and fruits are grown there (cocoa, bananas, pineapples, vanilla, carrots,.....). Before class started our very nice and entertaining instructor gave us a tour through the garden and explained all the different plants to us, plus we could already try everything and collected some ingredients for the cooking. The guy is fluent in English, which helps a lot.Our group only consisted of 8 people, which was perfect as all of us could really cook themselves. Btw the class takes place in an open bungalow directly in the garden. The view is so beautiful!We made 5 different dishes in total, including a dessert ( banana fritters :). As we had a vegetarian in our group one of the staff members cooked a dish without meat extra for her!!All the dishes were provided to us in a small booklet that we could keep!!!We really enjoyed this class, it was an amazing experience and we would recommend it to everyone who wants to get an insight into the traditional Balinese kitchen in an organic setting!

We learnt a great deal and more importantly, we also acquired much insight into the village culture and traditions of farming and food. It was very inspiring to be hosted by such vibrant young people who live what they believe and stay true to their cultural values . They also demonstrated much insight into the use of traditional food and cooking not only to promote good health. But also how food can be a medicine to manage chronic health. Which in todays economic environment where governments and insurance companies struggle to fund basic healthcare is becoming a vital issue for every one"

We try to be organic and fresh at home and when we travel, so to actually pick the food in the beautiful vegetable gardens and then cook it was a highlight for us. The teaching of the recipes was easy to follow with plenty of hands on and the results were absolutely delicious. We made a total of 4 dishes with dessert being prepared for us. It is a family set up so to see the children playing in the garden was a delight. Hosts were great, good English and very good knowledge of local herbs and their uses over which I was able to quiz at some length. Thank you for a lovely day."

We enjoyed the early morning market experience - it was great being with a guide and able to ask questions, as well as try the odd fruit from various stalls. Once on the farm, our small group (4 in total) enjoyed coffees before being shown around the farm - and in particular trying the different produce growing there - in a lot of detail. Really interesting. It was fascinating trying the different types of ginger, and even leaves, and noticing the small differences between them, and learning how each plant is used traditionally within both cooking, and often within medicine. Once cooking, we made 5 dishes in total - each were delicious. Really nice to be able to taste things along the way too, and see how small squeezes of lime (for example) can really transform a taste. We had a lovely time eating all the food of the course of a few hours. The tempe and dadar were my favourites (though tough to call!). Really recommended, and thank you once again!"

The driver took us to a market and we walked around a bit but the driver was passively stroling around. We already did great cooking classes in Thailand & Cambodia and the market tour was always a highlight. But it got wors when the driver lit his sigaret while showing us fruits. I did'nt like that and the tour started bad. But once we were at the farm another guide gave us a welcome drink and a tour around the farm. It was great, we chose our fruit and vegetables and got our hand dirty while picking them :-). It's a beautiful well maintained farm. We started cooking in an open kitchen. The cook was very kind and explaind everything. We made 4 dishes and 1 dessert. It was delicious... The best sate Ayam i've tasted in Bali. It's about 40 min from ubud. A great experience with great people."

The hosts couldn't have been more welcoming or helpful, answering all out questions and sharing very interesting information about the farm and food. We made 5 dishes, all delicious and more than enough food to go round. We were provided with recipe books to keep and given lots of extra detail as we cooked. The staff were keen for us to do as much cooking as possible, but always there to help and advise as needed. The only criticism is the amount of flys present, but as an out door cooking school we know there is not a lot that can be done. All the food is kept as hygienically as possible.Over all a fantastic day, highly recommended!"

It began with an hours journey through forest and villages just waking for the day ahead. Then followed a walk around a village market, high up in the hills. Villagers busily collected and bargained for their goods; vegetables, chicken and fruit. All the spices we saw were identified and explained for the next part of the day. For the first time since coming to Bali, I felt as if I was experiencing the real Bali.The farm was set in an organic garden of spices, papaya, banana and many other fruit growing beside mandarins, coffee and lemongrass. We picked our cooking ingredients as we walked and then made our way to the pavilion where tables were set out to welcome us, each with its own apron, cookery book and place setting.Several enjoyable hours later we had learnt how to make the all important basic paste for Balinese cooking, and had produced with lots of help from the excellent chefs, three main courses and chicken satay. All of this was eaten with great pleasure and satisfaction. We had fun, great food, learnt much about Balinese food and met delightful people. A great day, don't miss this experience!"

My mum and I had a look at the cooking classes on offer in Ubud and initially picked this class as it was great value (35USD) and was held on the farm rather than in a hotel restaurant. We didn't really know what to expect but were really impressed by this trip and had a great day.We were picked up from our hotel (15 minutes outside Ubud) at 7am and driven towards the mountains to a local village market close to the farm. Our driver took us round, explaining all the local foods and some of the traditions involved with cooking and eating. We were the only tourists there but everyone was friendly and made us feel welcome.The cooking school is an open-air pavilion set in the middle of a small organic farm. All the people working there are part of an extended family from the local village and were extremely hospitable and knowledgable. The level of English instruction was excellent, the teachers very patient and the cookbook and apron we got to take away were a lovely gesture.We started with a tour round the farm, looking at all the different fruit, veggies and spices grown there. Everything is grown organically and you got to pick the veggies that we were going to use later for the class.There were eight of us taking the class, so we were split into two teams of four and shared the cooking around two stoves. We were shown how to produce the spice paste base used in Balinese cooking and produced four meat and veggie dishes over the course of the morning, with giant banana fritters to finish. We were done around 3.00pm, so as well as being a really fun day, having transport to the hotel and a massive feed, we felt this was excellent value for money."

Balinese Farm Cooking & Organic Farm is located on a beautiful and unspoilt piece of land close to where the local villagers live. The land belongs to one of the chefs' family and is truly a community project - a source of sustainable income for the villagers, and an enjoyable way for tourists to experience an important part of the Balinese lifestyle... the food!!It's all in the family as Wayan's brother and the cute lady chef du jour (Ketut) took us foraging for edible greens around the farm and natural surrounds. We then prepared four popular Balinese dishes and one dessert over the next 2 hours. A book of Balinese recipes and our trusty black/white apron were not the only items we took away with us, as we felt so welcomed by Wayan and his team :) It was such a lovely experience for us and we would highly recommend it!"

You could easily spend a full afternoon browsing all the booths, but I'm happy that we had a guide to walk us through it and explain the different types of produce and variety of items.Next up was the actual cooking portion. It was so informative and they shared all the recipes, and we got hands-on experience cooking and chopping and making every dish. We were taught about the flavors, ingredients, and techniques. We made good friends with our group (they were very social, which made it so fun!) and at the end we enjoy a delicious (and filling!) meal!The only downside was the there wasn't A/C (it was in a shaded area though), and especially with the woks it got VERY warm. But there was plenty of cool hibiscus tea to drink to cool off - yum! At some points I got a little tired, so I just sat on the couch and enjoyed the afternoon. Participating in the cooking aspect of the class was entirely voluntary, so don't shy away if you aren't a big cooker (but are a big eater like me!).We would definitely take this tour and class again when we come back to Bali, as we greatly enjoyed it. I recommend it to anyone who likes shopping, cooking, or learning about cuisine."

Although I am vegetarian, I was able to enjoy all the food with the exception of the chicken satay (although there was delicious Tempeh satay).Now whenever we prepare Balinese food we reminisce about our holiday and at the cooking school. It is a wonderful memory to have and we will certainly attend another class when we next visit Bali. Since attending the class, we have prepared the recipes we learn multiple times, in particular the pickled carrot and cucumber which we eat weekly, and nasi gorang. Upon leaving, we purchase Janet's book \"Fragrant Rice\", which woke recipes into her personal story about life in Bali and the island rich history and culture. Highly recommend the book!"

Janet after reading your responses to other negative reviews for this tour I don\u2019t think that you get that people aren\u2019t complaining about the market, or eating at the market - it\u2019s about not getting value for what was advertised - especially after the buildup as to the range and quality of Bali\u2019s #1 Night Market we got from our guide along the way. I estimate that for 5 people - who paid around $210 AUD we consumed about $12 worth of food! Yes I understand you have to pay the driver - say half a day $25!  I would have been happier to pay just for the guide and information for less money.Bottom line it was not worth the money by a long shot. We had lunch including wine at the #1 Restaurant in Ubud on Trip Advisor for less. I would only recommend this tour is good value for a person on their own - after that just get a driver to take you to the Gianyar Night Market."

The setting was tranquil and beautiful with lots of lovely staff to help you. It started with an interesting and useful demonstration on all the local spices (who knew there were that many types of turmeric or ginger!) followed by us all preparing and then taking turns cooking. It was great to learn how the Balinese use these foods for medicinal purposes as well as listening to various local tales. The class was 15 in size and we all had a chance to do something - we even had a couple of MKR celebrities drop in! This was a Monday morning fish class and lasted from about 0930 to roughly 2pm. Not quite the cooking class where you prepare everything and cook everything just for yourself, rather this was more communal , more the Balinese way, but no less an experience and still very interactive. We prepared starters, 2 different fish dishes, 2 salads and some banana wrapped morsels. Professionally run, friendly, high quality and the results were so tasty.

            "review": "Great teacher, little bit hands off for skilled cooks. The cooking school was great with a awesome selection of dishes in the traditional range of Balinese food. I chose to do the Wednesday cooking class due to conflicting schedules, but was disappointed to not have individual cooking stations for the price and such a large class of mostly disinterested participants. Weird doing a cooking class with so many people that were not really interested in participating and were obviously roped into it by keen family members. Absolutely loved the chef teaching and would recommend her to anyone wanting to try to learn the art of Balinese cooking. Sadly I feel having so many people in the group so disinterested in cooking took away from the joy of a cooking class which I felt Yude tried her hardest to alleviate, with mixed results. I personally thought she was an absolute riot and loved her stories and sense of humour, but several of the participants missed the point so many times it was painful to watch (this is their fault and not hers). Overall I thought it was a great beginner's class which for me was a small problem, wanting to spend less time identifying Galangal (something I see everyday) and more time on the finer techniques of Balinese traditional cooking. Also made it quite uncomfortable to eat surrounded by people that didn't even wash their hands once and yet still prepared food I put in my mouth. Maybe a tip for future classes is mandatory hand washing before touching food. Makes chefs like me a little less uneasy.Despite the issues, would definitely recommend if only for a awesome face to face with Chef Yude and her helpers who were my highlight of the class.Thank you Janet, Yude and team!Andrew"

They run the tour on Thursday and Friday evenings. We met at Casa Luna restaurant in Ubud around 5.30pm with the tour kicking off at 6pm. They usually require a minimum of 4 people - my husband and I got really lucky and joined with a wonderful couple from Bolivia/Germany which made our trip all the more special. We were driven 20 minutes from Ubud to Gianyar which is where the district night market is located. We had an amazing guide who spoke incredible English and explained the customs and delicacies of the food there. We were shown as a group around the interesting stalls and stands selling food, flowers, fruit and clothes, sampling dishes as we went, with lots of opportunities to ask questions. Can't speak more highly of our guide or the kind local people who made us feel so welcome. The tour finished with a fantastic meal at a particularly good stand where a range of Indonesian dishes were washed down with some lovely iced tea. If you are used to a mild Western palate you will probably find the food quite spicy - enjoy! You will rarely find more flavour some treats on your trip. Thank you for an amazing time!"

First of all we had 5 minutes notice for our transfer pick up to the class (6:55am call to be ready and leave by 7am!) we left at 7:15 but we arrived 35min late to the class which still doesn't add up, we should of been picked up early and a msg should of been left at reception the night before telling us what time to be ready!When we got there we went to the food market and did a quick tour to catch up with the class the guide was very nice and When we got back to Casa Luna I asked one of the male cooks if he knew that my sister can't eat seafood.. He didn't so he looked at our paper work then wrote something down and said two beef? I said yes and thought the problem was fixed. I realize these two mistakes were done by the travel agent and transfer company and not your class but the last straw for that day was the way we were spoken to in this class.When we first started cooking the main lady cooking asked why we were late we told her and she went back to the demonstration, about 1 hr later some food was past around and the lady noticed everyone had some but my sister. She asked her why and my sister explained because she can't eat seafood and we're sorry about the miscommunication (I forgot that I had told one of the staff members in the beginning really wish I told her that!)She said oh no if she knew she could of done something about it.Then we moved on to the next step in the class.. More food was past around my sister didn't eat it again and the lady started the conversation again \"if I knew I could of done something but you didn't tell me\" I stepped in and said \"yes we realize this wasn't your mistake and we'll talk about it after the class\" she agree and said yes I need more information later.10 or so minutes later she came over and said \"I don't like your tour guide she's very rude to me\" the worst bit was she kept doing this in front of everyone in the class making it very uncomfortable and awkward that was the last straw for me and we walked out. The tour guide/driver was from the included transfer in the class meaning it had nothing to do with us! She should of sorted it out with the tour guide one on one or told her boss so she could sort it out with the other company.. NOT come over to us (the customers) and repeatedly tell us about her problem with the tour guide infront of everyone.It takes a lot for me to complain and I've never walked out of anything before in my life.. It ruined our day. So disappointed how this was handled.Ps anyone doing this class that can't eat seafood best not to do the class because using beef or chicken instead still wouldn't be enough there's shrimp paste, fish sauce and cut up eel in everything. If we where told this to beginning with we would of never booked it and this would of never happened. I suggest morning information in the ads next time."

I chose to attend the Saturday Food as Medicine cooking class as I wanted to learn more about medicinal properties of Balinese cooking as well as learning how to cook Balinese food. I'm a naturopath/herbalist and learning more about food as medicine interests me. The class started with information about the different herbs and spices used in Balinese cooking. There was very little information on medicinal properties of the herbs and spices, nor what illnesses Balinese people used the herbs and spices for. This was disappointing. Maybe the class needs to be renamed Vegetarian Cooking Class. We got to handle, smell and taste most of the herbs and spices in the food that was prepared. The plus side was we did make some very tasty vegetarian food. Even my non-vegetarian husband agreed the food was tasty and filling. The vegetarian food we prepared will be added to our home cooking. Unlike other cooking classes I've attended everything was done in a group rather than individually. Watching someone else cook in a wok or mix ingredients into a particular meal doesn't really teach you how to cook in a wok or prepare that meal. I prefer a cooking class that is more hands on. The teacher was funny and informative. The class was a lot of fun. I was happy with the hygiene at the cooking school."

As the market was 'changing' from a food market to a tourist market, which it does around 10:00am every day, we headed back to the cooking school for a taste of the local breakfast delights and a lesson in how to make hibiscus tea. Then the 'work' started. Our chef had a wonderful personality, was a great story-teller also with a good sense of humour. We got to chop and prepare vegetables and condiments for 8 dishes we ended up making, and then eating for lunch.

Constant jokes felt like we were her audience requiring feedback. I felt irritated by the constant laughing and jokes. I hesitated writing this because clearly she is a nice person, but I want others to know what to expect so you might explore another option that will better meet your expectations. As a sidenote, the restroom I used did not have hand soap which was troubling knowing we were going to be handling the food. They did find some soap once I asked for some. Overall, seems the growth of this groups businesses, may have contributed to a lack of attention to detail. This feedback also comes from eating lunch at Casa Luna the day prior and experiencing very mediocre service by unmotivated servers.

I guess having travelled in Indonesia extensively and having done tertiary studies in Indonesian culture and language we do understand the culture but we felt uncomfortable about the discussions on caste from the instructor. Mainly because she stated how she was a high caste and the owner was low caste. This made me feel a bit uneasy.The food was great and the vibe was good with people from many different countries in the class. We do like to hear a good story, however the dialogue was a bit tedious and a bit too comedic at times."

They serve a wonderful local style breakfast and then you go on to make lunch we did Nasi Champur everything from scratch of course and it was delicious can't wait to go back and do the smoked duck Sunday evening. It's hands on so get involved and have fun."

The guide was knowledgeable, funny and had excellent English. We were introduced to many local foods and crafts. From there we were taken to Honeymoon 2 where we were served Hibiscus tea and snacks from the market, which were introduced by our hilarious and friendly teacher, Udeh. The class had a good balance of preparing, cooking and eating. The menu gave us a comprehensive view of the main foods and food practices of Bali which was what we came for. The group size was manageable and we could all see what was happening.Very enjoyable morning."

We instantly liked the lady that took the class who was really easy to listen to. She spoke good English and had a very happy and vibrant nature. She made jokes and told short stories about her life and her love for cooking which she learnt from her mother and grandmother before her. She had an extremely good knowledge of the types of ingredients that are and aren\u2019t available to us in Australia and offered substitutes. I will definitely be giving the recipes a go at home. The food was out of this world!! Would definitely recommend this class to vegetarians but also to meat eaters that would like to try something new. The food was definitely not lacking in flavour. Next time I come to Bali I would be keen to try the market tour. Thanks Casa Luna we all enjoyed it, even my brother who is not overly keen on cooking. He was glad we convinced him to come. Thankyou and see you next time!"

We had visited the market before however we saw it through completely new eyes with our Casa Luna guide who introduced us to the local ingredients and delicacies. From here we walked back to Jl Bisma to Honeymoon Cottages where the cook school is held. When we arrived cold drinks, fresh fruit and morning tea was served to us. There were 11 of us who had travelled from Bali to the course and hailed from all over the world. We all chopped ingredients on wooden boards with Balinese knives then the lovely teacher and her assistant magically combine all of the ingredients into the most divine dishes. There were about 6 dishes in total. We sat at long table and enjoy a leisurely lunch together, while dessert was prepared for us. This class was the highlight of our holiday, lovely people, excellent personable and humorous tutors and divine food. We highly recommend Casa Luna Cooking School."

Nothing has changed!This tour is extremely overpriced. We were a family of 4 (12 and 15 y.o. daughters) therefore it was AU$160 or thereabouts. Can you image how much food that would buy at a Balanese market?!? \"just gouging\" is how my husband described it afterwards - we were both livid! The other problem was that the amount of insight gained from our guide on Thursday 1st October was minimal. We were a group of 10 and he was unable to contain the group as a cohesive group and impart much knowledge at all.This tour needs serious review.I don't appreciate being recommended it by our villa owner and it falling so far short of expectations.I am reliving my dissapointment with it as I write this when I had resolved to just \"put up and shut up\", pay the money and wipe it from my memory.I owe it to other \"punters\" to let them know too.Don't waste your money!The feedback seems to fall onto deaf ears."

Although there were about 15 in the class, it was very well organised and we all got turns to do different things. It gave a real insight into how labour intensive this kind of food preparation is - all the fine chopping, then hand grinding of the flavourings for the dishes was what took most of the time. The dishes were all very different in their flavours. The eggplant sambal was a highlight as was the fern salad, and the mie goreng was delicious - so fresh and full of flavour. Any cooking class here is definitely worth taking - was disappointed that all the others during our stay were fully booked."

It was enjoyable and we got to look rich and smell each spice we tales about. Then came the fun part of preparing all the food. We were shown how and then split up in small groups to split beans, grind peanuts, make chicken skewers, rice etc.It is not a day for kids up to 12 or 13 and even then they would really need to have an strong interest in cooking otherwise it would be quite boring for them. We had one very keen young man in our group but after 2 hrs he had really lost focus and his parents probably wished they had not brought him along ( for his sake)We got the recipes to bring home and we got to eat what we cooked which was a beautiful traditional Indonesian meal. I loved the freshly made satay from ground peanuts and spices. Highly recommend it!"

Fantastic!Together with just two other couples (for a total group size of six), our guide Pudi brought us to the night market in Gianyar just outside of Ubud. (We met at Casa Luna and then were provided a van to take the group to the market.) Gianyar is Pudi's hometown village and as soon as we got in the van and he started to talk about where we were headed, you could hear the pride in his voice.The Gianyar night market is the place where Balinese from all around the Ubud region dine for a special treat - and it is truly a treat! Stall after stall prepare their specialities from suckling pig to smoked chicken to satay and kebab to veggies and tofu and finally beautiful sweets. Date nights, family celebrations, and friend gatherings fill the seats in front of each of the stalls.Pudi walked the market with us, pointing out each of the dishes, explaining both the ingredients and the cooking method. He also shared with us how the Balinese chefs prepared the plates for their guests (including take-away options), and talked about how the family business operated to prepare the dishes and move their carts nightly to and from the market.We sampled dishes along the way, then sat down for a meal at one stall - and our meal included *everything* the market was selling! We were stuffed!!! After the meal we wandered a little bit more and again sampled along the way, this time the desserts and sweets.We could not have asked for a better experience! This market rarely see tourists and is truly how the Balinese cook and eat. And Pudi was outstanding as a guide - so affable, friendly, funny, informative and kind. He answered every question our group had - about the market, about Balinese cooking, about Balinese customs and habits, and about the Ubud region. If you'd like to escape the well-worn tourist roads - and restaurants - of Ubud and really see Bali and the Balinese culture around food, then this is your tour!Thank you Casa Luna for putting together such a great program! Well done!"

The tour cost approx. $40 per person Australian which was expensive compared to other tours we had done but we thought the feast would make up for the extra cost. Unlike our other tours we had to make our own way into/out of Ubud from our hotel. The driver and tour guide were both excellent and well informed. The walk through the market was informative. As we walked we were provided with a taste of a cake from one stall and a delicious omelette inside a crepe from another. After less then an hour we returned to a stall where we were asked to sit on the wooden bench and were provided with a plastic plate of food from the stall and either a bottle of water or iced tea. Turns out this was the open air feast!! Both my friend and I were concerned about the food handling and the risk of becoming unwell so we only had a bite of the suckling pig. After this we were driven back to the centre of Ubud. in all we paid $40 for a 2 hour tour, a tiny piece of cake, shared omelette and taste of suckling pig - not my idea of a feast :("

I have traveled to many Asian country's but never to Bali. after spending a week in Bali I absolutely Love the people ,the food and the culture ..myself and friend from school day's in Melbourne have had a brilliant time.. We had Lunch at Indus one day and we both thought it was amazing ,Brilliant ..We also had dinner at Casa Luna and I could not rate it high enough. ..so much so we went back for an afternoon tea and again for a lunch all of which were faultless . I commented on how Fantastic the staff .were how . Beautiful the food was the Decor also Stunning in Indus and Casa Luna. I pre booked the Friday Night Market tour prior to Leaving Australia and I was extremely excited about going.. .this was going to be the highlight of our trip.. .. I am gob smacked at the fact we paid equivalent of $40 Aud pp .. Yes I was expecting a market..this I have no problem with.. yes I know it is local food..this excites me.. to be honest we both felt there must have been some mistake.. we were led to believe we were doing a night market tour then having an open air FEAST.. to be fair the tour guide and driver were fine but that is where it ends.. a stroll through a market ok . 1 bite of a sweet and sample of 1 other market food then told we are having the suckling pig ..all we wanted was to try a sample . but to say we were going to then have an open air feast ?? sorry $80 for 2 people to share a plate of food we didn't want or enjoy has left me feeling like I needed to say something .. we were expecting to maybe go to another location a Wayan or a set location at Market and have Dinner. but no that was it ...??? Love Casa Luna ...Love Indus.. Love Bali.. But Market tour ..?? don't understand why the standard did not continue.. Sorry :-( Didn't enjoy"

We needed to check 2 days before the class to ensure it would go ahead as there is a minimum class requirement of 4 students. We thought there was a possibility that the class wouldn't go ahead. Our husbands volunteered to come to the class if the minimum number wasn't reached as they knew we were anxious but keen to do the class. The class was confirmed 2 days before.On the day of the class we set off into town to the class. We did however get lost on the way as there are no signs to indicate where the cooking school is. We nearly gave up, but asked for directions twice, kept going and finally arrived 30 minutes late. There were 11 other people in the class.The menu was typically balinese, very highly spiced. Students were able to contribute to the chopping and preparation. However I had some food safety concerns about the teachers cooking style. The class was a bit tedious and slow.Students were able to eat the food prepared at the completion of the class. There was plenty of food to enjoy and a booklet of recipes was provided.My friend and I were disappointed and cancelled the market tour we had booked for later in the week."

She was good at explaining all the different ingredients and having us participate in the preparation. Because smoking a duck takes so long, we started the proces, but actually ate ducks that had been smoking all day. Apparently the staff get a nice breakfast on Monday morning. The staff were kind enough to provide with mosquito repellent which is well needed. The food was great and included a bunch of side dishes: lawar, chicken kare, pickled carrots and yellow rice. The dessert was coconut ice cream with jackfruit and mung bean. Excellent class. If we had once complaint, it's that it wasn't 100% hands on... we helped chop all the herbs and grind the spice paste, but when it came to actually assembling and cooking the dishes, staff did most of the work."

The refreshing iced hibiscus tea was a life saver. We had a compatible group of German, Aussie and US guests who had a good time sharing the chopping, shredding and mashing to ready the seasonings for both the duck and the green bean/coconut dish. As smoking the duck takes four or more hours, we were shown the prep, but they provided the finished meat which was yummy. Seeing the mountain of rice hulls that added the smoke to the betel leaf to the seasonings, and then tasting it was great. Every dish was just of the edge of too peppery for me, but I loved every bite. Just made my nose run. If I'm ever back this way, I hope to be able to do the market tour class."

I've taken the morning market tour class before, just 3 months ago, and had a great time so I was keen to come again with a friend.We booked for the Sunday twilight Smoked Duck Class - the class size for this is smaller than the usual day classes and this works really well. I enjoyed learning about all of the different ingredients and being able to touch and smell all of them. We didn't get to cook the duck as it is smoked for 8 hours but we were shown all of the stages of preparation and cooking so we didn't miss anything. The instructor was an absolute stand out for me. She was so friendly and funny. I was curious about home life and family and she was happy to answer all of my questions. This lady is an absolute credit to cooking school and is the biggest reason why the classes are so great.This is not the style of cooking school where each person has their own station and cook every dish themselves from scratch - instead it is more of a demonstration where participants can join in and have a go at each stage. I much prefer this as it allowed me to relax and ask questions and just observe when I wanted to and it also allowed us to chat with the others in the class. We had a lovely time, met some great people and the feast at the end was fabulous.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Casa Luna cooking school to friends and I will certainly be back to try more classes when I visit again."

Although we did prepare the duck, we ate one that had been cooking in the ground for more than 8 hours. The people running the class were knowledgable and friendly and since there were only 3 of us in the class we got to do quite a bit to prepare our feast which we later ate. The explanations and the processes for preparation and cooking were clearly and simply explained and we were given copies of all the recipes. The second class started with a trip to the morning market where real Balinese people do their shopping. It was fascinating and our guide was helpful in pointing out all the sights and explaining the process to us. we then went back to the kitchen and prepared chicken curry and several amazingly delicious side dishes. There were 12 of us and we still got to prepare and cook as much as we wanted. We then feasted on all we cooked, again receiving all the recipes. I highly recommend Casa Luna cooking school. It's a great way to cook and eat Balinese food."

I had heard about Casa Luna, as Janet de Neef had spoken at Darwin festival, where I live and wanted to get some Indonesian inspiration- as we grow very similar produce and I love a good food story and also run food workshops/ projects. There are many cooking schools in Ubud and I am sure many of these are also good and worth checking out, but I had heard Casa Luna was a wonderful restaurant with great tasting local/ fusion food- and I was not disappointed at all. The food we cooked was the best I had eaten in my stay in the now sadly overcrowded town of restaurants and tourists and building projects. I attended both a Saturday class- Food as medicine (veggie) and the Monday class- Fish Curries etc. (see their website for menu details beforehand) The presenter, Aday was great, and I loved her stories and insight to a little of Bali culture. I felt, as a holiday cooking class- rather than full on, there was enough hands if you wanted and some parts were pre cooked/ prepped or demoed, which was fine by me. The ingredients were all explained and so fresh and local and the food we cooked both days was so delicious, authentic tasty Balinese, and in a beautiful setting. If anything I would have loved to know a little more about food origins particularly farming styles and organic methods or not) and on the food as medicine day, I did not feel more was explained about the health properties of the ingredients than the other class. We had small classes of 5 people, then 12- which was great and got to meet other food loving people. I would avoid larger classes- probably in high season, as I think it would be a bit inpersonal (maybe check the day before) Overall though I had a great experience and would love to go and check out the restaurant as attention to flavour was so good, and the Bali cook book is also a great read!"

I spent a wonderful morning taking the Market Tour cooking class on a Tuesday.Meeting at Casa Luna restaurant we have a group of around 15 people - myself, an American couple, a group of women from Melbourne and a group of women from Iceland. Our friendly guide explains that he will take us to the market, show us around and give us time to buy anyhting we want before brining us back to the hotel for the cooking school. We take a short walk to the market and we are guided around and he shows us different fruits and vegetables, spices and cooking equipment and explains them all to us. We are able to taste most things and given time to buy anything we want although not pressured to buy anything at all. It gets quite warm and we are standing for a while so I buy a fan to keep myself cool.We take another short walk back past Casa Luna Restaurant to Honeymoon Guesthouse for the cooking school. We are given morning tea - chilled hibiscus tea, cold water, a rice dish and a curry dish and some small pandan coconut pikelets with palm sugar syrup. We move on to the cooking and we are joined by Janet De Neefe, the owner, who takes over teaching the class. We are shown all of the ingredients we are going to use and Janet gives us a great background on how they are used in traditional Indonesian cooking. The class takes turns to chop and prepare ingredients then to grind them on large mortar and pestles then some of the class cook and assemble the food.Finally we are left with a large feast of food that we serve ourselves and sit down to eat together. Urab Pakis (my favourite dish of the day), Kare Tempeh, Sambal Tuwung, Sambal Matah, Sambal Goreng, Mie Goreng and Ikan Mekuah. Dessert of green coconut pancakes is prepared for us while we eat but we are given the recipe for this and everything else we made.How much you participate in this class is up to you - if you prefer to sit back and watch you can do so or you can get in and try your hand at preparing most things. You don't get to prepare every dish yourself from scratch as you might in other cooking schools but this is still a very informative and entertaining class. Thank you to Janet and her staff for being so friendly and welcoming."

Truly an amazing and eye opening experience people watching as well as learning about local produce and spices.At about 10am we were then guided back to the honeymoon resort and introduced to our teacher, Yudi who was lovely. She provided us with morning tea/breakfast of local porridge and gadogado before we started the class.We were lucky and only had a class of 12 ppl, apparently the smallest class is past couple of months being that we are now at the end of the high season. Perfect amount.After being assigned a chopping block and knife we were all given different preparation roles for various dishes which were on the menu.Tempe/tofu curry, Marlin fish curry, mie Goreng, fern salad, sambals, roasted white eggplant w tomatoes all amazing, as the group all sits down and enjoys at the end.Well worth the Rp350,000 for something a bit different and some delicious food.Open 7 days/week and each day has a theme. Tuesday was home local home cooking, but other days include vegetarian, traditional/ceremonial, basic Indonesian, currys etcWell done Casa Luna"

            "review": "Second serv!!. My husband & I returned after 2 years. We got so much out of the first visit that we have been having Bali nights in Perth with our friends & cooking up a storm ever since. Our friends & relatives have commented on how authentic the food tastes. Although the cooking school may not be as hands on as some people would like, I think it depends on what you want to get out of it. Which for us is watching, learning & listening and seeing the order that ingredients get incorporated into the dishes. We also like the fact it's only half a day out of our holiday relaxing time unlike some cooking schools which go on most of the day. We loved our second visit even though we repeated some old ground, it's always good to refresh. The setting is very Balinese & inviting, the staff are warm & friendly and when you think about value compared to other cooking schools, it really is excellent. Considering you get morning tea, unlimited refreshments & a huge lunch. I don't think the value can be beaten. We were lucky to have Janet teach our class. As we have eaten at all Janet's restaurants several times & I am a big fan of her book Fragrant Rice, it was great to meet her in person. She is a charming lady & very knowledgeable. We can't wait to return to learn to cook some more dishes!!!!"

She explained all the spices we would be using,the meals we would be cooking and talked about local traditions, dos and don'ts at the food markets.I did the Wednesday class which was cooking ceremonial food.Then it was down to grinding spices, grinding peanuts for the satay sauce, making the chicken skewers. Next it was down to eating what we made. Absolutely beautiful.Would I make it at home? Yes, but it would be far easier to get the spices out of a jar than gather up to 16 different spices."

First the good stuff: this cooking school is in a beautiful location in an open air kitchen surrounded by Balinese decor and architecture, the food was pretty good, and the staff was very nice. However, those two features aren't necessarily the keys to what I am looking for in a cooking school, and the negative aspects of this experience unfortunately outweigh the positives. First, the class is not at all hands-on, and I think the website is dishonest in omitting this from the description. In a 3.5 hour class, I think I got in three minutes of cooking: I chopped a few cucumbers, I smashed some ingredients into a paste, and I wrapped a fish in banana leaves. All of the prepping and chopping was done for us, the dessert was entirely made in advance, and even much of what we were supposed to be cooking was done in a separate room. I felt like I mostly heard an hour long lecture about spices. On top of that, our instructor Uday, who was obviously a very nice woman, spent at least 25 minutes (I timed it) talking about her kids, her education, her health, the number of boyfriends she used to have, how she adopted her child, her mother, etc. I'm not callous, but honestly, that was not appropriate for the class and the time could have been much better spent cooking and not listening to tales from her personal life. I don't know HOW this got onto some list of best cooking schools in the world: I've been to cooking schools in Marrakesh, Paris, Rome, and Washington DC and this was by far the worst."

I wish I had taken the time to read TA reviews prior to booking this activity, then I would've know that it wouldn't be enjoyable for my daughters and me. Our only other cooking school experience was in Cambodia. For $5 each in Cambodia, we spent 2 hours and prepared 3 different delicious Cambodian dishes with a total of 4 people. That was my point of reference when my daughters suggested we try a cooking class in Ubud. Unfortunately, it was what we were expecting to do (but for $30USD instead of $5).As other reviewers have mentioned, it's more of a lecture and demonstration. The first 1.5 hours were spent sitting around a table with 15 other people listening to descriptions of all of the spices and ingredients. The next 1.5 hours were mostly observing the 2 ladies in charge prepare everything. We were given brief \"turns\" to mash peanuts, dice cucumbers, and skewer chicken satays. These turns were mainly photo ops. You are by no means preparing a meal yourself.On the bright side, the food we did eat was fantastic. They were also gracious and invited my husband to eat the lunch also even though he didn't participate in the class. In hindsight, I would have much preferred spending 3 hours exploring Ubud, and then going to their restaurant for lunch. It would have cost much less than $90USD and would have been more fun."

We first did all the spice mixing of the different dishes, so at the end you don't remember what went with what. Second thing is the duration of the class, from 9 till 13, quite short if you are trying to learn.have said that, I will recomend this place to everybody!"

Throughout the cooking class there were plenty of different foods for us to try which were absolutely delicious!! We learnt a lot about cooking methods and Balinese culture, the staff pleasant and happy to answer anyone's questions.

We of course, got to eat them as well. The frangipani cocktail was particularly delicious. You can partly help out but mostly it's watching someone prepare the food in front of you. Janet, the owner wasn't there on the day and we had an excellent replacement. You do need to book well in advance. There are different menus on each day so you can choose a day that is preparing food you may like to watch being made.Cost is reasonable, I think it was $40 each and we took home a booklet of recipes which I've used since.Note: you will probably be with around 15 other people so it's not a private cooking lesson."

We did the cooking class with market tour on Thursday morning and I am really glad we did, because at the market we were told all sorts of little facts about the food, spices and utensils that are sold there and their purpose in Balinese life, which in my opinion really adds to the whole cooking experience. You also get the chance to buy some products at the market, but our tip is to go back by yourself another time to buy the things you want, because if you go to the downstairs area in the back, you get much better prices. During the tour however there is no time to stop there to buy too. Our tourguide at the market was a very friendly and knowlegeable guy, who made the tour a lot of fun, and looked out for us so no one would be left behind.After the market visit we went back to the honeymoon resort for the cooking class. First we had a short break with some refreshing drinks and a few Balinese snacks, which were delicious! We had a short introduction and the lovely woman who would be our teacher told us a little bit about herself (she is actually a stand-up comedian too!), which for me gave the whole thing a very personal touch. After the drinks it was time to put on our aprons and start preparing the food. We got elaborate explanations on the ingredients used and their purpose. Insights on Balinese cooking and family life were also part of the package. Everyone got a chance to participate, in the preparation as well as in the cooking. All the recipes and some information about the ingredients used were provided to us in a nice leaflet to take home.We all enjoyed the meal together with a nice glass of rice wine. During the meal they prepared our dessert, sago pudding, which was a perfect way to end the class. The 5 hours the class lasted just flew right by.Overall we are very pleased with the way the class turned out. The food was great, the market was educative, the cooking was fun, but what really made our day was the amazing warm, friendly, open attitude and sense of humour of the staff that provided the class. Chapeau! And thank you again. You really made it so much fun. When we will cook your dishes at home, we will definitely remember this class with a smile!We recommend this cooking class (especially with the market tour!) to everyone who is sincerely interested in cooking great fresh dishes and in Balinese culture, and loves to have a good time in the kitchen!"

I gained a real insight into local ingredients from our guide who is a local and a chef. I now know how to choose vanilla, the best mangosteen and am able to identify and know what all the exotic fruits and vegetables are used for. He also explained what European substitutes we could use if certain ingredients were unavailable. We also gained insight into what the local prices should be. The market tour was then followed by a hands on cookery class held at the Casa Luna bungalows. A really pretty property not far from the market. We were first served a traditional breakfast deliciously spicy porridge and a spicy rice cake dish. We learned how to make fresh curry pastes for the fish curry and the vegetarian curry we would make. We made a total of five delicious dishes. We then sat and had the best typical meal of the trip. If you like cooking and eating this is a top choice."

For $35 I received an education in shopping at the traditional market (before 10am each day if you want to secure the prices locals pay rather than enjoy a 50% increase paid by tourists!). Following the tour, the Casa Luna cooking school staff treated us to a morning tea complete with a demonstration for making hibiscus tea from a fresh flower. The cooking class covered the preparation of 5 mainstays of Balinese cuisine, including my favorite...Mie Goreng (fried noodles).The instructor, Yudi, shared tips and techniques for cooking Balinese food which she had learned from her mother. We learned the proper way to grind ingredients into a paste using a Balinese mortar and pestle as well as knife techniques for preparing vegetables without bruising them. The best tip, \"Cook when you're happy.\" From the energy and enthusiasm she demonstrated during the class I suspect she is ALWAYS happy! :-) The class takes place at the Honeymood Guest House down the street from the restaurant in a spacious beautifully decorated open kitchen surrounded by lush landscaping.The best part of all...we ate our creations for lunch!"

I have long been a fan of the food served at Janet de Neefe's restaurants in Ubud and so I was looking forward to taking the Monday class where recipes that I had cooked at home were being presented. These were more complicated than the basic classes and did not involve a trip to the market. I don't particularly like Asian markets apart from the fruit and veg section - everything else is too confronting and smelly for my pampered western senses.The location is quite easy to get to and is held at the drop dead gorgeous apartments that are just across the road from the older section of the Honeymoon guest house. We started off with a local Balinese woman who spoke excellent English giving us a description/background to Balinese cooking and the different ingredients we would be using. These were passed around our group of 12 people to sniff and taste while we waited for Janet to arrive. While she talked others were slicing and dicing the ingredients that would go into our lunch.Some reviews have complained that this class lacks a \"hands on experience\". This is true but as someone who does cook Indonesian style food I know just how much time it takes to prepare the ingredients and how dangerous the knives can be so for me it was fine to have others prepare while I watched in amazement at how dextrous they were with choppers/knives and cleavers. We got a taste of how much energy goes into the preparation of ingredients when we all took turns at grinding the paste. Janet was delightful as an instructor - she must have presented classes so many times but her talk was friendly, fresh, natural and responsive to our questions. And she does it all while wearing high heels!The food \"we\" cooked was delicious and I went away with greater insight into how the ingredients were sourced and how the food should be prepared as well as a booklet of the recipes presented that day.I booked this over the internet but did not pay the R350,000 each until we arrived in Ubud a few days before the Monday class."

The market tour criticisms are valid however im a solo traveller and just manoeuvre myself so I can hear the guide. In terms of my food knowledge I was more than satisfied and ofcourse really happy that Janet was present and to be honest they had to encourage food preparation participation. Maybe not so good for those that want to have a complete hands on experience. The food was delicious and im seriously hoping theres a room available when I return to Ubud in September. Suggestion - for those complaining about the market experience you must go to Vietnam and do Nevilles ' A taste of Hoi Ann' its a 10/10 experience"

I even booked our class 2 months in advance - that's how eager I was. So when I realised there were around 18 people in my class I was not jumping with joy. The market tour was thoroughly disappointing. As other reviewers have mentioned, it was more of a money making campaign for a few select store owners. We did not buy the ingredients for the food we were making, but did spend a good 10 minutes looking at knives and were encourages to buy a whole number of weird things.The class simply had far too many people in it and wasn't hands on enough. Because of this people's attention drifted (including mine) and began chatting to themselves.Although the finished product food was excellent, I really need to rate this the lowest of all cooking classes I have experienced across the globe.

This is very hard review for me to write as I have a high regard for Janet De Neefe who runs/owns the Casa Luna Rest. and Honeymoon Guesthouses and I love, absolutely LOVE her book Fragrant Rice - which I cook from at home all the time.I have done numerous cooking classes through out Asia and was really looking forward to doing a Casa Luna Cooking class. Unfortunately this was more of a cooking demonstration then a hands on class. Although I was hoping Janet herself would be the teacher (but wasn't), this was only a very small disappointment, as the teacher who gave the class had been with Casa Luna for some 20years and teaching for 10years. This teacher (a local Balinese) was lovely, very informative and understandable, and delightfully funny.To begin with, we all met at Casa Luna at 8am, walked to the market and had a tour of the market. The chap taking us was fantastic - really interesting! The downside was that we were 'encouraged' to buy items he recommended, but the food we were cooking was not purchased at the market whilst we were there - in all the other Asian cooking classes I've done in other countries, the produce we're cooking were purchased at the same time as the tour and we see how they choose the produce. We then all returned to the Honeymoon Guesthouse (which is absolutely beautiful !) and to my disappointment all the produce we would be cooking with had been pre-prepared. The only cutting required was of some beans and an eggplant. The only 'hands-on' the students had was taking turns (very short turns) in grinding the spices together and two students were allowed to stir the curry mixture. Most of the cooking was done by another staff member whilst the teacher explained what she was doing. Because it was a large class - 19 - and there was so much standing around, some people became bored and began chatting amongst themselves and this made it difficult to always hear the teacher. All the food was delicious and the recipe book we were given will be well used but I just wished there had been more hands on. I feel so bad giving this a low rating, but for the price I felt the experience was a bit of a let down. It's a lovely way to spend a morning - beautiful surrounds and delicious food but I have to say all that standing around doing nothing is also hard on the legs. I wouldn't recommend this as a cooking class but I would definitely recommend buying Janet's book as the recipes are fantastic and come out deliciously and I would definitely recommend eating at the Casa Luna Restaurant."

We learned to make chicken satay, peanut sauce, rujak salad, fried rice, pickled veggies, and fresh fruit cooked in coconut milk. All of the above was delicious. You can learn different dishes on different days of the week. They also offer a market class where you walk through the tradional market and learn what to buy. The Balinese have a really cool way of combining sweet, sour, salty, and spicy. It's a combo that we don't learn here in the US and unless you are taught which ingredients to use, you're at a loss. At least, I was. In addition, you learn about the benefits of each of those ingredients - lemon grass, 4 types of ginger, peppers, galangal, etc. The man who teaches is is very friendly, speaks great english, and he gives you little tidbits of Balinese culture throughout the class. It was only $35, included a meal at the end, and even a little glass of rice wine. You'll be given information on what tools you'd need for your own kitchen and where you are likely to find the asian ingredients back home in the US. The class is held on a beautiful shady, tropical plant surrounded patio with lots of fans, which is a nice respite in oppressive Indonesian heat! Pitchers of iced hibiscus tea (you'll learn how to make that too) are set on the table, along with ice cold water. I met a few Aussies and three Canadians. We had a great time chatting about our lives and travel adventures. It was a really lovely experience and I'm so glad I did it!"

I would have liked to have done the market tour, but as there was a special holiday the week I visited Ubud (Galungan) I only had the chance to do the cooking school on Friday morning which doesn't have the market visit. The lesson was very informative about ingredients and you get a little cookery book with the recipes to take away. I like the way you are given suggested substitutes f.or the ones you probably can't get at home. Most of the class is watching the teachers demonstrate rather than you cooking everything (as I did in Chang Mai, Thailand), but it was still a very enjoyable morning and I would recommend it. On the leaflet it said that the class finishes at 12.30, but actually that's when you sit down to eat. It's about 12.45 when you are actually finished. Food was delicious, especially the satay!"

The begining of the class we listened to the instructor explain the ingredients (which was very informative and very interesting) then she went on to explain to us how wonderful her boss was at every moment she could (said boss - owner Janet) then came and took over the class, which I found to be disrespectful and her tone wasn't at all becoming for a 'teacher'. The majority of the remaining time was spent standing around waiting to take our turn at chopping, mixing or grinding. There was no 'cooking' in this cooking class :-( The end of the class was great in that we got to eat the food in which we \"cooked\", this was fantastic!!! Although given a recipe book which gives instructions on how to cook the dishes we were taught, there is a very slim chance I would be able to make these dishes at home.A lovely day in the beautiful surrounds of Ubud, however, I wouldn't be in too much of a hurry to go back."

If it was called a cooking class, then visitors may be more informed as to what to expect. Firstly, Janet was not present and while the Balinese chef was bright and cheerful, we were expecting to meet Janet. Visitors really do not participate in the cooking of the dishes, except to prepare a few spices, as many of the ingredients are already prepared and the chef does the cooking. We were in a \"class\" of about 20 people and we ate the dishes at the end of the demonstration. I believe that it was a \"fun\" morning spent, but we came away not being satisfied that the main chef (Janet) did not even greet us, let alone prepare any food.For new travellers to Bali, it can be recommended, but treat it as light entertainment."

I took one of Casa Luna's cooking classes more to understand Balinese food and what I like and don't like, than to replicate the dishes at home. I took a second class at another restaurant-and-cooking-school as well. Both classes were about 15 people, and surprisingly, about half were men, so men shouldn't feel intimidated about attending.Both classes were a mix of lecture, demonstration, participation, and meal. The Casa Luna class was informative about the ingredients and cooking techniques, the surrounding are charming, and the food was very flavorful--probably among the best I had in Bali during three weeks. Considering all this, the price is very reasonable. For me, the highlight of the class was a Balinese staff member going through the many fresh herbs used in the cuisine, as well as some of their uses in natural medicine. Several of the ingredients will be familiar to those who know other Southeast Asian cuisines, but there are some unique ingredients as well. Four types of ginger are used, for example. The richly colored native coconut sugar is unforgettable (If anyone reading this knows a mail order source in the U.S. for the first grade of gulab Bali, please let me know).There were more opportunities to participate in this class than in any of the 3-4 hour, introductory ethnic cooking classes that I have attended in the U.S. with a similar number of participants. Many of the cooking techniques--sauteeing, frying, steaming, simmering--are familiar to anyone who had done some cooking. With the guidance of Balinese cooking staff, several class members tried their hand at the more unfamiliar processes, such as grinding ingredients for basic curry paste on stone mortar and pestle, and making packets of food from banana leaves for steaming.I highly recommend the experience of a Casa Luna cooking class. And don't forget to visit their restaurants in Ubud--Casa Luna and Indus--to taste more of their wonderful food. If you like Thai food, as many people do, well-made Balinese food will become your new favorite!"

Theere was a chance for everyone to have a turn at something if they wanted.We got to eat the food for lunch and it was very tasty.... plenty of vegetarian options but for someone like me who doesn't like even slightly spicy food, I stuck to the rice and mie goreng as the rest was a bit zingy for me.

One of the \"students\" did question the amount of palm sugar used and Janet's response was something like \"everything is good for you in Bali\". I was also a little concerned about the high oil content and would have liked more advice on how to keep oil/sugar lower whilst maintaining flavour. We've been visiting many highly rated restaurants while in Bali for 2 weeks and we notice that they seem to use less oil/sugar/salt and still retain the flavour. There weren't many opportunities for hands on practice so that was a little disappointing too. The size of the group was good and we were inspired to return home and try more recipes from Janet's book. Many thanks to Janet and her staff!"

There were only two cooking stations so when we were encouraged to help out everyone (15 in the class) took turns. Other places I've taken cooking classes we started at the market (which they do here just twice a week), the classes were smaller (5-8), and each person had a cooking station where we prepared the food we would actually eat. It was much more of a learning experience than this. The lunch the staff prepared was delicious and the information they shared was interesting. The conversation with friendly tourists sitting near me from the UK and US was very pleasant. Since there was time to chat while the staff cooked it turned out the side conversations were a highlight of the class, not what I'd expected based on my previous experience with cooking classes elsewhere. All in all it was a pleasant morning but perhaps should be advertised as a cooking demonstration to eliminate higher expectations."

Excellent guided tour of the produce market and then transported to the cooking class venue where we were shown a multitude of Balinese traditional dishes in a Balinese family home. Well set up with individual cooking stations and seating in a private setting. Would thoroughly recommend this as part of your trip to Ubud."

            "review": "Home Cooking In Bali. Having sampled the delights of cooking in a Moroccan kitchen in June, my recent trip to Bali could only be enhanced by a similar experience. I love South East Asia, the people, the culture, the climate all fascinate me. Above all I love the food with its light, citrus and herby flavours and an emphasis on ginger, galangal, tamarind, coconut and lemon grass. The region has also embraced many outside influences in terms of its cuisine. From the filled French baguettes of Vietnam to Indian influenced curries and spicing from Persia. Protein choices include fish, chicken and tofu with beef and pork served mainly for the tourist market .Prior to departure I trawelled the internet looking for an authentic Balinese cookery class and found the Jambangan Bali Cooking class. What appealed to me about this school compared with the others I found was that they take you a Balinese market prior to class and introduce to the ingredients you will be using. Also that it takes place in the home of the school\u2019s owner, Rakesh.On the appointed day we were picked up at our hotel at 9.30am by Rakesh and driven to the market. During the journey we passed many paddy fields and he explained that each home owns their own field, where they grow the rice for the family. The fields will produce two crops per year with a yield of about 100kg of rice. The crop takes five months to plant, grow and harveste, then in the fallow month the family will put their ducks into the fields to eat the insects and fertilise the ground. I asked Rakesh how many grains of rice an average plant will produce and was surprised to find it was only between 10 and 15. Traditionally the Balinese eat rice with every meal, even breakfast. It is their staple food.On arrival at the market we met some of our fellow classmates; a jolly bunch hailing from all over the globe. Rakesh\u2019s cousin, Capung, himself a chef showed us around the market stalls and explained what the various goods were on show. Capung means dragonfly in Balinese and the name suited him, as he darted about and made us smile.After the market, we were driven to the house where we were welcomed with a cool drink and Rakesh explained the layout of a traditional Balinese compound. There isn\u2019t one house in the complex but four and each has a different purpose. In the south is the wedding house, which the family use for eating and celebrations. In the East is the honeymoon house, where the newly weds start their married life. To the North is the children\u2019s house and to the west is the kitchen house. There is also a temple, usually built before the houses and the rice house to store the family\u2019s food supply. At this point another group of pupils arrived, a gaggle of elderly Australian ladies who were travelling together. Once everyone had settled we were introduced to the lady who was going to be our teacher for the day. Our first task was to weave an offerings basket, which we did to varying levels of success and then fill them with flowers, in order to bring success to our endeavours in the kitchen. The kitchens themselves were open air, although with a roof and the lady went through dishes we were going to cook.Vegetable Soup - vegetables and mushrooms in a chicken brothSate Empol - traditional minced chicken kebabs with a peanut satay sauceLawar Bali \u2013 an Indonesian salad Gado-Gado \u2013 an Indonesian salad of steamed vegetables, tofu, hard-boiled eggs served with a peanut sauce.Tempe Manis \u2013 Fried soya bean curd in a sweet and sour sauce. Ayum Curry \u2013 This is nothing like an Indian curry. It is much more delicate and fragrant than that.Tum Ayum \u2013 A popular Balinese dish of chicken steamed with spices and coconut in banana leaves and finished on the barbeque. This dish is often made with fish too. Banana and Jack Fruit with a caramel sauce. \u2013 The fruit is poached in water, sugar and cornstarch and served with a palm sugar caramel sauce. We were soon split in to teams and put to work slicing, chopping, and mixing, using traditional methods, with not an electrical gadget in sight. The chicken was put into two big stone mortars on the floor and then pounded within an inch of its life with two 6-foot long wooden pestles. We were certainly working up an appetite. Between us we created the base of a lot of Balinese cuisine, Basic Yellow Sauce, (or Gede Bumbu Kuning). It is a mix of shallots, garlic, turmeric roots, candlenuts, galangal, ginger, chillies, lemongrass, spices and palm sugar and it is fragrant and flavoursome.The first dish to be finished was the soup and once dished up we were invited to sit at the large communal table in the wedding house and enjoy it together. It was light and delicious and we soon got to know our fellow diners, who included natives of Korea, Japan, Germany, Denmark and a Geordie lass.Then it was back to the kitchen to prepare our main and dessert dishes. Everyone was encouraged to get involved, taking it in turns to cook and add ingredients. The Sate Empol kebabs were shaped from balls of the chicken mix on to flat bamboo sticks and then cooked on a BBQ over smoldering coconut shells. The Balinese certainly don\u2019t believe in waste, using the whole of the palm tree and its fruit in one form or another.Again we sat at the communal table and enjoyed our feast, with a cold Bintang beer and a feeling of self-satisfaction that we were all now authentic Balinese cooks.After the meal was finished and with no washing up to do Rakesh drove us back to our hotel. This fabulous, fun-packed, educational day, with transport and a full belly, cost us the grand sum of \u00a322. An absolute bargain and the best day out of our trip."

My wife and I decided to take a cooking class recommended by our honeymoon driver and we were very happy with this activity!After picking you up at your hotel, they take you to a market where you take a quick tour of what ingredients you'll be cooking for each of your dishes. It was interesting to see how people buy their ingredients in an open market instead of grocery store.After the tour we were taken to a house that was setup as the cooking class. I liked the idea of them using their actual house as the activity spot because it helped add to the Balinese environment and true home cooked meal. The main teacher was so cheerful and upbeat it actually made the cooking part fun. They show you the true Balinese way of cooking without blenders and machines. Plus it was cool to see how certain things are made from scratch as opposed to buying it ready made in a grocery store. It did take a few hours to cook all the dishes but if you look at my attached photos there were a lot! In all, the food ended up tasting great! So many dishes and flavors it really felt like a home cooked meal. Would 100% recommend this to all couples and even the singles because it is fun, culturally fulfilling and the food was amazing!!"

We ate so well our whole Bali trip, but this was the best food we had by far.We went as a group of four and teamed up with 8 others to make a group of 12. The beautiful Balinese house was made to fee like we were relatives visiting our Balinese family by the lovely hosts. The food we made as a team was authentic and flavoursome, but most important was the attention to details.Why this class is great...Obviously, you learn amazing recipes but also:We learnt about the food production, such as making your own coconut oil. We were made to be food safe, so we were given many utensils, aprons, gloves and instructions in English.Half of our party was vegetarian, and this was catered for with a vegan menu that ran alongside the meat menu. Yes, that's right we learnt two kind of meals, and I've never tasted vegan food that was so delicious.We had our morning class on Kuningan, a Holy holiday for the Hindu people of Bali. The cooking class still ran, and the family came back from the ceremony halfway through the class. This meant we were able to discuss Balinese culture and see the beautiful sarong attire that everyone wears during this day. The hosts were great about this, and made us feel welcome to talk with them about the day.During the whole class bottled water is supplied so you. Stay hydrated in the hot Bali weather! Also the weather is not a factor- it's all undercover in a big tiled open air kitchen.Thank you Nyoman and family for a lovely morning, great memories and delicious recipes!"

The next day we were picked up from our hostel in Ubud on time (which was a first for us in Bali ;)). When we arrived at the house we were welcomed very warmly by our cooking instructors. It is a family business so every family member has a different task. It turned out that we were the only two who signed up for the evening so we received a private cooking lesson. The women were very friendly and explained everything very well. The food was extremely tasteful, it turned out to be the best food we had during the whole three weeks in Indonesia!! Besides the cooking we learned also a lot about the Balinese culture. I would certainly recommend this cooking class and hope you will have a really nice and tasteful experience too. Last but not least, at the end of the evening you get a booklet with recipes of all the food you have made..so you can try to make the delish food once you return back home :)"

Its about 20 minutes from the centre of Ubud and when we got there we had a coconut drink waiting for us and then given a tour of the grounds by the very friendly family.After that we started preparing the various meals. You needn't take notes as they give you and English version of the recipes later. You can get all the ingredients at home but you will need to visit Asian and Indian supermarkets. We made the base genep (yellow) sauce and had fun with Balinese Kenwood Chef.Once the genep was made we cooked the following meals: a spicy clear vegetable soup, sate empol (cooked over burning coconut shells), steamed fish in banana leaves, chicken curry , tempeh manis, gado-gado , lawar bali and finally the desert Kolak Ubi.We were totally full after eating all that and after about 4 hours we were taken back to our hotel in Ubud."

After the market we were taken to the Balinese home for the cooking class. We learnt about balinese culture, religion and family traditions and also had an opportunity to as many questions.

If you take the morning class you'll go to a good market which has much more to do with the cooking class.) The cooking class is held at a traditional Balinese family home, so when we arrived we got some information about these traditional houses first, which was really interesting because I'd never heard it before. The women who helped us with the cooking were also super friendly, and spoke English really well. They worked like a well-oiled machine. We needed a little more help than usual because we were only with the two of us. The food was delicious and the staff super friendly. It was way too much food, so it's a shame that we had to throw it away :(They gave us all the recipes printed on paper so we could make it at home. Can't wait!!

The sights, sounds, smells... really was a blast. Each ingredient we would later used was explained as we toured by our guide. After our time there, we were shuttled back to their home, and we are immediately \"put to work\" in the kitchen prepping food. We prepared around 8 courses and a dessert. Every ingredient was prepped by us, under their instruction. We also cooked everything ourselves, tasting as we went. Have to say, \"our\" meal was one of the best we had in Bali, and we really learned the techniques to make these dishes at home. My son even learned how to carve a crab out of a cucumber!The staff was friendly and efficient, always there to help guide you but making sure you did it yourself.

Still, the fun parts you can do yourself, the dishes and boring preparations are being taken care of.

After that we went to the house where we joined two other couples. We were warmly greeted and got a drink while the family was sorting ingredients.The class was great fun, every step is explained well and you can ask questions as much as you like. Everybody gets a task so that nobody is standing idly by.Because of this, you can not make many photos yourself but the hosts will ask if they can use your camera so you still get some nice action shots.The food was delicious and afterwards we received the recipes. After some more chatting we were brought back to our hotel. It was a great experience!Sidenote: On various websites there are people complaining about not visiting the market in the afternoon. In their brochure it clearly says this is only in the morning class and when asked at booking they also say this. The reason for this is that there simply is no market in the afternoon..."

We walked around and they explained all the local spices, fruits and vegetables. They also explained about Balinese culture and facts about the buildings in their house. The cooking class itself was so much fun! Rakesh and his whole family was so sweet and welcoming and made jokes the whole time and volunteered to take our pictures. It's a real family run business and totally worth it! We loved Rakesh so much, that we asked him to take us on a day tour the next day (which was also amaaaaazing: temple, waterfall, lumak coffee, spring temple, art gallery, rice terraces, monkey forest all in one day!)"

I've done cooking classes in other southeast Asian countries and this was the best one by far. It's a family run business and they bring you into their family compound. They take you to the local market to get the ingredients then they welcome you into their home with refreshing drinks. We started by walking around their home and their personal temple- they all made us feel at home right away. The cooking class was hands on and we learned a lot. They teach in a very fun and interactive way. We made 6 or 7 dishes using traditional tools and everything tasted amazing. It's perfect for kids, backpackers, families, anyone. Highly recommend this school! You won't be disappointed!"

We visited a coffee plantation before heading back to their house where we learnt about Balinese culture and traditions, made offerings, prepared and cooked the food as well as tasted it. The afternoon session was great as we were in a group of only 5 people (the smaller the group, the better). This was great value for money as we got to make 8 different recipes and try everything. The food was fresh and the family were so friendly and welcoming. They share a great passion for what they do and were always so helpful and enthusiastic. We definitely recommend this experience for anyone, of any cooking ability as we had a great time and would do it again."

We learned to make the offerings but they didn't turn out as nice as the Balinese make them ;) we made 6 nice dishes adapted on allergies etc. We got to do the whole process, from cutting to cooking and the best part... eating. We'd hardly recommend this cooking school. It's a family business and they make you feel like at home. Great day, lovely food and really nice people. Go for it :)"

This was so interesting as we were taken around by a guide who explained the process of coffee making and even provided us with a sample of around 24 different flavours of coffee and tea for free. We got to try lots of new and exciting flavours and as a tea lover I really enjoyed sampling new and traditional flavours. After this we went to a traditional Balinese house to begin the cooking class. Throughout the class the hosts were so so welcoming and very very kind. We learnt a lot about traditional cuisine and about traditional familylife in Bali. There was only three of us on the afternoon course and we made around nine dishes and the amount of food was very generous. All transport was included and we were given bottled water throughout.Having been to cooking classes before I must say this is one of the best I have been to! The staff could not have been more helpful and welcoming. If you want to visit the market make sure you book the morning class. The morning class does however tend to be busier so if you would prefer a smaller group go for the afternoon slot!Highly recommend!!!"

We did a morning workshop, picked up at our hotel and headed to the small local markt in Ubud for some ingredients, not an extensive visit as the market is quite small but good to walk around. Our group (6) were the only foreigners at this time. From the market we went to the coffee plantation ( I guess this is a standard thing in all the tours or workshops you do in Ubud, it's nice to see it once, but at the end is more like a sales thing) Back to the workshop: We arrived at Rakesh's house, and were greeted by his sister Made, who's in charge of the workshop. After getting some refreshments and a \"lecture\" on the family tradition and house planning, we were taught how to weave the baskets used for the daily offers in front of the door. Loads of laughing as most of us did struggle trying to make a presentable one. The workshop was great, the way that was run was really good, everyone got the chance to do something, even my kids (13 & 16) were working hard to deliver a nice Balinese meal. The food was just great! I'll give the highest rate to Jambangan and want to thank Rakesh, Made and the whole family for allowing us to be part of them for a couple of hours.Do not look any further, just call them and book the workshop, I'm sure you would love it!"

All before the actual cooking class were we learnt to make a delicious Balinese 9 course cooking course - even teaching us how to make nasi goreng on our request - which was simply taught and easy enough to recreate at home with the recipes they provided.He was then kind enough to take us on an VERY reasonably priced tour the following day to a few sites of his and our choosing (temples, rice paddies, art market, funky bars and restaurants) whilst taking care of us (4 young women) and our bags.Two of my favourite days in Bali thanks to Jambangan Cooking course!

The price point is cheaper than hotel based yet the service is excellent. The facilities are clean and very smoothly operated.

Madi and her brother even whipped up a surprise birthday cake for one of the guests to serve after lunch. A wonderful time from the beginning to the end. Value for money and highly recommended."

The class includes the following:Pickup from your lodgingVisit to market to see ingredientsCooking lessons in a traditional Balinese family compoundEating the meal the cooking class preparedPrint outs of each recipeTransport back to your lodging While a visit to the market shows you the ingredients you\u2019ll be cooking with, if you are familiar with ginger, turmeric and galangal, there really isn\u2019t much more to learn. I\u2019d be happy if this section of the class was cut out to shorten the day. We had a tour of the family compound which included information on the Balinese culture and offering customs. This was interesting and very informative. The class itself was very informative. I would have liked to make each meal myself. Instead we were put into groups to make different items. It would have taken forever to make all the meals by myself so I understand why we had to divide the labour in groups. Having recipes to take home made up for not making each menu item myself. Some of the meals we made were:\u00b7 Snake bean and coconut salad\u00b7 Chicken Satay sticks with peanut sauce\u00b7 Vegetable soup\u00b7 Chicken Curry\u00b7 Yellow curry base\u00b7 Gado-Gado\u00b7 Fried tempeh\u00b7 A banana desertThe instructors were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The facilities were nice and clean and there was ample space. The group was about 15 people. It was a long day. We were picked up at 9am and arrived back at 3pm. I feel like these lessons were good value for money."

There was no additional charge and no pressure to buy. We were then welcomed at the family run Jambangan Cookery School with fresh coconuts before learning how to cook a delicious 3 course feast - the family were friendly, chatty, informative and the whole experience was well worth the 350,000 we paid (\u00a318).

They gave us a quick tour of their house (yes, the cooking class is based in a traditional Balinese house which they stay in) before we started cooking. The lessons are suitable for people without much cooking experience like us and we were given a choice to customise the menu based on the group's dietary requirements. The lessons were very hands on and we were involved in every process. Food turned out to be tasty which is an added bonus."

It was a fun morning as we learned about Indonesian everyday family life and some of their family history. We were taught how to weave banana leaves into mats and we were guided to prepare much of the meal ourselves. We even learned how to carve decorations from vegetables.

From the pick up to the activities (as there is more than just cooking to be done) to the actual food. I really enjoyed myself, the only reason why give I 4 and not 5 points is because I would have enjoyed it even more if everyone would have prepared their own dish from start to finish (rather than have the group split to work on different parts of the process).I did a detailed write up of the entire day, which can be found here: https://nowornever2015.wordpress.com/2015/08/02/acquiring-balinese-cooking-skills/#more-1506"

Cooking class very well organised and good variety of dishes (8) cooked and eaten as a group, meanwhile a lovely insight into a typically beautiful Balinese house.The food we cooked tasted better than any of the equivalent dishes we ate at restaurants in Ubud town. Most other classes advertised picking participants up early in the morning to go to the local market in full flow, drop back at their hotel for breakfast and then pick up again late morning for the cooking class. Jambangan instead collect in time to see the market still in operation so that you can experience the full cycle but not so early that it is so busy that you feel slightly in the way or interrupting the locals actually running their business and then straight back to their home for the class. The whole family involved in helping were great. I would even go again if I am lucky enough to go back to Ubud. (Also, see Warung JB which had just opened when we were there)"

We happened upon this class by chance as they would accommodated a vegetarian during their regular classes, absolutely no regrets, it was fantastic! We were picked up early the next morning, joined by three friendly Australian women (so a small group of only five) and off we drove to a nearby village where we started with a tour of an authentic local market. We tasted fresh fruit, ambled along the colorful stalls, sampled some fresh mini pancakes and picked up some last ingredients for our class. We were then taken back to a nearby village, entering a family compound. It was a great way to see traditional lifestyle, our class was indeed a family affair with different members assisting in various ways. They were extremely friendly, pedagogic and ensured we all got our hands dirty, chopping, stirring or grinding. The resulting feast of our labors was divine. Not only did we have this unique window into Balinese life and cuisine, we also learnt more than we would during some of the other classes in town that are more of a demonstration."

Met a very nice family, got things explained about their house, and had a nice cooking course. Of course you don't do all the work yourself. It is being divived among the group members. I was traveling solo and that was fine too. The food tasted amazing, maybe because you help prepare it. And gthe best thing is: you don't do the dishes! We had a little event extra. The prince of the village had died and the ceremony started in fornt of the house where the cooking course was. Impressive!

Afterwords they show you all the ingredients if all the meals on different plates that you understand what you'll cook. It is an awesome experience to prepare everything by yourself and learn about their cultures. I like balinese food a lot but the own made one was better than all i had in the restaurants. Maybe because the food quality was better or why i knew how it was prepared! Of course eating was the best part. the end their provide you a recipe too cook everything for your family at home."

The family compound was interesting with explanations for how Balinese family units work and visits around the gardens to the different buildings. Cooking facilities were very impressive. Branded aprons and bottled water show how professional these guys are. We cooked mushroom soup, Checken Satay, a chicken/vegetable curry (including making the paste), tempe/tofu dish, Gado-Gado (at last I know hoe to cook this), and another salad dish with green beans and sprouts. The food was awesome, my kids normally wouldn't eat Indonesian but because they had cooked it there was no stopping them!!. The desert (banana/coconut cream) dish was extremely popular..(and easy). These guys work hard and I wish them all the success they deserve. We enjoyed ourselves, and we learnt more that I would have ever expected about Balinese cooking. Success!!"

Incredible cooking class, but also so much more than just a cooking class too - learn about the Balinese home, family and traditions!We were picked up from our hotel a driven to the class. The class is located a little ways outside of Ubud center, and driving out of town you get to see the \"real\" Bali.... Rice fields, local homes, neighborhoods and the people that live there. It was very refreshing to get outside the touristy area and actually see Bali. Upon arriving at the class, we were welcomed into the family home. They always keep classes small, however that particular day, we happened to be the only ones in the afternoon class! They do offer morning classes, which include a trip to the local market, which are generally more popular. They gave a us a tour of their home and explained the intracacies of Balinese family life and culture. They were happy to share and answer all of our questions about family temples, their rice house, and the traditional Balinese houses.Finally, we got to the cooking! We made 9 traditional Balinese dishes! The entire familiy was there to help out (we were only two people, SSO this was helpful, but would also be helpful witha larger group to assist). They walked us through, step by step, for every dish. Everything was really quite simple, but turned out so delicious! It was very clean, organized and well-executed. We even got to see how to make coconut oil!This was one of the most authentic experiences we had in Bali, and HIGHLY recommend it! They were so kind, welcoming, and happy to share. I brought my camera and they took lots of action shots while we were busy cooking! You also get a recipe book to take home. Overall, one of the most memorable experiences in Bali! This class is a bargain for the price!"

Everyone was able to take turns doing different things - chopping, grinding, mixing, etc. We made a delicious spicy mushroom soup which I will definitely try and recreate at home.

Unlike most cooking classes in Ubud that are conducted in a hotel/restaurant, Jambangan Cooking Class takes place in the comfort of Rakesh's beautiful home. We felt extremely welcome and it was such a joy learning how to prepare the delicious Balinese dishes.The amount you pay (IDR 350,000 per person) includes pick up, drop off, the food (yes you get to eat them after), a visit to a local market (no, not the touristy Ubud market), a trip to Luwak Coffee plantation (optional) and beverages (bottled mineral water and fresh coconuts). The entire experience takes about 4 hours.We were the only ones in the class and received undivided attention from our patient teachers. They were very friendly and the class was so fun! I can't believe I almost forgot to pay for my class and I felt terrible. They reminded me gently and even apologized for reminding me when it was clearly my fault. Mrs Rakesh is remarkably hospitable - she was all smiles, constantly checked if we were thirsty and gave us multiple bottles of mineral water to keep us hydrated.I suggest you skip breakfast before the class or just have a snack, as you will soon be cooking up a feast - which you will definitely not be able to finish.I tried to film whatever I can during the cooking class and made a short 33 seconds video, you can view it here: http://thekeepersmap.com/2015/04/20/ubud-jambangan-bali-cooking-class-review/I highly recommend this class to anyone who is currently in Ubud / visiting there soon!"

Rakesh and his family did all they could to make us enjoy these few hours in their beautiful Balinese home. Everything is perfectly arranged. We had great company, a nice and friendly couple for Belgium, so that the whole morning was full of laughters. The food and spice of course was incredible. I would recommend this to anyone who are looking for some touch of real Bali life."

They pick you up at your hotel and drive you out to their house about 15 minutes away (with no traffic). It's a pretty nice house (might describe it as a compound) with a dedicated kitchen for the classes, and they'll explain to you the symbolism and meaning behind all the buildings and statues etc. The food was delicious - better than most any restaurant we went to - and they staff there definitely have the class down to a science so everything went very smoothly. I highly recommend!"

We learned about all ingredients at the market, did a coffee& tea tasting and finally cooked and ate at their house. I could do my vegetarian meals and at the same time watch others preparing meat dishes (great in case I cook for some non~vegetarians as well). Besides we learned a lot about the culture. Now I can follow the recipe book and start practicing. Thank you for everything!!"

The cooking lessons take place at the family home and they teach you about their traditions first. Everyone was so lovely and made you feel like you were part of the family. A very hands on experience and delicious food! My favourite dish was the tuna wrapped in banana leaf and i don't even like tuna! I love that they give you the recipes at the end so i can recreate it home.You will not regret booking this trip. You learn so much, meet an amazing family and eat so much! Money well spent. :)"

We were picked up from our hotel and taken to a private home where we were learnt about the Balinese home, beliefs and culture. This class definitely offers a value for money experience as we had more food than we could handle and used some balinese cooking techniques.The cooking class is extremely well organised as we were active at all times and were doing interesting things (making crabs out of cucumber) while picking up some good knowledge about their traditional flavouring. A nice touch is the recipes they give you to take home and make your own. Everyone was extremely friendly and are more than willing to take some nice action shots."

We were picked up from our Ubud accommodation and taken first for a tour of the local market and then onto their own home for a great experience. We have done cooking classes in other countries and found this one particularly good as it is more hands on than just watching someone prepare the dish and then leave you to copy it.The class started off with weaving using the local palm fronds which was a great laugh and certainly made us all feel more comfortable with each other. The class is informative and fun with a lot of laughter and way too much food for us to eat. We tried dishes we probably would not have otherwise and learnt some great tips.We were safely returned to our villa early in the afternoon armed with a recipe booklet to try at home."

If you want to learn how to cook real Indonesian food then there is no better place than Jambangan's Cooking Class!My two friends and I visited whilst staying in Ubud. We were picked up for free and driven to a local market where we were shown and told about the local ingredients that we would be using in our dishes later that day. We asked about tea tasting and so on route back to the host's home we were taken to a coffee and tea plantation where we learnt about how the luwak coffee was produced and tasted 14 different flavours of tea/coffee - all included in the price!When we arrived at the host's beautiful home, we were warmly welcomed and made to feel at home straight away. The day consisted of preparing and cooking a range of delicious starters, mains and a dessert. The chefs were helpful, kind and good humoured throughout. The food tasted incredible and we were also supplied with plenty of water throughout the day. At the end of the day, we were warmly waved off and driven back to our villa. This is one of the best activities I have experienced in Bali and it is all down to the fantastic family at Jambangan Cookery Class! Thank you! Chantelle, Clare and Tess xxx"

Back at the family home, we were walked through a fantastic menu from soup to dessert, making our own peanut sauce and pounding our own yellow curry sauce. Of course, the family helped with the prep and the proportions, but throughout we felt we were being guided on our own delightful culinary tour. We were in Bali for over a week and the meal we prepared in this class was one of the top two meals. We return to Hong Kong with a our \"cookbook\" of the recipes we prepared, and plan to give one to our sister and save one to make the meal for our friends.

We were then taken to a coffee plantation and got to try a bunch of different coffees and learn about the process of making their special Luwak coffee.The cooking class itself was great, with great instruction and it was very hands-on. Everyone in the group had slightly different tasks and required teamwork between all the students. We were an intimate group of just 6 students, which was a good size. The food was delicious and we had cooked so much that we were stuffed and even had leftovers to spare. Rakesh and his family welcomed us into their home, and treated us like part of the family. They were such a happy and warm group, making the experience thoroughly enjoyable.We received recipes for all the dishes we had made, and can't wait to try them at home!At the end of the class, we were dropped back at the hotel.

I was then explained about the dishes I was going to be making with them and we got underway. The place was very clean and the food was yum! They allow you to take photos and eat after every course and make you feel right at home. We made over 6 or 7 dishes and each one was simple but flavorful and will be easy to replicate when I get home.I got typed pages of recipes to take with me and they even let me take some food to takeaway because we cooked so much.

From the first moment you can feel that the host and his family are really passionate about what they do and that they want for their guests to enjoy the experience. Btw: the host speaks excellent English. We were welcomed with fresh coconut juice and had an introduction to the typical Balinese house and then we started cooking. The experience was awesome: we made about 6 different types of food and all were exquisite.

Firstly I hadn't expected a lot because there were not much reviews in Tripadvisor and I contacted a couple of cooking classes but already fully booked, then I decided to contact to them but luckily it was the best moment in my bali visit.They picked us up at Ubud Terrace and went to a traditional local market which was REALLY LOCAL! We had tasted a couple of fruits - mangosteen, snake fruit, longan etc and Indonesian spices - galangal, gingers etc. After that, we visited to the world famous \"Rice Terrace\" for photos and \"Bali Pulina\" - agriculture tourism place. We walked a fruit and spice forrest there - there are cocoa tree, giant passion fruit tree, pineapple tree etc and tasted several kings of balinese drinks - ginger tea, balinese cofee..Then we visited to the cooking class venue - it was the traditional balinese house. We listened about the history and style of house with welcome coconut juice.We cooked 7 meals totally - vege soup, chicken sate, gadogado, bean salad, grilled tuna, chicken curry, pan fried tempei. We separated our role from chopping to frying. Also cooked dessert as well. then total recipe will be 8. Most important thing was they taught how to cook yellow sauce and peanut sauce. It was very tasty.The atmosphere and location is better than other cooking class in restaurant and understand about balinese food deeply.If I pointed out a bit negative point, probably staying at Bali Pulina and market needed to be shorter.Otherwise, It was the best activity to visit in Bali. Strongly recommend!!Cheers."

Our hosts have always been careful that everybody is busy with nobody left aside. This is a real plus.In the end, the food cooked and eat during lunch was awesome, with a great atmosphere.The groups are small and you are really more than watching to prepare the lunch.Strongly recommended and worth the price!"

It was interesting and informative about the Balinese style of living. The cookery course we did lasted throughout the afternoon and evening. It was my first time doing something like this. They had all the ingredients ready and told us exactly what to do in a structured and organised way. It was fun and relaxed. The food was delicious. There were 4 of us altogether. There is nothing I would have changed about today. It was the perfect introduction to Balinese cooking. We even got the recipes to take away with us. I would highly recommend this experience and I would consider it a highlight from my trip to Bali."

After being picked up from our villa, we were taken to a local market (no tourists in sight) to see where all the fresh produce comes from. Our guide pointed out all the ingredients we would be using, and a lot of the other interesting fruits and veges we don't get at home. We also stopped by some beautiful terraced rice paddies, and went to an eco park, where they were growing a lot of the plants that various spices are produced from - a really fascinating experience. The class itself was great fun, lots to do, plenty of explanation and plenty of time to taste everything. The feast we produced was amazing, and we got a print out of the recipes to take with us. Just fantastic, and made better by it being held in a real Balinese household. Highly recommended."

When Rakesh came to pick me up from my hotel he explained that the other people who were meant to join the class had rescheduled at the last minute, which meant I had a private cooking lesson.The whole experience from start to finish was fantastic. The cooking takes place in Rakesh' home and it felt like the whole family was involved in the lesson, which made for a really fun and funny time.The lesson started at a local market where the various ingredients were explained to me. This was really interesting, especially as the market was in a little town outside Ubud and there was not a tourist in sight. After that we drove thorough the rice fields to Rakesh' home which is a traditional Balinese family compound with several different buildings, a family temple and lots of ingredients growing on their land. It was interesting to hear about how the family lives and to get a bit of an insight into Balinese life.After a welcome drink it was time to get stuck in! We started by making the yellow curry paste which is a base for many of the dishes. I had a go on the huge pestle and mortar, chopped, mixed, formed and cooked....all the while under the watchful eye of Rakesh's sister who made the morning so much fun. There was always time for a photo and when weighing out the ingredients there was always one extra spoonful for luck!The food was absolutely delicious, one of the best meals I had on holiday! You learn how to make curry, satay empol, Tempe manis, lawar bali, among other things. Make sure you arrive feeling hungry as you will certainly leave feeling very full!You also get a copy of all the recipes to take home with you.I really cannot rate this cooking class highly enough. Rakesh and his sister both have a background in gastro and this shows. I had a great morning and really recommend it to others."

Hereafter we went by passing Tegalalang's paddies to Rakesh his home. A beautiful typical Balinese family compound where we were welcomed by all family members with a smile and we got a fresh coconut. The cooking started with cutting and then we started preparing the yellow and peanut sauce. After a while we switched to learning some decoration and some were making minced chicken... later we cooked at turns the several dishes (as there were 4 heaters). All in all we had a wonderful meal that we made together with the whole group! Although there was no individual cooking place for everyone tasks were well divided and everyone saw how dishes were prepared as we were not doing several dishes at the same time. At the end you get a very lovely meal (enak sekali), a very full stomach and recipes to bring home:)."

The drive to the village is very picturesque and the family's compound is very pretty and very clean. Turns out I was the only guest so we got down to the cooking. We made. . Or should I say. .I helped make 8 dishes and learnt the basics of balinese cooking. ..lots garlic and wonderful spices which need working with a mortar and pestle. Good fun. I can't remember her name but the cook is wonderful. .. She speaks English well and has a fantastic sense of humour. . Everything was so many tablespoons and 'one for the road'. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and the final feast was huge! I can't believe I ate most of it.. But it was astoundingly good. It was a shame for the family I was the only guest..but hey. Who's complaining. I think they're a fairly new business and I wish them much good luck for future.Do yourself a favour. . Get cooking with Jambangan."

On the drive, he explained to us all about Balinese culture, with lots of interesting insights on day to day Balinese life that we didn't get elsewhere (such as family life, traditions, religion, current events).- It was way more fun than I expected. I don't enjoy cooking at home, so I expected it to feel like work. That was totally wrong, it was a lot of fun.- You get to see a Balinese home! I was really curious about them so it was a highlight for me."

            "review": "\"One more spoon full for good luck\" =). Our experience with Jambangan Bali cooking school started off positive when we received a prompt friendly email response to attend a cooking class that afternoon, with a free pick up and drop off to our hotel which was 15 mins north of Ubud. Cost is 350,000 rupiah per person via cash only payment and there is a morning and afternoon class available. I belive morning classes are usually busier and you visit the Ubud market which is closed by the afternoon classes, so you go to the coffee plantation instead (which was our preference as I wanted to sample the famous Kopi Luwak). Rakesh was friendly, talkative and answered our many questions and being just two of us we received a indervidualised and intimate experience. After the coffee plantation (no pressure to buy) and a stop off to the bank to exchange money we drove to Rakesh's village to cook at home with his sister and family, receiving lessons on Bali life, temples and rice farming on the way. Rakesh is an experienced Chef who spent 6 years cooking at a hotel and the standard of food, organisation and cleanliness were high. We were dressed in aprons and given coconut water on arrival before we got hard at work. Most of the ingredients are home grown and/or produced from scratch including the coconut oil, milk, chicken stock and spices. You make 8 dishes, including 2 pastes plus desert, with explanations along the way. Bottled water is included as it's thirsty work. Rakeah and his Sister are happy to take photos, laugh along with you and make it enjoyable. I am an experienced cook at home but think this class is enjoyable for all levels of cooks as you can always learn a lot cooking in another part of the world with ingredients and techniques not commonly found at home.Jambangan cooking school offers value for money and lessons you can take home as well as the added bonus of connections to a wonderful family if you choose to visit again. A highlight of our trip and highly recommended."

If you are looking to really learn how to cook balinese dishes, and not a turisticaly ordinary ubud cooking class where you just spend money on, then you should choose Rakesh's cooking class. You will be granted the honour of going to Rakesh's beauyifull house, getting to know his family, and how a balinese family really lives, and then he will put you to work. But first, he will take to a local market, explain you the diferent ingredients balinese food has, afterwards, to a rice field trip, to show you the procedure of planting, irrigating and harvesting the rice. Then, straight to work. You start with an workshop to learn how to make a \"green matress\" out of palm tree leaves, that you'll be using later on your cooking procedures. Concerning cooking, you will learn how to cook 9 different recipies, the basics to it, from a starting soup, several main dishes, and ending with a desert! Curious about the dishes? Sign in for the cooking class when you arrive in Ubud. This will be a 6 hour activity, lasting the whole morning, buy we can promise you, that the early wake and the hard work on making the yellow sauce will be largely compensated with a wonderfull meal, actually made by you, and that will satisfy your every sense. Thank you very much Rakesh!"

The family home and commune is beautiful, and we had a lovely walk around their property, where we saw the children at play, as well as their chickens, pigs and cows, and we also collected some fresh items for the cooking class. We were shown their private pool villa, which is beautiful, and is available for rent. I would definitely look into staying there in the future.The class itself was fantastic, and we were involved in the preparation of each of the different dishes. The food that was cooked is definitely the best that we have eaten in Ubud - especially that peanut sauce (!), and we enjoyed a delicious lunch looking out into the jungle. We were very lucky that our group was so small, and that we had a personalised class with Made, which was very hands-on. We both thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and highly recommend this class to others.We were collected from our villa at 8 am, and we were returned home just after midday with the leftovers from our cooking class. An excellent day!"

            "review": "Great culinary experience in (very) small group!. Kadek first picked us up at our hotel at 8:30 am (we were just the two of us that day -more generally, it's a 6-person max tour), and took us to a local market near Ubud, where he showed us the traditional ingredients used in Balinese cuisine and explained the importance and the crafting process of the (multi-)daily offerings that Balinese people place at temples and at their homes. He then drove us to the family farm, where he first showed us the different buildings in the house, which are arranged according to a traditional layout. As we later walked through the forest to their (gorgeous) guesthouse facing terrace rice paddies (which he showed us briefly), he showed us the trees and plants used in the kitchen (and even a monkey jumping from tree to tree). We then met their cows and eventually arrived at the outdoor kitchen, nicely set in the wooded/jungle part of their domain, with a nice view on the Agung river valley.There, Made told us about the main principles and components of the Balinese cuisine. We then put theory into practice: we ground, cut, mixed, stirred, wrapped, modeled... One hour later (and with much of Made's help), everything was ready for degustation. On the menu: chicken soup, corn fritters with (homemade) sambal sauce, sweet potato rice, chicken satay with (homemade) peanut sauce, pork pepes (cooked in banana leaf), gado-gado, and banana fritters for dessert.Everything was delicious! And the setting was great, facing the lush valley.We cooked so much food that we couldn't finish it despite all our good will and appetite. Made packed a fraction of the leftovers into a big doggy bag (plus some fresh fruits that we could pick from a basket), and also gave us a booklet with all the recipes we made that day. Finally, Made showed us how to make offerings of various shapes, and we tried to imitate her. It appeared we didn't have half her dexterity but it was still fun and informative ;)It's hard to find room for improvement in that tour, but I think I would have loved spending even more time in the kitchen and do some of the work that was actually done by Made before our arrival to make things easier and faster for us (getting some herbs in the garden, cutting vegetables into small pieces, etc). Also note that there will be some advertising for the rafting occurring nearby (at times, we could actually hear the screams in the distance) and, obviously, for the guesthouse they take you to during the tour. But nothing too insistent, I thought.Overall : Made and Kadek (and all the people we met in the farm) were very nice and welcoming. One of our best moments in Bali, for a reasonable price (350 000 IDR per person in August 2016)! And the big plus is that contrary to most of other cooking classescaround Ubud, here you get the opportunity to cook in (very) small groups!"

We were explained the different spices, vegetables and fruit available in the region.Our guide then let us the time to buy whatever we needed and negotiated very good prices each time for us.Then on the way to the familly property, the guide told us about Balinese tradition.Once on the beautiful familly farm, we were given a tour of the property and the rice fields.After that we started the cooking lesson. All the product were from the familly garden. Even the coconut oil was homemade!! We cooked chicken sat\u00e9, rice with sweet potatoe, Balinese chicken soup, corn fritters, steam pork and banana fritters for dessert: SO DELICIOUS !We then enjoyed the meal we cooked in the very nice surrounding.

The best we had during our stay in Bali. The whole farm is really beautiful and if you do the tour, do step up the rice terraces as you have a great view from above. It is a bit tricky to get down though. We got all of the recipes from the cooking class and lateron prepared our own offerings. My husband turned out to be quite skilled.

            "review": "What a fantastic day!. We just had the best day with Kadek and Made, truly an amazing experience! I would highly recommend you to avoid the top tripadvisor choices and go for this authentic experience instead. I picked this place as the reviews mentioned small groups, and we were not disappointed! It was only my boyfriend and me! Turns out the biggest group they take is 8 people and even that is really rare. The more popular options usually take up to 25 people so this really made a huge difference and it felt so special to be just the 2 of us.Kadek picked us up at our hotel and then we headed to one of the traditional Ubud markets. One the way there we talked a lot about Balinese culture and the planting of rice. At the markets he showed us lots of plants and vegetables that we had never seen before, really interesting.We then headed out to their house compound and farm and started a tour of their home where their large family (30 people) live. He explained a lot about Balinese religion and culture and how traditional families live. We then headed to their beautiful farm where we spotted lots of different plants. We walked up to their rice terraces, it was really magical! They also have a small eco-resort there, next time we want to stay there instead of crowded Ubud. There is a huge pool where you can relax among the terraces and the frog noises.The walk in their rice plantation was super cool, we learned lots about the irrigation system and how people plant rice.Then back to their farm where his wife Made waited for us. All the ingredients were nice and clean and ready for us to chop, wrap and grind. So much fun and she made it so easy! Made told us everything about the different spices we used. All the ingredients were super fresh straight from their farm, it was so special. Even the coconut oil is made fresh at their farm. We used so many different things like galanghal, ginger, kafir leaves, white tumeric, lemongrass, tofu, chicken etc... In the end we helped make tofu soup, white rice with sweet potatoes, fried eggplant, gado gado, tofu skewers satay, steamed tofu and chicken in bamboo leaves, sweet corn fritters...My god! There was enough food for 10 people even though it was just the 2 of us. We had so much fun preparing it but even more eating it, with the beautiful view on their farm. I got full so quickly so Made packed us enough food for the night's dinner, such a treat. The corn fritters where the best I've eaten in my life. My boyfriend loved the gado gado and me the tofu satay but truly everything was incredible (especially with a cold beer). While we were eating they even prepared us some dessert, some delicious battered bananas. Once we had a small rest, Made showed us how to make traditional Balinese offerings, such a special addition to the day's events. As we were leaving, she heard we had a small kitchenette at our place so she packed us a huge bag full of their spices and leaves, I couldn't believe it. We now have lots of tumeric, ginger, leaves and others to try and recreate some recipes. Lucky that they also supplied the recipes!In conclusion, everything was wonderful to the last very detail, I have rarely in my life been so satisfied with such an experience. It was the best thing we did in Ubud and we will cherish these memories for many years to come. Made, Kadek and family, thank you so much, we will miss you!Marie and Michal"

It's a few days after our cookery course (and in spite of having helped cook the food on the course) we still compare every meal to the food we made with Made, Putu and Kadek. It gave us a real taste of Bali. We have had a number of delicious meals since but nothing has beaten it for taste. We are tempted to do the course all over again just to eat that food again. The family is so friendly and welcoming. The course is very relaxed and the small groups gives a really personal touch to a day which is much more than just a cookery course. We loved it and would recommend it to anyone going to Ubud."

After the market, Kadek took us back to the family compound where we picked other veggies and herbs, got a tour of a traditional Balinese compound and the temple and then toured their farm. The cooking class is fantastic for those who do and don't cook alike. You'll learn how the herbs are used, have the choice to participate and receive a list of recipes in the end. The classes are kept small so everyone can work together and the best part is the lunch at the end. Made was sure to include vegetarian options for me and it was an afternoon well spent. I would highly suggest taking this class!!!"

This cooking class was recommended by our private driver, Wayan Juli, https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297701-d3683097-Reviews-Be_Balinese_Private_Tours-Ubud_Bali.html#review_361466821. Juli's family runs this cooking class, and it was a great experience. The day started with Kadek picking us up from our hotel, and taking us to a local market. There were only 4 people in our class, so it was a very personal experience. He showed us various vegetables and fruits in the market, and explained how they are used in Balinese cooking. Next, we went to his home and toured around the complex. He showed us in detail things like the yard, family temple, kitchen, and living areas. It was a great look into local Balinese culture. After that, we walked around the farm area, learned about many different local fruits and vegetables growing there, met some animals, and took a few pictures around their beautiful homestay available for rent. I would definitely consider staying there the next time I'm in Bali.Finally, we headed towards the cooking area, where we were greeted by Made, who lead us through the cooking class. Made was a great host and it was a very hands on experience. We went over all the ingredients in detail and worked together to create the spice mix and entrees. I helped make the corn fritters, steamed pork, chicken skewers, and peanut sauce. At the end, we probably had enough food for 10 people, but there were only 4 of us. 2 in our group were vegetarians, so we made both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Recipes for everything were provided for us at the end. Made was a great instructor and all of us had a great experience! The food was delicious and we even got to takeaway the leftovers along with some fresh fruits picked from their gardens. Thank you Kadek and Made!"

Again, it took quite a long time in the burning sun to show us around. Interesting though to hear about traditional families and their habits.Then the real cooking started.

Picked this based on its 100% record of 5* reviews, and we weren't disappointed. As Ubud is a place where travelers rely religiously on trip advisor, I was desperate to escape cooking a dumbed down menu in an over crowded class, which is what I feared and read that the top listed places would offer. Managed to book 48 hours in advance, and we were the only 2 in the class, so a really personal touch! (Max group size is 8).We met Kadek in his air conditioned car at 8 at our hotel, headed to the locals market where we were introduced to a handful of produce we'd not seen before, and even haggled for some of the gorgeous locally woven baskets. We then went to Kadek's home, where he walked us through the rice fields explaining the irrigation system, took us to the house and farm where he and his family live, explained in detail the 'offerings', shrines and rituals, then went to the outdoor kitchen, set high in the most gorgeous forest /jungle setting, where his wife Made started our lesson. In total we did 6 dishes; cornfritters, chicken soup, fish steamed in banana leaf, minced pork in banana leaf parcels, chicken satay, veg salad with shredded coconut. All complex enough you'll learn something, but easy enough that you'll be able to make them again without the teachers. You get the recipes at the end, and I think you'd easily get all required ingredients back home at an Asian supermarket to reproduce the dishes.So if you're looking for a boutique operation, where you'll get more under the skin of Balinese culture and cooking, then book with this company. Equally they have a stunning 2 bed villa with infinity pool set in the forest which would be sensational for a short visit for a group of 4!! It's on airbnb at 150 USD per night, but well worth it!"

Definitely excellent value for money to discover Indonesian culture and also see the countryside."

First we went to the market and we saw where locals do their groceries. After that, we walked through the Village and iMade (m) showed us how the fruits and vegetables grow and h\u00e9 showed us his house. We learned a lot about the Balinese family culture and the ceremonies. We walked a bit downhill because it is time to cook! I've never cooked with an amazing view like this! Ni Made (f) is our hostess for the Day and she learned us everything about the spices and how we can cool the tasty Balinese dishes. I cook a lot in Holland, but now we have to do some other techniques, so sometimes I felt a little bit clumsy :-). We made our own lunch and it tastes soooo good! The family is really hospitable and you could ask whatever you want. I'm not used to have such a big lunch in Holland. So they gave us a 'doggybag' to carry the food back to the hotel. I've had an amazing day and I recommend this cookingclass to everyone."

Everyone left extremely happy.We had a tour of their family home (Balinese style with each sub-family having their own small compound), a walk around the beautiful farm picking things to put in the lunch and walk through their rice fields and finally cooked lunch together.Next to where you do the cooking class there are two ponds stocked with fish - our children each caught a fish (including a 1.5kg catfish) which also got cooked and served.The corn fritters were fantastic and probably the largest serving of veggies our kids had during our entire holiday (they almost polished off the entire platter themselves).One of the best family things we did in Bali.

Putu and his beautiful family welcomed us into their life for a day. It is so much more than a cooking class, it is an opportunity to see a Balinese family compound and farm, then learn how families cook and eat. And boy did we eat!!! It was beyond delicious and they adhered to our dietary restrictions no problem. Their tiny son even caught a fish and we cooked it up right there! We made at least 6 different things and all were amazing. We also walked through the local rice fields and learned about that industry and its importance. Finally we were able to sit by (didn't have bathing suits!) the most beautifully situated pool I have ever seen, and a herd of about a hundred monkeys passed by, right stinkin there!!! It was like a dream!!! They also have a beautiful Airbnb property which the pool was part of. This was top to bottom a glorious day! Book it!!!"

We didn't realize what we had signed up for!:) Made welcomed us into her family's compound and toured us through their home, their rice terraces, their organic garden and then we learned to cook a huge meal! Made was lovely and answered all of the questions we had along the journey. We loved the local, culture experience and we actually want to do it again!

We went for a walk through one of their rice fields and cooked in an open air kitchen with wood fired stoves and a lovely green view high above the Ayung river. We cooked together with Made and her cousin, making sate lilit ayam (minced spiced chicken on lemongrass skewers, tum babi (aromatic steamed port in Salam and banana leaf), coconut and bean salad to name just a few of the dishes! We're definitely inspired to cook Balinese when we get home!"

First hour on the local market in Ubud, being introduced to many Balinese spices and vegetables. Then to his cooking school. Instructions were very good - and funny. Lots of hand-on experience. We made several basic Balinese sauces (bumbu Bali, peanut sauce) from scratch. Then used these to prepare several dishes. We then had lunch eating what we cooked. Having done some Indonesian cooking at home already, this class really added good understanding about the spices and their flavors. And all was done with a lot of humor by Ketut and his staff. Highly recommend this activity. Whether you're into cooking or not."

After that we went to his cooking station/house in the middle of a rice field. We cooked in pairs and were prepairingn the food from the begining to the end.The only thing I missed the second time is, that we didnt learn about the traditional balinese home, process of coconut oil making and we didnt make offerings as we did the first time when we visited him.In any case-this class was a lot of fun and i wish to Ketut a long-time success with his classes!

From here we all jumped in a car and headed to the cooking class where we were greeted by the big smile of Ketut! Ketut really did make the class memorable, with his phrases and infectious laugh! 2 weeks later and I'm still saying \"Bumbo Bali!\"in his way! As a group (12 people in total) we prepared 3 key sauces that we then used for the dishes. Then under the guidance of Ketut and his assistants, we made a chicken curry, satay, noodles, tuna, and soup in our pairs. He did offer a vegetarian menu but we were all non-veggies. Once all the dishes were cooked we moved to the open sided restaurant area to tuck into the amazing food. Ketut gave us all print outs of the recipes so we cook practise them at home.

The class was very enjoyable, with step by step instructions, and suited everyone from beginner cooks to those with more cooking experience. We made a total of 3 sauces, fried Balinese chicken, steamed fish in banana leaf, Mie Goreng, satay chicken with peanut sauce and soup, plus an unusual but delicious dessert of sweet potato in a palm sugar sauce with icecream... Yum! Absolutely loved it and would definitely recommend."

Then we went to our \"classroom\", which is a really quaint and spacious outdoor kitchen beside a farm. Our teacher was very funny and he always checked in on our progress to ensure we were doing fine. Despite being a small class of just 3 people, we were able to cook a wonderful 5 course meal with the help of our teacher and his assistants, who were all rather fluent in English. Food was great, and the best part was, mr Ketut personally handed us a certificate at the end with a copy of the recipe book so we could replicate them at home. Wonderful time spent in ubud learning about Balinese cuisine :)"

We went to local market for a quick briefing about local ingredients and some shopping. Then straight to the venue, a complex of local houses. First we learn how to do a offer basket to put to the family temple. We were 11 person, french, italian, Chinese and some germans. The mood was funny and light and instructor take us in his on kitchen by the river. We start to learn how to do balinese sauce, \"bamboo bali\" peanuts sauce, cutting and mixing together all the ingredients. The we proceed to follow the receipts and we cook several dishes. A soup. A chicken with coconut sauce. A noddles, a tuna steam into banana leaves and a dessert. We follow all together the teacher with his own family members. A thin rain start drop and we were safe and comfortable. Nobody get bored and we enjoy all together the meal around twelve o'clock. But 1.30 we payed \"300k\" each and i can easily say was really money worth experience, considering you eating a 5 course meal. More then this the driver drop you wherever you prefer. People kind, Humble, generous with good mood. Definitely one of the best experience we did in Bali during the whole month. Very useful and funny!"

The Payuk Bali staff picked my 7-year-old son and I up from our hotel. We learned about local ingredients and sampled ripe, local fruits--snakefruit, mangosteen, and marquisa--at the market. We received a refreshing, cinnamon-y welcome drink before crafting offerings to give before the start of the class. Ketut demonstrated the process of making coconut oil, and my son got to try his hand at grating coconut. The location of the outdoor kitchen is beautiful. It is well equipped and breezy. We cooked for hours and I never once felt too hot. Everyone is provided with a big chopping block, an apron, towel, and chef's knife. Water is available throughout the class. Food safety procedures were followed, and everything was run very professionally. Eleven people were enrolled in the course for the day, and together we created just as many dishes. The class staff did all of the boring and messy prep work ahead of time (washing produce, cleaning and chopping meats, and sorting ingredients) while we students were able to focus on the fun parts. We were actively engaged chopping, stirring, smashing, crushing, and sauteing fresh local herbs and vegetables all morning. We moved quickly from one task to the next, so nothing became tedious; ingredients and processes were aptly explained. Some participants chose to prepare a vegetarian menu, and we were told that several menus are available if you'd like to take more than one course (I would do it again!).My seven-year-old son was able to fully engage in all of the cooking. The staff was patient and caring with him, and he was very proud of his chef skills. He says, \"Take your kid to the class! It was blast-tastic!\" I would highly recommend the course for kids who are good listeners, probably over the age of 6. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if I'd had to assist my 4-year-old.No cooking class is worth it if the food isn't delectable, of course! We were all very ready to dine by the time our handmade lunch was served. Everything was tasty, but I especially enjoyed the satay, the long-bean salad, and the sambal. The sweet potato dessert and the satay were my son's favorites.We were picked up from our hotel at 8 am and didn't get back until 1:45, so the class was a bit longer than I'd expected. It takes a while to get to the eating part, so I would suggest eating breakfast before you go.It was a delightful experience, very professionally run, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Bali."

Ketut is very amusing and knowledgeable (he went to cooking school and has over 20 yrs of experience) and the class is well planned and flows extremely well. We used traditional methods for grinding and pounding, a lot of the ingredient prep (peeling garlic, shallot etc) was done ahead of time and saved us valuable time, and they are VERY accommodating for food allergies or dietary preferences. Our group was fun, Ketut helpers were great as well and did all the dirty work of washing dishes and cleaning. We even got two bonus activities: making the daily offering and learning how to make coconut oil and milk. This is and EXCELLENT way to get familiar with Balinese cuisine and learn about traditional life in Bali. Totally recommended!!!"

First they pick you up from your hotel, take you to the market for some ingredients shopping, then you're taughed to make the traditional offerings to the Gods accompanied by some delicious iced tea, afterwards, the cooking begins! Everyone in the class is each tasked to do different roles and therefore makes this a very hands on activity. As a vegetarian, I was also granted the privilege to have my own menu separate from everyone else's. Anyway, once the cooking is over, we get to indulge in the food that we made.

We were picked up from our hotel then went to the market which was very educational and cultural. Then we went to the house, where we learnt about life in bali and how to do an offering which was great. The food we made was so yummy, restaurent standard and so great to try! It was easy but still fun! However the best part was the two guys who ran it - Ketut and Made! Such funny and friendly people- some of the best we've met in Bali. They had us laughing all the way through - I'd do it again just to see them!Do this class - you won't regret it!!"

We didn't anticipate how much fun the chef and guide Katut would be to cook with. He makes trivial chopping and frying a joy with his humorous quips and unique laughter. He gives you specific steps toward making dishes like Sambal sauce, chicken satay, and steamed tuna. Best of all we got to eat the dishes we'd made at the end. This isn't a professional cooking course but more than worthwhile for half a day's fun."

We chopped, cooked, mashed and just learned so much in a span of 3 hours. Of course we get to enjoy the meal after which was amazing.There're only 4 of us so it was really intimate so it was nice. Made was really friendly and funny and explained to us in details about the basic of Balinese cooking. The best part is that we get to take home the recipe with us so we can make the same at home now! Thank you everyone, it was a really great learning experience for us!"

Of course not, but I think that I really will use the ideas I learned in this class to add to my repertoire.The village where this class is held is very pretty but there are a lot of mosquitoes - they will offer you some bug repellent, don't just casually spray it on, rub it everywhere that could vaguely be described as exposed!"

First we made some offerings with palm leaves with flowers. Then we were shown how to make coconut oil from fresh raw coconut flesh. Finally we got down to the cooking and it was really well explained, organised and very 'hands on' for all of us. The only bit of cooking we didn't do was the grilling of satay chicken and tuna in banana leaves over coconut charcoal husks."

Staff was very helpful to help when we ( I ) was challenged. 5. Menu was great. 6. Like that it was in a village away from the busy town ( only a few minutes away. I don't write reviews often.....

He explained the menu we would be cooking and explained and showed us the difference between the different types of ginger, chillies etc.The morning ran very smoothly with the kitchen team handing out ingredients and taking away dirty dishes like magic! Everything that was needed to make the experience comfortable was at hand such as cold water and insect repellent.We got to make several dishes and sauces which were then laid out as a buffet for our lunch. We were a group of five and we all loved the experience.

It runs like a well-oiled machine with dirty pans and plates removed by almost invisible worker bees. The chef Ketut takes you to the market to give you an idea of a typical Ubud food market where locals get supplies. You get to taste the local (exotic to us) fruit and get some great pics. Next you go to their living compound where he teaches you to make an offering and you are allowed to say a little prayer and place your offering at their family temple. I would have liked this to be a more formal affair but I suppose it was difficult us being a big group. Our group was 13 which although sounds like a lot was easily managed by the staff. You all get a turn chopping/ crushing/ frying etc parts of the meal and at the end get to eat it! The meal consists of a 3 course and free water - beer is on offer at a price. The recipes are given to each participant after the class. This is a good way to spend a half day in Bali!"

            "review": "Fun way to spend a day in paradise. My spouse and I actually signed up with Paon Bali for a cooking class, and I was taken aback when we discovered that Payuk Bali picked us up instead. Luckily, I had a SIM card and could look this place up, along with reviews. This company appears to be located quite near to Paon Bali, so I suppose they have some kind of co-marketing agreement to take each other's overflow. That said, it is a pretty serious service flaw to not at the very least inform clients that a substitution will take place. Imagine my shock and confusion when we arrived at the actual cooking school and it wasn't where I expected to be. This all said, I can't hold Payuk Bali responsible for any of the above issues, and in the end, the class and experience was nothing short of fantastic. If there is any blame to be held, it should lie squarely with Paon Bali, who took my reservation only to slough it off to Payuk. Now, on to the review of the class itself. We were picked up and driven to Ubud market, where our driver/guide Wayan provided our group of four with detailed information about the produce and spices used in traditional Balinese cooking. It was quite a detailed tour, and included not just culinary information, but cultural commentary as well. We were able to smell and taste the unique ingredients and get a flavor for the bustle of the local market, although most of the market action is over by 9 am. Then it was off to the school, where we were joined by four other students and our primary instructor, Made. Made provided insight into Balinese life on the family compound, and taught us how to construct our own basic temple offerings made from coconut leaves, bamboo picks, and flowers. We later had the opportunity to place our offerings and \"make a wish\". Next, we learned how to make coconut oil, which is the primary cooking oil in Bali. The cooking class then commenced. It is set up for 10 students paired in twos. We were each assigned various tasks - starting off with chopping, pounding, and grinding ingredients. You will not have the opportunity to do all the dishes from start to finish, but you will be able to try your hand at most of the aspects of preparing each dish. More importantly, you will learn a number of preparation methods, such as grinding and pounding ingredients by hand with a couple of different mortars, and steaming rice in a basket - things you would likely be using a food processor and rice cooker to do at home. From my view, this was less of a cooking class, and more of an opportunity to experience how food is prepared the traditional Balinese way. For me, this was a good thing. In all, our group prepared 6 dishes: a chicken soup, chicken sate', steamed and grilled tuna, a balinese style salad, a chicken dish, a dessert, and rice as an accompaniment. We also prepared three sauces: a bumbu sauce, sambal, and peanut sauce for the sate'. The food we prepared was combined and plated buffet style for lunch. I'm guessing that in the process the seasoning was refined by more skilled hands than ours. It was delicious and everyone left completely stuffed. You are also provided with printed recipes so that you can attempt to replicate what you learned at home. A hint - Some ingredients may be hard to get at home, and will require substitutions, so take some notes on what possible substitutions can be made while it is still fresh on your mind and you can ask questions of your instructor. Also, some steps on the printed recipes may not have a lot of detail, so writing down exactly what you actually did to prepare a dish will minimize confusion later.I would sum up this activity in one word: Fun! You will definitely gain enough skill and confidence from this class to attempt to make authentic Balinese food at home. More than that, you will gain some fascinating insight into Balinese life and culture. This is a very worthwhile experience, even if cooking is not necessarily your thing."

The family running it is kind, welcoming, and more than anything - incredibly fun. They'll keep you engaged and entertained throughout, even if you're doing something as trivial as chopping vegetables.Often with day long tours, there can be lulls or sections where you're bored. Things can be dragged out and by hour 4-5, this is the last thing you want. I don't recall a single time this thought came to mind; time just flew by.The market tour is interesting, mostly to have some local fruits and spices specifically explained to you. We adore meandering through markets on our own, but in a foreign country, you don't always know what's what. Making our own offering was really fun too; after seeing thousands of them, it's nice to get a more intimate experience with them.We didn't make anything TOO exotic, but then again, for a fun cooking class, you don't want to be. We had a huge array of dishes though, and the best part was that we did EVERYTHING. Many cooking classes will streamline things by prepping certain ingredients for you, or even being the ones to throw them in the pan/pot. Payuk utilized a buddy system which meant you were always doing something, and the patrons were always the ones cooking. Making everything from scratch, yourself, makes it a genuine experience. The food we ended up with resulted in an enormous feast, and every dish was truly delicious.The class was suitable for all ages, as our group had children and seniors. The instruction was clear, simple yet fun and challenging, and, again - highly entertaining. Transfers were prompt and safe."

Everyone gets to learn about local Balinese traditions & then it's time to learn about and taste the array of ingredients, and begin chopping, pounding, grinding, saut\u00e9ing, steam, and assembling the food. Loads of photo opportunities, tasting along the way and asking questions etc... The main host I think he's Ketut is a trained chef with a background in hospitality and overseas hotels, is such a hoot! Full of character, a wicked sense of humour and joy to meet. At the end of the 4 hours you sit down to savour yours and your fellow class mates wide selection of Balinese dishes & take home copies of the recipes. Don't look elsewhere this is A MUST DO whilst visiting Ubud."

Once the cooking began it was very hands on, which everyone really enjoyed. The photos you see on TripAdvisor are correct to what you learn.

As we booked last minute we were on an afternoon class so while there was no market visit, we still felt this was an incredibly worth while Bali activity. We were picked up from our hotel, and greeted warmly on arrival to the family home. We were first taught about and how to make a traditional Balinese offering, followed by a lesson in the traditional production of coconut oil. We were then lead to an amazing cooking area in a beautiful garden overlooking the river. It really was bliss! The staff were incredible, we couldn't fault, and our chef kept us entertained throughout the entire lesson! One thing that made this place stand out is that it is completely hands on- you prep and cook everything yourself from start to finish, and the food was delicious. Enjoyed at the end of the lesson overlooking the river! A great way to experience a slice of Balinese life. We would do again in a heartbeat! Thank you so much much Payuk for a great afternoon :)"

We signed up for the Payuk Bali cooking class athe the recommendation of our hotel and we were absolutely delighted by the experience. They picked us up at 7:45 am and we drove to the Ubud food market where we received an introduction to the Indonesian spices: 4 kinds of ginger, many different chilies, water and regular spinach, and the colors and smells of an open air market. Our driver than took us to a Balinese home which had been outfitted for the cooking school. We learned how to make the flower offerings that were distributed throughout the household everyday to ward off evil spirits and welcome the positive ones. The making of coconut palm oil was very interesting as well.Then, the cooking and the explanations were very informative, enjoyably presented and the food was delectable: satay and homemade peanut sauce (I had no idea how complex that delicious sauce was to make). A salad with snake beans and bean sprouts (yumm); steamed and grilled tuna in banana leaves; Balinese rice (perfect); chicken soup with all the complexities of the spices in sauces we had made; Balinese fried chicken in tumeric; and the end with candied sweet potato with palm sugar. Our lunch started at12:15 pm. Our head chef and teacher was charming and I am sure that you will enjoy this experience. I recommend that you arrange for this at the start of your stay in Ubud."

Ketut provided us with loads of information as well as being exceptionally entertaining. We made offerings, met his family, learned the history of Balinese cooking and familial culture.As a former classroom teacher, I'm fully aware of classroom management. I can't say enough great things about how the cooking process and instructions were delivered. Everyone had a chance to cook, to cut, to be sous chef, master chef as well as meet and work with the other people in the class. As soon as we finished one dish we would turn around and start another and our pans would be clean and ready to cook again. It was exceptionally well timed and executed. It's something you wont even notice as it's so well done.The food, of course, was delicious. And the people with whom we shared and cooked made it even more tasty. You will love Ketut and his team!"

They explained everything then took us to the compound to begin. The first thing we did was learn about the offerings that you see all over Ubud, including how to make them. Then the cooking began. We made a bunch of food and did it all piecemeal (the only downside to the experience because if we had made less food we could have done our own dish from start to finish).

We had 11 in the group which I also thought might be too much but they split us into two and both guides were entertaining, informative and involving of everyone. Got to cook a three main dishes, three sauces (all from scratch, including the grinding of spices in huge manual pestle and mortars), rice, pudding and sides.

It starts with a tour of the food markets and Ketut explains all the different fruit and veges and you get to try some too. Then back to the cooking school by car. You are given a welcome drink and start by making the offering basket, then down to see how coconut oil is made, a bit of interaction then to the kitchen. The ingredients are given to you and there are other chefs to assist you and also chop up the rest of ingredients needed. I liked that you got to taste the food along the way also. About 15 people in a class and they make sure that you are partnered with your own group. Fantastic experience and at the end the food you just helped prepared and cook is served smorgasbord style and you help yourself. You are given the recipes at the end. Then they take you by car back to a local hotel in ubud or a meeting point. For us our driver came and picked us up from the cooking class. A great experience and Ketut was very helpful. There was myself, husband and 16 y.o daughter. Other couples and families with younger children also. Highly recommended"

I was worried that the cooking class would be a lot of hard work...it was hard work but totally fun and totally worth it because we got to eat food we created at the end and it sure was tasty!!I loved that upon pick up they took us to the morning market to illustrate how the Balinese people select their produce, food, flowers and spices . It was fun to see especially in a small group. Next we headed to a traditional Balinese home and were educated on the different buildings and happenings.We got to make traditional Balinese offerings and place them in the appropriate area.We next got to see and try making coconut oil from real coconuts!!! It was amazing night.After that we learned about all the ingredients of the food we were about to prepare and then set to making 8 lovely dishes. We made Balinese chicken soup, three sauces including bumbu, peanut and chili sauce, BfC, sate, tuna in nana leaf, long bean salad, twice steamed rice, etc. at the end we were given the recipes and ketuk's email in case we wanted to ask for different recipes! I did, I asked for the fried tempeh and was Emailed the recipe 24 hours later!!We started the day at 830 and finished around 2 with free transport both ways in ubud. Great day! My boyfriend had a blast too!"

I wanted to do the morning class, but it was fully booked as with some other cooking schools as well, so be sure to make a booking well in advance. So the afternoon class didn't include the market tour, but we got make our own offerings for the gods instead which was interesting. Cooking itself was very informative, our instructor Ketut was great! Always smiling and making jokes. Everything went smoothly step by step because of a few assistants that were finishing our cookings, doing dishes etc. Won't be so neat and easy when I try these recipes at home haha. Eating was the best part of course, there was so much yummy food and there's no way our group of 5 could've finished it all. Sate chicken and peanut sauce were to die for."

Great location by the river and very professionally run. We took our 3 kids along and they enjoyed it. For us adults however, used to Asian cooking it was perhaps not that enlightening. We learnt a few tricks and tips, but certainly I would suggest this is more geared for the Asian cooking novice. Nice, but not one of the best in comparison to some we have tried around the world."

We were picked up from our hotel after 8am and after collecting another couple, parked at the market place and all set off through the food sector. Although this was after the busiest time for the locals, it is still a vibrant and colourful place. Ketut highlighted a lot of the unique Balinese fruits and spices to us. We then drove to a family compound where we were given a very refreshing cinnamon flavoured herbal tea and then we were all given the opportunity to make an offering from scratch. We then walked to see coconut oil being made and thence to our table and cooking area. Ketut then showed us each spice or ingredient needed for the sauces, and we then set to cutting up, chopping, slicing, grinding or pounding items for the sauces. Ketut then demonstrated the skills and steps needed to make the dishes. All the staff were warm, friendly and informative. The class was fun, relaxed and non threatening for inexperienced cooks. We all then enjoyed the lunch we had prepared."

He brought us to tour around the Ubud market which we otherwise wouldn't venture so deeply on our own, so it's awesome to get a feel of the local market scene. Cooking wise, many things were prepared in advance for us, and we merely had to do some basic chopping, grinding and stir frying. The instructor and assistants were overly interested in helping all the participants take pictures. Honestly I would hope for more hands-on cooking rather than demonstrations and photo taking.Don't expect to be preparing and cooking for just you and your partner. All food items are prepared as a whole team!Overall it was a pleasant experience to interact with the Balinese in their own house. We also brought back a printed recipe booklet at the end of the day."

We all took it in turns to cook, chop or grind. The smells were in incredible. All of the dishes were typical balinese and it was great to learn what goes into each dish. We have tge recipes to take away and attempt to make at home All of the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. Once all made we sat and ate our lunch and it was definitely worth it!

We are glad we chose to attend this class regardless... as it was really enjoyable!There were four of us and we were added to a group of 8 for a total of 12 participants. 14 can be catered to in each class apparently. It was a really interesting morning and Ketut is a charming host. We enjoyed seeing how the coconut oil is prepared in addition to our own participation. We were a little surprised that the whole class was to cook the same 4 dishes. Previous classes in Thailand etc have allowed individuals to select from multiple choices by simply varying the the basic sauce and trading a couple of herbs or vegetables for others, or swapping seafood for chicken etc. The dishes that we were able to assist in making here, (chopping and grinding mostly) were good. Although we did not know it we were all helping to create dishes that would after cooking be combined by kitchen staff which was a little frustrating.Balinese cuisine calls for the considerable use of palm sugar and sweet soy - we'd have preferred to cook and consume our own meals prepared by our own selves (or at least in each group of 2) It was explained as we were cooking that we might choose to add more salt or chilli etc and use less of the sweet ingredients to suit our own individual palates so thinking that we were indeed cooking for ourselves, we did... but the finished dishes were then all combined and served as a large dish buffet style! Therefore inevitably we found the tuna a little bland for our individual palates. The peanut satay sauce too sweet etc. There may be a little more work involved in allowing & assisting us to cook individual dishes for our own consumption- but we would have definitely awarded a five star rating had this been the case. Simply because we'd have enjoyed the flavour more. Please consider this option for your clients and we would be happy to come back and learn how to make some more dishes on a subsequent visit to Bali."

You do everything, cut, grind, shred, cook, steam, using all tools in the kitchen and all is done with no electric tools but manually. It was an amazing experience and one I would have done over and over. it takes almost 5 hours to do it all and then you eat what you made.. unbelievable. I would never think of taking a cooking class while on vacation but you cannot miss this activity and this was the best highly recommended and in a little village not a a fancy restaurant in town, but in a temple setting where people lived and grew their own vegetables with chickens and all.. a perfect delight"

My husband and I travelled to Ubud with our 19 month old baby and a cooking class was the only thing I was keen to do as an organised tour. Payuk Bali was a professional tour but it had a relaxed feel to it. We were picked up from our hotel pretty much on time (around 8am) and went straight to the markets in Ubud. Katut met us there and walked us around the market explaining a lot about the Balinese ingredients and offerings. One of the most helpful things Katut did was to compare ingredients to western flavours and uses which helped to provide context.After the visit to the market we were driven about ten minutes out of town to Laplapan Village. There was a funeral planned for the next day and our group was interested in the ceremony so Katut took us over to look at the beautiful offerings that the village had made in the temple to send the important villager (I think it was the Priest's wife) on her journey. Katut explained how the funeral would happen and invited us all to come along.The actual cooking class was extremely organised. There was about 10 people (tourists) doing the class and about 7 staff helping to do all of the preparation of ingredients. As soon as we started one of the staff tried to take my baby to let me concentrate but she is quite shy so stayed in the backpack. My daughter eventually went to look at the chickens with one of the staff and I had a break to cook and grind spices without her for awhile...We made 8 dishes and they were all different and delicious. Soto Ayam (chicken soup) was my babies favourite, the satays were delicious too. It was helpful to know what dishes are usually eaten so that when we went to restaurants we were more familiar with the food. I absolutely love the flavours of Indonesian cooking and they keep the sambal (or chilli) separate so that you can have it as spicy as you prefer.I guarantee that you will have a great time at this class no matter if you are single or travelling with others. Everyone is lovely and very helpful. It was nice to hang out at a house in a village and see a bit of the \"real\" Bali too."

            "review": "Educational and fun experience. Booked in for the morning cooking class as we wanted to do the market tour and we weren't disappointed. The young guy who took us through the markets was incredibly knowledgable as he identified and explained the use of different fruits, vegetables and spices as we wandered through the markets - he even grabbed us a few different things to try as we went through. Then we were off to the compound/cooking school. We started with a quick lesson in preparing the traditional balinese offerings as our guide gave us a lesson in Balinese culture and spirituality. Then the main man Ketut joined us and showed us through the process of making Coconut Oil from scratch. Then it was off to the main kitchen where we were taken through the menu for the day with everything explained in great detail. Then the chopping began! Everyone rotated through the many preparation tasks as the day went on so you got a chance to try your hand at all the different stages of the different dishes. Whilst not a traditional \"lesson\" in that we weren't guided step by step through all of the dishes, it was nonetheless enjoyable as we got to try a lot more things than we would have done if it was all step by step individually. The preparation really was all by hand which was great - down to the grinding of many different spices in large mortar and pestles to create the sambal and the peanut sauce. The result was an array of truly delicious balinese food for everyone to enjoy. We were grouped with a great bunch of people from around the world which was fantastic, and everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves. We were also provided with a detailed recipe and instruction handout to take home meaning I was left feeling like I might actually try to recreate some, if not all, of the dishes we made today. The staff were absolutely amazing and they really made the experience special for us. They were patient, educational and helpful with everyone and made sure everyone was as hands on as possible. They constantly offered to take our cameras/phones and take photos for us as the day went on so we could document the experience which was a great touch. Spending the morning with them is worth the experience alone - the amazing food is just a bonus. I think everyone felt the same as students and teaches shared hugs and high fives on the way out - and a lot of laughs and smiles. Big thanks to Ketut and his amazing team for a truly amazing and educational experience!"

It makes the cooking lesson a really pleasant experience!!The food was really good. We certainly had the best Chicken Satay among our stay in Ubud, not pretending we are cooking well, but still...;-)!The extras (The offering craft and the coconut oil process introduction) was really good as well.A cooking lesson with Payuk Bali is highly recommended to put the balinese culture into practice!!!"

This was an amazing experience that we will take with us for the rest of our lives! Ketut was fun, welcoming, and very patient with the group of various people at that morning's class. His assistants were also all very helpful and friendly. I loved going down to the market in the morning and trying some of the various fruits that the vendor's had to offer. Learning how to make the offering for the kitchen shrine, and how coconut oil was made was fun and informative. After having spent the past few days loving the food in Bali, we were very interested in learning how to make the food for ourselves (I have made some of the dishes since returning back to the States, and have come to a pretty close approximation to the tastes of Bali considering the limited ingredients I can get in Reno, NV). We appreciated the cook book that was given at the end of the class too. My wife and I were in Bali on our honeymoon, and I couldn't think of a better way to spend our morning with some of the most welcoming, friendly, and fun people we have ever had the pleasure of meeting!"

I highly recommend Ketut and his team, as they will keep you laughing, will teach you a lot about local ingredients at foods, and will provide lots of hands-on experience. We began the day at the local market, checking out local ingredients, and then headed to a lovely family compound where we spent a wonderful few hours with the Made-for-TV Ketut and his staff. Highly Recommended!!! Our daughters ages 10 and 7 were welcomed and put right to work as well, so it truly was a family experience."

We were picked up from our hotel in Ubud and driven to the markets where we met our wonderful guide and cooking instructor Made. First of all we were taken around the Ubud market and shown all the produce and what it was used for and where it came from - having Made with us meant that we could get up close and personal without being harangued to buy anything. We then drove to the family compound where we were first shown how to \"sew\" the ceremonial offerings with Banana leaves and bits of bamboo (this was to get us ready for later sewing the leaves around the food). We then went down to the cooking area where the menu was explained and we then set to chopping and grinding and getting all the spices ready for making the sauces. This ran like clockwork. Everything had been laid out in advance and everybody got to chop, mash, pummel and grind a bit of everything. We then moved on to cooking the various dishes - again all the meat had been measrued out in advance and there were plenty of people on hand to show us what to do. The lesson also showed us how cocnut oil was made. Once this was all finished the staff took over and finished the cooking and we then all sat down to an amazing three course lunch that we had (well mostly) cooked. I would recommend this for foodies and non foodies alike -"

The colourful flowers, fruits and vegetables will never cease to amaze me. We returned to the traditional Balinese home to begin our cooking experience. We began by making a flower offering and learnt how coconut oil is made. Then we made our way to the 'kitchen' and 'dining' area - the most beautiful setting. Surrounded by lush garden, high on a cliff edge - we could hear the river running below.After a quick drink, we began to chop, saut\u00e9, steam, pound, fry, mix, grill etc. Our group of 14 were kept very busy!! Once all dishes were completed came the best part...time to feast!! The food was delicious, company was wonderful and the setting was second to none. Payuk Cooking Class is highly recommended. There is something very special about being invited into a private home to experience the Balinese way as opposed to cooking in a restaurant kitchen.Plus the 'entertainment ' is too good!!Thank you Ketut, Made, Wayan and all of the Payuk team for another wonderful adventure!Toni, Rippa and Charli SalmonJanuary 2015"

We decided before coming back to Ubud that we'd happily do the class again, partly because we needed a refresher on what we'd learned, partly because we found the food (that we'd collectively made) so terrific, and hopefully to catch Ketut Budi's marvelous act again.Well this year, we had a different instructor, a young guy named Made, who was every bit as charming and helpful as Ketut Budi. The formula for the class was the same, and is notable for being superior to other cooking classes we've heard about. First, the class goes to the market and sees how to shop for ingredients. Then you go out to the family compound where the cooking takes place, and you learn to make offerings. And then learn how to make coconut oil from scratch. Then prepare the entire meal from scratch, many courses, including the critical three sauces, the-more-involved-than-you-think steamed rice, satay, soup, vegetable and fish dishes, and dessert. Rather than watching someone demonstrate, you actually do it, all of it. Super well-planned, and delightfully delivered by Made and his sweet staff. The meal was one of the best we've eaten in Bali, which is saying a great deal. Plus, like last year, we met other people in the class who were really fun to meet and talk with. There you go."

Once we were actually there I didnt think about it for one moment and didnt feel that we were missing out on anything.We contacted them via e-mail and the correspondens was quick and accurat.I highly recomend this activity!!"

We would highly recommend the class to anyone considering a cooking course whilst in Ubud."

The class includes door to door pick up and drop off at your hotel. We also went to the local market and our chef/teacher, Katut, introduced us to a wealth of local color and flavor. The class itself is in a serene setting on a hill overlooking the Balinese forest and river. There were 10 people in our class and we all had the opportunity to contribute to the creation of about 6 different dishes and the sauces that go into them. This cooking class experience Katut and his friends and family provide was amazing. Katut is also a great teacher and very funny. If you are in Ubud, you should really sign up for this great experience!"

After an initial mix up with transport, we ended up being found by Ketut himself at Ubud Palace and taken to find the rest of the group. Ketut was extremely knowledgeable about nearly everything at the market and gave us a great tour including tastes of Balinese fruits and a trip to the spice section of the market. After arriving at his family home, we were treated to tea and a Balinese offering lesson. He then set up a photo opportunity for everyone with their own offering and flowers in our hair. Next we were given step by step instructions of how to make coconut oil, which was really interesting. The final step before beginning to cook was a nice morning coffee while our ingredients were set up.Ketut had this class down to a science, perfecting the timing of everything to have our lunch served by 12:15. We started by seeing, smelling, and tasting every ingredient we were cooking with that morning. We then began cooking by preparing the ingredients for each sauce. After this, we ground, sauteed, and finished the sauces, adding each to a dish we were making. After beginning each dish, Ketut's team finished the dishes and served the buffet. If you are looking for a lovely Balinese group to teach you how to cook Balinese food and teach you more about their culture, Payuk is the clear choice for a class in Ubud. They are definitely worth a trip from Canggu, Seminyak or Kuta."

It was excellent value for money, and easily one of the best things I did in Indonesia, as you come away from the class with a new skill. We did the afternoon class, as the morning classes for the next few days were fully booked. (Class sizes are capped to I think 12 participants.) The only difference between the classes is that the afternoon class does not include a visit to the Ubud market. We were picked up from our hotel around 2pm and dropped back round 8pm. We paid Rp 350,000 per person. The food we prepared was delicious! Our group of seven spent a lot of time chopping, grinding and blending spices. It was all done the traditional way, using mortar and pestles rather than electrical blenders. We learnt how to cook 3 spice mixes/sauces which form the basis for much Indonesian cuisine. We were then shown how to prepare 5 dishes (4 savoury plus 1 dessert). I was the only vegetarian in the group and made similar dishes to the others (eg satay tofu and tempeh skewers whilst the others made satay chicken skewers, and steamed mushrooms in banana leaves whilst the others did steamed fish). We didn't cook everything from start to finish, but would tend to start dishes which were then finished by the handful of assistants there. This struck me as a good use of our time. The main chef, Ketut, is described in most of these reviews as one of the happiest people alive, and he did not disappoint! (In fact, it was on the basis of Trip Adviser reviews that I picked this particular cooking school.) I particularly appreciated how he involved my daughter in activities, giving her little jobs to do that involved less chopping but which helped her to feel included. Ketut and the other chef (whose name I forget) in whose family compound the classes are held were consistently helpful and encouraging. After around 3 hours of cooking, our group sat down to feast on what we'd cooked. There was far more food than we could have possibly eaten. The food was simply divine, and the surroundings, which overlooked a valley, were most pleasant. All participants were given a recipe handbook at the end of the class. Since my holiday ended last week, I have cooked nothing but Indonesian food. I do not feel at all daunted by the longish list of ingredients as I feel that this class was really helpful at demystifying Indonesian cooking, and showing how easy it is to prepare. I would highly recommend Payuk cooking school. In my case it was definitely money well spent as I have been using the skills I learnt in this class every time I cook dinner. I also found the class itself really enjoyable as well as informative."

Started out with a tour of the market where we were introduced to some of the fruits and veggies most commonly used in Balinese cooking. After that we continued on to a rice field and finally to the cooking school. Once at the school we were taught how to make Balinese offerings and were offered coffee/tea/hot cocoa and taught about many of the spices. Then onto cooking. In this school everybody collectively helps to make the dishes as opposed to everybody making their own dishes. While you will not learn in depth how to make a specific dish, you will get to try all of the wonderful dishes instead of being limited to just the ones you chose. All in all a terrific morning!"

I had no idea that we would learn so much about growing rice, making Hindu offerings, or making coconut oil before we even began cooking. The recipes were delicious (though our Balinese driver said, \"It was good, but not very spicy.\") and were adapted to Western tastes in one key way (only five hot chilis instead of 20!). Although it rained the morning we were there, we had enough cover to avoid getting soaked before we settled down into the outdoor kitchen. My husband has already used the recipes to make some basic sauce at home, and we've been back less than a week! Of all the cooking classes I've taken in a variety of countries, this one was the best value for the money. I highly recommend it."

The chef and an assistant picked me up at my hotel and we went to the market to buy fresh ingredients. That was fascinating. Then they told me about the area's agriculture, particularly the rice farming, on the drive out to the school. Those two parts alone were worth the cost even if we had done no cooking afterwards.The kitchen is built behind the chef's family compound. We did the prep together, so many spices. The cooking was very \"hands on\" and well managed. Then the fabulous meal that resulted was an additional treat. They gave us recipes to take home. This was one of the two best activities I did on my recent Bali trip. Highly recommended."

If you are vaguely interested in food, a bit of local culture or want a lovely view to accompany your three course dinner then I'd highly recommend this class. The team were absolute professionls from start to finish. We were picked up and taken to some rice fields where we were taught a bit about the growing process. After this we were taken to the family home, greeted with drinks and taught how to make a traditional Hindu offering and then coconut oil, before embarking on our lesson. There were six of us in our class and we all got a chance to get involved in every stage of the cooking process. There were lots of staff on hand to make sure everything went smoothly, dishes were cleaned and all the food prepared on time. They were also really friendly answering questions, taking pictures and happy to share their culture with us. At the end of it we got to eat the fruits of our labour in a beautiful outdoor dining area and were given the recipes to take away. Great way to spend a few hours in Bali. We did the afternoon class so didn't get to go to the local market to buy the ingredients which was a bit of a shame (they only run until 10am) so would perhaps recommend a morning class so you get to see these too. Highly recommend."

On booking, Chef Katut enquired as to any allergies, to determine which menu he would use.The next day Chef picked us up from our out-of-the-way villa at precisely 8 AM, and his driver returned us sometime after 2 in the afternoon. We joined the rest of the day\u2019s participants (we were 10 in all \u2013 the most is 12 for this class) at the market for a tour. Chef explained that we were seeing only the tail end of the produce market, which opens around 4 AM and that this was not a good time to buy the best ingredients. The class was held at the back of a traditional Balinese compound in Laplalan village with a very scenic outlook into a deep ravine. There were shaded cooking and dining areas to accommodate up to 12 participants and clean western style toilets. On arrival we said selamat pagi in passing to a traditional old lady with exposed breasts doing some chores on her porch (my wife was taken aback a bit). We started by making those little banana leaf trays with flowers and pandan for temple offerings.On moving to the cooking area, we sat down and a choice of excellent hot chocolate or coffee was served, and we could introduce ourselves and organize into teams of 2 who would share a gas burner. We were invited repeatedly to take complementary cold bottled water from the fridge. We met another chef as well as 5 or 6 other assistants including Chef\u2019s wife. The menu comprised:- Soup Ayam (chicken)- Steamed Rice, Bali style- Balinese Saut\u00e9ed Chicken- Chicken Sat\u00e9- Tuna cooked in banana leaf- Sayur Urab \u2013 a spicy cold vegetable dish with grated coconut- Sambal Ulek \u2013 hot chili condiment- Base Gede \u2013 a complex general purpose spice paste prepared with traditional mortars and pestles.- Peanut sauce- Caramelized sweet potato \u2013 a dessertTo begin, all the ingredients were explained and discussed with authority by Chef. He made sure we washed our hands and provided little plastic gloves when we needed to mix by hand. He then orchestrated the class, breaking the preparation and cooking down into very small steps which he demonstrated individually, and then let each student perform them. We each had a sharp knife, chopping block, sarong apron, and kitchen towel. He and the other chef walked up and down the 10 work stations, coaching, joking, photographing with our cameras, answering questions, and seasoning. The assistants pre-measured and staged the ingredients, finished the cooking steps we started, fixed up any poor work by inexperienced cooks (husbands), and combined the individually-prepared portions, so that we could move on through the menu. It reminded me of a cooking show on TV, with no time wasted looking for things or cleaning up and the assistants were diligent in wiping spills and removing trimmings and kept everything clean.Sometime before 1 PM, the finished dishes were displayed as a nice buffet for our pictures and we ate a very tasty lunch. We lingered with our congenial fellow students \u2013 Swiss, Swedish and Ozzies, until nearly 2 PM. This enjoyable day went by very quickly!"

After a demonstration of how coconut oil is extracted, we set to work preparing a wonderful range of food under the guidance of the chef. Our duties included chopping, grinding, sauteeing, threading sates, and wrapping parcels in banana leaves. The same recipes were adapted for a vegetarian version. The staff completed the cooking, and the food was presented beautifully for our gourmet lunch, which included soup, multiple main course dishes, and dessert.

Day started early with a tour of local market and Ketut pointing out various ingredients and interesting produce (kids had to hold their noses through some areas admittedly). Then we visited a little local school that Ketut helps support ( usually a visit to the rice fields is included instead but wrong time of year). Once at the cooking school we were taught about making offerings for the Hindu gods and then onto kitchen to make 7 separate dishes. All delicious. Ketut laughs infectiously all day... So much fun...

We each did not have our own work station where we prepared and cooked our meals. We all prepared together and cooked together on two stoves. I felt like I missed what some other participants were doing when I was grinding mixture or visa versa. I totally missed the method for cooking on if the sauces as that was done by three other ladies. In saying that this class was very enjoyable, Katuk the chef was very pleasant and explained things well while at the market. Anything I did miss is now in my take home 'Cooking Class Menu'. It was very reasonable also only \u20ac35 AUS each."

We were picked up from our villa at 3pm and taken to a traditional Balinese village that had a well equiped kitchen and an amazing open dinning room! Head chef Ketut is a very funny man that is a skilled chef and teacher. My family of 7 joined a Swiss group of 4 to an educational 7 hours of learning about Balinese spices and how to cook a 7 course banquet.We first learnt how to make our own Balinese flower offering and how to make coconut oil the traditional way. An entertaining afternoon of hands on choping, mixing, frying, steaming, and then eating our way through this 7 course menu was the best family activity!!Web address: www.payukbali.com Email: info@payukbali.com"

We were meant to meet at Ubud Palace at 8:30am in the morning but the traffic into Ubud from Legian made us 30 minutes late (we had left at 7:30am already). Not only was Made very welcoming he sat there for 30 minutes assuming we were probably a no show. We then went into the local market which was already starting to pack up (they open at 3-4am) to give us a few of what it was like; I would recommend arriving at 8 or 8:15am as Made was already waiting for us at that time. After trying the snake fruit we headed to the kitchen. A short 10 minute car ride away at someones home. We were taught about the local customs, housing, inheritance, how to make the offering and also coconut oil. Made explained everything that I had to ask and wanted to know. We were giving a refreshing herbal drink which you can ask the recipe for. Then we went right to the back and got down to the cooking class. The location of the cooking class is open air and looks into a river forested area, it was beautiful. Made quizzed us about the herbs and spices to get a few of what we knew. Everything was hands on from chopping all the herbs and making the paste. The only thing we didn't cut was the meat. We made a total of 7 dishes and was holding our bellies out the door. The food was nice, I found the favours milder then what we ate at the restaurants but it was delicious =)Once again Thank you Made for your patience and being a wonderful teacher =) Hope to see you again sometime soon."

This was such an enjoyable day, made all the more so, by the head chef, Ketut, who was very funny and very entertaining. We were picked up from our hotel and taken to Ubud Markets where the various Balinese ingredients were pointed out and explained. Then we were driving to a rice paddy field, and the rice growing process was also explained.We were then driven to the location where we were going to be cooking, and along with 4 other participants we learnt to make the Balinese offerings. After viewing how to make coconut oil, and a morning tea of fried jackfruit, and drinks, we were ready to begin cooking.We all took turns in cutting, dicing, slicing, chopping, grinding, steaming, frying and grilling. Ketut and his team made things look and feel easy (I have since tried to cook some of these dishes at home, and it took me all day), and we ended up with a delicious feast of several courses and were filled to the brim with food, even though we had barely made a dent in the quantity.I thoroughly recommend this cooking school for a really fun day."

We went on a tour of the local wet markets and saw areas we hadn't noticed when we'd gone ourselves on the previous day. As we went from vendor to vendor he explained the various fruits, vegetables and ingredients and how they are used but cautioned against buying anything at 8am as 'there were too many flies and fingers so late in the morning. He shops at 4am to get the best and freshest ingredients. We then headed out of Ubud into the rice fields entertained by his wit and repartee en route. We were certainly a happy bunch by the time we'd learned about rice farming and made our way to the family compound where the class is taught. Before the cooking began we learned to prepare offerings from banana leaves and flowers and had the chance to see how locals lived.There were lots of opportunities to participate in the preparation of the meal - and lots of help to prepare a very labour intensive repast with a variety of family and friends helping with the cutting and dicing and cooking. The lesson finished with the nine students sitting down to what we had prepared - about 10 courses in all. We left feeling very confident that we'd learned to cook authentic Balinese food, with lots more knowledge about Balinese family life and having had many good belly laughs."

Experience started with a visit to the food market where we tried some different fruits and had a quick look around. On arrival at the cookery school we then got to make an offering that you see around the temples with fresh flowers which was interesting. During this we were served a delicious ginger tea. Then for the cooking we were all given various jobs preparing parts of the sauces, meats and vegetables for several dishes on an indonesian menu including starter, mains and dessert. Whenever you finished a job you were given something else to do and we got to do a range of cooking activities like chopping, frying, pestle and mortar, using banana leaves etc. The satay sauce was particularly good! During the cooking Ketut explained more about the meals and cooking techniques. Afterwards lunch was served to you with a drink where you got to try all the meals prepared.

I did learn how the dishes were created and after watching (most of the time, you actually just watch), I'm confident I can re-create all the dishes.However if like me, your expectation is a complete cooking experience, you will be quite disappointed. I've taken half-day cooking classes for tourists in Laos and Thailand. Usual routine was: the chef's would cook and demonstrate then we would go to our own work stations (2 people/station) where we were left on our own to do everything from scratch with the aid of the recipe book while the chefs checked on us. We peeled, sliced, chopped, and cooked. We each made all the dishes step by step and when we sat down to eat, we were able to compare each other's work. At Payuk Bali, everything had been prepped already. We just did additional chopping and grinding. We did different tasks for 1 dish so we didn't get to experience actually completing a single dish on our own. The only cooking I ever did was to simmer the peanut paste someone else had made. Most of the time we were huddled around the stove watching while someone stirred something and another put a teaspoon of something on the instructions of the chef. It was over all too soon and I felt I didn't really create something. I didn't even stand long enough on the stove to feel its heat.If you just want to have fun and have a really easy experience of \"cooking\" then I guess it would work for you. I really wanted to cook the way I had it in my previous cooking classes, but I didn't get it here that's why I guess, I left the experience not really feeling I accomplished something. This was the only cooking class i did where my recipe book remained clean and crisp as we never used it."

Communication was in English at a high standard.We were taken to the main Ubud market ( not the cleanest place here) and introduced to many of the local varieties of foods and spices available. In particular we were taken with pink ginger flower which were used later in a fresh sambal together with chili, shallots, garlic, affirmative lime juice and salt, mixed with coconut oil.We then proceeded to the villa set on the edge of one of the river ravines. Almost every plant in the beautiful compound garden was able to be used in the kitchen. We were greeted with a cold tea and a brief class in offering making.The class was preceded by morning tea, actually banana fritters. We were provided with clearly written notes for both the meat and non-meat menus as requested.We were taught about the methods and ingredients of 7 dishes and their accompanying saucesmaking these as we went along. There was ample opportunity to both observe and participate in each process and each step was expertly guided by our chef Ketut and his team.Each component and process was explained and demonstrated. The school uses traditional cutting, pounding ( for the tuna dishes) and Balinese mortar and pestle technique. Steaming, shallow and deep frying and barbecue techniques were demonstrated. Dessert was made using a caramelizing technique for sweet plantain bananas leaving the flesh intact with a citrussy flavour despite the use of palm sugar. Western kitchen equivalents for preparation were discussed where required.The class moved rapidly and deliciously to lunch which was served in feast style.A very satisfying and rewarding activity which my wife and I have no hesitation in recommending to others , both nivice and experienced, in the confidence that the time required will be well rewarded."

We were picked up from our resort but Ketuk and one of his assistants. Very friendly and also funny from the start. 2 other guest were picked up and we were driven up to their village. Here we stopped at some paddy field and Ketuk explained how rice is harvested. Following this we hoped back in the car and up to see the tradition Balinese house. We learnt about Balinese offerings and how to make the offerings. We sampled a Balinese snack before beginning cooking. We spent the next couple of hours learning about tradition food, we were encouraged to smell, taste and ask about all the ingredients. There was plenty of opportunity for questions and if you wanted anything else explained Ketuk and his team were more than happy to explain. Following the cooking we were all able to enjoy the food we cooked. Ketuk and his team were extremely friendly, welcoming and funny. It was a fantastic afternoon and I would highly recommend for anyone. Thank you to everyone at Payuk!!"

The bonus is you'll get to eat it all. Highly recommend and wouldn't change a thing."

The day started with Chef Ketut giving us a tour of the markets where all the food would normally be purchased, although the ingredients were all pre purchased for us to start the class when we arrived at the kitchen. Chef Ketut also helped me buy a Durian (the stinky asian fruit) at the market as I had really wanted to try one for a long time - it tastes better than it smells). We were in a group of 8 people and we had a great time. Chef Ketut and his asisstants were very friendly and helpful, and we all got to experience each stage of the process to make several starter and main dishes, and a dessert. The whole atmosphere was fun and friendly too. The reward of out labour was a delicious buffet of the food we had prepared. Hygine standards were good too. Highly recommend to any lover of cooking or eating Indonesian cuisine"

We'd done a lot of research into the activities we were planning to do, and there are a lot of similar cooking classes on offer - we're so glad we chose this one! It is a special privelege to visit someone's home to learn how to cook traditional Balinese food! The house is set in lovely surroundings, overlooking a river, with lots of vividly coloured flowers. Before we started cooking, we used some of these flowers to learn how to make small offerings. We also visited an afternoon food market beforehand, and tried some snake fruit, which was interesting!Ketut, Kadek and all the staff make sure you get really involved, and a hands-on experience is exactly what we were looking for! There was also plenty of time for photos, and Ketut himself was happy to take photos of us chopping/frying away. You also get a recipe book to take home, so that you can recreate (or at least, try to!) all of the dishes at home. There were 4 of us, which I think is a perfectly sized group, and we all got along really well. This made the experience even better! There was lots of laughter, especially from Ketut, who is brimming with genuine warmth, friendliness and all-round cheerfulness. Kadek, who showed us around the markets and taught us how to make our offerings, was lovely and a great guide, and made us feel so welcome!At the end of the day while the sun was setting, we got to sit down and eat what we'd made. The food was delicious, varied, and plentiful, and the atmosphere was beautiful, and very relaxed. It was the perfect ending to a fun-filled day in the kitchen.I'd recommend this course to anyone who is visiting Ubud. It's superb value for money, and you get a fantastic experience that you'll never forget! Another thing I'd recommend when visiting Ubud is to use mosquito repellent wherever you go!"

There was little waiting time and a lot of eating time, and the food was great!The cooking was great fun. Everyone got to participate and chop, grill, or fry things. I particularly appreciated the fact that we didn't need to know the recipe itself (what a relief, the basic sauce is NOT basic at all!) The staff was there to give us directions every now and then, and we all worked together to move every quickly through recipes. Indonesian food involves many herbs and ingredients, so it was better to rely on the staff and study the recipe on your own later. I have taken cooking classes before that I thought was so-so, but this one is great because the food smells so good and you wouldn't make indonesian at home. I also liked the other participants and even made friends after the class! I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who has any interest in cooking or would like to see explore a traditional Balinese home."

We returned to a traditional Balinese home to begin our cooking experience. We began by making a flower offering and then made our way to the 'kitchen' and 'dining' area - the most beautiful setting. Surrounded by lush garden, high on a cliff edge - we could hear the river running below.After a cuppa and fried banana we began to chop, saut\u00e9, steam, pound (chicken mince), fry, mix, grill etc. Our group of four was kept very busy!! Once all dishes were completed came the best part...time to feast!! The food was delicious, company was wonderful and the setting was second to none. Payuk Cooking Class is highly recommended. There is something very special about being invited into a private home to experience the Balinese way as opposed to cooking in a restaurant kitchen.Thank you Payuk!"

The class is held at a family compound within a really well set up kitchen and eating area. First, learn to make offerings, extract coconut oil and then on to do lots of food preparation. Lots of cooking and then on to enjoy all the delicious dishes made during the afternoon. There were six or seven Balinese men and women all assisting with preparation, cooking and just generally making it all possible. Sadly these guys did not join us to eat all the delicious food. It would have been nice to all sit down and share the meal and conversation together. Maybe this would be a good thing to do, a good opportunity for a cultural exchange whilst sharing the meal.

Then, we arrived in their house (a traditional balinease house) and they showed us how to make the traditional offreing basket, and we had a cup of home made cold tea. It was very nice, and the result was nice.They showed us how to make the coconut oil ( long long work !!! ).before starting the ccooking lesson, we were offered some banana donut with palm sugar and some tea&coffee. They gave us some cooking recepies, to do it at home.Then we started to cook, we leart how to make the tradionnal sauce, we made a soup, a chicken curry, tuna in banana leaves, yellow rice, chicken lollipop barbecue, and a desert with banana, coco milk and palm sugar.We eat every dishes and they were all nice.

He was very lively and fun and really made for a great host/entertainer/teacher. My girlfriend and I signed up for the class and were joined by one other person making for a class of 3. We cooked all of the dishes simultaneously so at times it was hard to keep the exact directions of a dish straight but it was still easy to follow. We made great food and I am happy to have a recipe booklet. We also made our own Balinese offerings, stopped in the market and got a tour of the rice fields. This was a very fun day!"

We were little bit skeptical driving through the countryside but when we got there we were reassured. We learned about the market, the offering, ingredients, how to make coconut milk and oil, and then also how to prepare everything from scratch. The chefs that were helping us were very good, I would highly recommend this is a great introduction to Bali food and culture"

It was relaxed and informative. It was a chance to get lots of our questions answered by Chef Ketut Budi in his jocular manner. Afterwards we traveled to a rice field where we learned even more. As it turns out Budi is also a rice farmer. Then we drove a short distance to his family compound. There we proceeded to create a sumptuous Balinese feast in the most relaxing, friendly atmosphere imaginable. The teaching was superb and included lots of cultural information. Like all great teachers Budi created an atmosphere that was so fun we forgot we were learning. The facilities were clean and the setting was remarkably beautiful. Budi and his helpers were efficient and so attentive. I joked that someday I would see them on the Food Network, but really \"Budi in Bali\" would be quite a hit. Even if you aren't that into cooking you will enjoy this."

All our questions (and the kids had many!) were answered by Ketut, our driver and the teacher.When we reached the family compound we were welcomed again and enjoyed a delicious drink before beginning with the cooking preparation. Ingredients were introduced and much laughter enjoyed by all the participants as we prepared the food. Kids were welcome and assisted to chop. And stir and grind with tools they had never seen before.By the time we were done we were all friends and sat down to a fabulous meal as the rain poured down over the incredible view of the gully. We relaxed and ate our divine creations and were sorry to leave.I would recommend this to anyone who likes to cook and have fun in a relaxed friendly home atmosphere!"

Another lady explained us something about making coconut oil and milk. Then got coffee/tea and a banana snack. Cooking was really great! We were just with 2 people so it was a private class. We were not really good in cooking but the 3 chefs helped us so good. You will make 2 starters, around 4/5 mains and 1 dessert. When we finished, we tried to eat all, but it was so much:)! The view is also beautiful, because it is in the jungle and above a river. The chefs can all speak english!"

The cooking class is held at a family compound where you witness how balinese families live together. You learn how to make balinese offerings and they show you the herbs and fruits in their garden. Then a coffee break with fried bananas and the cooking lesson starts. They explain everything clearly and let everyone participate in the cooking process. You get a booklet to take home with all the recipes. And after cooking is finished you can enjoy the dishes prepared during lunch. I cook a lot and have followed many cooking classes in Asia, but this was definately one which I would recommend to everyone. Thanks Ketut and staff for this lovely morning!"

The master chef Ketut Budi himself is a very friendly and warm fatherly man, with a nice sense of humor and charm. Even as an experienced cook myself, I felt I had learned something new. I got a bit of a sore back from grinding those spice paste, talked about working for your lunch! There was a lot to eat, too much actually, and it was very delicious and satisfying. This, in my opinion, had got to be one of those best Bali experience one comes for. I highly recommended this one over all the others, for the class is kept to a small number, which means everyone GETS a chance to have a go.If I return to Ubud, I will do it again, hopefully with different dishes."

So we checked it up on the internet and decided, that it was ok. The next day the Pick-Up came in time and we first went to the Ubud food market. One really nice told us everything about spices, meat, vegetables, etc.. On our way to the cocking class the driver decided to stop in front of a school. He gave us colouring books and said, that we should give them to the children. In the beginning we felt bad for interrupting the normal classes, but actually it wasn't bad at all. The kids were having a break of their dancing classes anyway and so it was ok for both parties.Now to the cooking class: In the beginning we got taught in Balinese traditions and had to make a Balinese offering ourselves. After that we started to cook. Everybody was busy. In the end we cooked 8 meals and had a nice lunch after class.We were 5 persons, the kitchen was outside, but in the shadow and it is also possible to just cook vegetarian or vegan style, if you like to. In the end the whole trip took more than 4h and we can say, that we really had a good time. We can really recommend the Payuk Bali Cooking Class. I think we had to pay 380.000IDR per person, which was ok, I think."

We received a welcome iced tea and were then taught how to make our own offerings which the kids enjoyed.Next we were given a welcome snack and tea which was delicious. The table organised for us is in beautiful location looking out onto the valley below.After this we began our cooking session. We put on our aprons and started chopping, slicing, pounding, boiling and frying. My kids had fun chopping up some of the ingredients and then grinding them into a curry paste. They really enjoyed making the chicken skewers and pounding the chicken into mince.When the cooking was over we sat down and were served all our food buffet style which was delicious.

The tour begins in the open market immersing us into the local culture of bartering for ingredients and a complete explanation the myriad indigenous spices and fruits and vegetables used in Indonesian cuisine. This followed by a beautiful ride into the rice paddies of Ubud to explain how rice is cultivated and harvested before arriving at his home and open air kitchen with a view of the lush Balinese jungle that is awe inspiring. Before cooking however, you are welcomed and invited to create an offering of flowers in their family temple to thank the gods for the blessings that will abound that day. Then it was off to the kitchen for a light breakfast of banana fritters and coffee before a four hour cooking class with superlative hands on instruction. It was non-stop laughing as Ketut is quite the showman, yet his expertise and very specific instruction was welcomed by the most novice cook to the expert. After all is cooked, the class enjoys the fruits of it's labors al fresco. The staff could not be more friendly and the food was outstanding. A recipe book of everything that was learned is also included along with suggestions for alternate ingredients that may not be available wherever home is. This is not just a cooking class, but an invitation to experience the Balinese culture and one that should not be missed.

I guess the program of each course is more or less similar, but nevertheless Payuk Bali offered an engaging afternoon and evening. We were three, this afternoon in November, the two of us and sparkling Joy from Taiwan. We got the regular market tour and a trip through the countryside to reach the facility. In a leisurely way Ketut, bright and cheerful and energetic, made us prepare (well, at least partly) a nice sequence of typical dishes, like tuna sateh, fried chicken, syrupy bananas etc. Alas no wine, but this was understandable given the price of the arrangement. After a big hug we were driven back to our hotel. We thought it to be worth our while."

We started off around the market, and Ketut explained everything very well. Then we went to a school, which was fascinating. It was so primitive I couldnt believe it. Clean and well maintained, but I have travelled a lot and was still shocked. Ketut gave us books to hand out to the kids and they loved it. I would recommend bringing something from home to give to them if you can.The cooking location is beautiful, and firstly we sat with the family in the temple and made some blessings with fresh flowers, then we ate fried banana with honey and had a coffee before the serious work began.Then we cooked some super delicious food, but I will leave it a suprise for you. This class was definitely the highlight of my holiday, especially learning from smiley Ketut and his crew.Not too long, not too short, great value for money. I would do it if i were you!"

We were first brought to the Ubud market where we got to see the daily livelihood of stall holders. We were amazed by the freshness in the fruits and vegetables. We then headed to the kindergarten which was an eye opener for us. Even with limited facilities, the children had so much light in their eyes, happiness and contentment. They were so quiet and well-behaved. Loved it! Then off we went to the cooking class. We learnt to make the offerings and I loved the details that went with each offering. Being a Hindu myself, I was not aware that we had colours representing each deity. I love the respect the Balinese have for God. Mind blowing!The cooking class needless to say was a delightful experience. Outdoor kitchen surrounded by a picturesque view of Ubud, its lush greenery and a meandering river...so peaceful. Loved each of the dish we prepared. They tasted delicious. The basa gede gede (the main sauce) is so versatile. It can be used to make satay, chicken soup and many other dishes. Ketut and his group of friends and family were of such great assistance. They made us laugh and enjoy our cooking. My husband who never comes near the kitchen actually prepared two great dishes! Love Payuk Cooking Class!!If you are looking for an authentic Balinese experience, please visit Payuk Bali!100% satisfaction guaranteed!"

First of all, I would like to say a BIG thanks to Ketut Budi and his wonderful staff for making our trip in Ubud a memorable one! From the time he brought us to the Ubud marketplace to introducing us to a lovely kitchenplace surrounded by lush garden and nature, it was absolutely a joy to behold! He taught us how to make balinese offering using coconut leaves and flowers. He patiently explained to us all the basic spices and ingredients used in most Balinese food. His friendly mannerism, humourous personality and in-depth knowledge of Balinese food made sure we had a fun and enjoyable experience with his staff. Me and my wife can now make delicious chicken satay, chicken soup, three types of balinese sauce, yellow rice, gado gado and many others! His friendly staff also made sure we understood the recipes and instructions. The cooking class ended with an amazing spread of authentic Balinese buffet with sumptuous taste and flavour! Highly recommended to anyone who want a taste of Bali through delicious food in a beautiful countryside environment!"

This you have to do when in Ubud!We were picked up at 8 a.m. by Ketut and Wayan with a van at our guesthouse, to go to the produce market in Ubud. There Ketut explained with great enthusiasm al about many different ingredients as we walked across the market, such as vegetables, herbs, spices, fish and meat. Also letting us smell al the fantastic aromas! The ingredients for the cooking class are already bought on forehand, because the market starts at 4 o'clock in the morning. So only the freshest and best ingredients are used! Afterwards we drove to his family's house where the actual cooking is done. But first we made a quick stop at a local school, to bring some books to a kindergarten class. This is so much fun! Al the happy and cheerful kids really lift your spirit! At the family house you are welcomed with a refreshing drink and learn how to make Balinese offerings. Then it's of to the cooking area in the back of the beautiful garden. After a cup of coffee and a delicious fried banana, it's time to start cooking! Everyone gets a recipe book on how to make base gede,gado gado, nasi kuning, sate lilit, pesan be pasih, ayam bumbu Bali, sup timun and kolak pisang! You get to do everything yourself, under the skillfull and watching eye of Ketut. He explaines everything with great patience and enthusiasm! Also telling a lot about Balinese culture! After the cooking is done (about 2 hours), you get a taste of your own made Balinese food. This is served at the dining area with a great view overlooking the palm trees and the valley.All and all a fantastic experience that I will recommend to anyone visiting Ubud! Besides the cooking a unique chance to get an up close Balinese cultural experience!!!"

After that went to an elementary school in his town to bring them some gifts and see their daily business. When we reached his home, we prepared the offerings, had some coffee and started with the cooking. We made several dishes and sauces in a small group of 4 people. After 3 hours of cooking, everyone was hungry for the good food, which as expected was fabulous. So go bestir Ketut and have your own Balinese food."

His cooking class, like his spirit, was generously infused with laughter and warmth, and of course, lots of delicious food. Payuk Bali Cooking Class currently ranks #15 on Trip Advisor\u2019s list of things to do, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a must if you\u2019re in Ubud.Since we opted to sleep in, we didn\u2019t get a chance to visit the local market, but we did get a delicious nutritious three hours of extra sleep. Our cooking class took place at Ketut\u2019s Balinese family compound (i.e. his home), set in the lush jungle, a short distance from Ubud. As is customary before meals, we began by preparing an offering of fresh flowers, betel leaves and panda to the Hindu gods.Whether this is applicable to all Indonesian food or just an example of a efficiently utilized menu, I have no idea, but the most important thing I learned was that Indonesian cooking is rooted in the preparation of three sauces: peanut sauce, samba olek and gede (basic) sauce. After smelling our raw ingredients (which included three kinds of garlic!), we began the laborious process of chopping, grinding and sauteeing each into a paste that would later be used as a base for our proteins. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m happy that modern-day food processors have replaced the mortar and pestle :)Preparing the many ingredients that go into homemade peanut, gede and sambal sauces.The large, open-air kitchen served as a peaceful backdrop for the preparation of our 6-course meal, which under my direction, would have been chaos. But with the help of Ketut and his family, we swiftly moved through the menu, frying chicken for one dish and grilling tuna for the next, and always adding in a dash of our basic, samba or peanut sauces. While the cooking techniques are simple (grill, fry, stir fry, steam), the meal took a fair bit of time to prepare, since we were making everything from scratch. The chefs made sure we snacked at regular intervals, so between the fried bananas, tempeh, satay and soup, we kept our hunger at bay. All of our dishes were cooked in freshly pressed coconut oil, which Ketut\u2019s family produces as part of their village farm collective.Our hosts were constantly smiling, laughing and joking and before we knew it, it was time to sit down and enjoy the spoils of our labor: tuna satay, gado gado, steamed pepe, fried chicken and yellow rice. It was a feast large enough for a family of eight (not that I know anything about feeding a family) although we were just five people. We had a great time and I\u2019d definitely come back to do it all over again."

A kaleidoscope of colour, smells and a fantastic array of spices. The huge bags of saffron and vanilla were a sight to behold. We were then taken to a family compound a short distance from Ubud. Two families live here and the cooking classes are held at the bottom of their garden overlooking the river. The class was well run and recipes given out. Chef Wayan whipped around the kitchen making sure that everyone got a turn. My favourites were the Satay Lillit, making the bumbu and dessert of palm sugar bananas with fresh mango was to die for. We made offerings to the gods with the matriarch of the village who promised to pray for us and our good health when she offered our handmade baskets of flowers at the temple later that day. The day finished with a visit to the local rice paddies to understand how rice is cultivated and how it grows. Delivered back to our villa, we were very happy that we had this unique opportunity.

Next we headed to what is usually a time for the class to visit the rice fields, but was changed for the day to visiting a local school. We were given notebooks to hand out to the teachers and spent some time seeing what the children learn. It was a truly wonderful thing to see! We finally headed to the kitchen which is in a typical Balinese home setting. We were given a welcome drink and cold towels while being shown how to create the brightly coloured offerings we have seen on the streets since we arrived. As if this hadn't been enough, we then sat down to coffee and tea and fried bananas. The whole morning experience was almost worth the full price of the class! The cooking lesson was phenomenal.

After spending a few days researching the best cooking school for myself, a keen home cook and foodie, I came across this course by stroke of luck as the other more renowned classes were either booked out, not running or under renovation. I'm so glad I did, after checking the course schedule, with its market tour, rice paddy tour & tradition palm leaf offering workshop PLUS the hands-on Balinese cooking lesson I had been searching for, I suggested the four of us (ages ranging from 4 - 40) do the class together. After much persuasion the family joined me, and we were lucky to be the only students for the day. We were picked up at our hotel by our chef Ketut & his able assistant, Wayan and taken on a brief market tour, where they were ready to answer all our questions. Ketut is a gregarious warm guide who quickly had the children at ease. Instead of the rice paddy tour, we chose to visit the village school. Our kids really loved the interaction with the smiley happy school kids, (and the school children also had a giggle at us!) The cooking class itself was definitly hands on - to extent that I looked across to see our 4 & 8 year old girls wielding cleavers to chop cloves of garlic! I was unable to help as I was too busy with my own tasks for the preparation of the delicious Base Gede, the base sauce and flavour for many of the savoury dishes. (I wasn't at all concerned, since our children were well supervised by the very talented staff at all times.)A bonus for us was that Ketut tailored the menu to add the kids favourite \"Lumpia\" (Spring rolls) and the delicious \"Dadar Gulung\" (Green Coconut & palm syrup pancakes). The setting, at the back of a traditional Balinese family compound was surprising picturesque, with views down a lush green river gorge. The outdoor kitchen was well setup and the fresh ingredients would make any foodie salivate.We were treated to an amazing banquet of the 5 dishes we learnt to cook, but it would have been nice to sit and share the sumptious food with our lovely kitchen staff and their family.I highly recommend this cooking and cultural class to anyone with a love of Bali and its food."

The actual class was very hands on and Ketut was entertaining, thorough and dedicated. I seriously can't rave enough about what a wonderful day we had. As for the feast at the end...amazing! My daughter and I are vegan and Ketut accommodated us really easily. The other three people in the class made chicken and fish dishes as well, so when it came to sitting down to eat, there were many plates on offer.I would suggest though that the early session may be better at this time of year, November, simply because the late afternoons can be rather wet. Ketut picked us up from our hotel and we were dropped home afterwards. So convenient. This was a great experience and at $35AUD per person an absolute steal.

It is definitely a different experience and we were taken through all of the ingredients and produce in their raw form. Market opens very early (before 5am) so they had already been down to market to purchase ingredients while at their freshest.Next stop was a local elementary school because part of proceeds of classes goes towards books for the children. Had a tour of the school and some of the group joined in in an impromptu one on one game with ice lock sticks that looked easy but the local champion won every time (9 year old boy with a pocket full of sticks).We then went to the cooking school in the local village. Beautiful setting overlooking the valley and rainforest. We were given a demo on how to make the offerings boxes full of flowers. Once we made our own it was time to cook.We made beautiful food using authentic ingredients and tools. We broke into 2 groups of 4 and it is definitely hands on so we got to pound, mix, stir and cook everything (under the watchful eye of the chefs, and they made sure they did the sate tests....). Great selection; soup, sate, curry, fish wrapped in banana leaf, rice, vegetable dish and a heavenly dessert that is so simple but delicious..... We then had the pleasure of eating all the good in the lovely setting and getting the recipes to take home. Definitely things you could make again, they made it seem simple. Highlight is making the pastes from scratch which is then used in almost every dish, so versatile.Well with the trip to ubud and would definitely recommend."

Ketut picked us up and took us to the main market in Ubud and showed us around (he already bought the freshest ingredients earlier that morning to be used in our class), he then brought us to an elementary school in his village to donate some books and say hi to the kids. After that, we had a quick rundown on how to make offerings, which was neat. The cooking itself was a lot of fun, Ketut's wife and another guy helped out, but we were able to do a good amount of the hands on prep and cooking work. The setting of the class is unbeatable and the finished product was really tasty! We had an afternoon feast that ended up being one of the better meals we had in Bali."

That was definitely the case in Ketut's cooking class! Everything from chopping op chillies and garlic to stomping tuna in giant mortars! We also visited an elementary school which is supported by Payuk Bali and learned about balinese offerings and how to prepare them. All in all, excellent course!"

Visting Bali early October, we booked this class at the very last minute on the recommnedation of our booking agent - we were very pleased they could accomodate our family of 4 at such late notice for that evening's class. We were picked up from our accommodation and toured the markets (which were quiet at that time), visited the rice fields and watched harvesting with our very informative guide. Once we arrived at the compound we were given welcome drinks, made our own offerings (with guidance), saw how to make coconut oil and process coffee. The compound backed on to the river - beautiful and very relaxing atmosphere to enjoy our welcome dish and later our meal. Ketut and friendly staff then put us to work chopping, mixing, cooking, etc but made sure we were having fun. We learned so much and really appreciated the fresh ingredients used. The outdoor kitchen was clean, hygenic & attention given to good food-handling practices. The meal was probably the best we had during our Bali stay - definately the best cooked rice we have ever had. The whole family enjoyed this experience!"

The thing that would make me recommend this cooking class above others was the host and chef - Ketut Budi. He is extremely entertaining, funny and explains things very clearly.We used incredibly fresh and aromatic ingredients (uploaded), and I love the Balinese offering demonstration we did as well. A recipe book is provided to all attendees so you can try the recipes again at home :-)I adore Gado Gado so it was great to learn how to make this. I would definitely recommend. A friendly family run business in an absolutely beautiful Balinese home. 10/10 - thank you for an amazing time Ketut and the cute little grandma!! I have uploaded some photos as well. Love Chef Dan, his wife Elizabeth and our friend David xxx"

You learn a bit about rice fields and the local religion too. A bit of help from Agung, Wayan and others was provided in putting together the Balinese cooking base from scratch that is used throughout - but at the end we sat down to a meal that we helped prepare and was as good as - better - a meal from a local Street Cafe - and its all included in the price.

We had walked past this area for days and not even noticed it there so it was a lovely surprise to be taken in to have a look. We didn't buy any of the produce as it was later in the morning and Ketut had taken the time to go earlier in the day to ensure that the produce was fresh for us. We then went onto the rice fields where we learnt about the production and then to Ketuts house where we met his lovely family and were introduced to the truly stunning kitchen and restaurant. The cooking class was very thorough and Ketut and his team were friendly and hospitable. We really did have a fantastic time and I would suggest it to anyone.. We got to sit down with our new friends and enjoy our hard-work in a gorgeous setting. A great day."

It provided additional cultural activities including the trip to the food market and rice paddy field, along with the creation of flower temple offerings which immersed us in to the Balinese world for a day. A magical experience with Ketut and his wife and Waynin who showed us patiently how to cook their mouth-watering recipies in their traditional ways. There were no electrial appliances in sight, it was wonderful to do things naturally. Steaming rice through a hand woven basket for example. Having studied and worked in the catering industry both in the UK and Switzerland many years ago, I am quite fussy about food and hygeine in the kitchen. Ketut runs an extremely professional and hygeine conscious kitchen. The Payuk Bali Cooking Class was the best day of our holiday.Wonderful, thank you so much for your personal attention and sense of humour."

Ketut was very knowledgeable, helpful, and it was wonderful to get out into the countryside into a typical Balinese house. This is more than a cooking school, its an education in how the Balinese live and how they cook. We were catered to as three of us had allergies, and given 6 different recipes. Ketut also taught us how to make sambal as one of the ladies had wanted to learn. A true test of any cooking school -Can you bring the recipes home and make them? The answer is yes! 2 months later in Canada, I just prepared a delicious meal from Ketut's recipes and wowed my parents. Also great, Ketut answers email questions! If you are going to do a cooking class in Bali, this is the one to do."

The market was an interesting glimpse into local life, certainly a world apart from what we'd see in the States. Next our guide brought us to a rice field where he explained the harvest cycle of rice (3 times per annum). After a quick drive back to their lovely home/restaurant, we were greated by an old women who was all smiles and instructed us on how to make a Balinese offering dish to the Gods. Next, we saw saw how to roast coffee over an open fire (which they later prepared for us and was definitely some of the best coffee I've had). To accompany our delicious coffee was a stricking view of country from their outside seating area - a welcomed moment of peace and quiet from the busy streets of Ubud. Cooking class was well planned, with an organized staff and clean kitchen. We were involved in every step and learned a great deal. Oh, and of course, the food was delicious. I would highly recommend the Payuk Cooking Class: it's a nice small operation that provides an intimate environment with great instruction, freshly roasted coffee, an offering tutorial, how coconut oil is made, and got to taste the fruits of our labor with some of the best food I've had in Bali."

After learning about and making our own Balinese offerings, we got to cooking. The class was very hands on and the small group setting was wonderful. The chefs are great - happy to help but very willing to let the students do the majority of the work. We cooked about 6-7 dishes as well as an amazing dessert, and were given a recipe book to take home. Also included was drop off back at the hotel.

This was the best thing we did in Bali, and one of my son's favorites also (even competing with elephants and rafting and fire dances!) The instructor is not only a skillful and patient teacher, but a warm and wonderful human being that it was a pleasure to meet. The food we learned to cook was the best we had the whole month, the setting was beautiful, we received recipes and an ongoing relationship (new Facebook friend!) as take-aways. There are several cooking classes to choose from - but I feel blessed that we chose the best! The teacher picked us up and even the drive to the family compound where the classes happen was great. Our class also included a tour of an elementary school which I was interested in. When we arrived they let us each make an offering basket and the guide showed us the compound and explained the traditional lay-out according to the four directions. The grounds, gardens and surrounding jungle vistas are beautiful. Then we made a huge variety of dishes and learned so much! They offer the course with or without meat dishes and it is good for a variety of ages. The only draw-back is the huge amount of food that is so good I over-ate. It's like there was a party in my mouth and my stomach had to clean up afterwards! This is so much more than just a cooking class and all the people we met were really special."

I enjoyed making the traditional offering you see everywhere. By the time you finsh preparing the food, everyone has relaxed, gotten to know each other and the meal is a shared experience. Wonderful way to meet other travelers. One of the best meals I had on the trip"

If you are looking for something new in Bali, you have to try cooking class with them.this is not only cooking class, it's learning their culture! (they organize this program in the best way!!) we went a rice field to see where's all the rice come. we went a small local traditional market to lean which ingredients Indonesian use the most.after we arrived at the place (that was traditional Balinese house) we learned how to make Offering.and they gave us some snack(home made banana pancake) and BALI KOPIafter those all we started our own cooking class. we were so lucky because we were the only customer for that class. (afternoon class)so I went vegetarian menu and two of my friend went non-vegetarian menu. (check the menu on their website)I will skip the cooking part because if I start describe how goof it was then I need to write a lot so I just say \"just try\" BUT! I have to talk about the people there. I've hear that they have few other cook but that day I met KETUT BUDI.he was the best guide and instructor ever! actually he's major in university was F&B. he was super professional!! I'm not telling only about cooking part, the whole experience with him was amazing he really tried so hard to make his customers happyhe told some funny stories, and made us feel free to ask anything curious, tried his best to make sure we feel comfortable~ it was just amazing~ he kept his smiling face whole time. and! he's English was so~~ good!!!

Making offerings was fun and it was good to learn about Bali culture. The tea served was delicious and refreshing. I saw coconut oil being made, so much effort. The banana fritters and coffee were served in the lovely open air dining area and were delicious. We then started cooking and made 8 different dishes which was very hands on and lots of fun.

            "review": "More Than Just A Cooking Class. I recently took my daughter from Australia to Indonesia to visit the family of her Indonesian father for the first time in 15 years - she is 19 - and thought it would be good if she could learn to cook something to contribute to one of the many family meals I knew we would be having whilst in Kupang.From the time we were picked up by the ever smiling Ketut I knew that this was going to be a great experience for both of us. We visited the local market in Ubud learning to identify ingredients -in both English and Indonesian. A real bonus, as so often we can learn the Asian name but not the English one which is a real drawback when one returns home. We were then taken to the rice fields in Ketut's village and given explanations on the planting, growing and irrigation methods (cultural and agricultural) of the different types of rice. After this we were taken to Ketut's family compound - stunning area - served a delicious iced tea with flavours I have never tasted before and a cooling face washer.We learned to make offerings for the Gods and their meanings - these are seen outside homes and businesses throughout Bali. We then walked through the amazing organic gardens which have everything growing labelled (again in both English and Indonesian) to the outdoor kitchen to begin our cooking class.The food that we prepared was absolutely delicious, about 7 dishes in all. I am over 60 and consider myself a pretty good cook - even of Asian food - but I learnt so much during this class. My daughter - a little reluctant at first considered this to be up there with one of her best Indonesian experiences. One advantage is that the class is small - only 5 on the day that we attended - but I think it goes up to 10. We were given a comprehensive recipe booklet to take home with alternatives for ingredients and cooking implements if they were not available in our respective countries.The setting of the kitchen and the small open air restuarant (just for members of the cooking class) is exquisite! Ketut is assisted by his lovely wife and and another man whose name, I'm embarressed to say I can't remember. All in all I can't recommend this experience highly enough."

My partner and I decided on a whim that we wanted to do a cooking class during our trip to bail in June of this year (2012) and it was one of the best decisions we made. We had such an excellent day starting with pick up at 8:30 sharp and straight to the Ubud Markets where Chef Ketut Budi took us around the stalls showing us a plethora of ingredients and taking the time to explain each one to us. After our trip to the markets we were taken on a drive through some breath-taking scenery to some rice paddies where the Ketut Budi explained the complex irrigation system used by the local rice farmers.Following our little adventure through the markets and the paddies we arrived at the home where the kitchen / restaurant is located. We were welcomed with a lovely refreshing drink and some soaped towels to freshen up. Ketut Budi explained the traditional Balinese house layout and functionality. We were then invited to learn how to make a traditional offering out of banana leaves and flowers and after that shown how to roast coffee, Balinese style.After a delicious morning tea of fried banana and awesome views (the outdoor kitchen is set on the edge of a cliff that drops down to a flowing river) we were invited into the kitchen to learn how to make a traditional Balinese feast! The class was excellent, all of the ingredients were explained and everyone got involved with the preparation of the meals. We chopped and mashed and stirred and laughed our way to a feast of rice, soup, chicken, gado gado fish and syrupy boiled banana. All of the ingredients were fresh and delicious and at the end of it all we got to pig out and eat it all. It was without a doubt one of the best experiences of our holiday and definitely up there with some of the best food that we ate.Aside from the excellent experience of cooking, one of the biggest highlights was Ketut Budi himself, what a character! He was so funny and cheerful that we would have been happy to sit and hang out with him all day! I would really thoroughly recommend this class, we had a great time and learned so much."

Chef Ketut and his team went above and beyond to make this a memorable cultural experience. First we learned about the ingredients as we toured the local market out of Ubud. Exploring the rice padis nearby was fun and informative. Then we spent the most wonderful evening on a family farm where the well-equipped kitchen and dining areas are sited high on the rim of a ravine. Tropical rainforest covers the slopes and the river sounds magnificent. Here we learned how to make the colourful offerings, grind coffee and cook delivious food. We shared this with a young couple from the Netherlands and another from the UK. Great company for the fun of preparing and cooking, then consuming. We thoroughly recommend this experience."

As soon as we were picked up from our hotel, however, I knew that the day was going to be enjoyable. Ketut was extremely friendly, funny and warm. He did his best to make us feel welcome, and my mother and I (as well as the other three people that were in the group) warmed up to him and each other right away. After the informative market and rice fields trip, we all went back to his amazingly beautiful house to make offerings and cook the food. The place is absolutely stunning. There are lots of fruit and vegies growing in his garden as well as lots of different types of flowers and beautiful trees. the place where you actually eat (next to the open kitchen has a beautiful view, and you can hear the river somewhere below. The cooking itself was enjoyable and the food was amaaazzzziinnng (even though I am a vegetarian). I can't recommend this place more highly. Anyone who enjoys cooking at all should do it!"

We chose Payuk, for three reasons. First was price obviously, because there was six of us. Second was the fact that it was at a family compound, but only a short distance from Ubud, and third was the recommendation from the shop where we booked it. Another thing was that Ketut was I think the only one that did an afternoon/evening course, which suited our schedule.We certainly were not disappointed. Enough has been written about what goes on. Free hotel transfers; Market; Rice paddy and temple; then to family compound. During our holiday, Our kids were constantly dodging and asking about the offerings that are everywhere throughout Bali. Despite it being our 5th trip and the kids' 2nd, we really didn't know much about them. So, while sitting down with Ketut's mum and grandmother, and making both offerings, the reasons were explained and translated to us by Ketut's little sister and nieces, who also live in the compound. We moved onto the coffee making/grinding, which was demonstrated by another family member. By this time, all the nieces and nephews were intrigued by our kids, and ours by them. They were kept at a polite distance, but it was notable that not a lot of kids took this tour. We began our cooking lessons and nothing was substituted for our kids who, prior to this, had peeled the odd potato or carrot, but very little knife work. They revelled in being handed razor sharp meat cleavers and the like. They were chopping, slicing, dicing, boiling, stirring and most importantly, grinning like Cheshire cats. All the while, they had one-on-one assistance and we were never concerned at all.At the end of the evening, we had a massive feed, in a beautiful setting. A truly unforgettable experience. Our kids still talk about it, months later. They now want to do cooking classes here in Australia, which we simply cannot afford.While in Ubud we did Payuk, a cycle tour, white water rafting and an art/craft/painting class at one of the local museums. Our kids, apart from the rafting, didn't want to do any of it. They now rate them as highly as the Marine Safari Park and Waterbom Park. Don't miss this. It has free pick-up from everywhere. Kuta, Nusa Dua etc. just an earlier start that's all. A great cultural experience. Unforgettable."

Already we noticed that Ketut, who introduced himself as the chef, was kind and very correct.After meeting the other people, visiting a small local market, a stop at the rice field, we went to his house: in the backyard (nice.., very nice) the course is given. Not only he explained a lot, he also asked a lot of questions and is doing the best he can to make everybody feel comfortable, like writing down your name on a small note so he won't forget it! First we made small traditional offerings, than coffee, thea and fried banana snacks is served and than the cooking course started. The menu is very nice, kitchen and location is neat and beautiful, ingredients smell great and the interaction between Ketut and his guests is great! I loved it! Off course, some parts of the different dishes are prepared but he (and also his assistent and his wife) explains why and how. At the end, the different parts are combined into a very nice meal, with starter, main course and dessert. Yumyum! That the course itself was very good, is important...,that the food was nice too, but what I liked most was the way that Ketut interacted with the people and also kept smiling. I really think that he loves what he is doing and that affected us al! I can't think of any negative point at all. If I would come back to Bali another time, I would take the course again definitely!"

As a previous reviewer has pointed out, it is a much broader Balinese cultural experience rather than simply learning to cook some tasty dishes. The class started with trip to the Market in central Ubud (they pick you up), where Ketut taught me the Bahasa Indonesia names for the ingredients we would be cooking with that day. He was very flexible with the menu (accommodating my fish allergy). On the way to Ketut's home, we stopped by an elementary school in his village and talked to a few kids and teachers, which was quite fun. After learning how to make offerings using bambo leaves and flowers with an elderly woman of the house, and surveying the process of roasting coffee and making coconut oil, we got down to work in the kitchen. I was lucky enough to be the only person who had signed up for that day's morning class: the student to chef ratio was 1 to 3! Ketut and his fellow chefs were incredibly funny and warm, as well as knowledgeable and encouraging. Yes, very hands on. Grinding up chicken for making sate - in a massive mortar and pestle - proved to be a real workout. The kitchen and dining room are beautifully situated on a kind of terrace overlooking a river, and bird calls provided a constant soundtrack. The feast at the end was absolutely delicious, and dare I say well earned. Strongly recommended!!"

The morning started with a trip to a local, non-touristic food market where we learned about Balinese fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices with Sang Made, the family host. Sang speaks English quite well and is very personable. Then we went back to the compound for refreshments and a lesson in family life within the compound. Chef Dewa then took over for the cooking instruction. We prepared a three course meal with 7 dishes. Preparation was fun and the food delicious. Prior to our sitting down to eat, we were taught about, then watched the ceremony for the food in the temple within the compound. My wife and I do cooking classes everywhere we travel as it is a wonderful way to learn the culture. We would rate Lobong among the top schools we have attended. Highly recommended as it is not just a cooking school but an education."

Very easy to book via telephone or email. The host Sang and the chef Dewa are professional and will make you feel at home. The cooking class begins with a morning tour to the local market where you will get familiarised with the local produce. A must visit. Then you are taken to their house for cooking. The house itself is a typical Balinese house and the host will tell you lot of their style of living. The cooking class is a big fun and chef Dewa is helping everybody. Special thanks to the chef Dewa. Strictly recommend this cooking class, and the food is delicious."

There's a reason this company had hundreds and hundreds of five star reviews. From the early morning pickup to the information local market tour to the actual techniques explained during the class, this is a truly well-oiled professional experience. Everything about this class flowed so well. The spices we touched and smelled in the market were exactly what our recipes consisted of, which seems simple, but is a really great tie in when you are new to an entire cuisine. This is quite a long day, but when I found myself getting thirsty, tea or a iced drink would appear. The family was more than happy to answer all of the hundred or so questions our group offered up over the course of the day. We learned a ton and left happy and full, thanks to the delicious luncheon you get to enjoy as the fruits of your labor. Vegetarians, definitely book this class. I did a lot of research before I booked and this class was seamlessly accommodating. I worked with tofu and tempeh whilst everyone else worked with chicken and it didn't impact things at all. The market didn't really have meat for sale at the late time of day (9:30am) that we visited with the class, I think that's a first thing in the morning product. Without a doubt, this was one of the best things we did during our two week honeymoon in Bali!Small tip - where close-toed shoes to the market. It had rained the night before and I was really glad I had shoes on as the market you visit (especially after a rainy night) has some puddles."

I felt so accomplished as a chef cooking real food from Bali. The smells to this day are still dancing in my head, I have bought cook books and I am watching videos on you tube to refresh my memory and doing a good job- except for the rice, its a work in progress. I recommend that everyone who visit Bali take this class because there is nothing better than cooking an authentic meal for yourself that tastes as good as it does from a restaurant. The trip through the market was the best experience for me because i was swimming in the spices and ingredients the scream Bali. And I got to shop like a local. I have looked at my food as a religious act after this experience because the people of Bali pay respect for all of the life that was given so that I can live. I made it a point to return to Bali next year with my family and the first thing we will all do is the Lobong Culinary Experience."

After that, we head out to the family compound where we were greeted with coffee/tea and banana fritters (delicious). We were introduced to the life of a balinese family with great detail before beginning our cooking class. The \"teacher\" is a restaurant trained chef and he shared lots of details about what balinese food is all about. We got to get our hands dirty and managed to produce a lovely meal (starters, main & dessert).Before serving the meal we had a small presentation on the offerings you can see everywhere in Bali and even got to see the whole ceremonial process.Upon leaving we received the book with all the recipees and a bottle of home made coconut oil.This is much, much more than a culinary experience. Not to miss!When coming back to Bali, for sure I will book it again ;)Thank you for a lovely day!Adina"

I booked Lobong after reading many excellent reviews. I was surprised and delighted at every turn. The group of 12 was a mix from all over the world - such great observations and comments based on varied backgrounds. Sunday, our guide, was an incredible storyteller. His knowledge of history, the culture, ingredients... all outstanding. After the market, we went to his family home, a compound that was beautiful. The entire family is involved in the business and how fantastic it was to spend the morning immersed in Balinese culture. If I could recommend one activity in Ubud, it would be Lobong.

What a fantastic day and experience we had today.First we were picked up by Sang at our hotel and driven to a market in Ubud.There we were met by Sangs brother Sunday who showed us around the market to show us ingredients we were using to cook. He was extremely knowledgable about all aspects of market and culture.From there we were driven to family compound and where we were shown around and learnt about how the family lived. We then met Dewa who was our chef. Dewa then explained what we were cooking and from then on everything was hands on.We cooked a 3 course Balinese meal and was very interesting an enjoyable to eat .I would thoroughly recommend any anyone travelling to Bali to go and experience this cooking class as very professionally run very informative and they make u feel very much part of family"

I reviewed several cooking courses, until I found one that had a menu I knew I would be able to find the ingredients for at home, and also a menu I was confident I could tackle at home.I wasn't disappointed, our teacher gave us alternatives for ingredients that are not easily found at home. The recipes were typical Balinese fare and \"do able\".The experience rfrom being picked up from my hotel was warm, comfortable and friendly, right until our drop off at the day's end. The market tour was informative and interesting. The chance to ask questions and view a family compound was also extremely interesting. The whole family seemed involved and everyone spoke perfect English. Our teacher involved everyone in the menu, and everything was made by the students. The end result was served to us in a beautiful dining area in the middle of the garden compound.You don't have to be a \"Master Chef\". If you can chop, grind and stir, you can do this course. The cook book given to you at the courses finish is also easy to follow. We had couples, small group of friends, and me (solo). The group was supportive, interesting and fun.I would highly recommend this tour."

My partner and I recently attended Lobong cooking class: we were not dissapointed!We were picked up at our hotel and had a short scenic drive to meet our tour guide who took us around the local market place. The guide was clear spoken, funny, helpful and full of interesting information about Balinese culture and food. We loved walking around the marketplace and seeing new things. The cooking class was held at the family's beautiful home. It was a humbling experience learning about the Balinese traditions and culture here. The chef was clear and made sure that everybody was following his instructions, this made the class easy to follow and a lot of fun. The food at the end was delicious! Make sure you have plenty of room in your tummy to fit it all in!This class was one of the highlights of our trip and we would definitely reccomend it to any food lovers."

From start to finish, the people were very friendly, welcoming and ensured we had a smooth enjoyable experience. The chef and also the guide who took us round the market were very helpful in explaining what each ingredient was and also what you could use at home if you couldn't find the same Balinese ingredient. We were also very impressed by how well they catered for my partner who is vegetarian. The vegetarian was by no means second best to the chicken but equally thought out and delicious. Overall, a really great experience!"

Definitely a highlight of our trip and I'm looking forward to making the dishes again at home. It was great to see the market and be educated about Balinese food. While we were at the market I did get really upset about the welfare of the chickens (it was pretty poor) and so I was really relieved and grateful when our chef explained that they source their chickens from a higher welfare place. The cooking was really fun and a good balance of doing lots of the cooking ourselves but with some shortcuts and help from the staff so that we were not cooking all day. A great day and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visiting Ubud."

A comprehensive tour of a small, local market, allowing us to see truly how the locals go about their day. Back to the guide's family compound to cook our bounty. The structure of the family and compound was well explained, I felt priviledged to be welcomed into the compound. The trained chef took us through all elements of preparation and cooking our delicious , authentic food. After an offering( once again, all parts explained fully) by the Guides mother on our behalf, we were served our food that we had cooked, restaurant style. An amazing day, it is a true experience in not only cooking, but Balinese culture. I would highly recommend taking time out to do this."

Right from the start you see that you are treated as a friend of the family. The team is so knowledgeable and justifiably proud of their culture and heritage. You start out with a top knotch tour of a market outside of Ubud and they provide so much information about the ingredients and foods that make up Balinese cuisine. After the market to you are taken to their home and then the real fun begins.The cooking space is imbeciably clean and so very well organized. The chef that teaches the class is internationally trained and an expert in Balinese food. The instructions are so helpful and they provide small tips and offer substitutions if we can't find a certain ingredient at home.At the end of it all you get to sit down with the rest of your class and enjoy the meal you have just prepared. The take away booklet with the recipes is clear and I've been able to make many of these items at home with no problem. They also have some of the Balinese mortar and pestles available for sale and I picked up one of these which has proven to be one of my favourite kitchen tools.This is one of many cooking classes available in Ubud but I really think this is the best one. You can't go wrong in booking this class and you won't regret it."

I was picked up punctually from my hotel (7.45 a.m.) and, together with a few other guests, taken to the local market where Made, the organiser of the school, was waiting for us with the rest of the people I'd be learning to cook with that day (there was 10 of us that day and Made told us the max. of people they take per day is 12 which is a good number). Made took us around the local market which was a brilliant experience in itself. We were the only Westerners there and were told lots about various spices and fruits and could even try some. An hour later we were taken to the Lobong family compound where Made told us about traditional Balinese family life (fascinating, as it was all completely new to me!) and answered any questions we had. We were then given either some coffee or ginger tea and banana fritters before Made introduced us to Dewa (spelling?), the very experienced chef who taught us various dishes. We learned how to cook rice the traditional way and cooked 8 dishes that morning. Dewa explained everything step by step, got us to chop the spices and always used 1-2 people from our group to follow his instructions, so that everybody got involved in things. Once we'd finished all the dishes, Made's mother did the traditional food offerings to the gods - a ritual that was so interesting to witness!After that we were served all the dishes we'd cooked - oh, it all tasted divine!!Afterwards we were presented with a little bag which contained a booklet with the recipes we'd cooked that day and a small bottle of coconut oil. Then we were driven back to our accommodation. I was back in my hotel at 2.30 p.m.All in all, it was a fantastic experience! Made speaks excellent English, as does Dewa. The compound is beautiful, and they take hygiene extremely serious, which I was so glad about. I cannot wait to try the dishes at home :)I highly recommend this cooking class to anybody visiting Bali!!!"

We started with local market (completely different from those Ubud tourist markets). Mr. Sunny explained us so much about all the spices, herbs. If you need anything for really cheap price take from there (Sunny helped us to bargain the price - tobacco, vanilla...). Later they welcomed us to their family compound with a cup of local tea/coffee and fried bananas, explained about family live, traditions. Then the cooking class started, everything was so carefully prepared with so many helpers so you can concentrate on the chef\u00b4s explanations and cooking.

Having said that, our colourful guide who spoek excellent English explained the difference between hot (small, red & very strong) and what they call \"tourist\" (big, sweet and not hot at all) peppers! He was an excellent communicator and knew the market and stallholders. I bought a kilo of the best local red rice for just 20,000 to take home, and learnt alot about herbs & spices. Then we went to the family compound where the cooking class was held. A really informative talk about Hindu culture ensued (why the house for the eldest family member is in the north and why the family temple on site was in the north-east corner) The art, architecture and fmaily practices were fascinating. The class instructor was great - he knew so much about all kinds of cooking, having worked in a big hotel before (His favourite snack was pasta he made for himself!) and he had a good sense of humour and engaging manner. We were lucky to be in a class of just 6 people, so alot of hands on work, followed by a most enjoyable lunch. The steamed rice & sweet potatoe and the chicken satay were delicious.

The Lobong Culinary Experience is fantastic value for money - it includes a market tour with your guide Sunday who can explain all of the ingredients and also how the market works. Following the tour, and some delicious tea and sweet snacks, the cooking class takes place at his family compound, where his brother-in-law (who is a chef) is your instructor for the class. Before lunch, there is the opportunity to watch Sunday's mum making offerings at the family temple with the food you've cooked (she'll wrao you up in a sarong so you can enter the temple with her). So a real insight into Balinese family life as well as Balinese food. The lunch you cook is delicious, and there's plenty of it. They even give you some coconut oil and a little recipe book so you can replicate the dishes when you get home (I'll give it a try!).Thanks everyone at Lobong!"

I am so thankful to Sang Made's family for this wonderful moment. We arrived in the evening the day before to Ubud and I called to book cooking class, even tough it was already late, we were positively attended and Made was waiting for us the next day to pick us up at the hotel.The tour of the local market was an unique experience, back to their home, we were offered tea, coffee and fried bananas while Made was enlighting us with balinese culture, traditions, way of life...Then, we started the cooking, it was so entertaining that it went so fast. All together we were a group of 12 person from all over the globe, so cheerful to share together this experience. All the techniques given by the chief and the kindness of the staff really made this moment special.Once everything was finalized, we were able to share with the mother of Made the offering to the temple house before eating all the dishes we had prepared. It was so delicious!!! Best food ever in Ubud.Thanks to the whole family and staff for this wonderful experience which I more than strongly recommend! Suitable for vegans offering, toffu/fish alternatives."

We were collected from outside the Ubud Palace at 8:00 a.m. this morning, driven to Lobong and then to the market, where we were taken round by Sang who explained all the fruit and vegetables and what they are used for. We were then driven back to Lobong, a truly beautiful family compound, given coffee, tea and fried bananas. Sang explained his culture to us and we really appreciated his time and friendliness.We then met Dewa, the chef, and his helpers. Dewa made it so interesting and it really was 'hands on'. We cooked numerous dishes and I loved every minute of it!When the lunch was prepared, we were taken to the family temple where Sang's mother made the offerings. We were then seated at a beautifully set table, where we ate what we'd cooked, finishing with black rice porridge, which I thoroughly recommend.I would recommend the Lobong Culinary Experience, without reservation, to anyone who has an interest in food and/or the Hindu culture."

It isn't easy as a tourist to experience so much culture without expert guidance and that's what we got from the Lobong Cooking Class. Sangde (Sunday to us) gave a great tour of the traditional market with impeccable English and a jovial attitude. He was also the expert at Balinese culture and taught us so much about the lifestyle, culture and religion of Bali and in his own home compound. Then his brother the magnificent chef took over. Cooking is very much a part of the family experience, but this was not average home cooking. Our creations tasted like they'd been made at a 5 star resort. What a feast! Can we recreate this at home??? The souvenir cookbook will get us close, at least! Thanks, Lobong Culinary Experience!"

This was one of the activities that we did. It has filled our minds with lovely memories. We were picked up from our hotel. As part of the experience we were taken through a traditional market which was an experience in itself. We were also shown a traditional balinese family compound. The cooking school is located on the grounds of the owners family compound. It is very clean and shaded, with fans to keep you cool. We made some lovely dishes there, preparing and cooking them. Once all the food was made we sat down for our feast to try everything we had just made. It took about 5-6hours in total from memory (it was back in May that we went). Lovely little touches like giving us cold water and towels. All in all a great experience that I would recommend to anyone that is visiting Ubud."

I asked about alternative methods of cooking chicken instead of barbecuing as England doesn't really permit the weather for that (haha!) and they were very keen and quick to give me other methods (use cast iron in the oven).

To be honest the top three have good reviews on the whole, however, I ended up choosing Lobong, and although they are (or were at the time of choosing) #3, they definitely offer a #1 service!My wife and I were collected promptly at around 7.50am on the chosen morning, and along with another guest driven around 25 minutes to a local market. NOT I will add, to Ubud market, which is just full of tourist junk, but an actual, local market. We were the only non Balinese there. We were a group of 9, so not too big, and were shown around by one of the brothers who runs the class.His English was brilliant, and he explained everything very well and showed us all the spices and root ingredients that are such an integral part of Balinese cooking. It was very insightful and at no point felt like we were just following someone around, it was informative and interactive. A great start to the day. From here we were driven to the family compound in which they live, and given a tour of where, and more importantly, how they live. We were told about the family history and the cultural side of how Balinese families live. Again, it was very informative and educational. The class itself was very good. Run by another brother, he too was very good, good English, and very helpful throughout. We learnt all about how to use the spices and the methods of cooking the multiple dishes that we made. Everyone played a part in the class and everyone had vital input to the finished product. It was well run and everyone clearly had a great time and enjoyed it thoroughly. Before sitting down to eat, we all experienced a big part of Balinese culture, and that is the offerings. It was a very nice touch, and gave the whole experience a very Balinese feel. We sat down to eat around 1pm, and by this time were all starving and looking forward to eating everything we had just prepared, and that we did. A nice cold beer to accompany the multiple dishes we had created. The food was lovely, the family were lovely and the experience as a whole was exceptional. They even give you a parting gift, a small book of the recipes and ingredients for the menu we had made, and also a bottle of coconut oil. Just another nice touch, from a very nice and well run family business. I'd be surprised if Lobong don't make it to #1 on trip advisor, they provide an excellent service from start to finish and we couldn't recommend highly enough."

After pick up they take you to local market, usually you are only tourist there so is pretty cool. Guide explains all about local spices and prices etc. After your market you go to their house, you have opportunity to meet family and understand more about Balinese family compound. Everyone is very friendly and answer all your questions. You are welcomed with tea/coffee and fried banana. After introduction cooking start. Groups are around 10people, there is space for everyone to chop etc. an experience usually finish around 2 pm, after lunch where we all eat what we prepared. We both really enjoy this experience."

That made me a bit concerned about their professionalism, but those fears were unfounded. This was a great experience for everyone in the family from our 12yo boy to my 84yo mother. The class was impeccably run and a completely smooth operation (no small feat given the breadth of experience in the class and the number of dishes we prepared). The food was delicious, and there were enough dishes that there is sure to be one that will be pleasing to your whole group. The dishes will take some effort to recreate in the US, but doable. The best thing about the class was the fact that it is done in their family compound. This, combined with the trip to their local (and non-touristy) market made this more of a cultural experience than just a simple cooking class. The day started with a hotel pickup at 7:50 AM. We were back to the hotel by about 3PM. Well worth every penny and every minute."

We had a GREAT experience with Lobong; it had everything we were looking for: started with a super detailed and interesting tour of an authentic market that had ZERO tourists, moved to a real family compound (of the owners, not staged for tourists) where we learned about the family and religious traditions, then spent hours cooking a Balinese meal with and learning all about the process from a chef who was at the Amandari for TWENTY TWO YEARS, and finished by eating the goodness we cooked! Class size limited to 12 (we had 10) and lasted 8:30am to 2:30pm. All cooking was interactive with the expert chef, who was very focused on enabling us to bring the Balinese cooking tradition back to our home in the U.S. -- this is not just a demonstration of something you'll never be able to replicate, but rather a true course of a dish that we're excited to try for our next dinner party. Gifts of coconut oil and a recipe book followed the class. For less than $30 USD (475k IDR) per person (including all taxes/fees), this was a steal. Highly recommended!"

The Lobong Culinary Experience did not disappoint & blew away our expectations. Starting the morning with a guided tour around a local market introducing you to local products was a warm up for what we would be cooking with. A quick van ride took us to the family compound where we were welcomed. We were shown the basic layout of the compound & the meaning behind the set up. A coffee & tea break before starting our 2 hour prep & cooking session. The three course traditional Balinese menu was explained in detail, as was every step through out the day. A fantastic set up to ensure everyone had space to chop, cook & take photos. It was very interactive with lots of time for questions to be answered at every step. After completing the cooking we were shown the Temple offering rituals by their mother with Sunday giving us details on the meanings behind the offerings. Then it's time to eat your three course lunch which you helped prepare. It was delicious!! It was a 6 hour tour, class & lunch for under $40. The class was all couples but it would be just as fun with friends. It is just outside Ubud & if you're staying in Ubud they will pick you up for free. We had our driver take us from Kuta but would book a pick up through Lobong next time as it cost the same but you start & finish at different spots making it a little confusing for our driver."

Having confirmed our booking, we were later informed that a family group had requested an exclusive class and so the owners cancelled our booking. I contacted the owners to let them know how disappointed I was that they put the prospect of more bookings over customer loyalty and courtesy and was informed that the family had already made a prior booking, but when they didn't confirm immediately Lobong gave away their place to us. Subsequently to cancel on us when the family did later confirm. Warning to anyone who books this class that your confirmation may not be final, and if they request confirmation of your booking, respond immediately so they don't give away your place. Very disappointing process and the booking was cancelled the day before so very difficult to find an alternative class. I would go to one of the many slightly cheaper, but still fantastic classes such as Jambangan who put their customers before their takings."

Not only do you get an insight into how to cook some traditional Balinese cuisine, you also get an insight into the Balinese culture and way of life. The day starts with a visit to a local market, accompanied by Made Sunday who was an excellent guide. It was super interesting to see how the Balinese people buy their produce and how their markets work. We were the only non-Balinese people there which was awesome. They provide you with complimentary water and cold towels at the exact moment that you need - the whole day has all been incredibly well thought out. The class itself takes place in their family compound as opposed to a restaurant or cafe which is very personal and interesting. The class is taken by Made Sunday's brother-in-law. The food we made was delicious! The actual cooking time is around two hours. Our class only had seven people which was great, this meant we all got a chance to be hands-on with everything. The price includes pick up (around 8-9am) and drop off from/to your hotel (around 2-3pm). We were also able to observe offerings being made in the compound temple. This was without doubt one of my favourite days from my Bali trip! The tiniest thing that I thought could be changed was that it wasn't made clear that the additional drinks (e.g. Coke etc) that were offered while we sat down to eat were additional. However, the prices of these drinks was very reasonable so it wasn't a problem. Make sure you eat plenty before you go, you get a small snack on arrival at the comound but don't eat properly until around 12-1pm. Overall, it was a day well spent! Do this, you will not regret it!"

The market was an incredible experience as we were the only tourist and non locals there. It was awesome to see the people from this village buying and selling their goods. Our hosts took us through the market educating us on many of the local ingredients used for Balinese cooking. After the market we were driven to our host home where we received so much more than just a cooking class. We were treated as friends in their home and given coffee/tea and a tour of their compound while learning about their culture and family dynamic. We also witnessed an offering in their temple and they explained how and why this offering takes place everyday all over Bali. So impressed with their kindness and hospitality. Learning how to use and prepare different spices and ingredients together was really interesting. The food tasted amazing and at the end they gave us a small goody bag with the menu and instructions of how to make our dishes along with their handmade coconut oil! Very nice touch!!

He brought us to the payangan traditional market in the early morning and explain to us the different types of ingredients used in Balinese cooking.We even got an insight to the traditional balinese family compound and we learnt alot about Balinese culture through him! Once home, we were greeted by chef Dewa. He was very knowledgeable and he go through with us the steps and techniques involved in cooking all the different type of dishes. Everybody in the class partipated in the cooking process. We cooked a total of 8 dishes, including appetizer, main and desserts! The food we cooked was delicious! We enjoyed the food and class very much and would highly recommended this to everyone who is interested in Balinese food and culture!"

My husband and I signed up to this course primarily to learn about Balinese food and do some cooking, but we did not realise it would be such an insightful crash course in Balinese culture too. A member of the Lobong family picked us up from our hotel and drove us straight to the local market to meet the others and our guide. We learnt loads about the food and it was totally tourist free - apart from us of course!Then to the beautiful and peaceful Lobong compound. From here I don't want to go into too much detail and spoil the surprise... but if you are interested in food, cooking and the Balinese culture then book here!

(Its the effort and pride in Balinese cuisine that made it delicious. Hands on is always better than theories. I bet you will remember how to do the dishes after 1 course) - Understanding Balinese culture (this is not just a cooking class. In fact the place is a home for Sunday and his family. Sunday is the guide who brings us around the market) - Fun and delicious balinese lunch (I enjoyed the session and had my own cooked Balinese lunch) This is NOT just a cooking class. It is a culture exchange with nice cuisine sharing. It is definately value for money activity. I have to say they have upkeep the home very well and beautifully decorated.Recommended for those who loves cooking or love food! Even for those who cannot cook, join them. It is easy and you might fall in love with cooking afterwards. "

It starts out with a pick up from your hotel in the Ubud area, then you go to a local market (not the touristy places you'd see on your own). The guide (who speaks very fluent English) walks you through the market showing you spices and foods you wouldn't see at home. He talks about things like how to tell if a banana is tree ripened, and what kinds of things we can substitute at home. They have everything carefully thought out down to the cold wet towels and water bottles after the market. You then go to a family compound to learn about home and family life, and how each compound is laid out and why. They make coffee or tea, and a special treat of fried bananas. Then you learn how to make an entire Balinese feast. Come hungry, because you get to eat the food you cook, and it is A LOT! Everything is so delicious, and they make every effort to keep the work stations clean and sanitized. Everyone we worked with was so helpful and lovely. We felt very welcome, even by the children in the compound. You can't beat this experience!! Highly recommended! Thank you Lobong Culinary Experience!"

Its taken me a while to write this as felt conflicted - in January we had the most wonderful experience at Lobong cooking school. The trip to the market, the family compound, the cooking instruction was all excellent and so friendly and genuine. Unfortunately the three of us who did the cooking course were incredibly sick afterwards with salmonella (suspect the chicken wasn't cooked or was handled in a way we are not used to which the Balinese chef did talk about). What was so scary was that I was in the early stages of pregnancy and feared we may lose the baby. The fourth member of our group didn't visit Lobong with us and was totally fine. Having 5 days of not being able to do anything on our 10 day holiday was not a great result!"

The menu was 7 courses and it was shown step by step how to do it. The end result was delicious. I do not like peanuts and one of the sauces was a peanut sauce, so he made a different sauce for me - very yummy! We had a wonderful bunch of travellers with us who complemented the whole experience. I would definitely recommend this to everyone who would like to try their hand at a cooking class in Bali. Thank you again Made (Sunday :) Kind regards,Karina and Julie"

Lobong Cooking Class is the best day out in all of Bali in my book, the day begins with a pickup from your accommodation to make the journey to a local market place in Ubud. Here you get to see where the ingredients we will cook with, come from. Then it is on to the family home for the cooking class in what is a fantastic outdoor kitchen, kitted out to accommodate 12 pupils through the tuition by qualified chef Dewa. All ingredients have been prepared before you arrive so it is straight into the cooking, including the slicing, dicing and grinding of the ingredients. Everyone pitches in to cook the meal which you will finally sit and enjoy with your fellow students. Todays table seated people from France, England, Chile and various parts of Australia. The food we ate, just like our last visit was amazing. Sang De the family host has a great personality, is very knowledgeable in many cultures and visibly enjoys sharing his culture with his guests, of which he is very informative and delivers in such a way he keeps you captivated so much so, you don't want him to stop talking. A wonderful day out, hope to return again soon."

After everyone has been picked up you will then proceed to the market where they will educate you about the local produce. After the informative stop they will take you over to their property.The class takes place in their compound or house. You will partake in the daily rituals and prayers to the elders and then go on to the actual class. They will teach you how to prepare each ingredient and the proper steps to prepare each dish. During our specific experience they also taught us how to make coconut oil. After all the cooking you will then be rewarded with the spoils of your work. Gathered together in a big communal table you will drink and dine.After every one is done it is time to pay up and you will be escorted back to your hotel."

From the moment we were picked up from our hotel to the time we were dropped back we were treated like very special guests.This is not just like any other cooking class. It encompasses the cultural side, local customs, spiritual importance of Balinese religion and everyday family life, truly inspirational and not to mention the way the teaching was carried out, in such a professional manner. I have learned so many new thing that I thought I already knew about cooking, like cooking rice the proper way! After walking through the food market and learning about the main ingredients in Balinese cooking we went back to the school, which is also a family compound set in beautiful surrounding. We make five or six different dishes, they all turned out to be delicious.I would highly recommend this experience to anyone wanted to learn about Balinese cooking and traditions. This course is very comprehensive and fantastic value for money.If I return to Bali I have no doubt I will go back for another course. Thank you Lobong. I had a unforgettable day.Kim"

Going back to the compound was amazing, the home of this family is so beautiful & finding out all about the structure & rituals of the family was very interesting. Then onto the cooking - our mentor chef was fantastic, had a great sense of humour & encouraged everyone to have a go.

We learnt about family, housing, education and even had the honour of going into the family temple to see how a offering is done before we eat. Cooking class was great!! Very hands on and by far the best meal we had on our whole trip. Dont waste your time with any other cooking company book with these guys.

We saw some offers for cooking classes on the streets, being held in Warungs and cafes, and we are so glad we decided to book online after reading reviews.Lobong Cooking Class does not disappoint. In fact, it's better than we expected.We were picked up from our hotel at 8am, but an talkative and friendly driver, taken to a local market to join the rest of the group. There were 7 other tourists that joined our group, and we met our guide, Sang De. Sang De, guided us through a local market, only used by locals to purchase food. We could tell that this was an authentic local market, because not once, were we approached by a seller trying to convince us to buy something. We were a bit of an attraction to the locals as the only foreigners in the market. Sang De was funny, informative as he directed us around the market, explaining the various customs, spices, and vegetables.After exploring the local market, we were taken to the Snag De's family compound, where we were shown around the compound, receiving a full explanation followed by banana fritters and ginger tea/balinese coffee.Soon afterwards, our teacher, Sang De's brother-in-law took us through the cooking class.The entire experience was amazing, starting at 8am and finishing at 2:30pm. It included seeing how to cook and actually chopping, grinding and cooking traditional dishes consisting of soup, curry, rice, and sweet green crepes.Everyone involved in the Lobong Cooking Class is polite, professional, speaks english and is entertaining and informative. There are plenty of opportunities to ask questions and they ensure that everyone gets involved.It concludes with being served the meals we prepared, including free beer or softdrink and being given a recipe book & home-made coconut oil to take home. The whole experience cost my wife and I approx 850K, and we also purchased a Volcanic Rock Pestle & Mortar for only 80K.I highly recommend this experience to anyone including kids, as it's a hands on authentic experience full of great flavour and food."

He then drove us to his family's compound where he explained about Baliense family life, how and why the compound is set up in the way that it is and other interesting facts about Hinduism in Bali --we were given coffee, tea and a welcome treat and then it was off to the kitchen.The cooking itself was tons of fun! Everyone got their own stations and was involved in prepping the ingredients, cooking the dishes, stirring and saut\u00e9ing (I've heard in other schools this is not the case). We all got to be a part of the class which made the day super fun and rewarding when we feasted on our delicious creations. A full experience that is so much more than just a cooking class - I highly recommend to anyone traveling in Ubud. You won't regret it!"

Sang De (our guide) explained a lot of the food to us and let us try a local fruit which was interesting. We then went back to their family 'compound' which is where all Balinese people live. It was really great to see inside their home to understand the Balinese culture. De Wa then guided us through making a full 3 course traditional Balinese meal. Everyone was involved in making every step, with all 8 of us making the meal together. We then got taken to their family shrine and Sang De explained all about the offering process while his mother did the offering for the meal we had created. Very, very interesting. The meal itself was absolutely amazing, and Sang De's information about Balinese tradition and De Wa's knowledge of traditional food was so amazing. This is the best thing we have done in Bali so far, can not recommend it highly enough. Thank you to the Lobong family for making it so special!"

While the staff finished and plates our dishes, we got to join in a ceremony at the family temple. Again, everything was explained to us and then the ritual was performed. After that it was finally time to fig in and taste the sate, nasi, soup and salad we helped prepare. It was absolutely delicious! I'm very glad we took the time to participate, it was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.Also, if you can't handle spicy food, please don't feel discouraged and do take part in the class.

We had 10 people in our class which seemed like a good number. You didn't get a chance to prepare every step of each meal however lots of opportunity to observe. I think we would easily be able to replicate most of the dishes at home with the menus given. Chef Dewa has worked in 5 star Balinese resorts for many years as well as in Australia so has a good gage of how to translate this into Western home cooking. The food was delicious! The market tour was not too extreme- suitable for families. People with mobility impairments should be aware of stairs in the market and steep stairs to access the family compound. The information on Indonesian cultural background provided by Sang De was very interesting, I learnt many new things on my 4th trip to Indonesia. 5 stars to staff for friendly, welcoming and informative service."

Sang De does well to transfer his love for his culture and customs to his clients. Our chef for the day was Dewa. He is a very passionate teacher and we had a lot of fun preparing the food. He was very thorough in his explanation yet very encouraging too!(I am a beginner cook hehe). And a bonus - we got a parting gift as well. A recipe book of the dishes we did included! All in all, a cooking class with a real Balinese experience to it! Can't recommend enough :)"

Despite the many classes the family had conducted, the guide Sang De and chef Dewa had consistently shown passion in doing what they loved. The culture of bali, the persistence in using organic ingredients and their incredible service mindset. Little details we looked into, cold towel after our traditional market tour. Will not write up on the details of the class as many had already given many detailed accounts.Definitely a must go if you are at bali.Thank you Sang de, Dewa and family for an unforgettable and enriching experience at lobong culinary experience."

This is a very slick, professional operation that still makes you feel part of the family. From pickup to dropoff, the market tour and the cooking class itself, you were immersed in the wonderful Balinese culture. The dishes were fairly simple but they concentrate on traditional family Balinese dishes. The key differential here is how they explain not only the cultural significance of the food, but also how traditional Balinese family compounds operate, which includes the giving of offerings to the family shrine of portions of the food cooked, before you partake. The whole family are involved and it is this involvement that makes this more than just a cooking class."

I've been to three other cooking classes in the Ubud area over the last 10 years and this is the best by far. The local market visit is amazing. You get to truly experience the life of a local Balinese who shops at the market from buying produce, poultry, pigs, spices, tobacco and even clothing and kitchen tools. Definitely out of the norm than going to the touristy Ubud market.The compound of Sange De's family is so inviting and beautiful. We felt at home and relaxed. They do a great job with the setup of cooking instruction as well as the traditions and understanding of the family compound.The food was so delicious, the best we've eaten on our trip. I love Balinese food and learn something new each time I take a class. Dewa is a trained chef and explains everything and answers any question you have. The staff is very accommodating as well. Offering water, coffee, jamu. A must do in Bali!!! So worth it."

They take you to their local market and guide you through the different stalls telling you about all the different vegetables and fruit. Then, when they take you back to their family compound, you are greeted with coffee and traditional morning tea.They love telling you about how their family and the way the compound works. Then you start cooking. You are guided every step of the way. You don't have to go above your comfort level.

After a refreshing cool drink we were than taken to the Lobong family compound which was extremely well set up and accommodated the cooking school. We met some more family members, and got down to business, this is a very hands on cooking class which enhanced the experience. Once we had cooked everything we then observed a blessing in the family temple. Everything we cooked was then served to us for lunch and it was delicious.

And the Lobong cooking class was just excellent! - they are very efficient and accomodating to make the reservation via mails- you won't just learn about food: throughout the whole day they'll explain to you all about their culture and traditions. Bali is extremely rich culturally speaking, and it's fascinating to be in a familial house and receive explanations from Sang Made, who manages to make it accessible to all (great orator!).- but you still learn a lot about food!! The day begins with a visit to the market, where Sang Made explains all the basic ingredients, how to chose them, etc. Great!!The only two comments I have are: - the food we prepared was not very spicy - which is the way you eat it in the streets and markets of Ubud. I don't mean that everything should be very spicy, but everything was mild, even the dishes that are supposed to be spicy... When I asked why, I was told that as it's a class for foreigners, who usually don't like when it's spicy, they make it mild. To me it was a pitty: you come to learn how to make the food as it is made in Bali, and if it's too spicy, either you ask beforehand to make it less strong or you decide to spice it less once you do it back home. But they shouldn't decide for you.- when we were preparing the food, the person that was showing us the techniques was not always keen to answer our questions. Too bad, because we had tons of questions to be able to cook well back home, and everytime we had the feeling to annoy him.But in general, the day is perfectly planned. With a lot of little attentions that are very pleasant. I highly recommend the Lobong cooking class!"

Prompt pick up, fascinating trip to the local market learning, smelling and tasting so many different things. (Snake fruit was something I'd never knew about: how to peel or taste.) Our guide Sang De was well-spoken, gregarious, knowledgeable and engaged all with questions seeking how much the group knew about the culture, spices, fruits and all that we saw. Next up was to visit and experience their very lovely family compound with coffee/tea, fried bananas along with information about Balinese Hindu family homes that include a temple and fascinating architectural aspects. On to the cooking class where our chef, Dewa helped us learn and create the many courses of our meal. We chopped, ground peanuts, cooked and stirred. So many good memories of cooking, eating and enjoying the company of cooking classmates and our hosts; gift of recipes and coconut oil were a nice touch.

Our guide Sang De was great - very knowledgable about the history, food and culture. After the market Sang De invited us into his home where we got to experience cooking in a Balinese family compound. His brother was our chef (Dewa), and brought over 20 years of hotel chef experience. He was very funny and great teacher. All the food including the sauces we cooked were fresh, no MSG or pre-made ingredients and they also had options for vegetarians (I'm not a vegetarian, but there were a few in our group). We got to help prepare all the dishes we were going to eat, and the meal was delicious. We also received a parting gift (recipes from class + homemade coconut oil). Returned to our hotel around 3pm. This was definitely an unforgettable day, not only because of the amazing culinary experience, but also being immersed into authentic Balinese culture and family life."

My one small gripe would be that there are quite a few people (12 in our case) on the class. Although this isn't a lot, it does mean that you essentially cook a meal between all of you and a lot goes on behind the scenes to get things ready. I have to say that I didn't really do an awful lot of cooking which was what we really paid for.

            "review": "5 star experience!. From the moment we were picked up, this proved to be a fantastic experience. We were lucky enough to get a place with only a days notice, and thank goodness we did! From the local market tour (a genuine local market!) to the introduction to the family compound - this cooking class taught us so much about the Balinese lifestyle and values - it was much more than just cooking! However, the cooking was the highlight - as someone who is a confident cook, I still learnt a lot of different things and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. But don't worry, less confident cooks were equally accommodated, and everyone was given a number of opportunities to be hands on throughout the lesson. Cannot wait to try out the chicken satay (sate) and peanut sauce at home! Thank you Sang de and family for welcoming us into your home and providing an experience we will never forget!"

Sang, our guide, was great and very informative. From here our group of around 12 were driven to the family compound (home) with cold water and towels in the cars. Here you are welcomed into the beautiful family home and given information about Balinese culture which is totally unique.For the cooking class you are handed over to other family members and you make a full meal completely from scratch. It is informative and fun and everyone gets really stuck in. And the results are absolutely delicious!! At the end of the experience you are given a recipe book so you can make the meals at home too.Overall the day is from around 8am to 3pm including hotel transfer. Honestly it was unforgettable, the family couldn't have done anything more to improve the day, make sure you book for a fantastic day in Bali."

I booked the Lobong Cooking Class via the internet prior to arriving in Bali, Sande's communication via e-mail was first class with very quick confirmation of the class.Sande's picked us up at our hotel in Ubud and took us to the market on the other side of Ubud picking up other people on the way. The market visit was very informative with Sande explaining all the local produce that we would be using to make our lunch.On arrival at his family home we were given an explanation of the typical Balinese home and their culture. Following this we were introduced to Sande's brother in-law who hosted the cooking class. The class was fantastic and we thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic lunch that we had all prepared, the highlight was the chicken satay, the peanut sauce is to die for!!!!!! Once we were finished lunch, we were all given a recipe booklet with alternative ingredient suggestions, coconut oil and the contact e-mail details should we wish to contact if we have any further queries when we try the cooking at home.If you are going I to try a Balinese Cooking Class whilst you are in Bali I would definitely recommend you give this one a try, trust me you won't be disappointed."

We booked our cooking class via the internet and they were very responsive and happy to accommodate our timetable. The day started with pickup and we went to a market outside of Ubud. No tourists around and Sande explained how the market worked. We met many of the people selling their products and it was very informative. We then went to Sande's beautiful family home for the cooking class. Everything was explained in detail and every question answered. We were shown around the kompong and the layout and family structure was explained to us. After our cooking class, which was very enjoyable and hands on, we participated in an offering with Sande's mother, with the whole process explained to us. After that we enjoyed the beatiful food we helped prepare. The chicken satay was a standout - delicious! We were offered complimentary drinks and could also have a beer (charged) if that was wanted. We were all given a gift of coconut oil and a recipe book, and dropped off at our accommodation afterwards. All the ingredients were of high quality and very clean, including the bathroom facilities. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking and standing a bit. Highly recommended!"

It started with pick up from our hotel, taking us to the market where we met up with the rest of our tour group (there were 12 of us altogether which was a good number).

We spent the next few hours learning about Balinese culture and traditions, cooking and then eating a beautiful meal. The hygiene standards were high throughout - from the preparation of the food through to the toilets. Before we left we were given a small gift and a booklet with ingredients and instructions for each of the items we had cooked that day. Our car was waiting for us and took us back to the hotel.

The food was so delicious and something I have promised myself to tackle on my return home. Upon asking for a few extra recipes, these were emailed as requested.

This was definitely one of the highlights. First we went to a local market where we saw where the locals actually purchased their ingredients and learned of all the different ingredients that go into balinese cooking. Then we were taken to the family compound where we were welcomed into their home, learned about family culture in ubud and then began the cooking class. We also learned more about the offerings in balinese culture and experienced it first hand in the temple in their compound. It was by far the best cooking school experience I have encountered and the food was absolutely delicious - we hope to actually be able to recreate it at home one day. I highly recommend this."

We arranged the class last minute and they easily made accommodations for us to be picked up the next morning. Sang De picked us up on time and another couple and brought us to the local market and explained to us all about the different foods and culture. We even got to try some fruits at the market. Everyone was so friendly and it was so neat to see this side of Ubud rather than the tourist sections.Next we were welcomed to their family compound where we learned the culture and history behind the compound and were welcomed with coffee and banana fritters. We then started the cooking class and it was so informative and fun. They explained every step thoroughly and everyone got a chance to participate in the cooking. My favorite part was seeing how the satays wre grilled and how the rice was cooked.After the cooking was done and before we ate we got to experience giving gifts to the gods in the family compound. It was very neat to see. Then we got to enjoy an amazing meal where they served us. As apart of the cost, you get the cookbook from the recipes you made and a sample of hand made coconut oil. I highly recommend going here. The people are so friendly and it such a full cultural experience. They really care about sharing the Balinese culture and cooking with others!"

We were picked up on time and from then on had a wonderful experience. With very good English, Sang Made told us so much about the culture. We had to stop for a long procession and he explained about the mass cremation, which was going to take place. The local food market was fascinating and he showed us different ingredients we would be using. The actual cooking is done at the family compound and it was an honour and a pleasure to be there. Dee War was so pleasant and passionate about Balinese cuisine. It is simple, but the prcocesses are very important. Loved learning how to make Sate sauce from scratch. Sitting down to the beautiful food at the end after mother gave the blessings was so enjoyable. Recommend this so much."

There are many cooking classes to choose from in Ubud, and here are the reasons that Lobong Cooking class ultimately won us over:- Small classes of 10 people max, which makes for a pleasant, intimate setting conducive to learning. - Menu seemed interesting (this was before we landed in Bali and became familiar with the local foods) and the family took allergies seriously. No shrimp paste was used during the class, and this was reassuring, especially with my shellfish allergy.- Free pick up in Ubud.Of course, I can name you even MORE reasons now after having taken the class why you should choose Lobong Cooking class over the rest. Besides the local market tour, the delicious ginger tea and banana fritters that have been offered to us before we got our hands ''dirty'' + parting present (coconut oil + recipe booklet), I'm thankful for our teacher who offered a clear, hands-on experience to those attending the class (enough for us to be able to recreate the menu at home -- thank goodness, as the Kare Ayam and Dadar Gulung were fantastic). We also appreciated the ingredient substitutions they provided and the patience they demonstrated to the culinary-challenged (i.e. ME) Best part of the class was stuffing your face with the scrumptious feast, of course!"

After reading the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor our group of two families booked the Lobong experience and we were not disappointed. We were picked up from our accommodation in Ubud, and enjoyed the trip out to Payangan village, about a half hours drive. It was good to go to a place where there are not so many tourists. The trip to the morning market was so interesting and we really appreciated being guided around by Seng De who had lots of personality and was a mine of information. Lots of good photo opportunities there too, and friendly interaction with stall holders. The lady selling piglets even held one squealing piglet up for us to take a photo! We were also fascinated by the coloured chicks, and painted crabs! Not to mention hearing about the suckling pig, how to kill eels and what fruits make good offerings!! After that we had the privilege of visiting our host family's home compound - a beautiful and interesting place where we had the chance to learn about \"real Balinese\" people. The cooking school is brilliantly run by the whole family who take different roles but have complimentary skills. After being served with a coffee or ginger tea, we were shown around and then started on the cooking. The array of foods and spices etc all laid out was wonderful and again, lots of photo opportunities.The facilities were professionally geared to a cooking class but yet authentically local. There was a good balance between being instructed and shown a demonstration on the one hand and having a chance to do the hands on work oneself. The main chef, Dewa, worked as a chef for many years and knows what he is doing but has a relaxed and friendly manner making it easy to ask him questions. We also appreciated meeting the elderly mother of the family who had prepared offerings for the family temple - we were then allowed to accompany her into the temple while these were made. This was also very interesting.After jointly preparing the food we ate lunch - one of the most delicious meals ever. Our own group included two teenagers and four adults - all of us had a great time. We are so pleased that we managed to get a booking for what is one of our best travel experiences ever. Very highly recommended and extremely well priced, especially considering that the meal is included as well as travel etc. You won't be disappointed if you manage to get a booking."

Seriously, do yourself a favor and book with Lobong, you won't regret it ! We went to the market and Sang De explained to us everything we will use for the cooking class. Have to mentionned his english is very good and all the information he gives is more than interesting. I've learn more in a couple hours about balinese culture and food than in our entire trip. The family compound is beautiful and the kitchen very clean. One of us has allergies to peanut and seafood and at Lobong it was taken very serioulsy. Apart from the peanut sauce, they don't use nut/peanut/shrimp paste in any of the dishes, so it was very safe. Chef Dewa was also very knowledgeable and a good host. Now the food,.. it was DELICIOUS and we had big portions, so you won't leave hungry. The food was just spicy enough and every ingredient was fresh. Honestly, it was one of our best meal in all our trip and we made it ourselves. What is also nice, is that you leave with a recipe book and also some homemade coconut oil. The price is very decent for the service and quality of food you get. I recommend Lobong to everyone, it is a must do in Bali. It's not just a cooking class but a great way to learn about balinese culture and food. Thanks to Sang De and his family for this amazing experience ! Merci beaucoup !"

No touristy junk here, just down home Balinese items. Sang Made lead us through the market carefully explaining ingredients and allowed us to taste along the way. Then, he took us to his home, a beautiful family compound just minutes from the market. Here he and his family welcomes us as family. They toured us around their traditional home explaining the intricate details so foreign to western culture. Then the cooking began! We met Chef Dewa, another member of the family. He carefully guided us through every step including traditionally steaming rice, making sambal, curry chicken, vegetable salad and chicken satay. All the ingredients were impeccable; so fresh, flavorful and fragrant. Finally we made creeps stuffed with coconut and sugar- wow!

Questions were also asked so that we will be able to remember the information given.Back to the home, we were greeted with coffee/ ginger tea as well as banana fritters. The staff was also explaining about the culture of Bali housing. It is a brilliant touch on top of learning solely how to cook. He was also very open to questions asked about the place.Next, it was time to cook hands on. The chef who taught us explain how to do the dishes steps by steps. We were able to understand as well as follow his pace. He is also very encouraging, so first timer don't have to feel pressurize to do well or to catch up with the speed of others. Similarly, questions were also asked so that we will remember the technique acquired. In this class, we are able to have hands on activities such as frying, stirring, slicing, dicing the ingredients. All the cooking only took us 2 hours, to prepare 7 dishes. Lastly, we are served with the food that we cook and we are given a recipe book and a bottle of coconut oil as a gift to bring back.

It is SO much more than a cooking class--but rather a comprehensive lesson on Balinese culture. The class occurs at a family compound with a VERY professional cooking school built to suit about 10 people. The whole family is involved in setting things up, assisting, teaching & support. It is a beautiful home/compound with an equally beautiful family. My wife and I own a travel company and brought a group of 11 people to the class. It was a highlight for everyone. Can't wait to go back!"

I took two retreat groups from the USA to experience this cultural and cooking experience. It is one of the best ways to understand the cultural along with learning to cook their wonderful, fresh and flavor dishes. Sang Made treats each group as family and shares many details about the Balinese way of life and Chef Dewa makes you feel like a pro in the kitchen. At the end of your efforts you sit down for a fine meal and take home recipes so you can impress your friends and family when you return home. Each time I return to Bali, I will return to this class!"

When my sister advised us she had booked a cooking class on our holiday,I was \"yeh ok\" and after just contracting Ross River Virus 6 weeks before was wondering if I would stay upright for whole day.But it was just the remedy I needed.From meeting Sang Made & off for the tour of the local market, to look at the fresh produce we would use in our cooking that day, stopping to taste, smell & learn what some products were.Then back to his car for fresh hand towels to wash hands & continue to his family home \"Lobong\"As we descended into the Kampong the tranquility immediately enveloped us. Little birds chattering, beautiful gardens, water features, temple areas.While we sat & enjoyed a Balinese coffee & Pisang Goreng, Sang Made explained the home set up from the patriarchal family system to how every house designed with North/ East aspect.Then we were handed over to Chef Dewa & the team for a morning of cooking the best meal of the trip, cooked by ourselves & a lovely couple from Perth Sarah & TroyThe whole experience was a blessing, to be invited into their beautiful home & shown true Balinese culture & food.Meeting the Matriarch of the family with kindest smile, showing us the blessing of the food before we sat down to eat this beautiful meal we had all created.I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who is looking to learn more about Balinese culture & cooking. Than you Sang Made, Chef Dewa & family for welcoming us into your family home & enlightening us about your culture & cooking Wendy, Sue & Jo from Darwin, Cairns & Sunshine Coast (QLD)"

We are able to interact with the vendors and get a true Balinese market experience. Sang Made's English was excellent and it was a perfect introduction into an amazing day.After the market, we went to Sang Made's family compound where we were greeted with delicious coffee, tea and fried banana. Then we got right to work chopping and making the different sauces for the day. Chef Dewa did an amazing job explaining the different Balinese techniques and walking us through the different dishes we would be making that day. We made several dishes including chicken curry, sweet potatoe rice, chicken satay with peanut sauce, vegetable salad and a delicious coconut crepe for dessert. There was woman who was vegetarian and gluten free in our group and they were so accommodating to her restrictions. They had her make vegetarian curry instead of chicken and made a vegetable kebab for her. TBefore we ate, they had their mother made a sacrifice in their temple and then served us at a beautiful table in center of the compound. It was a true Balinese experience from start to finish and even gave us some coconut oil to take home!"

There were 8 students and we started by visiting the Payangian Market where we got to see different roots, herbs, varieties of rice, palm sugar, and much more. Afterwards we went to the family compound where Chef Dewa (20 years of experience) and 3 assistants taught us how to prepare seven dishes. This has to be one of the BEST cooking classes I have ever taken. It was definitely hands on and everything had been arranged and prepared just right to facilitate preparing all the dishes.This class is especially worthwhile because you get to visit the family compound (a very nice one), hear about the family history, and see how Sang Made\u2019s mother does the ceremonial offerings at the family temple before the meal was served. You are basically getting a lesson in Balinese culture and traditions as well as a cooking class. Tip: you will receive a gift at the end of the class, make sure you put the liquid one (won\u2019t tell you what it is) in a Ziploc bag to prevent any leakage in your suitcase."

There we met Sang De who gave us a really educational tour around the markets, showing us the ingredients that were going to go into our food for the day. We got to taste lots of things, lots of guessing what things were etc. so brush up if you want to be top of the class! Sang de has brilliant English and a great sense of humour. When we got back to the lovely family compound we were able to use their beautiful clean, modern facilities and then served tea or coffee and the yummiest banana fritters (which I really appreciated because I hadn't had breakfast.Dewa then took over seamlessly and began taking us through all the dishes we were making beginning with the spice paste. He explains and shows the techniques very well, it was a lot of fun and everyone gets plenty of turns.When we finished we watched Sang de's Mum give offerings in their temple and then sat down to our yummy lunch. I will definitely be trying to reproduce some of the dishes at home, the chicken curry was particularly delicious. And don't worry, the food is definitely not too spicy.The whole thing was wonderful, great job Lobong Cooking School."

Starting at the market, you are guided round, stopping at specific stalls to see, smell and feel some of the ingredients that you would later be using. The class itself is then held in a family compound where you are given an introduction to Balinese family life, their culture and a small snack of pisang goreng with coffee or herbal tea. The word 'compound' doesn't do it justice as it was a beautiful series of houses where each family unit of the wider family lives, with a family temple and ceremony spaces for everyone to share. This is the traditional way that Balinese people live and when a woman marries they move in to their husbands family compound.Then the cooking begins! For 2-3 hours you are taken through each of the 7 dishes step by step and for each one every person in the group gets the chance to cook. This part is led by a brilliant Balinese chef who has cooked in a top local restaurant for celebrities. He was very clear, his English excellent and he made it an easy and enjoyable experience. It was a fascinating experience to learn of all the stages involved in some key Balinese dishes and at the end you are given the recipes for them all so that you can replicate them at home. After all the cooking, everyone sits down to a feast of the dishes you have just prepared and this was easily one of the best meals we had in our two weeks in Bali. Our absolute favorite dish was the satay lilit and peanut sauce. So tasty that I am salivating just thinking about it!Every little detail was taken care of throughout the day from providing cold towels and water after the trip to the market, to the little gift given to everyone at the end. These touches were what made the day extra special for us and I can not recommend it highly enough!"

Sang De and his family were all passionate to introduce to us not only the way of Balinese cooking but also their culture as well as architecture. After the class, everyone got a little souvenir - a very natural and beautifully scented coconut oil and a menu, even though we probably would not be able to prepare exactly the same dishes due to the challenge to find those fresh spices and ingredients back home.We had a very lovely time at the class!

I have been to Bali three times, and only now do I see the culture more clearly."

We also gained a great insight into Balinese culture by cooking in a traditional family compound. Highly recommended!"

Every aspect of the experience is choreographed, thought out, timed and executed. You are picked up at your hotel and brought to the market where a highly professional and knowledgable guide leads you through the different ingredients. The market is not touristy at all and really helps you to see how people in Bali truly live. Then it's onward to the family compound where over banana fritters and coffee the guide tells you all about Balinese life and religion -- a wonderful perspective that added so much to my knowledge of the place. It's one thing to hop around Ubud shopping and eating. This tour gave me so much insight into the religion and traditions of the Balinese which I glimpsed but never fully understood on my own. The cooking course is so much more than food -- the family are cultural ambassadors as well! I think this aspect is essential as tourists can gain deeper respect through understanding of where they are visiting. This is not to downplay the cooking and eating part of the tour! The kitchen is spotless and well-run and the chef guides you through each step with clear instructions and helpful tips to modify the recipes for home. There's more watching that cooking to be honest so serious chefs beware. I think the school is more geared towards the casual cook who wants a bit of cooking experience without too much challenge. Fair enough as this is probably describes the majority of people. Anyway, it's not as if the course is lightweight. The chef is serious about imparting techniques and information about the ingredients, it's just that the hands on time is minimal. While the food is being served up you get to witness offerings being given at the family temple and you're given further information about Balinese Hinduism -- fascinating. The meals are served up beautifully in a gorgeous pavilion. You'll enjoy a relaxing meal and a chance to chat with other travellers. Complimentary coconut oil and a recipe booklet finish off the day and you're whisked back to your hotel.This cooking course is a bit more expensive than others but it's worth every penny for its professionalism and the quality of the food and guiding. It will probably be the highlight of your trip, as it was of mine."

One of these very well organized young Balinese family businesses: Made collected the participants and gave us a tour around the morning market to show us where to get the ingredients for Balinese cooking. Then his brother-in-law Dewa awaited us with his assistants to teach us what to make from them.The cooking class is held at their own family compound which gave us an interesting insight into Balinese traditions. Before eating we even followed Made's mother to do the offering at the family temple. Nevertheless the cooking pavilion has nothing to do with a usual family kitchen but is newly designed for its purpose as a show kitchen. And Dewa is an experienced cook who has worked in restaurants both on Bali and abroad.After a delicious breakfast of coffee and fried bananas we worked together on the dishes, chopping and mixing the ingredients, taking turns at the stove. Only processes that would have taken to long were finished by Dewas assistants, like the barbecuing of the chicken sate. Dewa explained everything in a very nice and helpful manner and gave us also ideas how to substitute ingredients we could not get in our home country. They never take more than 12 participants so the group is small enough for everyone to follow his instructions.At the end we had a very delicious lunch together and were handed out the recipes in pretty cooking books. Thank you, Dewa and Made, for this great experience!"

He did a wonderful job of answering our questions and drawing comparisons between the ingredients we find in our own countries. Upon reaching the family compound, we were made to feel right at home as Sang De explained the division of labor in Balinese families, the reasons behind different cultural practices and the layout of Balinese traditional homes. Our chef was very informative as well, and great about coaching us through the different steps of the cooking process. You were always encouraged to ask questions so that you could apply what you learned in your own kitchen. We had a group of 6 people and everyone of us was able to fully participate in the cooking process of all the different dishes. My only disappointment was in waiting until later in my trip to schedule this cooking class. Schedule this early on in your trip and you're likely to have a much more informed understanding of Balinese life and cuisine for the rest of your stay in Bali."

From the market we were taken back to the family compound a short drive away. We felt warmly welcomed and enjoyed a delicious morning tea while Sang De explained more about the compound, his family and Balinese culture.We then met Chef Dewa, we were first shown through the many ingredients we would be using and the menu for the day then our team effort began. Lots of hands on, chopping, pounding, stirring, frying and preparing the rice in a steamer over the fire. Chef Dewa provided many tips, sharing his knowledge and experience answering our many questions along the way.Before our meal we joined Sang De\u2019s mother at the family temple for the daily offerings, a very special experience.We enjoyed our delicious meal in a beautiful setting and went home with a lovely gift and great memories.

We were then introduced to Sang De's brother-in-law, Dewa, who was a chef at an international resort. Dewa then went through the menu for the day and the ingredients that we would be using. His knowledge was fantastic, he explained each step patiently and was very clear with his instructions. We all contributed to each dish (cram cam gedang mekuah, kare ayam, sate lilit ayam, jukut urab, sambal ulek, nasi sela and dadar gulung) which we feasted upon at the completion of our preparation.Before we ate, however, Sang De's mother made offerings in the family's temple that included pieces of the food that we had prepared and we were able to witness this.The food was served to us a la carte style and every dish tasted amazing! When we were finished we were presented with a booklet that included the recipes for each dish and a small bottle of coconut oil and then Sang De transferred us back to the resort after a most wonderful half day experience."

We really enjoyed doing this Balinese cooking class!We were with two people and signed up an evening before (we had our hotel call). The following morning we were picked up at 8am at our hotel by the Lobong team and were dropped off at a market nearby Ubud where we were received by our host Sang De and where we met the rest of our cooking class.The course starts with a market tour. Sang De talks about herbs and spices with love and explains which ones we will be using during class > we would be preparing a Balinese meal.After the market, the food preparation takes place at the beautiful family compound of Sang De. Sang De explained about the traditional lifestyle of his family on the compound and about Balinese culture. Which was interesting to hear. The food preparation had a hands-on and interactive approach and was led by Sang De's brother, Chef Dewa. Chef Dewa shows you how to use and prepare fresh spices. No bottled sauces! You do everything yourself. The chopping, the mixing, the cooking. We prepared a full course meal - which we ate in the end. The instructions were clear and Chef Dewa shares many tips and tricks. You're invited to ask many questions.It was taken into account that I'm a vegetarian. I could fully participate. No problem whatsoever.Before tasting the result of our cooking, Chef Dewa and Sang De's mother performed a daily ritual of thanking the gods (before you have the first rice meal), which also included the family temple. It was special to be part of this.After our meal, we received a little book with the recipes, so we could continue our practice at home! In a nutshell:1. Clear English spoken. 2. More than just cooking/ Personal touch - Introduction Balinese family lifestyle and culture.3. Clear instructions / hands-on / interactive.4. Only use of fresh ingredients. 5. Suited for Vegetarians and Non-Vegetarians.6. Recipe book as a gift.7. Schedule: 8am -2pm. Pick up and drop off at hotel.Our conclusion:We definitely recommend the Lobong Cooking Class. You won't regret doing this. It was very eductional and we had lots of fun. Chef Dewa, Sang De and the entire cooking team are friendly and welcoming. Loved the family compound. Cooking in a beautiful surrounding!"

Our 'guide' Sundai (?) walked us through these traditional markets, telling us about the unusual fruits and vegetables on display, and arranging the odd sample here and there. He also told us a little bit about the daily life of the people at the markets, both sellers and buyers. From there we drove a short distance to his home, which also doubles as the cooking school. The compound was beautiful. Here we were given welcome drinks (juice, Balinese coffee, tea) and told more about how a Balinese compound is structured in terms of building layout and who lives where. Fascinating stuff. We also started to meet some of the cooking school staff and find out what our program was. There were just the 4 of us today, so we felt like a very special little group.After coffee we headed over to the cooking area and met Chef and the team, including Sundai's mother, who was in charge of making coconut oil.Then it was over to the cutting boards, knives, wood fired ovens, pots and pans - our tools for the next couple of hours. We were to prepare about 5 different dishes, including a soup, several meat dishes, and a sweet, and then have it all served up to us for our lunch.We learnt the 'proper' way to cook rice, chopped and diced various vegetables, prepared a 'basic' paste for use in several dishes, fried our chicken pieces, hand mixed pastes, crushed up peanuts with a mortar and pestle, and generally had a great time, ably led by our enthusiastic chef and his team of assistants. After all the prep work was done we sat down at a lovely wooden table, had cold drinks, and were served our beautifully presented culinary masterpieces. I must say, they were all pretty darn tasty :-) We were then presented with a small pack containing the recipe book for what we had prepared, and a 100ml bottle of coconut oil that was produced on site. After saying thank you and goodbye to everyone involved, we were taken back to our resort feeling very full from our feast, and quite tired from concentrating when using the extremely sharp knives and very hot pans. No fingers were lost in the making of any of our dishes :-DThe Lobong team were professional, pleasant, prepared, and enthusiastic, and made us feel most welcome into their home. I would not hesitate in recommending them if you are at all interested in gaining some insight into the Balinese way of life and the delicious foods they eat."

We joined three others and thoroughly enjoyed the markets and the explanation of the foods that they use in their cooking. After the markets we were given some cold bottled water which was most welcome! We then travelled to the local home of a Balinese family and were given welcoming drinks and cold towels plus an explanation and tour on how the Balinese home works, it was informative and a great addition to what we thought was a cooking class. We then started the cooking class. It was fantastic, even some members of our group who don't often cook enjoyed it. After cooking we sat down with cold towels again and were served the food we had helped prepare. We could also purchase some cold Bintangs which was most welcome. The food was delicious and the best meal during our two weeks in Bali. We could not fault the day and was one of my most favourite days in Bali. Lobong Cooking Class add in some unexpected extras which was fantastic, they sent us home with our own coconut oil (which they showed us how to make) and recipe books detailing what we had cooked. Highly recommend!"

Not only do you learn about the food and how to cook it but you also learn a lot about Bali, its people and culture.We were picked up at 7:30 and then met with the rest of our group before we were taken to a market to learn about the food we were going to cook. This was a typical market and had no other tourists there apart from ourselves. We then returned and had a brief explanation of the day and the compound we were in. This gave us details about family structure, beliefs and was really interesting. The cooking itself was fun and we got involved and prepared and cooked a lot of the food either individually or as a group. The choice of dishes suited us as my wife doesn't like fish and isn't too great with spice. This didn't matter and what we prepared and ate was just great. You get a recipe booklet so you try at home and they are constantly telling you about alternative ingredients you can use if you can't get hold of the local ones they use.We had fun, learnt a lot and the food was great. It was a fantastic day and a great experience and we cannot recommend it enough."

You could not ask for a better experience. This is no cooking demonstration, it is a professionally run hands on cooking school where we prepared all of the ingredients, made the most delicious meal and shared it in magnificent surrounds. The cultural experience is wonderful and the hosts amazing but what really surprised was just how good the facilities were and how well we're were taught the skills and techniques to create great Balinese food.

They picked us up at 8 am and returned us to our hotel around 3 pm (though I wasn't watching the clock as the day was so amazing!) The trip to the local market learning about local produce and spices, hearing first hand about Balinese family, culture, traditions and worship while sampling Balinese coffee and banana fritters, watching the process for making coconut oil, cooking rice the Balinese way, and all of the knife prep, grinding, cooking and eating were just top notch. They provided vegetarian options, and were very kind and helpful with my 7 yr old daughter. The family were very polite answering every question. I really enjoyed seeing the inside of a traditional Balinese family compound. The cooking and bathroom facilities were modern and clean. There were ample prep and cooking stations to accommodate everyone in our class (we had 6 participants). The resulting food was the best we had in Bali. Bring extra money for a cold beer or soda to go with your meal, or to purchase your own Lobong apron to take home with you. We easily booked through their website the day before and paid about $35 for the entire experience including Ubud hotel pickup/dropoff, and half price for kids."

It offers an insight into both traditional and contemporary Balinese life. The day begins with a visit to the local market. It is followed by morning tea (ginger tea or coffee with small banana fritters) at the family compound, some hands-on prep of the local ingredients and then offerings are made at the family temple before a fantastic lunch in the garden. The courses include minced chicken satays (with the best peanut satay sauce ever), braised chicken leg in coconut sauce, mixed vegetable salad, and Balinese crepe - all with a cold Bintang if desired. Getting the basic spice paste (18 ingredients) right is the key to a successful dish. This was a return visit for our family. We first visited Lobong Cooking Class in 2011 - and our second visit in October 2013 was even better. Participants always leave with more than just a handful of great new signature dishes to try out at home. They also leave with a privileged insight into Balinese life and culture through the Lobong culinary experience courtesy of Sangde and his family. Highly recommended."

Lobong limits it to just 12 people. Also the other company would not allow my children (ages 9 and 11) to participate in the chopping/cooking, whereas Lobong let them participate fully, and only charged half price.The market tour was very interesting, we learned so much about Balinese cooking. In their family compound, we learned a lot about Balinese life. All in all, we were treated very respectfully, as honored guests. We felt welcome in their family compound, not just paying tourists that they had to tolerate. At the same time, they acknowledged that we were tourists, and allowed plenty of time for questions and pictures.Could I reproduce these dishes? Possibly, but not likely, even though we were given a booklet of recipes and a nice bottle of fresh coconut oil. But that's okay, we all enjoyed chopping and stirring and mixing, learning about the food, and of course, tasting it.After we were finished with our cooking, we were invited to their family temple to watch his mother make offerings. Meanwhile they plated up the food...it looked almost too delicious to eat.Highly recommend!"

I would actually give Lebong 4 stars if I had not been so sick off the uncooked chicken (I projectile vomited for several hours after the class from bad chicken).

The day starts with a visit of an original local market outside of touristy ubud together with a perfectly English speaking guide. Here you are introduced to the ingredients of typical balinese dishes. After that you are invited into a family compound where you learn about balinese culture and traditions. The groups are rather small (9 participants in our case) and you get to ask everything you ever wanted about life in bali. The actual cooking class is very professional and the meals are delicious! All in all a 5 star experience!"

Everyone gets an opportunity to participate. It is a great lesson, wonderful food, and incredible experience! Would absolutely recommend. Beyond leaving stuffed, you are also given a book of recipes, and homemade coconut oil. To say that it is run by a family gives the wrong impression.. it is incredibly well organized, like a business, with a familial feel. You feel right at home, and are given an incredibly unique experience with lasting memories. Absolutely would recommend!"

A driver picked us up from our hotel and took us to the local market, we were shown through market and learnt of all the different ingredients and customs associated with the food we would cook and then eat later in the day, The market tour was fascinating, we loved learning new ingredients and trying various fruits berries and nuts. Once the tour was completed we were transported back to the family compound where we enjoyed coffee and banana fritters whilst learning the customs of the family and the compound. We were then led to an amazing outdoor kitchen, and introduced to our chef for the day Dewar. Dewar was extremely generous with his tie and nothing was to much trouble for him whilst he explained the ingredients, the best way to prepare them and how to cook them for best results, it is a very hands on experience and I have taken several new techniques away with me to use back at home. The afternoon was completed when we all sat down at a beautifully prepared table and treated to a three course meal that was second to none, the food was simply to die for. Lobong Cooking School was the highlight of our trip and we recommend this fantastic day to anyone that loves Bali culture, cooking and eating authentic Indonesian food, we cannot wait for our next visit to enjoy it all over again."

We were picked up by a driver from out hotel in Ubud, and taken to a local market. My boyfriend and I met with 6 others, and we spent just over an hour walking around a local market. That was an experience not to forget. I don't know when I would have had another opportunity to discover what it's really like for those, who live their days trading in the early morning markets. Its not clean, its open to the elements, the ground is muddy, there is rubbish everywhere, yet the produce is so fresh and very cheap (in Australian terms). It was a real eye opener. We were then taken back to a wonderful bali compound, and we were shown the basics of cooking, where the 8 of us, prepared all the food, put everything together, and ate our 10 dishes for lunch at the end. Our guides and main chef, were very knowledgeable and accommodating, and it was a very comfortable and fun experience. We were given the recipes, and a gift of coconut oil to take home! Absolutely worth it! I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning more about balinese culture and learning some cooking skills :)"

There was enough hands on experience to keep you occupied at a relaxed pace with a team of workers behind the scenes checking the rice on the wood fire, cleaning dishes and barbecuing the satays. Best satays of the trip too! Sang De is charming and quite professional with his customer service. Bathrooms are immaculate with overall hygiene of food preparation excellent.

Not sure if we read the small print but were expecting a half day and didn't finish until about 3.00, so apart from everything else it is great value for money.We also did the compound dinner offered by Lobong which included the insight into family and tradition as well as a really fantastic meal, so I can highly recommend that as well."

This is a great option in Ubud if youre looking for culture - you not only get to understand what goes into a Balinese meal and try cooking it for yourself - you also get to see a non-touristy marketplace where the ingredients are sourced. In fact, the trip to the market was the best part of they day, since the actual cooking can drag on a little (3+hours). It's a lot of time to spend on your feet in the midday sun, even in the shade. Also, the portion sizes are pretty small per person, and I recommend you don't go if you only like mild food, as there isn't a 'no chilli' option! Overall, a great market tour with a decent cooking class and mediocre meal at the end of it."

Superb!The tour of the *real* Bali markets was eye-opening and sensorily stimulating (and a little shocking, in some educational ways). The introduction to the family compound was very educational as well - you are welcomed into the family home, a true honour - the architexture is beautiful and Made's explanation of Balinese family tradition gives social and spiritual context to the 7-course meal you're about to prepare.The cooking class itself is a pleasure and a lot of fun - not to spoil any details but the dishes prepared are fun and have enough variety to suit all tastebuds and constituions -- they could even adapt for my gluten-intolerance, so no problems there.

Yum! The class size was small (maximum 12 people) and everyone spoke English well so we could get all our questions answered. This Asinan salad was both beautiful and delicious - I especially liked cooking with local fern tips. We not only learned how to make all these delicious dishes, but we learned about the Balinese culture, how the family compounds are built, the ritual offerings made daily, etc. - a great lesson in culture as well.

Dewa our instructor/chef was clear in his cooking instructions and made sure that everyone in the group was fully included in all the activities. We cooked 10 dishes - exactly the menu on the website.After the cooking lunch was served up to us at a long table in an open-sided building and we all enjoyed the fruits of our labour.

Then on to the family compound where were greeted with refreshments and lots of information about Bali and customs. Well presented and fun. Cooking was hands on experience and with a group of only 11 cooking so not too crowded. It was in a very well set out kitchen, open on 3 sides so not too hot and a lovely view of the garden. Lobong chef is very good and a good instructor. With a price of about AUD40 for the 6 or 7 hour experience, I would say it was also excellent value. After the cooking is finished we then sit down and eat the results with a beer or soft drink if you want."

To eat the nicest food we have tried in Bali in such a beautiful family compound surrounded by great company, we can not speak highly enough of our experience here .The smoked duck was the best I have ever tried . We enjoyed it so much we returned with a group of 10 family members (also in Bali with us for a wedding) two days later and let me tell you it was nothing short of a delicious Balinese feast. They welcomed our family into the compound like we were there own, every one thoroughly enjoyed it and are still raving about it. The best dinner I have ever experienced in Bali .

The whole experience was professional, fun and inclusive from the start.Pickup from our villa was punctual and comfy aircon car - essential in Ubud.Visited a local fruit and veg market, no tourists there and our guide showed us all the interesting produce, what its used for and got to meet some locals. Once we returned to the family home we got to see how to make coconut oil as the rest of the family set about preparing our ingredients before chopping/slicing/frying/cooking and steaming rice!Cooking for 2 hours included preparation, teaching and everyone got a turn and chance to ask questions. The banquet was beautifully presented at the end of the day, the monsoon rains made it a true Balinese delight!Recommend 100%"

Sang De imparts such insight into every aspect of Balinese cooking, from the prayers to the animals we are about to cook, to the growing of the vegetables and preparation to the people of Bali. My mind was filled with interesting facts and I hadn't even started cooking. The market used for the tour is off the beaten track allowing our hosts to really explain all the different foods. Onto the family compound where we learn more traditions and finally into the kitchen where we prepare 10 different dishes. Here there is no need to worry about remembering everything as the recipe covers that. Excellent experience."

The feast at the completion of our cooking class was delicious. We have learned so any new techniques ad can't wait to get back home and cook some authentic Balinese food. Don't hesitate, do this cooking class, it's the best in Ubud."

For over 5 hours Sang De, our host and market guide, and Dewa, our chef and food guide, stepped me and four other 'cooks' (they take up to 10) across the threshold into their home and lives. Their brother-in-law Gunk De arrived to collect me at 7:45. He had a smile so wide it could have lighted up the universe. We collected another couple attending the course and then went straight on to their local market where we met up with the knowledgable and delightful Sang De and took a stroll thru the narrow alleys and piles of fresh food to learn about Balinese ingredients and culture. Then it was on to their beautiful family compound to rest and have a drink, eat some yummy banana fritters, learn more about Balinese culture and have a lesson in making coconut milk and coconut oil. Next, Dewa's cooking lessons were gentle and encouraging. When it came time to eat the 10 dishes we'd prepared they were presented beautifully, restaurant-style. The menu itself was superb and I loved that everything was fresh -including the coconut oil made that morning. Gunk De told me on the way back that everyone in the family has a background in tourism or hotel management and it shows. Cool towels to soothe one from the heat, snacks and drinks just when you need them, fine food, super clean everything (including western toilets) and the famous Balinese happiness and love that seems to seep into very aspect of this heavenly day. And on top of all that a gift bag to take home! A wonderful experience that I'd recommend."

If you are looking for a life experience that you will remember forever & possibly be the highlight of your holiday, then take this class.I used trip advisor to choose a cooking class to take while staying in Ubud. I chose Lobong because they seemed more personalised. I made the right choice! Lobong's classes never have more then 10 participants at a time. I was one of 5.After my day at Lobong I was on a natural high. It was a wonderful Balinese experience that will stay in my memory for ever.In the morning Sang Made guides you through his local fresh produce market. This alone was an amazing experience.You are then welcomed to the family compound to learn about how the family lives. This was a great insight into Balinese tradition.From here you head to the kitchen where you will prepare food for a few hours.Once all the cooking is done you will be served the most delicious Balinese cuisine you have eaten (your own creation). I would be happy to pay the cost of the class just for the food alone. Everything else is a bonus!I recommended two other travellers to take the class the next day. They too were beaming with enjoyment & raving about how great their day was.Book Lobong, You won't regret it!"

We were picked up at 8am and taken to a local food market, where we were shown a range of local foods and given explanations of their uses by the very knowledgable Sang De. On to the beautiful family compound where we were given either ginger tea or Balinese coffee. Sang De explained the buildings and the set out of their compound according to their traditional culture and beliefs. The gardens were beautiful and buildings so well maintained, it was a privilege to be there. On to the cooking part. After a demonstration of how to make coconut milk and coconut oil, we spent a few hours chopping and preparing our 10 dishes with the skillful and knowledgable Deiwa. The rest of the family ran around us clearing dishes, cleaning our slops and bringing out the next step. Deiwa was very kind to those of us who aren't experts with the chopping board, and encouraged all of us to have a go at every part of the process. Just before we sat down to enjoy the efforts, we followed Sang De's Mum in placing offerings in the family temple to give thanks for the food. The food was amazing, we learnt an enormous amount and were given a little \"package\" to take home. Won't tell you what's in it because it is a great surprise at the end. The whole experienced far exceeded any expectations, is excellent value for money, and highly recommended."

Its not just an insight to the amazing food its also an insight in the Balinese culture and family structure. A visit to the markets for the locals in the morning is certainly an education and very different to the Parap Markets in Darwin which is why it just added to the overall experience of the day. You are picked up in the morning, taken to the markets then back to the family compound to have step by step cooking lessons where you get to cook it all as small groups. You then sit down as a group and are served the lunch you have prepared. It costs about $40 per person but for the time and the experience it is certainly worth it."

I wanted to write a really great review and encourage everyone to take this cooking class... but I think every other review on Trip Advisor is already doing this!!! I have been trying to cook Indonesian food for many months (since I fell in love with the country and the food on my past four visits!), but did not have much success in the process. My partner and I booked a trip to Bali and this time I wanted to attend a cooking class to find out what I was doing wrong. I spent months (literally), looking for a cooking class. I had very specific items I wanted to cook, how I wanted them to be cooked, how many people were to be in the class, the utensils used and the location of the class. In the end, it came down to Lobong and one other class. Right from the start of my research, I had a feeling that Lobong was the right class for me. Although other classes were teaching recipes that I also wanted to learn how to cook, I didn't have a connection with them (sounds crazy, I know). I sent Sang Made an email and he replied straight away, he answered all of my questions and was very polite. I decided to go with my gut feeling and booked Lobong! It was the best decision I've ever made. Right from the very start, the class was fantastic. We went on the traditional market tour, then learnt about the Balinese way of life (very interesting!), and then we started to cook!!! The chef, Dewa, was a great teacher and very funny too! Finally, we were served our food in such a lovely way. It was the best day I've had in Bali. Thank you Sang Made and the family for such a great experience. I will be sure to recommend your class to all!!!!"

From the early morning tour of the local market, through the mid-morning coffee and welcome to the family compound to the very informative cooking process and feast that was our lunch, we were kept busy and well cared for. Sang-de and his whole family had a role to play in the day and they worked hard and professionally behind the scenes - nice touches were the cold towels after the market tour and the icy cold water during cooking, which is a hot process in Bali! I can't recommend this day enough. It was a real highlight of our trip and so lovely that every member of our family was able to participate.

However, I believe they have minimum number of 12? Sung De's local knowledge was outstanding, and I think I learned more about Bali than I did about cooking! His English was fantastic. The cooking class itself was great, with the meal served to you a la cart at the end (rather than buffet style I have experienced in other cooking schools). My only criticism was when we mentioned we had been to other Bali cooking classes in the past, some staff members went out of their way to \"slag\" them off. ie. They have too many students or They don't give you a hands on experience like we do. But I guess I'm just not a fan of businesses putting down others for their own gain.

The whole family get involved, from San De's mother to his cousins and brothers and even the in laws. We were provided with cold drinks and water, snacks and tastes of our cooking throughout the day. Once the meal had been cooked, we accompanied San De's mother to the family temple to watch her make an offering before we sat down to eat. Once at the table, the food we had cooked was absolutely delicious. Our 16 and 14 year olds were very open to eating all the dishes in front of them because they had invested time and effort into creating them. (Note to self!). My daughter is vegan and they catered to her needs with specific dishes she prepared as an alternative the meat dishes. I was really impressed.

They picked us up from our home and took us directly to the meeting place where we went together to the market. The market was very educational - a tour of the structure, the different vegetables, spices, meats, and other ingredients. My daughter was even captivated by it all! Sang 'de was super, and his English is as good as any you'll hear in Indonesia. The home compound where we come back to do the preparations and cooking is gorgeous. Extremely neat and clean and super organized for a group. The groups are not huge - max of about 10 or 12 I think. So you get good instruction and service. The staff are super, and Dewa, the main cook is awesome. His English is also excellent. His skill as a chef is obvious he is very patient and friendly! And he makes sure you learn technique and don't have to memorize recipes - they give you a recipe book and bottle of genuine coconut oil to take home. You then get to eat, and it is incredible! The ingredients are obviously fresh, and you have ground the spices right there! They even let my daughter participate and take pictures. Of course, the Balinese love children, so she was right at home. I can't say enough about all the staff and the experience. And to top it off, the price is very reasonable for over a half-day genuine Balinese experience. in talking with others in the same class, they had checked around more than I and found this was either the most reasonable or close to. And based on the fullness of the experience, I know for a fact that you wouldn't get a better value for this kind of experience. Thanks again Dewa, Sang Ade, and staff!"

We were then guided around the market meeting local vendors, with great explanation by our guide and a warm welcome by the people there. Saw sights and smelt smells only found in boring dried up form normal in jars at the supermarket (if you can even find them!). After the markets, where we tasted and smelled all we would work with later, we travelled to the main house but not before we were welcomed at the cars with a cold flannel and water... they think of everything.The experience there was warm and welcoming. Smiles everywhere within the venue's complex (it is their home at the end of the day) before we met the lady of the house. Here we saw the fresh coconut oil process and then to the open air kitchen area.The head chief was brilliant, great English and SO knowledgeable. Not your average \"head chef\" with smiles and laughter followed by a great explanation of the process ahead. All hands on, every dish, which was easy to follow and very tasty. After several hours of absorbing as much knowledge as we could we finally got to eat out wares. Delicious, fresh and honest food.

Not only is this a cooking class but such a cultural experience as well!I was picked up promptly at my hotel and taken to the traditional market. It was such a wonderful experience going the day prior to the Gangulan festival and seeing the business of the market as everyone was preparing for the holiday. The market experience was informative and very comprehensive. We ended with being handed cold towels and bottled water to help cool off for the ride back to the family compound.Upon arriving at the compound we were given a tour and taught about family life and how the compound is set up and then enjoyed Bali coffee or tea prior to starting the cooking class. During the cooking portion, the other participants and I made a nine course traditional Balinese meal. We did all the work and it was very hands on. It was incredibly thorough and very informative. At the conclusion, we were shown the Balinese offering that is done before meals and were able to go to the family temple and watch the offering. Such a wonderful experience to understand the offering and witness. Following the offering, we all were seated at a table in the gardens and served our meal, which was delicious. Prior to even coming to Bali, the email communication was prompt and it was very easy to book and even during the class and afterwards the service and professionalism was superb.The food was amazing, the education style was hands-on and came complete with our recipe book to take home. It was so well taught that I am confident that I could recreate some of the dishes! Overall what made this experience memorable was the immersion into the Balinese culture by the host family. A wonderful experience and highly recommended to anyone interested in understanding more about Balinese cooking or culture!"

The day started with a fascinating tour through a local produce market (we were the only tourists in the market!) before moving on to the Sang family compound where we learnt to cook 10 different Balinese dishes. The Sang family are incredibly friendly, knowledgable and welcoming and we learnt as much about Balinese culture as we did about the Balinese cuisine. We'd recommend this activity for anyone interested in learning more about Balinese cooking or culture. A great day!"

We attended the Balinese Compound Dinner last night as we had previously been to the cooking class on our last visit to Bali.From getting picked up in Kuta by a very polite young driver to getting dropped back at our hotel later that night the experience was excellent!We chose the Suckling Pig and slow cooked duck as our main course and were blown away.The duck especially was the best we have \"ever\" eaten!!We were greeted by Made on arrival and chatted with drinks about his village and Balinese culture for about 30 minutes before our meal was ready to eat.During the meal the young waiter looked after us very well and also chatted to us about his village and Bali in general.After a excellent dinner we sat around with the whole family including the chef and talked for ages about our different and in many ways the same lifestyles.The family were genuinely interested in us and our family as we were in them and there's.We left having made new friends with an invite to \" call in anytime\" we are in the area.Do yourself a favor and make a visit to Lobong a must do!!Carl and Barb - Adelaide, Australia"

The class takes you on a very thorough tour of a market after picking you up from your hotel in a airconditioned car. The guide talked us through many of the traditions and highlights of market foods and traditions. Able to answer every question about culture and food. The food we made ourselves was delicious and we learnt alot about technique and spices/herbs. There was also insight into the caste and home life of a traditional bali family. There were offerings made and explained to us. The goup we had was very nice as well (mostly aussies).Thank you Lobong :)"

It makes all the difference. The people at Lobong will pick you up from your hotel anywhere with a friendly driver and bring you to the experience. We started at a local market (no tourists,) which was a great place to learn about the foods used in traditional Balinese cooking. We did the cooking class at the family compound, a beautiful and tranquil and spotlessly clean place. There were loads of people helping, which was good for us as we had 2 children with us who needed some help. I feel like we learned more about Balinese food and culture in this one day than in our whole previous week and a half on the island. The resulting meal happened to be the best we've had, also. Terrific staff, service and result all the way around!"

We were taken to a local market where our guide Sang De (who had the best English skills) explained to us the different types of ingredients and food that we would be using at our class. Certainly a unique insight into everyday life as there were no foreigners besides us at the markets. We were taken back to the compound where we met De Wa, our teacher who was very informative and knew a lot about both Indonesian and western cuisine. He answered all our questions, explained why certain cooking techniques had to be used and the whole experience was very hands on. I couldn't believe that we were actually eating the food we had prepared earlier. It's probably the most traditional and authentic meal I've had on this trip. One of the best things we've done on this trip. Something you have to try if you're in Ubud. Thank you Lobong!"

The cooking lesson itself was very informative and fun. All the ingredients are either from their own garden or sourced from reputable sources and everything was natural. The food we cooked were some of the best I have tasted in Bali. Afterwards they gave us each a gift of fresh coconut oil made in their home as well as the instruction booklet.

Important detail: we booked out the entire class as a couples class so it may be different to a normal group class.Prior to this class, I had never cooked Balinese cuisine. They helped me every step of the way, without doing too much for me. My partner is more confident (faster) with prep and cooking so at some points I was assisted to keep up with her pace.As we all know, doing it yourself is the best way to retain new information. They were friendly, relaxed, helpful and informative. The food tasted great. It was a really memorable event on the holiday and I highly recommend them to anyone who loves new experiences.Tip: Back home, I wasn't able to acquire some ingredients - in my case, kaffir lime leaf wasn't available from local grocery stores. If you intend to cook these dishes at home; plan ahead, read the ingredients list well in advance of serving time."

Then we were taken back to Sang De's family's Balinese compound which is where they have the cooking school. Not only were we informed about the cooking but we also got a real lesson on the Balinese way of life and about family and customs. The cooking was taught by DeWa (Sang De's brother in law) with help from his little chefs and we had a blast. The end part was of course tasting what we had cooked. What a treat!

We were picked up from our villa by a lovely driver who proceeded to tell us how the day would run. Everyone working at the cooking school are part of one extended family and as we talked to different members over the day we built up a picture of how this family work together to create the best business they can. Almost all of the men had worked in hospitality and this shows in their good English skills and attention to detail..You start the day by visiting the local market where our first host Made explained about markets and showed us all the vegetables and herbs we would be using. We didn't buy anything from the markets as they source all their food from their garden or butchers to ensure that the ingredients are safe to eat (very impressed by the hygiene standards throughout the day). Then it was back to the family compound where we were told all about how it was arranged and how family life worked. I knew the basics about the temple facing Mt Agung but we learnt lots of sweet little things about family life that were so unique and meaningful, like how you sort out disputes when all the brothers share a compound! Can't imagine a bunch of Western men sharing a house with their father all their life! After a drink of ginger tea or coffee and yummy snack it was into the cooking. We put our aprons on and went off to wash our hands. (The toilets too were brand new and sparkling). Our chef had worked and trained at one of the top hotels in Bali and his passion was evident. He worked us hard for our lunch ;). We chopped and smelled and stirred and tasted our way through prep. Every time we finished with a spoon or bowl someone would be there to whisk it away to be washed. The organization and forethought was staggering! There were nine of us in the class, two being children who did a bit of chopping before getting bored and wandering off to enjoy the beautiful fish ponds and garden. After cooking the meal it was time to clean up and don a sarong to make offerings at the family temple. Once again I learned more about the intricacies of how the offerings work I never knew. Lunch was served restaurant style with each course brought out to us with the 5 star presentation the chef had brought with him from his previous life. Master chef would have been impressed!I cannot rate this whole cooking experience high enough. There were no negatives and too many positives to mention. It was more than a superb cooking experience it was a window into a beautiful Balinese family!"

We cooked everything from scratch and somehow us novices created the best tasting food of my trip so far. We left with the goodie bag of recipes and a little treat, not to mention very full tummies!! If you want to try a cooking class while in Bali, this is the one to try!!"

They take you to the market in the morning, where you can see where the locals come for their ingredients. Seng De gives an explanation of each ingredient before taking you to his house to learn to cook from his brother. The tour includes step by step instructions for the food prep and even an explanation of balinese customs for food offerings to the Gods. Getting to go inside the family temple and watch their mother perform the offerings was very special. I also really thought the food tasted azmazing, but then again, I did help cook it! I highly recommend this to anyone visiting the area!"

From the very start of the day: at pick up time from our accommodation; to the local market; learning about the family compound; their way of life; the garden where herbs and ingredients are grown; and the giving of an offering before lunch was extraordinary. My husband, who does not cook, commented at the end of the course that he was surprised by the flavours that he could create when shown how to put different foods together. This response is a reflection of Wyan\u2019s patience and guidance that he demonstrates throughout the class. We also found the class was well organised and as we were the only two participants this gave us a greater hands on experience. The menu for the day consisted of a large range of dishes which, with the take home book of recipes and coconut oil, we will replicate at home. We would like to sincerely thank Sang De and Wyan and all the other people helping on the day for providing us a very enjoyable experience; one that we would be happy to repeat and to recommend to others."

This time, together with friends, we did the afternoon tour. This is different from the morning in that instead of a visit to the market , Sang Made takes you on a short trek into the Ayung valley. This requires walking to /from the valley floor via steep steps but the effort is well worth it. The views are spectacular and the walk through the paddy fields interesting particularly enhanced by the insights provided. After the walk there is a chance to cool down whilst being provided with a full explanation of the compound and its workings. Then the cooking which is great fun even for non chefs (which were a majority in our group!). The menu is fantastic and the end result one of the best meals we had in Bali with the added satisfaction of our contribution to it. The whole experience is fantastic and Sang Made and his team (including his mother who makes the compound offerings) ensure it is an unforgettable few hours that gives you a great insight into Balinese life. We will definitely be returning!"

This cooking class is how you will best experience the real Bali!You will start your day with a tour of a local market to look at all the spices and veggies that you will use in your cooking. You can even use that market trip to buy some fruits for yourself! Sang De is the person who tours you around and explains things to you. After the market, you will relax over a morning tea and snacks at the owner's home. That's where you realize that the Lobong Cooking Class is a family affair every every part of your experience is handled by the same family! You will get the most hands on experience with this class with a small teacher to student ratio. The day we took the class, it was 4 students to 1 teacher. Our class was taught by Dewa, who was very good at going at a good speed and making sure everyone got a chance to practice making the dishes. He focuses on the technique to make the food authentic balinese. He says that you can measure and read recipe book later so focus on the technique first. He taught us how to make 9 items and customized 2 items for me since i didn't eat red meat. He helped me make 2 fish dishes and sent me the recipes for it a few days later. On a side note, I brought my 6 months old baby on this excursion and thought that my husband and I would trade off during the class. Their family members ended up babysitting him the entire time so that we could enjoy ourselves. THey even offered to make him baby food too! We brought our own so they fed him what we had on us."

The market visit is great to learn about the ingredients and also the way of life in a local market. Sang De was wonderful as was our chef, Dewa. No question was seen to be stupid and we came away with a new appreciation of fresh Balinese food and the time it takes to prepare. It may be little dearer but is well worth the money."

            "review": "Most fantastic experience. I signed my husband and I up for the cooking class at Lobong after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. One of the best decisions of my life! Lobong was chosen because of the hands on cooking that was mentioned by other reviewers. Before confirmation with Lobong, I made sure to double check that the class size would be small and there would be significant hands on practice. I was assured that class size would be kept to a maximum of 12 participants and lots of hands on cooking.On the day of our class, the driver picked us up punctually but we were about 10 mins late. So my apologies to other participants of the class. There was eight participants that day, including my husband and I. After we were picked up, we proceeded to the next pick up and with 4 participants in the car, we headed to Panyangan market, a market where only locals visit. We met up with the remaining participants and the market tour was headed by Sang de, who was fluent in English. In the market tour, we learnt quite a bit about the roots (eg ginger and turmeric) used in Balinese cooking and the local vegetables. The market tour was informative and I liked it a lot.Thereafter, we were brought to the site of the cooking class, which is the house of Sang de. The little details were very much appreciated. Eg, we were given cold towels and drinks after the market tour. When we reached the compound of Sang de's house, that's when the real interesting part kicks in. While seated with ginger tea, we were briefed on the Balinese culture, in terms of their accommodation and daily lifestyle. It was amazing to hear Sang de talk about the different parts of the compound and their uses and functions. The Balinese way of life is so very distinctive from most cultures and very very family-centric. Sang de mentioned about Balinese trying to strike a balance in everything they do, including their cooking. Then we were introduced to how coconut oil is made. Not a difficult process, but a lengthy one. Fresh coconut oil smells heavenly and I'm sure it made all the difference in the cooking.We were then handed over to the chef, Dewa, who taught us the correct way to hold a knife. I also learnt the right way of chopping (thought I already knew but turned out my technique was wrong). So we shared the chopping amongst the eight of us and that took about 25 mins or so to complete. We also cooked rice the Balinese way, which took 1 hour and 15 mins to do so. The rice that we ate was very fluffy.Our menu for lunch included chicken sate with peanut sauce, tuna salad, green papaya soup. All the food tasted fabulous and my favourite has to be the peanut sauce! Maybe it was because I was the one who fried the peanuts and my husband who cooked it, I thought the peanut sauce was one of the best I ever had, and I have had quite a bit of peanut sauce in my life. The peanut sauce was addictive!!! We are going to make that this weekend!The tuna salad was super yummy too. The tuna was very fresh and thick and I didn't know tuna could taste like that. Throughout the cooking, Dewa was keen to ensure that we remember the techniques more than the recipes since we were provided with the recipes at the end of the class. He said remembering the techniques is most important. Wise words indeed!The lunch we had was one of the best meal we had in Bali! It was so good I wanted to come back for another class. Sang de said their menu changes every 6 months but because the Balinese food does not have a wide variety, there is no extensive changes to the menu. And at the end of the session, we were given 100ml coconut oil and the recipe book. Both my husband and I enjoyed this class tremendously. It was the highlight of our trip! Not only did we pick up some cooking tips, we also gained an insight into the Balinese culture. I strongly recommend this cooking class. Not to be missed!"

It was noisy, busy, and full of colour and smells. A very interesting and unforgettable way to start, with a wonderful guide who explains the produce and where it is from. Then you go to his home 'compound' where you walk to the back part of it to a very clean commercial style but basic kitchen, there is a room off it with a great wood stove where rice is traditionally prepared and cooked. The teacher has had twenty years as a chef at a five star resort in bali and really knows how to teach. There was only 7 in total in the class which was a perfect size for learning, and one of the best things was the commitment and passion of the teacher. The setting is idyllic, and it was a pleasure to spend a few hours chopping up ingredients and learning how to prepare ultra fresh meals. Then you sit down and eat it. We had nine dishes and they were all delicious. You receive a small book of the recipes and some coconut oil to take home. I have already made one of the dishes back at home and really fell like I got a lot out of just one class."

Of course we actually \"ran into\" him online and booked the class, but our whole experience was so warm. The trip to the market was wonderful, and Sang Made expained ingredients we would be using. Then he welcomed us into his home compound - a beautiful place - and explained how the family compound is laid out and how things work there. What a fantastic experience to be welcomed into a home, and get a glimpse of real Bali life! Then the cooking started. Everyone watched everything being made, with someone doing each step under the expert guidance of the accomplished chef. There were 6 in our class, so it was a great size for questions and sharing. Everything (including the rest room) was perfectly spotless and everything was done with excellent hygine standards. The offering ceremony was special to witness and another precious glimpse into the real Bali. Then the food we had prepared was served. It was absolutely fantastic and beautifully presented, and set a very high standard for the rest of our trip (which many restaurants didn't meet).

Sang Made picked us up and took us to a local market to show us how Balinese people shop and also educated us on the ingredients... This was amazing. So colourful and I learned so much about culture from this trip.After is we were taken to Sang Made's family compound- which was beautiful and were shown around and treated to Pisano goring (banana fritters) and ginger tea while Sang Made explained how the Balinese live and the function of each section of the compound.We were then introduced to Sang Made's mother who showed us how she made the coconut oil, which smelled amazing- then the cooking began.Dewa and his team took us through all of the ingredients and the stages and gave us tips on how to improve technique- Dewa was right when he said the key to Balinese cooking is in the preparation, we have just made our first base Gede at home and it took an hour of prep but then the actual cooking is easy! His guidance was so valuable and my husband and I were lucky that we were the only members of the party that day so we could get his expert opinion on every aspect. There were a lot of dishes to prepare and we learned so much as we cooked... I am an avid cook at home so was really excited to get Dewa's expertise as I learned these new dishes.After we had finished the prep we were invited to make an offering the family compound's temple. This was really interesting as we had seen the offerings but had never had the meaning explained to us, it felt very apt that we could take part in this in a Balinese family home.Lastly we got to eat. The food was delicious and Dewa had presented our cooking beautifully. The recipes were delicious and I honestly think that the food was among the best we had in Bali and that is down to Dewa and Sang Made.I honestly could not recommend this enough, it was lovely to come into a family, learn how they live and cook food- they were so welcoming and warm. It was a real honour to be involved in the class. Sang Made's English is exceptionally good and we were always made to feel that no question was too trivial. If you could do one thing in Bali, do this. It was amazing."

We were collected from our resort and brought on tour of the markets and the rice fields then back to the couples home where we were met with a lovely welcome drink. The couple are very funny which make the day so enjoyable! Best part is you get to eat all the yummy food at the end.Definitely a must-thing-to-do when in Ubud! :-)"

Preparing 9 dishes in all, watching coconut oil being made, participating in a temple offering, and then getting to enjoy the fruits of our labours for lunch, completed the experience. The little gift at the end of the day was just the icing on the cake! Fantastic experience - I loved every minute."

The market itself was not interesting at first glance, but our host was able to show many aspects of local life as he strolled us through the market.The class is hosted in the family compound which really enriched the experience. As we were explained the various parts of the beautiful compound, we gained perspective on the Balinese philosophy of life.

My sister and 14 year old son joined me and we had an amazing time on our Balinese culinary journey. Our host Sang Made escorted us through a traditional Balinese market that was a kaleidoscope of colour with an array of exotic herbs, spices, fruits and vegetables. The outside market was a buzz of activity with merchants selling live ducks, chickens, pigs and clothing etc. On arrival at the family home (known as a family compound) we were greeted by our Master Chef, Dewa and commenced our class with great anticipation. The whole experience was fantastic and exceeded our expectations. It was a joint effort as we all shared in much of the time consuming preparation of chopping and grinding before the cooking began. What a gastronomique delight it was to prepare some truly tantalising authentic Balinese dishes. The chicken sate with sate sauce made lovingly and patiently from scratch was outstanding as was the tuna and fern tipped salad with chilli dressing and the broiled chicken in spicy coconut sauce. After a traditional blessing in the family temple we were seated to a sumptuous table filled with all the dishes we had prepared during the class. Our taste buds were alive and dancing to the contrasting flavours that were captured in each dish. During our stay we also learnt a great deal about the Balinese culture and way of life which helped to gain a better insight into the beautiful, kind and gentle people who live on this magical island. On our departure we were given a recipe book and a 100ml bottle of coconut cooking oil made by Sang Made's mum. We plan to use it when we treat our family to a Balinese buffet using our new found skills. Thank You Lobong Cooking School for a holiday highlight. No true \"foodie\" should miss this."

HOWEVER, the recipe book we are all given to \"cook at home\" is extremely disappointing. The Base Gede doubles the amount of ginger required resulting in a bitter tasting paste, the Base Sate is obviously missing an ingredient (we added Kepas Manis), the Sate is listed as chicken in the index but pork in the recipe (a minor matter), the Fern Tips Salad omits to advise to cook the red beans and the Fish dish cooking method is impossible to understand.......there are a lot of mistakes both in ingredients and cooking method. After several disasters, we checked all the recipes on the internet and made many changes. So, a lovely day at the compound but a very disappointing recipe book. Sorry, but we were so excited to be cooking these dishes again and presenting them to our friends.....the result was a waste of time and money."

The day was very hands on, the chefs were very helpful, and the food was restaurant-quality. The main message I got - Balinese food is all about patience and care.

I hv been in Bali many times but this event is something exceptionally.I am not much into cooking but the class was done in such a way that time flow by and at the end we had cooked together a wonderful and super tasting meal. However , before we could eat it, we had to follow the Balinese tradition and gave respect to the gods in the local house tempel. This brings me to the extraordnary part of this trip. Not did we learn all about the typical Bali food , fruits , spices , etc. but also a lot about the Balinese culture and customs. This is possible because the whole team belongs to one family and your class takes place at their compound which by the way is in top conditions. One last comment , the sanitary installations are excellent . I like to wish Sang Made and his family all the very best for the future and I am convinced that this will not be the last idea they have.

Our host, Sang Made, showed, explained, let us sniff and touch the produce we were going to be using to cook our lunch. It was a very good introduction to the differences (and in some cases, similiarities) in our foods.After the market we were driven to Sang Made's family compound (a beautiful, serene space), welcomed by others in the family including Sang Made's mother and presented with ginger tea and fried banana snack. While imbibing, Sang Made explained some of his country's traditions and customs.From there, we moved to the kitchen area and proceeded to watch and take our turns at creating a delicious lunch menu under the guidance of Dewi. I loved the way Dewi helped us understand the processes and checked that we were following his instructions. Lots of fun - and wonderful aromas as the food changed from ingredients to delicious courses.We watched the offering made in the home shrine before sitting down to a convivial and enjoyable lunch with two other holidaying couples who were also in the class. We were presented with our own 100ml bottle of fresh coconut oil to take home to use - and help get that truly authentic Balinese flavour. Loved every minute of this experience.

I had booked a morning class a month before arriving in Ubud and was pleasantly surprised to learn that only my friend and I were signed up for that day. The driver suggested that we try the Trekking-Cooking course which is usually set in the afternoon but being only two in the class, he said it was possible to do it in the morning. I was a little concerned about the mid-day heat but went ahead with the trekking course anyway for a minimal additional fee.Actually, I'm glad to have done the trekking trip in the morning when the air was much cooler and with the clouds intermittently blocking the sun, it made for a rather special morning trek in the area where part of the Eat Pray Love movie was set. Our guide was quite knowledgeable of the local flora and fauna and we even happily found common words between Balinese-Bahasa and Filipino. It must be our shared Austronesian ancestry. My friend did not bring sneakers on this trip and thus wore his Havaianas which snapped on negotiating through mud. He thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the trek barefoot though and his opinion, was much better than wearing flipflops. The trek lasted about an hour.The cooking class immediately followed. What I appreciate about the class is that although Balinese cooking and Filipino cooking have many similarities, I learned new techniques from the able chef, especially their traditional way of cooking rice. In the Philippines, cooking rice for 1.5 hours is unheard of but I learned that such was the Balinese way. I surmise that the chef may have had some Western culinary training which he applied in class. Again, we found so many common words between Filipino and Balinese-Bahasa and even exchanged some cooking ideas.What probably set this cooking class apart was all the cultural stuff infused into it. They demonstrated their daily rituals, explained their beliefs, and shared bits and pieces about their way of life. This was much more than a cooking class."

Our afternoon culinary Trek and cooking class with Lobong Cooking School leaves me struggling to describe in a few words what a privilege it was to do the river valley walk and then be welcomed into the family compound for a cooking class and wonderful meal.Sang Made led us down a path to the top of a deep river valley to begin our foodies trek. Immediately we were stunned by the beauty of the view. We would have been happy to have paid just to do this short trek down to the rice paddies and white water river.In fact our charming guide provided a wealth of information about both cultural activities happening nearby and the often edible plants and fruits that were always within easy reach. The climb back to the top via a very safe stairway was considerable but worth every sometimes gasping step.We were then welcomed into the lovely family compound for our cooking experience. The several hours we spent with this family were so much more than the excellent cooking instructions we were given by Dewa Jana (clearly a highly experienced chef with knowledge of both Asian and western food). Wisely his instructions and demonstrations focused on technique rather than ingredients. Recipe booklet provided later.Highlights of the evening were numerous and included donning sarongs to accompany the family matriarch as she laid offerings; explanations of family life; meeting other smiling dignified family members; natural fresh ingredients and \"touring\" the family compound.Finally once the 8 or 10 dishes and accompaniments were cooked Chef Jana beautifully plated our dinner which was than served to us by a delightful young \"waitress\".I suspect this will be the best meal we eat in Bali. Even a 5 star restaurant would be pressed to better the quality of our dinner. Overall a priceless experience which demanded respect and delighted our senses."

Then, went to a beautiful family compound (garden) for the cooking course. We learned how to make absolutely everything from scratch. The course ended with a multi-course meal of all the yummy things we had made that morning. Would do it again in a heartbeat!"

Sang Made met us at the markets and we got to learn about all the produce we were going to cook and meet all the wonderful market vendors.We arrived at the compound where Sang Made's family live and the cooking classes were held and we were amazed at the beauty of it.We met Chef Dewi, who has been a chef in one of Bali's best 5 star restaurants. He was fantastic with his fluent English and easy explanations. The day was full of laughs. We learnt all about the Bali family traditions.A beautiful dining table was set up for us to eat our cooking, and to our amazement our cooking tasted fantastic. We were sent away with cooking books and a little gift.I had checked out trip advisor looking for a cooking class experience before we left, I know now we could not have picked a better class. It was a five star experience from the moment we arrived until the moment we left."

Taken to seriously locals only market to look how they really shop and plenty of knowledge imparted and questions eagerly answered. This is a hands-on cooking course in a traditional compound. Many staff on hand and chef was experienced and very patient. My 11yo daughter cooks at home regularly so she was included and felt sufficiently useful. Be aware that when they offer you a beer with lunch that it will be added to your bill and is not included in the price. They charged fairly for the beer; this is just a note to remind you to bring extra funds. We bought vanilla, palm sugar and some spices for unbelievable prices, but be aware that if going onto Australia or NZ these will not be let in by customs. Happy to answer any questions anyone has, just message me."

The culinary walking tour was a huge highlight for me and my partner. Sang de (Our guide) knew this area like the back of us hand as this was his playground when he was growing up. He had a world of knowledge.\u00a0This is now my fourth cooking class and this was definitely the \u00a0best. Mata (I hope this is his correct name) was our chef and he was fantastic. A great teacher who loves his job. The food was DELICIOUS! Some of the best food we have had in all of Asia. They did not skimp on ingredients either, we ate like Kings and Queens.\u00a0The whole experience was very special, you are welcomed into their family compound and taught about Balinese traditions, lifestyle and culture. I would also not hesitate to bring along any male companions as my partner who is not a cook loved it, you couldn't not.\u00a0Every details was well thought out, even down to the special gift and book of recipes that you get to take home with you.\u00a0This\u00a0 is the best way to experience a place and a culture.\u00a0"

After looking at numerous reviews for various cooking classes, we realized that several factors are important: size of the class, location (home vs. cafe), and cost. Lobong limits its class size to 10, and we had a class of 6. There were plenty of things for each of us to do (though we weren't each making an individual meal- if that's what you expect). The chef was amazing and gave us instructions that were easy to understand- and more importantly- remember. The location also couldn't have been beat. The host family has a wonderful house, and the explanations of Balinese culture, the housing complex, etc. really contributed to our appreciation of the culture. Other cooking classes, many for a cheaper price, are located in warungs, or small restaurants, which I think would detract from the experience.The cost is roughly $40 USD, which we were hesitant about at first (other classes run as low as $20) but we think is more than worth it for what you get out of it. What it comes down to is- most anyone can run a cooking class. All you need is a kitchen and a recipe. Lobong manages to surpass all expectations with the presentation, the explanations, and the food. (the cook used to be a su chef and cooked for many celebrities.) If you are going to do a cooking class, you may as well do it right. Couldnt think of higher praises. Would highly recommend to any of my friends, and am going to send my parents when they come visit Bali."

There is an opportunity to see real Balinese life as its being lived. The information at the market and then at the family compound was amazing. I appreciated the chance to slow down and learn about a different culture and how they live their lives. Everything about this experience was authentic, from the market with all it's interesting foods to the smells (not always pleasant but real) to the family compound and daily life. Nothing is glossed over or hidden, this is the way the Balinese have lived for many years. Yes the table is beautiful and the modern toilet is appreciated but you still see the simple kitchen, the delicious, fresh foods used for cooking, the pigs in the pen and the chickens walking through the yard. As a chef I was impressed by the quality of the meal from a simple stove, including the wood stove used to cook the rice and the matron of the house making fresh coconut milk and oil for cooking. I received a great education on the food, the lifestyle, the spirituality and the home of a Balinese family. What a great bargain for the price and a fabulous meal and parting gifts as well."

Being in the family compound you are embedded in it from the offerings made after cooking to watching a priest conduct a ceremony 'cleansing\" one of the family members who recently became a mother. This is the real clincher for why we don't think this class could be beaten.3/ Good facilities, good food, small groups (we only had 6 in total).4/ A professional chef who is a good communicator and helpful about things from knife skills to different techniques of cooking.5/ Professional handling all the way from booking to arriving back at our accommodation.6/ Friendly and knowledgeable hosts at all points of the tour.Thoroughly enjoyed it - thanks!"

While the meal was being plated up we were invited to the family temple, wearing sarong and learning how and why offerings are made.

Today I went with them, and was reminded why. Made picked us up at 8 this morning and we headed to the traditional market -- a real one, just outside of Ubud -- where we had a wonderful tour of all the ingredients and regular market life (it's where things happen!). Back at the family compound over coffee and fresh-made snacks, you learn about how an extended family compound is designed and operates. Mother shows you how to make fresh coconut oil, and then Chef Dewa gets down to business. I was surprised the menu was so extensive, but it covers all of the basic types of preparation and sauces & sambals, and we did them all without trouble -- including cooking rice over a traditional wood stove! They have added a clean, spacious facility that lets everyone particiate and dine in comfort, and with a maximum of 12 participants you still feel like part of the family. We had two kids in our group aged 10 and 13, and they were easily included in all the activities. While the capable assistants finished up the last bits, we learned about making offerings, tied on our sarongs, and helped mother place the daily offerings around the family temple. Then we all sat down to a 5-star meal, the best Balinese food I've had in 20 years of living here. Even the picky kids cleaned their plates! Made delivered us home between 2:30 and 3:00 with our recipe booklet, a little bottle of fresh coconut oil, and an invitation to come say hi anytime we're back in town. A memorable day."

The variety of items available for sale is truly mind-boggling. If you keep your eyes and heart open, you will learn much here. Our guide spoke great English and there was no problem at all in communication.We were then driven to the family compound, where we were warmly greeted and seated in an open pavilion. While we ate banana fritters and drank coffee, we were told about the layout of the Balinese family compound. Since it was just my son and I at this class, we were able to ask anything we wanted. Our hosts were very generous and patient in explaining life in Bali.Our culture lesson continued while we cooked. Since it was just two of us, we got to be very hands on with the entire meal. Each step was thoroughly explained, with our hosts consistently making sure we understood. They told us things which we could use as substitutes for those ingredients which are not easy to find in the US. We also got the chance to see coconut oil being made by the elder woman of the compound in the traditional way.Time passed quickly, and soon, all the dishes were prepared. Before we could eat them, however, we got the very special treat of being allowed to participate in a blessing ceremony in the family temple. We donned traditional garb for this event. Every step in this process was carefully explained, with the reasons and beliefs behind it.Finally, we ate all the delicious food we had prepared. It was one of the best meals I ate in all of Bali. Very, very good!!!When you leave, you receive a recipe book for everything you've made, and given a gift of coconut oil made by the family matriarch. All in all, an incredible day out in Bali. I highly recommend it to everyone. You will not be sorry. As one final side note, the compound has very clean, western style restrooms. The area for food preparation, and dining is scrupulously clean. No worries about \"bali belly\" here!"

We learned about the real life of a Bali family ...food, weddings, Hindu religion and the interplay between family and community. This was the background for the fabulous cooking lesson which started in the local community markets and continued in his family home. Sang De's brother-in-law, Dewa, a qualified chef, took the actual cooking class. He was amiable and enjoyed a laugh as he involved us in each of the steps as we prepared the degustation lunch. The only suggestion would be that the experience would have been even further enhanced had Dewa sat down with us to enjoy the lunch we had prepared. Nevertheless, this was the highlight of our Bali trip. I'd strongly recommend this class. Oh, and it was the best meal we ate in Bali!!"

Pickup up from our hotel was free and we were first taken to a local market. Here, we were shown many local herbs, spices, vegetables, fruit and meat by a guide with very good English. We then went to the Lobong house to begin our cooking class. We chopped spices but the meat was already prepared. Each person (7 in total) took turns cooking the 9 dishes. Drinks were free the whole class. At its completion, we were shown an offering at a local temple before eating our creations. A parting gift of home made coconut oil and cook book with their recipes was provided. Overall, a very positive experience with just the right amount of involvement. Definitely recommend doing it."

We were unsure about travelling from Sanur to Ubud for a cooking class but so glad we did.All the other reviews describe the experience brilliantly. There is a great mix of cooking and culture, and the setting in the family compound is beautiful. The market visit was amazing, we got to see how the Balinese buy and sell in an authentic setting. You could opt in and out of the cooking process as you wanted, or just stand back and watch. The meal is served to you once all the dishes are prepared, and the coconut oil presented as a gift at the end is a really nice touch. Really highly recommended!"

The market experience was fascinating, we felt like we were getting to see some authentic culture away from all the touristy places. The family compound we were taken to was beautiful and the meal we cooked was the most incredible meal we had on our holiday! My boyfriend is a chef and he still learnt some Balinese cooking techniques (as well as having a bit of a cook off with the family)! I found it just as fulfilling with my basic cooking skills. All the participation tasks are nothing too complex, so it was all achievable and very enjoyable. I have seen some complaints that there was not enough actual hands on activity time, but that isn't the purpose of the day, it is as much a cultural experience. The family then serve you the meal you've helped prepared, by this time you have got to know the group (there were only 9 when we were there), so the mood is very festive and relaxing, with some beers available to order. Considering the very reasonable price of this experience to top off the great day, this would be the first activity I would recommend to anyone going to Bali! Thank your for making our trip so special!"

We were met by Sung De who showed us around the market and let us try fruits that we were inquisitive about. It was a great way to see the market and interact with the local people.We were then taken to the family compound which was a great insight into traditional Balinese life. We sat and chatted over a coffee and banana fritters (very tasty) and we learnt lots about the day-to-day life of a family.The cooking lesson was well explained, varied and interesting - all of the recipes that were given were totally do-able back at home. During the lesson we had a pit-stop near the bbq where we were served drinks and 'mangosteens' (picked fresh from their back garden as we had previously mentioned how much we enjoyed them).The food was incredible and we are looking forward to trying out the recipes back at home. This will be made a bit easier thanks to the little gift they gave us at the end of the lesson.I highly recommend this experience as a more authentic cooking lesson compared to the ones that are offered in a restaurant. It is also a great way to learn and experience traditional Balinese life - thank you for a lovely day!"

Morning market at Payangan was a great way to introduce Indonesian cuisine so I suggest you get the morning slot. They only accept 6pax so better book early. As we enter the Lobong compound, we were seated first in their hall for culture briefing. Good info and Sundey was very fluent in English so we easily understood whatever he's explaining. We were given drinks and Nasi Goreng (fried banana fritters), it was delish! It was an easy cooking class session, but also we were lucky to have good companion. Gained friends also (skyping til now). Chef Dewa and staff were helpful during our session. I also like the oleh-oleh (souvenir) :) Good job Sang Made family!

Our hired driver picked us up at 7:00 am at our hotel in Seminyak and took us to meet up with the class at an Ubud Market at 8:15am. We had a total of seven in the class. We toured the local market and learned about fresh ingredients used in daily Balinese cooking. We also sampled a few items. Once the market tour ended we were driven to the cooking class location and greeted with a drink of either coffee or tea and fried plantains. While enjoying our drinks, we were told about the layout of their home/garden, daily customs and other interesting facts of daily life in the Balinese home. The chef, who has worked in hotels in Bali, shared techniques of chopping, stir frying, grinding, and how rice is cooked. Everyone participated in the cooking and preparation process - and learned about all the ingredients. We cooked at least eight dishes in total - and after everything was done, we were served. It was excellent, and seriously some of the best food we had in Bali. I still don't know how they provide this class and make a profit. It's well organized, about five hours long, and very clean, and very professional. This is a class/day not to be missed. Very educational, fun and great food."

Sang Made was a great host and courteous guide with excellent English. The chef is top notch and while he and his assistants help with some of the details in cooking each dish, the class ultimately prepares most of the food.

Being foodies and having a love of cooking, I cannot praise the experience enough. The day began with a visit to a traditional Balinese market where the first stall we went to had a fresh roast sucking pig on the table which set my mouth watering - for 10,000 rupia (just over AU$1) I bought a good sized parcel to share with Rachael. From here we walked through the market with our guide, Made, explaining the different foods and fruits along the way. This market doesn't usually have non Balinese visitors and I think the stall holders admired us with the same curiosity we did them, a lot of smiles were exchanged! From the markets we went to the Lobong Traditional Family Compound where we drank Bali Coffee, ate banana fritter and talked with each other and our hosts before the cooking experience began.We were given an explanation of the compound and a tour and along the way introduced to our guide's mother who was making coconut oil. The cooking class was fabulous, with each of us given a chance to participate in the preparation techniques from chopping, frying, steaming rice to grinding fresh ingredients for the curry and satay. We were kept engaged throughout the lesson with questions, smells and flavours.Once the food had been prepared and cooked we dressed in sarongs to enter the family temple to make an offering before we ate.We enjoyed the meal sat around a large table within one of the compound buildings and while we ate it started to pour with rain - it was amazing! When the rain began to encroach on the area we sat at, the family moved us under a larger building.The family at Lobong cooking were so friendly and explained the cooking steps along the way. We took away complimentary bottles of coconut oil made by our host's mother, together with a cook book of the recipes we made that day. Since returning to Australia we have made the chicken curry twice and had the satay tonight. Lobong have remained in touch with us through Facebook and have provided their email contact details should we ever have any questions - as they do with all of their guests.We'll definitely go back on our next visit to Bali - the experience goes well beyond cooking alone and remains long after returning home!"

This class allows you to learn about their culture and customs and makes you have a greater appreciation for Bali. The best way to learn about one's culture is sometimes through their food. Take the morning class to really experience the full monty."

Hospitality of Sang De and his family was special and more than we could have hoped for. A real Balinese cultural and cooking experience that we are so glad we did. We were even given a little gift pack to take home of coconut oil and a recipe book to ensure we can try to replicate the amazing dishes we helped to make on the day. Loved it, loved it, loved it.

They are professional and friendly and the lessons they teach you are priceless. During the market tour (morning class) you learn about local market histories and traditions. You mingle with the locals and learn all about their food and culture. On arrival the family home you are given a lesson on traditional family compound whilst you snack on deliscious deep fried bananas and locally grown coffee... all before you even start cooking.The menu is DELISH! and seeing the traditional cooking practices including bbq and cocnut oil productions are just a few of the highlights. You must start your visit with this tour so you are aware of the culture as you continue through Ubud. Thank you to the family of Lobong we had a very memorable time, Yum!"

The day began with a punctual pickup from our hotel, and to a colorful local produce market, where we joined the other 7 in our class and our host, young Sang Made, who guided us through the produce on sale, explaining unfamiliar items and their uses eg betel nuts, live eels, various chillies, different types of rice and the local favourite, pork, (a 'suckling pig' definitely too big to have been suckling!) cooked and served to the locals as 'fast food'. We were given the warmest of welcomes by all the family at the Lobong home, the geriatrics amongst us given special consideration, being past sitting cross-legged on a cushion! After refreshments and an introduction to their beautiful home, and some of the customs and rituals they observe, it was 'roll up the sleeves', aprons on, and we were into it - learning how to make coconut oil, preparing rice by traditional methods, chopping, frying, tasting, asking and answering questions under the expert tutelage of an expert chef, with many years of commercial experience. Our group included 3 from Canada, 2 from the UK, and 4 Australians, all of whom participated and cooperated well as a team. Cousins and aunts, brothers and nephews, all gave attentive assistance throughout the process and withIn a couple of hours, 8 different dishes were prepared for a fabulous lunch. This would have to be one of the best ways to experience Bali if your interest extends beyond sightseeing and shopping.Sang De and his family deserve top marks for the presentation of their culinary experience. It would rate as one of our most memorable memories. We are so grateful to them for sharing their culture and opening their beautiful home to us."

They explained a lot of things about the Balinese culture, about the market and about the products for sale there. It was amazing to see all the colours of fruits and vegetables and to see chickens in baskets\u2026after the tour we were given a bottle of water and were brought to the compound, where the family who organizes these tours live. They life in a beautiful home, were we were served tea and a sweet snack while we learned about life in a Balinese compound. The chef was a nice and funny man, who has worked in a 5 star hotel before. He learned us to make 9 different dishes \u2013 all delicious. We also learned some chopping techniques and tips about onions and garlic, which is helpful for Western cooking back home as well! It was fun to learn how to make these dishes and to see how the others got on \u2013 there were about 8 other people there. We all had our part in making the wonderful meal we would be eating later. In the mean time everything was thought of \u2013 there was room to leave your bags, they took moment for you to take pictures and we were constantly provided by water. Very well taken care off. The meal was incredible! Pork satay and baby chicken barbequed and cooked in the nicest sauce ever, and a lovely and healthy salad. At the end of the day we were given a small bottle of coconut oil and a recipe book so we can try to make satay at home. All in all a well good day out, highly recommended. "

It combined three elements of a good holiday activity: (1) a cultural experience; (2) it was enjoyable and (3) it had great food! The morning trip to the market was a great experience. Sang De provided very clear explanations and with a good sense of humour. Back at the family compound we took part in an interesting cooking class. The instructor (Sang De's brother) catered for all abilities, and made a lot of sense. His tips for 'substitute' items back home were helpful. Finally, once of the best meals of our trip was served up. It was very pleasant. I will (and have) recommend Lobong Cooking Class to anyone I know that travels to Bali. ps: I should add - the pick up and drop off-service back to the hotel made the whole outing a very easy."

I went with my sister, we were picked up on time at our hotel (slightly out of ubud, in the rice fields, this was a small additional cost which we were happy to pay), we then picked up another two girls and went straight to the local markets where we met our host Sang De. Sang De speaks great english, and provided us with much insight into the balinese culture. We walked through the markets and were explained all the different types of fruit and vegetables, grains, and traditions. We then went back to the family compound for some refreshments, which was a great opportunity to chat with the other members of the class and get to know them.We then met with the Chef who also spoke great english and he took us through the processes of making the balinese food. After we made all of the food we were able to do an offering at the family compound and were told about the traditional bali family life, it was all very interesting. We then ate our food, which was AMAZING and had more time to chat to the other members of the cooking class.Over all, it was definitely a highlight of my trip. The staff/family were all very friendly and helpful, and professional. Everything was done perfectly. My sister and I both agree it was worth every cent.To all at Lobong Cooking - thank you for such a memorable day."

We were picked up bang on time from our hotel and driven to the venue via another couple's hotel. We selected the morning class (8 am pick up) and were driven to the local markets where we met the other members of the cooking class who had been picked up by other drivers. We were met by our host Sang Dae who escorted us through the markets explaining the produce as well as how the markets are organised for the locals. From there, we were driven to his family home where he gave us the religious and cultural background of how a Balinese home is built and lived in. It was a good insight for a newcomer to Bali. Then on to cooking guided by one of his brothers, an experienced chef. Everyone had a go at helping make the dishes which we later enjoyed for lunch, which happened after an educational tour of their family temple. We were momentarily interrupted by a moderate earthquake and Sang Dae took great care to ensure we got into open space. Overall, it was a very nice half-day spent with very hospitable hosts. Would recommend it highly to anyone who has not been to Bali as an educational experience."

Our host spoke excellent english and answered all questions. Cooking involved everyone and all that we ate later was prepared by the group, even the rice was cooked by the group! (No electric rice cookers here!!)Techniques and reasons for ingedients were shared by the chef and there was always a little humour involved.When cooking was completed we were dressed in sarongs and we all visited the familly temple and the history was explained.We finally sat down to a meal to die for washed down with bintang that was available at extra cost.The day started at 9.00 and finished at 2.00 and the cost was $37.50 pp. This included a cookbook given at the end of the session.My wife is a chef and so found it of great interest. However I am a non cook and still had a great day. Great value and I would recommend it as a must if visiting Bali."

Starts with a pick up at my hotel, and a fantastic early morning visit to a market in the hillside near the family compound. No other tourists (except for our group) and no people trying to sell something, just a really interesting walk through the market, highlighting the produce we would use in the lesson. On arriving we had coffee and sweet banana (deep fried with caramel sauce). They shared a lot of information about family compounds, the way the houses are structured, the small details like how offerings are made to signify particular things within the compound. I felt quite privileged to be in their space. Cooking is part demonstration and part hands on, but very clear and easy to understand. the chef talks through alternative ingredient that you can use if the ones used are not available in your home country. I was more than satisfied with the level of cooking, even though you do not do everything yourself from start to finish, and I guess the cooking skills are not different, its more about understanding how to chop and mix the spices, how to cook them in particular order etc. after the class finished, we made offerings to the family temple, and then sat and had an a la carte service of the meals plus some to finish. the meal was divine. the whole day was completely fantastic. its low key, perfectly routined and i really enjoyed the understated yet polished delivery."

She was being dragged along as she isn't exactly an Asian food enthusiast like myself, but even she raved about the cultural experience we had at Lobong. The staff in particular were amazing. They spoke excellent English and were very gracious with sharing their lives and culture with us. The class is held in the families compound and the open air kitchen is a beautiful place to take a cooking class. And the food... well! Yum yum yum. From the food we cooked on the BBQ to the steamed rice cooked over the fire- it was the perfect balance of salad and meat, sweet and spicy.It was so interesting to cook with the ingredients we had just seen at the local market. We shared the class with only another group of two, so four in total. This was a stark difference to a cooking class I had taken in Chiang Mai where we shared the class with 23 other people and felt lost and confused the whole time! A must if you are in Ubud, not just for the cooking experience but to learn about the Balinese culture, religion and family ties. A really wonderful day,"

Visiting a local market, our guide explained all the ingredients we would use. Then, in the family compound, we learned technique for basic peanut sauce and Bali spice paste, and then how to use them in various dishes. Also learned how to cook rice properly. To conclude, we ate what we had cooked - a true Balinese feast! We learned about the offerings and the family shrines, the daily routine and obligation for offering, and about how the family compound was laid out - who lived where and why, and what other buildings were used for. We asked many questions and our hosts were very generous in sharing information with us about their lives and customs.Not for babies or children, or those who can't stand for long periods - you need to watch the proceedings, listen and take part to get the most out of it.Our guide spoke very good English, and his brother the chef, had cooked for 20 years in hotels - all in all, very knowledgable people and excellent value for money.

Lucky us!The other reviewers are right on track with their comments. It is not a 'how to cook' class. It is more of a cultural experience. Thus it is fun for anyone with any level of cooking ability, although a basic knowledge of cooking techniques will certainly help. There is not much pressure and since everyone receives a cookbook at the end, one is not distracted by having to take notes during the class. The family is charming, welcoming and very eager to share their way of life with visitors. The food was interesting and very tasty. One of our classmates was vegetarian and was easily accommodated. I would take this class again.Be sure to bring your camera as there are lots of photo opportunities at both the market and the family compound. This is exactly the type of tourism business that should be encouraged all over the world. Small scale, environmentally aware family business with the money generated staying in the local community. I wish them every success."

The food was divine and I can't wait to have a go at cooking it in my kitchen.We loved the very informative talk about Balinese culture, which then helped us on other tours and gives you an insight into a totally different way of life than we are used to. It certainly puts things into perspective. The whole Lobong family are delightful and are on a winner with this business. We wish them every success and would thoroughly recommend.We had a thoroughly enjoyable time apart from the psycho, completely selfish, total nutcase of a 22 year old Malaysian girl who we had the misfortune to be sharing with in the small group of four. The Lobong family were hugely embarrassed that she had spoilt the evening for (which it didn't really, just gave us something else to remember!). Her behaviour suddenly changed after the food appeared, which incidentally she had been longing and hurrying everyone along for because she was hungry, only to turn it away demanding cigarettes and more alcohol. I might add, the Lobong family went out of their way to accommodate her wishes by going to several places to purchase cigarettes and without even a thank you. Her mood and tirade escalated after I politely asked her to stop blowing smoke across the table in my face as I am a non-smoker and used to Australian smoking rules, particularly whilst eating! She went off like a firecracker. We had to depart the table to get away from her and jointed the Lobong family for a few laughs to finish on a high. As mentioned, we did have a wonderful learning experience. LOL, if her travelling partner (poor thing!) has any sense, he will lose her as quick as he might have found her!!!"

We all put on a sarong and went in to the temple where thr talk continued and tge offering took place.I would highly recommend this cooking course. It's such a balinese experience! Well worth it!"

We were picked up at our hotel (The Samaya Ubud) exactly on time and taken to the market at 8am for shopping before the class. The entire experience with Dewa and his brother-in-law was simply exceptional. If we ever go back to Ubud, my wife and I would certainly do this again! There are plenty of other reviews here so I won't bother with the details - I'll simple say, FOR SURE sign up for this wonderful experience! I recommend it far above any other recreational or cooking activity in Ubud. Enjoy!!!"

The day began with an 8:00 pick up at our hotel, Tegal Sari, and then a tour of the small village market near the cooking school. The market tour was valuable, as our guide, Sundae (spelled incorrectly, my apologies!) speaks very good english and was open to answering our many questions on what the different and exotic food items were, were used for, cost in the market and clarifications on comparable items we might be able to find at home. He took extra time to allow us to taste and smell many different fruits and veggies. The Balinese culture portion of the day actually began at the market and continued to the family temple at the cooking compound. This view of Balinese family life was incredibly detailed and once again, no question went unanswered. Very well done! The brother in law, Dewa (once again, I am unsure of the exact spelling) is a trained chef with years of experience, and it showed. There was lots of hands on work, chopping, cooking, stirring and finally presenting the banquet...this is no \"sit back and watch the magic\" kind of experience, you are intimately involved in making the meal. There is a demonstration of how coconut oil is made and the detailed demonstration in the art of cooking traditional rice is fascinating. At the end, sarongs are donned and you witness the afternoon offering at the family temple with the matriarch of the clan. It's very moving. Everyone sits down to the meal and has a chance to visit and ask any further questions. We were each given a bottle of the homemade coconut oil and a recipe book to take home and we look forward to trying out the new recipes. We would highly recommend this culinary experience and felt it was well worth the cost."

This has to be our best experience in Bali in a long time. Our key hosts, Sang Made and Dewa were organised, informative and helpful and achieved their goal of giving us much more than a cooking class, supported by many other family and staff at their family compound. Our group was small, but diverse with the 5 couples each coming from different countries. The menu was varied to take into account vegetarian and 'no pork' preferences in the group. The groups are intentionally kept small so that everyone gets a hands on experience a few times through the class. Morning class includes a market visit, which is informative, but Dewa has the key raw ingredients at home to show you anyway. Great experience and great value for money. Subsequently, with Sang Made's guidance, we bought a Balinese mortar and pestle (fantastic!) and rice steamer (3 parts) to bring home. My first two days back at home were spent shopping and cooking. Australian Quarantine did seize my woven Balinese rice steamer mats, (infested with borers) so we had to have rice cooker rice, but family and friends have been very impressed by what we were able to make following the class using the recipes provided. The flavours are fantastic. We could not match Dewa's plating up though! Beers are offered with meals at modest cost. Must be one of your best and most memorable meals in Bali if you go. First class."

We arrived at the Lobong family compound (which is 5-10 minutes outside of downtown Ubud) just before 8am. That's when we met Sundae who runs the class with his brother-in-law, the chef. I'm not sure about the name spelling, but he said to think of an ice cream sundae - his English is really good. Sundae led us and a few other couples that joined on a tour of the market where all of our cooking ingredients were sourced. This was an authentic Balinese market. We were the only tourists there. We learned how the real Balinese markets work.After learning about the fruit, spices, rice, and meat in the market, we went back to the Lobong family compound to start cooking. Sundae's brother-in-law is the family chef and led us through each of the courses we created step-by-step. Each of the participants in our class helped cook one of the dishes or dish components. We learned about all of the ingredients and how to time the preparation - timing in Balinese cooking is really important. Before eating, Sundae led us on a tour of the family compound's temple. We made an offering, including small portions of what we had just created, before we ate. Then we sat down to eat all the food we had cooked. It was a great reward after a long morning of cooking.This is a family operation and you can tell. All of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The tour of the market and the tour of the family compound made me feel like my wife and I got a very authentic Balinese experience. Oh, and the food was fabulous!"

This was the BEST experience my girls (ages 6,9,12) and I had the whole month. It was a fun and educational way to be able to experience traditional Balinese culture and learn how to cook some fabulous food at the same time. Chef Dewa involved the children in the cooking according to their ability, and made sure there was plenty of fun stuff for each of us to do. We were amazed at how delicious the dishes were, but of course we had help. Thank you to Sang Made and the whole family, we were honoured to be welcomed into your home. My advice for anyone thinking of doing a cooking class - do Lobong Cooking Class, it is simply the best. Fiona"

Lobong combines traditional cooking techniques at a traditional family compound along with some insight into day to day Balinese life.Our day started with a drive out to the family home where the classes are held, past the scenic rice terraces of outer Ubud. From here our guide took the group to a traditional Balinese produce market where we learnt about some of the more unique Balinese fruits and vegetables as well as getting to see where the food we'd be cooking came from.Back at the family home our guide told us about Balinese life and culture. We found out about the daily offerings, Balinese calendar, family temples, and various aspects of life right from birth.After the markets we started our cooking class led by a Balinese chef who had worked at some international hotels. We made several dishes including red bean and papaya soup, tempe manis (fried soy bean cake), grilled marinated chicken, skewered marinated pork, a salad, sweet potato rice, sambal, and a rice porridge for dessert. All cooking was done using more or less traditional equipment and techniques such as stone pestle and mortar, woven flax steamer's for the rice and an open fire for grilling.The best part came at the end of course when we got to eat everything we made, tasty food and a cold Bintang.The only thing I didn't like about the course was the fact that we shared cooking duties as opposed to everyone doing their own thing however this did make the experience more social. Other than that we found the guides and chefs to be very knowledgeable and helpful and everyone spoke good English....a great way to learn about the 'real' Bali that most visitors don't get to see."

It began with a market tour and tasting some strange looking, but tasting fruit. Then we got driven back to the family compound and had morning tea!! Coffee and banana fritters - an excellent start to any day!!During the course of the day, we had Balinese family traditions and rituals explained as well as taking part in the daily offering. We made so much food, but they had us chopping and stirring in between the many photos and questions.. It was a great day and to sit down to our magnificent feast that we had contributed to was quite rewarding!We look forward to returning for one of their dinner classes when they commence in the future!"

By the time the cooking (and eating) is over (by 1:30 pm), you will have learned a lot about the life, religion and culture of Balinese people. Highly recommended... ...even if you don't like cooking!"

My girlfriend gave this to me as a birthday present during our trip through Indonesia and we loved it. The guide speaks the best English we heared in three weeks Indonesia and the contents of the cooking course are sublime; really nice to see Bali's true culture when it comes to its cousine.First, we set off to a local market no normal tourists would ever visit. Face the numerous stalls that sell their herbs, spices, clothes and animals. You will see Bali's true local people here. Find the freshly harvested food here that you will normally buy at your local supermarket. Always wanted to find out where it came from and how it made its way to the shelf? Here is your answer.After the guide on the market we arrived at a compound of a pretty rich Balinese family, I guess. Explanations about food, culture and habits are easily to follow because of, again, the good English of the guide. For the Dutch readers, this person cooperated with the Dutch tv-serie op zoek naar geluk from the Tros and worked together with Danny the Munk and other Dutch celebs (as so to say).Anyway, after some introductory talk we started preparing the food. We made our own peanut sauce, sambal ulek, tempe manis, marinade for the chicken and many other dishes. Everything is prepared with coconut oil (of which you will get a bottle of 100 ml after the course, sealed and good for hand luggage) and they even show you how they get the coconut oil from the...coconut.After about three hours we were finished with preparing the food and before we could devour the tasty dishes the food is bleshed traditionally, like the Balinese do.If you are in Ubud then this is a must-do. It not only grants access to the Balinese kitchen and its delicious herbs and all but also makes you appreciate the food and especially the animals. Bali locals bless their food and thus also the animals they eat. It actually reminded me of the Avatar movie where they too, praise their animal for its meat.A given many a Western country has already long forgotten."

So much interesting stuff i learned that morning!After the market tour we went to the compound where we were welcomed by snacks. While we were sipping on our tea/coffee Sang Made once again shared his vast knowledge of Balinese culture with us and gave us a full illustration of the layout of his compound.Dewa, the master chef, welcomed us to the kitchen, introduced our menu and began our exquisite journey to a scrumptious meal. It was a very informative and detailed cooking lesson, fortunately, Dewa gave us a recipe book in the end so that we can remember everything we did. We also had a bottle of homemade coconut oil to take home :)This was not only a cooking class, it was also an interesting session of Balinese culture education. Sang Made was eager to answer all the questions we had related to Bali. Our chef was also well prepared and good in his expertise. And the driver was very cool and patient..

This is by far the best setup I have been to. This is also an excellent buy for your money. My friends and I were picked up in a comfortable, fairly new SUV. Our driver was very friendly and told us about various areas we passed by. We were let off at the market in Ubud and our guide there was very knowledgeable and a great teacher as well (and easy on the eyes). He was extremely charismatic and made us all very comfortable and welcome right away. He purchased items for us to sample and helped us when we wanted to buy fruits to take back. Once we arrived at the family facility we were completely blown away at the beauty of the layout! We started off with a snack and coffee that was prepared for us. The hospitality was just phenomenal. I am a very experienced cook. I was very pleased with the dishes we were taught to make. It didn't seem as though it would be too overwhelming for someone who is not so experienced, so I feel this is the perfect balance for all levels. The chef, who is the patriarch of the family, has worked in some wonderful restaurants around the world. He is very knowledgeable and explained everything we were doing so you knew why that step was important.We learned so much about the overall culture of the Balinese during our time there. That was such an added perk. It was very interesting and helped us to understand many things we saw during the duration of our trip. When the eating was done, all I wanted to do was figure out how I could spend a month living on their property and learning how to cook more food! They gave us a lovely going away present that absolutely made my trip! I won't say what it was so as not to spoil it, but they probably thought I was crazy the way I was gushing over it lol. All in all, this was an experience that I will always remember, and I truly mean that. I think if I ever go to Bali again I will do this all over just to go back to their home and learn a new dish. I cannot recommend this any higher....it is the best, I'm sure of it. If you choose them, you will not be disappointed. You can't even begin to imagine the experience you will have with them!

They arranged for free pick-up from our hotel to Made's house for the class.Guests are welcomed with a cup of Balinese coffee and then showed around the house. Then, the cooking lesson started by showing us how coconut milk is made. We were then shown the menu and the ingredients used (including explaining any alternatives we can use back home).We cooked about 5 dishes plus rice. The only setback of this cooking class is the lack of hands-on cooking. There is only two woks and we take turns to do the cooking. (In our previous cooking class experience in a Bangkok, each student has his/her own stove and wok).The menu does not change much as the cooking concentrates on Balinese food, which does not have much variety. After cooking, we were introduced the traditional Balinese prayers led by Sang Made's mum at their family temple (yes, each Balinese house has a temple within their compound).After the prayers, we eat!"

I rang once in Bali, and spoke to the very charming Sunday, who is the son who organises this cooking class at his family home. Sunday speaks impeccable english; he organised for driver to pick us up in Seminyak, drive to Ubud to see the produce market and then take us to his family home, to prepare and then eat a lovely lunch that we all had a hand in preparing. Even my grand-daughters, aged 5, 7 & 9 years were cutting, tossing, pounding herbs and were intrigued to see the making of offerings by Sundays' mother, and prior to eating we wnt to the family temple to place these offerings to the Gods.The combination of cooking, learning Balinese customs & understanding local produce made it a wonderful day. Lunch was superb. The cost of this day was very reasonable, considering the quality of information & experiences."

What set it apart was the combining of the food/cooking experience with understanding of the culture. The cooking included visiting a market so we could see the range of foods and how local people shop and then seeing the varus food being grown in the family compound: a paddy to plate experience. The cooking class was very hands on and Dewar is a great teacher. He respected the varying levels in the group and adapted the class to take account of everyone's taste buds. Sang Made was a welcoming and informative host who made us feel at home. Nothing was too much trouble and he filled in many of the gaps we had about Balinese life and culture. All five of our group highly recommend this class even if you are not that interested in cooking because its such an opportunity to join a local Balinese family for the day and eat great Balinese food that you've prepared. For foodies like us it was a great way to cook some authentic Balinese dishes."

The family give you a complete cultural and educational lesson on all things sacred to the Balinese. We thoroughly enjoyed the passion with which this was communicated, in perfect English. Absolutely fantastic.Initially we had reservations doing the course, as we had done a cooking course in Chiang Mai Thailand at a much cheaper price (and Thai food favours our palate more). However, we thoroughly enjoyed our evening - in fact we had an awesome time!!! Highly recommended!!! Lobong cutely mixes up the main host and the chef, which keeps the interaction fresh. The host principally teaches you about the Bali culture (a former Bali tour guide) while the chef teaches you cooking skill sets (a former hotel chef who also worked in Perth). The food was fantastic - the peanut sauce, marinated chicken and pork skewers were standouts! The desert was slightly disappointing - I have tasted better black rice pudding in Bali.The only advice I would give Lobong is that we were asked if we would like a Bintang with our dinner. Everyone in the group assumed it was complimentary, as it seemed to be in the nature of the offer. It wasn't. We were all given large Bintangs, which most of the females didn't finish. It's a small matter which can be easily rectified with better communication. I would have been embarrassed if I had only the correct money with me for the course. Rectify this guys, give a small Bintang complimentary. The class is priced sufficiently.Overall, keep up the enthusiasm, keep educating us simple souls, and enjoy the rewards. Your tour has been the highlight of our trip to Bali so far (even better than the many massages, and that says it all)."

This is one of the newest cooking schools in Bali and as a result, staff are very eager to please and make your experience as enjoyable as possible. I was incredibly impressed from start to finish. An educational trip to one of the village markets is followed by a trip to the family compound where the cooking takes place in the open air. Our menu consisted of a mix of 9 authentic local dishes with the most sumptuous of spices and flavours all chopped and ground by your own fair hands. It all ends with a banquet lunch or dinner (you can do an 8am or 3pm start) laid out in style in the family compound. They don't Market the fact that a % of profits goes back into the local community making this something of a social enterprise! Lobong deserves all the great reviews and is bound to go from strength to strength. Treat yourself. You won't regret it"

Chef Dewa was a very patient and friendly teacher, especially with my slow cutting skills! The dishes we made were delicious and easy enough to recreate in the home. We were also given a goody bag with coconut oil freshly made by Sang Made's mum and a booklet containing the recipes. The whole experience was brilliant and I recommend everyone to give it a go.

We (five) were picked up early by our charming host and first visited a local produce market to learn about the ingredients we would be using. We were then welcomed at the family compound with a drink and a snack before meeting the chef. He then supported us as we cooked nine different courses of authentic Balinese food! It was very 'hands on' and we chopped, ground, stirred and fried all of the dishes. This was fantastic as we learnt the techniques not just the recipes which gave us confidence that we can reproduce them at home. We finally sat down and enjoyed the fabulous lunch we had produced - after participating in the family's blessings and thanks for the food. Seriously the best peanut sauce and tomato sambal ever!While the food and cooking experience was great, what really made this a memorable day was the extensive understanding we gained about Balinese cultural life from our generous host as we were shown around the compound, family temples and gardens. We did this class early in our 10 day holiday in Ubud and it meant we had a better understanding and appreciation of the culture and people for the rest of our stay. A very rich cultural and culinary experience - do it!"

We took the morning class - starting at 08:00 - and went to the local market where we got introduced to a variety of fruits and vegetables. I thought that I'd seen all, but as it turned out, Bali has many culinary secrets that lie hidden in the local market! After the visit to the local market we went to the family compound. I was afraid that it would be another day of endless cultural introductions to temples and Balinese customs, but to my pleasant surprise, we were all expected to take part in the cooking class and stir, cut and bake the ingredients ourselves! The menu was finger lickin' good, and the explanations of our cheff could not have been better. It took us 3 hours to complete the menus. Then, we sat down to enjoy our lunches. Since Lobong only works with small groups, there is a lot of individual attention. Oh, and BTW: they pick you up from the hotel and drop you off after the work's done! I really recommend this experience!"

After careful consideration, I opted for the Lobong culinary experience, and the five of us who went all agree it was an awesome choice. We were collected on time from our accommodation by Sang Made, our host, who was a fount of information about Balinese customs and culture and cheerfully answered all our questions as we drove from one side of Ubud to the other to get to the wet market where we would be seeing all the foods we would be cooking with later in the day. Sang Made was a most solicitous host and quick to assist as I had injured my foot before arriving in Ubud and was having some trouble with steps. He also helped us to purchase fruit to take back to our accommodation later. Back in the car, we quickly drove to the Lobong family compound where we left the bustle and noise of the main street behind for a quiet, peaceful family home.Here Sang Made explained how Balinese families plan their living spaces and share with the extended family as we enjoyed a moring coffee and snack in a ceremonial pavilion. Then he passed us into the capable hands of Chef Dewa to start preparing our luncheon feast. One of the things we liked best was that, as we were a small group, we all got to have hands on experience preparing each dish rather than standing about watching one or two people cook. Sang Made later explained that his family's plan is to always keep group sizes small, to provide just such and experience. We learned how to make a base paste which was then used to flavour our other dishes, which were all surprisingly different. There included two kinds of satay (which we had made the peanut sauce for from scratch), a salad, a special rice, a Balinese chicken \"curry\" and a tomato sambal. The only dish we did not make ourselves was a black rice pudding for dessert. All the ingredients used were fresh and healthy with no commercial products used and as Chef Dewa has worked in Australia he is very knowledgeable about ingredients which can be substituted if the original is not available.Our lunch feast was served in the ceremonial pavilion after Sang Made's mother kindly showed us the Balinese custom of making an offering to the family gods of the food one is about to eat, and Sang Made explained the significance of the offering and the family shrines.After we were full to bursting with a delicious lunch, we were surprised and delighted to see Sang Made, Chef Dewi and other family members appear singing \"Happy Birthday\", complete with a gorgeous cake! On our departure we were each presented with a going away gift of the family's home-produced coconut oil and a recipe book containing the recipes of all the foods we had cooked.On the way back to our accommodation, again Sang Made was happy to answer questions and point out places and sights of interest and it was a most pelasant trip. The whole experience was a fantastic way to spend some time in Ubud and I would thoroughly recommend it most heartily to anyone who wishes to enjoy good food, good friends and sterling hospitality."

If you think this is just an ordinary cookery class you are soooo wrong! We've been in Ubud for 5 days and I've learnt much more about Balinese culture from Made in a few hours than in the last 5 days!! Dewa is a great chef, he showed us everything carefully and explained in detail the technique, told us all the alternative ingredients in case we couldn't find them at home and kept asking if we've had any questions.. He's a very passionate and genuine cook:) Made's mum made offerings and we were given sarongs to go to their family temple in the compound where we cooked the meals in the \"clean kitchen\". we were treated so well and got sit down and were served the food we had cooked. It was Enak(delicious)!! All in all this has been a truly Wonderful experience both culinary and culturally, the class of 6 people also meant that we all had the chance to participate in the prep and cooking of all the dishes..I couldn't recommend it enough!"

Dwar the Chef (Sang's brother-in-law) was instantly welcoming and explained what we would be cooking and how the morning would progress. The compound was extremely professional, great facilities with an authentic twist. We chopped, fried, diced and made 8 unbelievable courses. Cool home made juice and bottled water were supplied as we cooked, there was absolutely nothing forgotten.We were shown how the family prepare traditional offerings, and then witnessed Sang's Mother give the offering to bless the food we had just cooked. We then sat like \"Kings\" in a lovely outdoor area, the food is incredible ( and we cooked it, with help of course ), Dwar explained what we could use in Australia if we couldn't get the exact ingredients , which willbe really helpful when we return home. Sang had prepared a small bottle of home made coconut oil and a great recipe booklet for us to take home.
