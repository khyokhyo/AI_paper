Definitely a struggle at first but once you get the hang of it then it gets easier and way more fun!! Laura was awesome at helping us out when we were really stumped but still kept it challenging for us. 10/10 would recommend. Thanks Laura!"

As an escape room it's worked great: the pauzels are complicated and based purely on logic. The only downside is that the background story is kind of detached from the room itself, but it's a very small issue that didn'tT hurt our enjoyment from the game, I would recommend a group of 2-3 people for this room, and it can be sutuble for children who enjoy logic riddles."

Place was easy to access. The English of our staff member was a bit hard to understand during the discussion before the game. Nevertheless the few hints during the game were well formed. The game was entertaining, Mindlabyrinth was 3/5 on difficulty scale and we solved it by 2 quite inexperienced gamers with rather ease. Overall we were satisfied with the experience."

The text message booking was easy and when I asked information on phone they replied after the first ring and they were very friendly. We recieved our picture from the game after couple days. So everything was good. We were in The Real Saw room, the designe was just as a movie the test were really exciting instead of that was the first game for both of us. Nice english speaking staff and the helps were coming in English as well so my friend who doesn't speaks hungarian can enjoy the game too. Niki from the staff helped for us when we were stucked somewhere in the game and we would like to say a huge thank you for her and her collegue (who I really sorry but I forget your name anyway she knows who are you so) thank you for both of you we really appreciate that! That was our first escape room experience and we can highly recommended to everybody your company! We will definitely go back if not for other reason just like to find the snake what you \"lost\"! :) Thank you for everything! :)"

I think we were afraid going into the escape room with it being too easy or too hard, but we found it just the right amount of difficulty for us.

At the end we could solve all problems and could exit the room but it was really good that we could have some hints from the organizer.Some negative: the \"documents\", papers, other staff we have to use to solve the problems - some of them was a bit used, torn, there were writing by other players on them, so it needs to be renewed. This room was challenging and hard but with some cooperation you can solve every single problem!Keep your eyes and mind open and try it out!"

            "review": "Organisation & thought required . We visited here during our trip to Budapest, having already completed a couple of escape rooms elsewhere, and decided to have a go at the Saw room as we knew it would be tricky and we weren't wrong! We were shackled to the wall, on separate sides of the room to one another, with nothing to light the room but a faint glow - which was actually pretty scary and felt really realistic. The room was exactly like the bathroom from the first Saw film and the props were really accurate.A couple of things did let the room down for us though. Having pre-booked the day before online, after ringing them to enquire and being told abruptly to do so, we arrived ten minutes beforehand and they were very surprised to see us. The room wasn't ready and as a result the set up was rushed - the first clue wasn't locked, meaning we got in quite easily, but then had a surplus key which it took us a couple of minutes to figure out where it could possibly go. We were also not given one of the numbered clues we required to solve the room. A more hands on clue that requires using a liquid was not pre-warned and ending up soaking my partner, meaning he had a pretty soggy rest of his game and trek home. The only other disappointment was that we wasted quite a bit of time on a clue in the second room, only to be told over the walky-talky five minutes later that it wasn't part of the game yet and to ignore it. This was extra frustrating as virtually everything else in the room had a \"do not use\" sticker on it if it wasn't part of the game, but this didn't so wasted our time getting out. Overall it's a really scary, interactive game and was very much like the real Saw but the room requires a little bit of work and the team working there need to be more organised."

Unfortunately everything was sold out, but they opened the place a couple of hours early just to allow us to play the \"Secret of Tomb\" room. We weren't dissapointed, the room was just as great as the Armageddon.

We had a brilliant time though - this is a really fun experience that everyone should try! The puzzles were well thought out. Good value too."

Perfect location, a variety of different theme rooms to choose from, very nice game master, good prices. First we visited the Amazon room which we really enjoyed, so we booked the Egyptian and loved it as well. Both rooms had great decors and puzzles. The also gave us discount cards for our second visit. We will definately visit them again in the future. They are a francise, so you can find them in other cities as well."

This room is heavily puzzle based - everything is trying to solve a puzzle so if you like that sort of thing it's the room for you (I note some of the other rooms are more animated or scary). I actually thought it was quite hard. The man gave us clues when we didn't ask (maybe he deemed it necessary) but a lot of the time we struggled to understand what he was trying to tell us and it wasn't that helpful. One of the puzzles relied on just \"knowing something\" which perplexed us a little after (when we asked how you did it). Overall we took 65 minutes so they fact they let us go beyond out allocated 1 hour was nice. Would go back and maybe do another. Great value for money as well - around(12,000 Hungarian forint) \u00a330 a room which I thought was great value for money."

Baring in mind there are two locations, we went to the Trap rooms at Paulay Ede where we did the Egyptian and Amazon rooms. Both are brilliant and get you thinking with lots of creative activities to escape. I would personally recommend the Egyptian room as it was very different to normal escape rooms and very interactive however both were good fun, I only wish we had enough time to do the medieval room too! To Note: the rooms are a lot better value for money than those in the UK!"

On day 2, 5 of us who literally knew each other less than 24hrs decided to attempt a \"Trap puzzle room.\" We were in the Armageddon puzzle room. I loved how it was spread over multiple rooms as I had done a previous one in another country and everything was in one room. This lay out was very impressive and really added to the experience. We managed to complete the puzzle with a little time to spare. Great team building exercise. We feel like the best of friends now thanks to the TRAP puzzle room experience. I highly recommend.

Both experiences were excellent! The booking site is easy to use, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the cost of the games is economical for an hour of fun for five persons! My youngest child was 11 years old, and she could still fully participate in solving the puzzles. The games and puzzles are very clever! Very tricky in fact, but very fun!We visit Budapest often, and we definitely plan on returning to TRAP to try the other two rooms! I highly recommend visiting TRAP while in Budapest!"

And it certainly wasn't our last!Escape Games are really popular in Budapest and you'll find one at every corner. We found TRAP Budapest on the internet and decided that it looked very interesting. We chose the \"Secret of tombs\" adventure, which we can recommend to everybody who doesn't mind getting some goose bumps.On the homepage you can find the different rooms, which TRAP Budapest offers at its two locations. They are rated by difficulty and design. If you play an Escape Game for the first time, it's rather hard to decide which is the optimal difficulty for you. Maybe it would be helpful to integrate some more information about the difficulty on the homepage, for example something like \"suited for beginners\" or \"only for seasoned Players\", etc.We were a little worried, that it would be too difficult for us and that we would be stuck there forever. Luckily, the guy operating the Escape Game was very nice and helpful. Whenever we were stuck in the game, we could just wave at him and he would give us a hint on how to continue. We are two grown-ups who like puzzling, and we found \"Secret of tomb\" challenging in just the right way. We needed about four to five hints to complete the game and sadly didn't make it in time. So, I guess, you could say it's not easy. But it's not frustrating either, because as already mentioned, you can get help if you need to.The Escape Game itself is localized in a small basement, which makes it even creepier. It's amazing to see what these people made out of the little space they had. All in all there are four different rooms belonging to \"Secret of tomb\" and you have to unlock one after the other to find your way out of your little prison. There are so many clues hidden in these rooms, you'll surely never get bored!As already mentioned, the staff is very friendly, helpful and patient. They explain everything to you and you can ask all the questions you like. The price is very fair and well payable, even if you're just a Group of two people, as we were. We really enjoyed ourselves and can recommend this experience to everybody! A must do in Budapest!"

I contacted Trap Budapest via Email a few weeks before our trip and asked about playing in 2 rooms at the same time (we were a group of 11 people). I received a quick and detailed reply and booked the rooms accordingly on the website (very easy).We arrived as planned and played (very easy to find the location) the Medieval room. Our friends played the Egyptian room. We played a few escape rooms in the past and the Medieval room was great. We really liked the fact that solving a puzzle, changes something physical in the room, very cool!We managed to get out in about an hour (didn't have a counter which was a little annoying). Our friends came out of their room at the exact same time. We are a family of 2 adults and 3 girls (14, 12 and 7) and all of us enjoyed the game.The price is also very fair.A few points for improvement:a. Add a display of the time passed (countdown from 60 minutes would be nice).b. Improve the quality of the voice communication with the operator. It was very difficult to hear and understand what he said.c. It would be nice to have a souvenir photo.d. The operator could be nicer\u2026"

We've done only a handful of escape rooms but love them and this was the best one we've ever done and for a very reasonable price. It does get very booked up though so I would recommend booking a good few days or weeks in advance to get a convenient time and date slot that suits you."

Still, my favorite remains Medieval room (the setting is very eye-catching), followed closely by Amazon (very original puzzles) and Armageddon. Although everybody praises the Egyptian room (even the game master tried to persuade us to play Egypt instead of Amazon), I didn't like it as much as their other rooms. Not because it is bad, but because it is a theme that has been done and redone and, after having played more than 100 escape-games, you tend to avoid the common themes. Trust me, though, all of their rooms are worth playing, no matter if you are an experienced escaper or you've just discovered this type of games. All games demand not only logic and attention to details, but also skills and, more importantly, teamwork. Also, all games are available in English and we didn't have any difficulty in communicating with or game master.Great name, by the way. Our Team Raced Against Puzzles and won."

Almost no locks.The riddles themselves are interesting, but in the Egypt room we've felt like they are more physical tasks than actual riddles (Except for 1-2 riddles which required some math and thinking).If you like escape rooms with such riddles, you'll probably love it.The Medival room have some more \"real\" riddles, although still - many tasks.

We have now played 22 escape rooms and this one is my personal favourite. Our team did not enjoy the Amazon room so much, we found it quite frustrating and did not find the host's communications with us very effective. However, our other team really enjoyed that room very much and thought it was one of the best they have done. We took longer than 60 minutes on the Amazon room, but the host left us to finish off the last few puzzles, as they did not seem too worried about timings. He also gave us a discount that we weren't expecting as we had booked more than one room. This place is excellent value for money."

At first, the man saw only 5 of us, said a price, but once the 6th person of our team showed up, he suddenly changed it. Afterwards I checked the price online and regardless of the number of team members, the price was the same.The room itself (Egypt) was nice, though some parts confused us as for example the workers failed to restore the parts previously damaged by a team. Once we got out, we were still confused whether it was over since we had so many things left over unused."

We did the Tomb game early, really enjoyed it so we did Armageddon, which we enjoyed so much we then booked in for Egypt. For a group of friends in their mid thirties to spend three hours doing these games in one weekend probably says more about it than my limited writing ability will.These are really fun games, even with a hangover. Personally I enjoyed Egypt less than the others, there is much less obvious progression to the game; this may just be our group's opinion, as a result of doing the game after a long day so don't be too put off. Have a go, if you've never done games like these before this is a good place to start.You don't need to take anything special, just try and feel as fresh as you can so your brain functions better than mine did. Each game lasts an hour and all are located centrally in Budapest. Go with an open mind, and communicate with each other (it's easy to forget to share some info you have), and you'll have a good time.Enjoy!"

We went to the Paulay Ede venue which has the Egyptian and Medieval rooms as well as the Amazon room which I'd booked for my party of four. Someone else has said the room is small for four people but we didn't find it cramped at all. I was with my adult son and daughter and my son's fiancee and it was the first time any of us had played an escape game. Before leaving us to it the chap who locked us in explained a bit about the different type of padlocks we'd need to find but without giving anything away. To be honest I wasn't much help at all so mostly contented myself with taking photos, although I was able to see a number that seemed to be invisible to the others. The room is monitored by the operator, who speaks excellent English, and if it is obvious you are struggling a bit a hint pops up on the TV screen in the room. Luckily my family were pretty good at it and found the final combination number to open the main door with 8 minutes to spare. We all really loved the game and would probably have tried another room afterwards but had a dinner reservation to go to. Highly recommended."

This was a great room: high level puzzles and clues, great theam, nice effects.But the operator was buisy with other rooms and was not available for our questions. As a result we did not finish on time and he opened the door for us, leaving us with a bitter taste about the room. But I still recommend- this is indeed a unique room, but it requests more opretors during parallel games.Important note: not all of the rooms have microphones! So if the operator is not responding, try another room."

We chose the Armagedon room and we were challenged by a reasonably interesting collection of puzzles. We felt that there were maybe a few too many combination locks, we didn't like the way the hint phone rang with a recorded message every time we hit a particular switch and most annoyingly of all we missed one part for which we were given the hint with five minutes remaining. They should have built the tension and let us try and solve the problem, or given us the clue with 30 seconds to go. As it was we exited with 4 and half minutes left. There were four of us and for this size group it represented good value for money."

A really friendly and welcoming guy on the desk told us we could come back after a couple of hours if we wanted one of the locked room games, or that we could go in to the Armageddon room which was available there and then, so we went with it. 12,000 huf per team of up to 5 people which is a good price for a bigger group, but maybe a little pricey being just the two of us. He spoke good English so instructions were explained well and throughout the game he helps you by telephone and a printer inside the room where he sends hints and clues. Really good fun. He even extended the hour as we couldn't get out in time (although embarrassing for us haha). Some parts were tricky but with hindsight everything was actually fairly logical - I won't go in to detail as it'll spoil the game. If you're in the area and there's a group of you it's definitely worth it, especially if you're looking for a filler in between other activities and plans as it's only an hour or so long."

We had a team of four very diverse people with very diverse skill-sets and they all were very useful: Three monolingual English speakers, one native Hungarian speaker fully fluent in English (as well as functional in several other languages - show-off!) but the language does not matter at all as long as you understand numbers. We had degrees in physics, microbiology, business, and a high school diploma with some college. Hairdresser, software engineer, sales rep, screenwriter/script supervisor. Not one person was more or less useful than any other.I will be back in Budapest in three weeks. I will be back at TRAP. Guaranteed!"

I chose the medieval room - as many people here suggested it as the easiest one and the best one for beginners. The room was well made, we made it and my whole family simply loved it.

When I asked \" no more explanations?\" He replied, \"I've said too much already\". An hour and fifteen very challenging and team building minutes later, with a very few well placed hints we were out, and understood what all the fuss was about.

In a world of smartphone apps and video games, it's great to work with real objects and work together towards a common goal. It was our first escape room experience and we are glad we did it. It's pricey for the room so try and go with more people and split the cost. We met a friend in the city who joined us and we split the cost by 3 instead of 2. And make sure to reserve online! It's easy and you can cancel online and rebook at any time. Don't expect them to be able to serve walk-ins. And be careful: 2 of the rooms are in one location and 2 in the other. Use their website! The tripadvisor page only shows one location address (which was NOT the one for the room we chose [medieval])"

The Egyptian room had some really nice puzzles as well. We also did the forest room that was by far the most difficult one. The layout is less then the other two rooms, but the puzzles are a lot harder!All 3 rooms had their own good part and although it was by far not my first escape room i'd liked them all. Medieval is a good one for starters, the Egyptian room as well, but you don't know if you are on the right track for a long time and the forest room was really a hard one, but more from puzzle to puzzle."

We opted for the Egyptian game and our team comprised Mum, Dad, and our 15 & 13 year old daughters. The venue was easy to find (big signs outside) and the fact that you had to go down the steps into the basement added to the excitement. Our host was friendly, spoke excellent English and very encouraging (especially useful during the game when you occasionally have to plead for a pointer!)The game itself is brilliant funThe biggest challenge was the start when you first enter the room and the door closes behind you and we found ourselves looking around the room thinking 'Well, what do we do?' You literally have to work out what is a puzzle and what you have to do with it. After a while we asked to guidance and after that we were motoring.The great thing is your host is there to help (via a speaker in the room) if you want it. There is no interference if you want to carry on, on your own. We found that there was a good balance of challenges and the girls suited some better and the grown-ups others. We succeeded in getting out in time with no family arguments with a great sense of achievement! SuccessFantastic fun and our only disappointment was that we didn't get chance to go back"

I really enjoyed the two games we have done with this company and will go back to do Armageddon when back. Both games have been fun and authentic.

Obviously you are reading this right now meaning that we did succeed! The puzzle was challenging, but the attendant knew just when we needed a little hint in the right direction. The attendant was very nice and seemed to really love the game. We finished with 7:44 seconds left so we were never under that much stress but I can see how it could get intense if the time was ticking down. The clues you find all flow together but it wasn't always crystal clear which kept it interesting. This room did have a basement which would be tricky for disabled, pregnant or anyone who would have problems squatting pretty low get into. Also remember that Armageddon and the Egyptian are in one location and the other two are in another!"

We had so much fun attempting to save the world because you really become immersed in the game. We actually managed to save the world, but we still found the game challenging enough for our capable group of four. This was our first time doing anything like this and the Armageddon room was definitely a good fist room to start with. Unfortunately we did it on the last day of our trip so we couldn't try any of the other rooms. We had previously looked at doing something like this in other cities and the hour price at TRAP was the lowest of everywhere we saw. Make sure you reserve ahead of time because the slots fill up and it's not to hard to find and is closest to the Kalvin metro stop. Also, don't be worried about language barriers because it is all in English. Would recommend for everyone."

Both were brilliant in their own ways :) Medieval had a lot of more physical puzzles, requiring moving objects into the right place or manipulating various devices. It felt fun and engaging whilst still requiring logic and puzzle-solving. The Egyptian room on the other hand had a lot more logic puzzles, and I personally enjoyed that a lot more. They were cleverly designed too, with no use of numbers (as fits the setting) and lots of use of Egyptian symbols.I was really impressed qith the quality of fittings and decorations in the rooms. The puzzle set-ups were amazing! Lasers triggers, pressure sensors, giant magnets, etc. So cool!I wish I could erase my memories so I could do this again :D"

            "review": "Great fun in Budapest - highly recommend!. My sister and BIL had been to Budapest earlier in the year and had a great time at TRAP and recommended we do it, especially since it was so inexpensive compared to other countries. You pay 12,000 Forint for 2-5 participants...so the more people you have, the per person charge goes down. After my work team did it on Wed night, we enjoyed the challenge so much, 3 of us made reservations again for Friday night and invited 2 Hungarian colleagues (two members of our team had already flown out so weren't available). Each time we did it, they gave us a business card for a 2000 forint discount for the next visit (so net cost of 10,000 forint or $36 USD for our second visit). We gave the two extra cards to our Hungarian colleagues so they could take their friends. It is an game where you're locked in a room and solve puzzles to get access to other rooms and eventually escape. The two games we solved were Secret of the Tomb and Armageddon - both at the Maria Utca location. There are two other games at another location (Egyptian and Medieval). If you're having a lot of difficulty they will give you clues. We had a problem with one of the items in our room and the attendant had to come in and fix it. Overall, we all agreed that we would highly recommend it to others. They give you an hour to solve it...and despite having a very smart group, it took us about 55 minutes the first time and 50 minutes the second time."

She really liked the idea of doing an \"escape room\" type experience, and I just went along with it for her sake. But I was surprised at how much I got into it.We did the Armageddon game room, which is a new one. Apparently only around 20 groups had done that game before we did it. The story is that there's a meteor heading towards Earth, so the participants of the game have 60 minutes to enable and launch a missile to smash the meteor before the Earth is destroyed.I'll try not to give anything away so as not to spoil it for anyone thinking about trying it, but as an experience think Crystal Maze, but with lots of interconnecting puzzles in a room instead of just one. There's an array of puzzles to do which involve some mathematics, some steady hand movements/ skill, and plenty of logical thinking. When doing the puzzle, you are watched by an observing staff member who is able to communicate clues to you via a small printer and later in the game, a phone (don't worry, I didn't give anything away there, he told us at the beginning there'd be a phone :-)The cost is reasonable, at 12000 HUF (around \u00a330) for the room, and you can have up to 5 players at once. We turned up quite late at night and were able to just walk in and play, but it's best to book in advance on the website. We were slightly concerned that the game would be in Hungarian, but we needn't have been as there wasn't much in the way of text, and the clues were given to us in English.It's quite exciting being against the clock, with some very atmospheric music, and is a great way to spend an hour. There's a great feeling of satisfaction on completing it. A highly recommended attraction."

Well, what an absolutely fantastic hour we spent, trying to solve all the puzzles in each room. Think of the TV series the Crystal Maze and you will be quite close. The puzzles were challenging and for us getting to know others on our hen weekend it was a great icebreaker as we all had to work together. We all left wishing we could spend another hour in the other room! Whole heartedly can recommend this activitiy. Its perfect for team building events, like ours and family challenge events but I don't think it would be suitable for very young children or those frightened of the dark."

We escaped with 5 minutes to spare. I really enjoyed this and would definitely do it again! At a set rate per team, it's definitely very affordable for larger groups (up to 5 I believe) but we felt that for the two of us the price was about right too.

We've done several escape rooms in different cities before, and this one was a bit different (for a start you didn't have to 'escape' - instead you had to stop a missile within the time limit). Some of the puzzles were very different to what we've seen before, which was great to see.However, when we booked this we didn't realise it was a new game that very few people had played so far, and there was some refinement needed. We did it as two people (the smallest team so far) and completed the mission quicker than any other team so far (with 20 minutes to spare)! Many of the things in the rooms were not used in the puzzle, and afterward the game master told us these haven't been developed into puzzles yet. I think once these have been incorporated into the game it will be an excellent experience. I only wish we had been aware of how new the game was before we went as we would have picked a different room.The owner was very nice and gave us a discount as we completed it so quickly. He also asked for our feedback and any recommendations to make the experience better - so it's clear they care about developing this room into something great. I'd be really interested to try the other well-established rooms if I went back to Budapest.The price is fixed at 12,000 HUF no matter how many people take part. We're used to paying around \u00a330 per person so this was very cheap to us!"

Our family of three, including a teenager, have become drawn to these escape rooms over the last year or so, and have completed a few in different cities.TRAP is definitely the best so far - much more professional than others, and all very much about applying logic and working things through. We did the Medieval Room first, and then a couple of days later did the Egyptian Room. For us, this was definitely the right order as we found the Egyptian Room much more difficult. These two rooms are in a basement on Paulay Ede Utca, which is easy to find. The set-up is friendly but business like - we dealt with two different members of staff on our two visits and both were exceptionally helpful.Not going to lie - we did need nudging in the right direction on a couple of occasions, but that help was given in a way where we weren't provided with the answer, rather that questions were asked which made us see what we'd missed, so we were able to still feel lots of satisfaction when we finished.Make sure you go with people who like to be a team - you really need to be able to work together. You'll love it!!!!!!!Tip: Tell them if you're planning on going back to do a second room - they'll give you a discount card for 2000 forints (app. \u00a35) off....every little helps!"

Think Crystal maze. This time we didn't make it out in the 60 minutes alotted, so I write this review from inside having been trapped for 2 days now. In all seriousness these are good fun but can be a test of a relationship. I recommend going in a group to this particular escape room as it required some maths skills which both my partner and I struggle with under pressure.Still fun and worth the time and money as its different to anything else out there."

A lot of red herrings, so it is east to discount a real clue - fortunately the camera observing guy offered a few small clues at just the right time, so we got to the bomb with seconds to spare when one of us had a brainwave and typed in the right codeword! It was exciting, great fun and since we managed it, gave a good sense of achievement. We were lucky there was nobody waiting so we were allowed to go just a few minutes over the hour as we were so near to solving the final puzzle. I recommend it to almost everyone!"

Admittedly it took us a while to get the hang of things but after a while we got stuck in and had a blast.We only needed a few hints throughout the same, a lot of it was skill and sheer luck but we managed to get out in the time limit with seconds to spare!It's a fun and challenging game, a lot of red herrings to put you off and make you over-analyse the place, but it's all part of the fun. I'd definitely go back again just to play in more of these rooms as the price was very cheap to play for the experience you get :)"

We did the medieval room.If you have time, i suggest to go through both rooms. If you are riddles lovers, It is highly recommended."

The game was to disable a bomb in 60 minutes, finding clues and performing tasks in the correct order. With four in our team , thirty minutes just flew by; urgency was of the essence but we were starting to get the hang of the designers mindset after a couple of prompts from the organiser who plots your progress on cctv .Once we had disabled the bomb our second task was to decipher clues to enable us to leave the room , in total the game took a extremely enjoyable 90 minutes and at \u00a320 for a team of four was great value for our money.Due to being a group of four, We spent quite a bit of time in the bar afterwards working out the order of the clues , who had found what and how we had completed the tasks.Well done Trap for a great afternoon !"

There is help on hand if you get stuck but so long as you remember that pretty much everything is there for a reason you should be able to get on okay. It was really good to do something different. The price you pay is per team so the more you have the better value it is. They also give you a special price if you want to come back and complete one of the other rooms. Just a note of warning that it is built into the basement level so the wooden steps go down into the building and are a little steep if you struggle with stairs. Really good fun though."

We booked quite last minute online and had good communication via email to confirm our booking. Staff were friendly and helpful and helped when needed without giving the game away to easily.We did the medical room first which took us the full hour and then had that much fun we decided to come back the next day and do the Egyptian room which we found more challenging. We would defiantly recommend to others and would go back to do the others and plan on visiting a similar escape place here in the uk shortly. "

While spending Thanksgiving in Budapest, my wife, our 15 year-old son, and I visited TRAP - Team Race Against Puzzles, and had a really great time! We attempted The Secret Of the Tomb at the Maria Utca location. Peter, our host, was very polite, friendly, and thorough; the establishment itself was clean and well cared-for. The puzzle room presented just the right amount of challenges for the hour-long quest, and each element of the puzzle called for different types of skill and reasoning. In the end, with a little bit of help from the voice in the wall (Peter), we escaped with just 30 seconds on the clock. Because of the way the puzzles were built, each one of us had ample opportunity to contribute to our escape, and we all had a blast! As proof, we are here for just three days, and have already made plans to back again before we leave, to try our hands at another puzzle room... perhaps the Bomb Room. Enjoy and Good Luck!NOTES: Great for families and small groups of friends. Peter mentioned that businesses bring employees here for team-building - what a great idea! There is some low-ceiling duck/watch your head area, but for the most part, any reasonably mobile child or adult should have no problems."

We had to use a mobile phone to give light and use the calculator, so an improvement would be these items to find in the room. The guy running it was very nice, but when we did Claustrophilia(also on Trip advisor), it was much more sinister because you let yourself into the flat and see no one, the clock starts on it's own and you have no interaction unless you press the help button.

Rudi was a fab guide though & reassured us that he was on hand if we needed him. Thankfully we didn't need him much- just one clue and we managed to solve the rest! The room was so entertaining- such a wide variety of challenges and puzzles to work out. I would REALLY encourage you to have a go. One thing I would suggest that would get more repeat business from me, have a discount if there are just one couple playing. We loved it but can't really justify the price for doing another room because the price is aimed at a group of 4 or 5 really.Thanks for an entertaining hour though!"

With a very good location and affordable prices the place is a \"must go\" for the fans of the game. Also very interesting for those who are looking for new experiences spending time with math, logic games.The Staff, in our case just a guy, which unfortunately I cannot remember the name, was extremely nice with us. When you get stuck in any part of the puzzle, he can give you hints, however not solving the problems for you, just in case that's what you want.I recommend you to make a reservation at their website, especially because the timetable isn't so wide and the demand is quite big. In our case we had a bit of lucky regarding availability. We have made the reservation for the Medieval puzzle but after this one we were so excited and we ended doing the Egypt as well."

Having never tried a room escape style game before, despite having seen them rated highly on Tripadvisor in almost every other European city we've visited whilst interrailing, it felt like Budapest was finally the place to try it.My brother and I arrived 20 minutes early for our booked appointment, for alledgedly the hardest room - The Bomb Room. As the room was already set up, the guy running it let us in straight away to get started. With some occasional tips from the guy outside through speakers, we managed to disarm the bomb and escape the room in just under an hour - I have to say, without some external tips, there is no way we could have possibly finished that particular escape game in less than a few hours.For 12000HUF (around \u00a330) for a team of 2-5 people, I think it's an incredibly unusual and exciting experience that is more than worth it, even if you are only trying it out with a group of 2 like my brother and I. Upon escaping and before leaving, we were presented with a voucher knocking the price down to 10000HUF if we wanted to come back and try another room. I have to say, I'm very tempted to go back again tomorrow!All in all, TRAP is conveniently placed near the centre, the chap running it was both very accommodating and helpful, it's an unusual experience if you haven't played a room escape game before and I would highly recommend anyone in the area to give it a go.I'll certainly be trying out more room escape games in the future, after my first experience with TRAP."

This popped up on Trip Advisor and had a bunch of great reviews. I must say they are well deserved. However, I must say that this would not be for everyone. If you are a puzzle solver you are going to adore this place. Or, if you are with a few friends, it is really fun to work as a team to solve your way out of the rooms. We were 3 people. We didn't quite know what to expect and I think they intentionally don't give you too much info. Once you get the hang of it, you start to become aware of everything in the room. Actually, even after we left TRAP we were still doing it with everything outside. If you like a mental challenge, by all means give this unique game a try. As a tip, they are located in various venues around the city. When they email you the confirm, check the address you go to. The different rooms are located in different parts of the city. We got out in about 1 hour with 2 hints through the walkie talkie. Have fun!"

And like most were kicking ourselves in the but afterwards for not having escaped sooner. Using clues in various rooms you race against the clock (1 hr) to find the escape code for the door. There are two challenges to choose from. However...Book in advance and arrive on time. Spaces fill and you don't want to make the next group late for their reservation. We were a group of six. Big mistake yes the game was still challenging however with six people it was \" too many cooks in the kitchen\" type of deal. Try and stick to the recommended group number of 4- 5 persons. Keep on mind the rooms are improved upon, challenges are made harder, clues are altered based on participant feedback... I wouldn't say that you could repeat a challenge because they don't alter the rooms enough to make them a totally new game...Just go! You won't regret it."

The employee was helpful with hints when we got stuck, and took pictures with us at the end. So, this part of the review is a 5-star. Actually, we liked it so much, we booked another session. This next part of the review is a 1-star. Not only did the employee (at the Paulay Ede location) never show up, we didn't get any notification (email, text, etc.) what was going on. So, we waited in the rain for 45 minutes, then left. Very disappointing. Two days later, I got an email apologizing that the employee had a bike accident. They offered a free TRAP session and a bottle of champagne the next time we're in Budapest. I get that life is unpredictable, and no hard feelings. But, improved communication would help. Bottom line: I would book TRAP again, but also hope that TRAP figures some way of ensuring the doors open on time."

Both of the games turned out to be sufficiently challenging and really well put together, with different types of activity/clues/puzzles to get through, some getting a bit physical! And, if you do get stuck, the nice chap gives you little hints, which is great for avoiding frustration and keeps it moving.I think it is a very good sign that we all went to a bar after and proceeded to chat about our game to the other team for ages, having a right old laugh at ourselves, going through the clues and what we got stuck on, and what we nailed - it was great fun. We almost went and booked to do the other two games the next day but ran out of time.Definitely recommend it as something different to do in Budapest!"

We found the puzzles in the dungeon to be somewhat challenging, and had to get a few hints from the nice man who ran the place. I found the diversity of the puzzles to be very impressive, and some required coordination and physical skill rather than just the mind. Since there was no group directly after us, the man was kind enough to afford us a little bit of extra time so that we could finish the challenge.We had a fantastic time at TRAP, and it was a nice change from sightseeing in busy tourist areas.

We split into 2 teams and had a great time trying to make sure we were the first group to beat the game. We found the games perfectly paced; just as you felt you were stuck we would find some small clue that helped us progress to the next set of challenges. I imagine the activity is more fun with groups of 3+, but we had a really excellent time. The location is about 20-30 minutes walk from the river/central square and we managed to visit a number of the cities famous ruin bars on the way back to our accomodation. Having never experience anything like this before I would highly recommend it."

You're given 1 hour to find and solve a series of clues, puzzles, and brain teasers in order to 'defuse' the bomb and escape from the room. I would recommend this place to any travelers looking for a new and different experience to have with friends and family. For the Bomb room, I would suggest having at least 3 people in your party, as one of the tasks would be nearly impossible without at least 3. Inside TRAP, you really get to see how quickly you can work and you have to learn how to work together as a team to solve the clues. It was a blast and I'll definitely try another room the next time I'm in Budapest."

Pure tourist trap ripping 12000 forint (~40?) out of your pocket for one our puzzles which uses both magnets, electricity and other modern methods to solve the puzzles. Much of it is a pure ripoff of the Claustrophilia puzzle which I find tragic.. The last door also uses a codeboard (like in ATM's) which collides with the whole medievil feeling of the room. You dont feel trapped at all actually..Try Claustrophilia - half the price and the real deal instead."

We went early in the morning, the guide said that since we were the first ones we could take our time if we needed longer than the standard hour to complete the challenge. He was very friendly, spoke English well, and explained everything clearly.We choose to do the Egypt themed room, I believe the other was a Medieval setting. The rooms themselves were very fun to navigate through. There are no instructions at all which is a bit daunting, but if you are a fan of puzzles or certain types of video games (think Legend of Zelda or Lara Croft) you can pick up clues from symbols and objects hidden around the room and inside of locked doors or chests.There were a couple of times that we were pretty stumped about exactly what to do next. The guide was able to watch us via security cameras in the room and communicate through a PA system. He didn't tell us what to do, but gave vague hints that were just enough to put us in the right direction. We ended up finishing the entire thing in 55 minutes which really impressed the guide since it was just the two of us. He sais that most groups of four or more struggle to finish on time.Overall this was a great experience. I'm happy we checked it out because there is nothing like it in the US yet. If you go be sure to think outside of the box and most importantly do not get frustrated at the game or your group!"

We left the bomb game after having an incredible amount of fun, giggles and feeling a sense of achievement. We were surprised at how well we worked together and complimented each other as a team and (perhaps with a few handy clues from staff) we managed to diffuse the bomb within our allotted time. It was a very cleverly, quirkily put together and I would recommend to anyone who fancies a different kind of experience. If I am ever in Budapest again I would 100% return to play the other games. Our only slight criticism is the price. For 2 persons it was very pricey for one hour in a room with second hand charity furniture. They must make a killing on profit in this business. I think it should be paid by person rather than per game, to make it fairer, or at least buy one game get the next half price as there was no way we could have afforded to fork out for another game. Or at least there should have been some kind of incentive to completing before the end, such as a 10% refund perhaps."

It is downstairs in a damp and dusty cellar, so be warned about that. The host is very nice and speaks English well. The game is a lot of fun and more involved and longer than I thought. You will feel a little slow at first but after you catch on and get comfortable it gets easier. If you really get stuck the host will give you hints(He is watching and by camera and listening to you the whole time). It is a great way to spend an hour or two with friends and family.

The rooms/tasks are well built, the challenges require a lot of thinking, the staff is great, so the altogether experience is: FUN.

We were on stop 4 of 5 cities through Europe and needed a diversion from the normal sightseeing agenda. We were fortunate to get a spot in Secret of the Tomb and had a blast working out the puzzles. I suppose that someone who is claustrophobic might feel a little uneasy, but none of us felt that way. There is a fair bit of logic and some lateral thinking involved. We were able to get out in about 50 minutes."

The guy was brilliant and explained what was required. We opted for the tomb and had a fantastic time (arguing mostly) over the clues and their meanings. You have to work together and think outside the box at all times but it is constantly entertaining and you actually never know when it will finish. I suspect that younger people will have more capacity for this kind of game but do not let this put you off trying. We were given a fair bit of help AND a load of extra time but still felt a sense of achievement and have talked of little else since. I suspect that the guy helping us via audio and cctv must have felt that he was watching his parents bumbling around a strange planet and I hope that entertained him as much as the trap entertained us. Perhaps 4 minds would be better than 2 but we would not hesitate to go back and try a different game. Thank you to everyone that reviewed trap as without you we would have missed this gem."

Each puzzle you complete will give clues onto what is next, and you will work through multiple rooms before you can finally leave!You have an hour to finish the puzzle, which makes it a nail-biting race against time.The entire experience was fantastic, the staff were really friendly and made us feel very welcome.

There are very few things to solve and most of the time is spent doing the same action over and over, so it's a bit repetitive.The atmosphere is nothing special, everything reminds you that you are in a custom-built room with custom-built furniture and you're playing this sort of fake game. When we played Claustrophilia, instead, we really felt like we were in someone's \"authentic\" apartment and got really immersed in the game.Considering that for a couple Claustrophilia costs half than TRAP, I would highly recommend choosing that instead."

By this I mean you really need to do each clue in order,so you really only need 2 people to play this game, being the third person I often found their was not much input I could have. In other escape games, for example clastophilia, there was plently of different things to do all at the same time so was easier for three to all be engaged. Having said that we all had a great time and I would highly recommend trap."

Groups of all sorts will love this multi-dimensional game that allows individual strengths to be put to good use. You bond as a team and build momentum towards solving the puzzle and escaping. We had the hardest trap and indeed needed a couple of helpful clues from the \"overseer\" who watches your progress via security camera. We finished just on the hour--totally thrilled by our ultimate success. Makes for a great evening. Don't miss this very cool attraction in Budapest!"

Both rooms are challenging but possible and we escaped them in the allotted time.

When we arrived, the owner/worker was a bit awkward and did not really know what to say. He told us very little and locked us in the room. Without giving anything away, I think a clearer explanation would have helped start the game. Then, throughout the game, he was confused about what steps we had already figured out and gave us clues to steps we had already finished. Finally, he wasn\u00b4t paying attention at the end, to let us out once we had solved the puzzle. We kept attempting the final step, and after several tries the door popped open and he said we had won. It was a bit anti-climactic in my opinion."

I'm quite claustrophobic so I was a little wary of what was going to happen, but as soon as the door closed on us, I forgot about everything and just wanted to find our way out and got well in to the spirit of puzzle solving.The whole experience was amazing and really well planned and thought out.Thankfully, we found our way out after 54 mins and the best time was 46 mins so you do get your monies worth!The whole party had a brilliant experience and wished we could do it all over again.I would recommend this to anyone who visits Budapest,It was one of the best activities I've ever done!!"

We were a little worried that it may be too simple as we are both keen puzzlers and thought it may be designed for kids. However, the difficulty is spot-on. With an hour to get out you will definitely be pressed for time - in fact we didn't quite make it. The owner will give you clues if you get really stuck, but he has clearly thought about how to word them without giving too much away.The puzzles were excellently designed, testing various skills (logic puzzles, physical games, riddles and more). There are also a lot of red herrings in the room - purely serving as a distraction, but simultaneously adding to the complexity and overall experience.After we left, we couldn't stop talking about it. If we had more time in Budapest I have no doubt we would've also taken a stab at room 2. It isn't a particularly cheap attraction, especially if you go as a couple. However, please don't let this put you off. It is a truly unique experience that really shouldn't be missed."

Good way to kill an hour though I guess. I think I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't so expensive. The price is the same for the activity as a whole, so the more of you there are the cheaper it is. Since there were only two of us, I left feeling a bit ripped off to be honest."

If you have played any kind of adventure/room escape video game in your life or you like putting your intelligence to test, this is the ultimate deal. The game is for teams of min 2 max 5 people. Me and my best friend were thrilled to try this after reading the reviews. We did the first stage and we couldn't resist and did the second stage the next day. The best decision we have made. The second stage was longer and more challenging. We solved both in time. Asking for less hints in the second one. I would suggest doing the first level first to get acquainted with the concept, then trying the second one with less hints.There are a lot of distractions and things to be occupied with, so for a team of 2 its hard to do it in 1 hour. I guess 3-4 people would be best for this.Both stages have riddles that needs codes, keys, practical use of physics, some maths, a lot of thinking out of the box, speed, concentration and communication. This is the ultimate team building exercice and is the best game(real and video) me and my buddy have played so far. The owner is a genius and a great guy! Thanks for everything and we will come back for the future stages you will design.Greetings from Istanbul ;)"

It is in a very tiny and cramped dungeon with some obvious air quality issues, and this is the only reason I'm taking off one star. However, one could say that it adds to the atmosphere of the game :-)The TRAP game is all about solving a series of very creative puzzles to diffuse a time-bomb and escape. The puzzles come in all varieties, some of them may look familiar and others could totally stump you. There was one cryptogram which I couldn't decipher, but my 9-year-old immediately identified it as a standard math puzzle that she does in school :-)Be prepared for things to get very exciting, because one hour is not a lot of time, and there are a number of puzzles, and if you haven't seen a puzzle before it could stump you for precious tens of minutes. However, the person running the place does speak into the microphone and help if you are obviously stuck.At the end of the game, we were all thrilled and exhilarated, we will do the next puzzle when we visit Budapest again."

You literally go into a room have the door closed behind you and start looking for clues. To what?! We looked for a minute or so and then one of us noticed the start point - very clever.It's a basic set up, but so clever and totally enough to keep adrenaline pumping, you are so buzzed up to find the next puzzle. The whole team loved it (4 friends) and everyone was needed to play their part - whether you are blessed with lightning reflexes, brains, brawn or a logical mind you all need to add something to mix to fly through it.We diffused the bomb with 20 minutes to spare - and loved it so much did the next room too.Costs about \u00a330 per team in the room, well worth it for an hours entertainment. We talked about it for ages afterwards over a cold beer, and just wished there was more of them round the world, we would be booking in...So if you have an hour to fill this is a great place to go and test yourself and play as a team.

I did Trap 2 - I don't want to give anything away, but we were immersed into a room with codes and numbers splashed everywhere, and with various objects littered across the room. After exploring the room for clues, we were faced with several puzzles and challenges leading from one to the next, all of which eventually leads you to the end result (if you get that far!) of getting the code to exit the room.Thankfully, we were successful at escaping the room and the other team were successful at de-activating the bomb, but easy it wasn't. If having trouble or getting stuck, the host will give you nudges without giving the game away. Your ability to communicate, work as a team, think outside the box and discern valuable information from useless information will be tested.You might think 12,000HUF for an hour game is expensive, but it is totally worth it for an experience that is something completely different."

We walked down a backstreet of Budapest not quite knowing what to expect when we came across an innocuous staircase down to a basement.We were made to feel very welcome by our host who took us through the basics of the game. We were a party of 8 who split in to groups of 4 each on doing trap 1 and the other Trap 2. I was on the team that did trap 1 where the overall objective was to deactivate a time bomb within an hour.The puzzles that we encountered were very challenging but we found if we worked as a team it was possible to progress through the game. I can happily say that we managed to De activate the time bomb and our friends in trap 2 successfully manage to escape.I would recommend this to anyone visiting Budapest and hopefully Berlin (When TRAP Berlin opens!). In fact have gone as far as to plan a trip to Berlin just to visit!!"

One warning: The game is located on a somewhat residential street so I would recommend taking a cab. Our taxi driver looked at us funny when we asked to be dropped at the address but it was there with \"TRAP\" written on the door. When we went in, the gentleman working the rooms was very accommodating. He looked disappointed that we didn't have reservations (so, make them in advance) but was able to get us in within a half hour. They kindly ask that you wait outside so that you don't get any clues. We were then locked in a room and given an hour to find and deactivate a \"bomb\" and then escape. I was worried about the language barrier but everything is in English and you don't actually need language. The game uses a lot of symbols and numbers. Anyway, we got stuck a few times but the host of the game gave us hints without giving away answers. We made it out with literally :56 seconds left. It was exhiliarating. Don't be swayed by the cost of 12,000 HUF per team. Totally worth the experience."

It is not advertised well, but thanks to my fellow TripAdvisors, I knew to book this in advance. On arrival the rules were explained, and without any wait time, we were quickly locked into a small room. The puzzles were tricky and extremely engaging. There were only two of us and at least two people are required to solve the puzzles. The puzzles were all unique and required some brain power. When we were stuck for a few minutes, help from a few clues was quickly offered. Although we were able to complete the 'quest', we ran out of time to figure our way out. The only disappointment was not being able to complete the activity in the one hour time frame. Instantly as we walked out, we were already considering coming back to complete the second room."

TRAP is a fascinating fun teambuilding type experience where as a team you try to decipher clues to solve puzzles and either escape from a 4 room maze or disarm a suitcase bomb.I think my kids 17, 16 and 8 would probably say this was the highlight of the trip. The price is fair and costs about $55 per room for an hour. It is incredibly well conceived and challenging. If you are comfortable doing something a little different, TRAP is for you."

Is it because we are 15 minutes early? We don't mind waiting.. But he was like No, you can't go in. He was highly evasive about it until upon further pushing did he admit that he let another group in. Then what was the reservation online for? He was not apologetic about making us make a wasted trip at all, and whilst smoking, just kept telling us you can't go in. He made half hearted efforts by offering us slots 5-6 hours after the slot we booked for, which completely defeat the purpose of a reservation! They obviously don't care about online reservations, and only want to maximise profits by entertaining walk-in despite the time clashing with reserved slots. No integrity in doing business at all and Worst customer service ever. TRAP completely spoilt our holiday. Don't visit it!"

After reading previous reviews we were thinking of trying to find two others to join us, however in the end I'm glad it was just the two of us. In fact, we enjoyed the challenge of trap two so much that we went back in the afternoon to complete trap one. Some of the puzzles are really challenging and force you to think outside the square, whilst others can be solved through a logical process. We would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Budapest!!!"

We played Trap 2, where the main task is to deactivate the bomb, but to fulfill this task you have to solve numerous riddles and problems.

Tips: It would be more fun in groups bigger than two. Wear something you're okay with getting a little dirty as you might have to crawl or get on your knees so your pants might get a little dusty.

What I will do is say that having visited TRAP it was the single most enjoyable activity of my trip to Budapest and since returning home I have booked up the equivalent in London. Having read what little information was available on-line me and my girlfriend had very little idea of what to expect really. This was absolutely no hindrance to the level of enjoyment we experienced. What I would say is as a team of (2) we realised that an extra person or even (2) more would have been very welcome. Some things you simply will require a little help from the controllers if you lack the knowledge. However, that said almost everything is solvable from clues within the rooms or from applying your mind outside of the box. I would describe the overall experience as both incredibly stimulating and exciting at the same time. It brings out a sense of competition and team building with you needing to work in unison with your team at the same time as being open to allowing everyone a chance to put their thoughts on the puzzles in the open. Having completed the first puzzle we immediately booked to return the next day to complete the 2nd room. We enjoyed it thoroughly despite running out of time and not escaping, whereas the 1st room we managed to escape albeit we did receive some help, being complete novices to this type of experience. I believe the cost was around \u00a312 each however, I really am not 100% on that as it was paid for in Hungarian Florints and we didn't hesitate to pay what was asked. Also I am unsure as to whether the cost was per person or per room. I think this would be suitable for almost any traveller, whether you are a young couple, an elderly couple an adult family unit with teenagers etc. However, this is probably not suitable for children due to the thought processes utilised, however, perhaps a childs mind would be of benefit. Happy escaping!"

Not very obvious from the road, but just follow the address and you won't have much problems finding it. They have 2 puzzle rooms currently and my husband and I had a great time in both TRAP 1 and TRAP 2. Basically you have to solve the puzzles as a team by looking for clues (physical, mental) within the given time. TRAP 1 is to find the password to the bomb before it detonates. TRAP 2 is to find the code to get out of the room before time is up. We went as a couple, manage to solve both puzzles with the help of the crew who gave additional clues if they sense us getting stuck at a particular point for longer than usual. I think it will probably be even more fun to go as a bigger group.It's a very unique experience in all, somewhat like the flash-based Crimson Room game (created by Toshimitsu Takagi in 2004) but more awesome as you can play in REAL LIFE! We've had a good variety of puzzles, some are even quite challenging. Won't go into the details coz I don't want to spoil the fun but it's great for everyone in the family. The way the guys design the puzzles are really quite creative!Yes, it's not your standard tourist attraction (museum, cathedral, river cruise, etc) but it will definitely guarantee a great time out with friends or family. I hope they will create more rooms soon, can't wait to try more puzzles from TRAP! Our weekend trip to Budapest was a lot more interesting because of TRAP. Highly recommended. Do not miss!!!!Some tips:- Cash payment only.- Book in advance - they do get very busy in the weekend.- As you have a booking schedule to meet, do allow more travelling time to tram + walk over as budapest is a big city and it takes time to get around"

We made the reservation on the webpage for one of the rooms (room one).The guy in the lobby just said that we could start whenever, even though we were 15 min early. We entered a strange room with a lot of things and the door closed behind us.In one hour we were supposed to disarm a bomb in a suitcase and get out (I won't reveal anymore). We had such fun!! The puzzle was quite hard, but since our every move was watched by the personal outside we got small hints anytime we were stuck or very off target.After completing room one, we just wanted MORE so we ended up doing room 2 as well!This was 2 hours of complete fun, and If there would have been more rooms to do we would have done them as well!Everyone in our group found it to be very fun regardless of age and gender.Unfortunately you can only do this once since you will know the solutions, but I will keep an eye on the place (if they ever make another room, I will go again :)I think this is a perfect thing to do with your family or close friends, but it could also work as something you could do with your co-workers as a team-event.I think you need to be at least 10 or something to understand some of the puzzles, but If I was here with my parents as a kid I would probably have loved it anyway (if my parents managed to solve the puzzles for me :).Conclusion - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

This means there are two different rooms you can play with your friends. For both rooms you\u2019ll have 55 minutes to finish. Me and my friends played both rooms, and failed with room 2 completely. Don\u2019t think TRAP is something easy, your brains will be triggered. The room 1 we succeeded and we can now proudly say we survived TRAP! Unless we were not able to finish both rooms, playing them filled a big part of our day with a lot of fun. I can\u2019t say much more about the rooms, because I would spill too many secrets you don\u2019t want to know yet. TRAP can be found near the centrum of the city. The closest metro station is K\u00e1lvin t\u00e9r on the M3, from there it\u2019s about a 10-minutes\u2019 walk. You can also take tram 4 or 6, from tram station Harminckettesek tere it\u2019s only a few minutes\u2019 walk. Just type in the address on Google Maps and the location will match exactly. There is no big sign at the entrance, but you\u2019ll recognise it by a poster at the entrance door.The guys that run this place are very friendly. One of them speaks good English, so that\u2019s no problem for tourists. Their website is also available in English. On this website you can make a reservation for the room(s) you want, so you will be sure you can play at the moment you want. It\u2019s not the cheapest attraction in Budapest, but worth every cent. And in the cold months of the year, it\u2019s also great that the attraction is warm inside. So if you want to do something unique and thrilling in Budapest, going to TRAP is a must!"

We live outside NYC and had heard about places like this before. We only had 3 days in Budapest, and were trying to make the most out of our time. Teenagers can only go to so many churches and museums, so we decided to try something different. The woman who greeted us was lovely and we found out later that her brother and her designed the rooms themselves. As first-timers, we did the prison room, which is supposed to be the easiest out of the 3 rooms. Time limit was 1hr and the fastest finisher did it in 24min.... We took the entire time, but eventually figured it out. It was so intricate, and had a great storyline, the entire family left gushing about it.Highly recommend for everyone to try this!! I think families with kids over 13, friends, and anyone else would absolutely love this."

The guy that works there was ok when we came, he put us into room with not much talk with us. But ok. The room itself is quite hard, the task are heavy, but callenging, quite good. The game last 90 minutes. We had one light (the other one not working) and it's hard to move with one light. One task was set in one direction, but it was not working, so we had solution on paper, done. You can ask for hint by knocking on the door?! So we knocked...and knocked...and knocked harder...I wanted to get out but there is no Panic button? So we knocked more...and in that point you get really frustrated! The team that was waiting in a lobby came to door to tell us that there is no one there, that guy went to clean the others rooms??So if I'm paying you to monitor the game, you need to monitor us! What if something bad happened inside? And there is no one there to let you out? What about the fire? So you lock people without panic button? I played so many games, but never saw that!!After 4 minutes of knocking, guy talked to us, giving us hint to move on. When we came out, there was no one there! So we could just walk out? One guy running 3 rooms? No service at all. After I told him about hint and lamp and knocking he was not so interested about that issue. He gave us a small, too small discount but that didn't fix the feeling we were robbed. No good by, no thank you, no taking pictures, he just walked away. I would even give you a lower grade but the game itself is pulling you up."

It's somewhat of a 'cult' favorite amongst escape game enthusiasts all over Europe. Allegedly the 'most difficult game' in Budapest.We are very experienced gamers (30+ at this point) and the White Room at Gozsdu Mission is still one of our favorite escape rooms, period. Without giving anything away, the premise is- you (+ your team) are placed in a 'barren', white room with a single key hanging from the ceiling and you have 90 minutes to escape. It's incredible.The game has a linear methodology, but is very challenging with extremely unique puzzles. (They don't allot you 90 min. for nothing)"

            "review": "Mediocre game with terrible game operator. Let me start with the fact that I am an experienced room escaper (30+ rooms so far) so I have experienced quite a few of them to compare.The experience started off well. We arrived on time and were shown to our room (prison cell), where we received a very basic explanation. I actually appreciated the lack of rules as we mentioned that we have been to other rooms. But the lack of story was a bit off putting. (As neither the room did unfold too much of a story)Minor spoiler: Be aware that you are handcuffed together in the beginning of the game, which is not mentioned on their website.The design of the room is actually quite good, it gives you the feeling of a prison cell. The props on the other hand are very basic, mostly laminated papers with instructions on them. Props are also quite worn, dirty of human grease and used.The puzzles are mostly nothing special, doesn't need much thinking either, and some of them have too big logical leaps There was only one puzzle I liked a lot, around mid game. Most objects you use for the puzzles are not sitting in the storyline either, or have no real meaning why they are in a prison cell. They are just there so you can have an escape room.Up until around mid game I was between 3/4 stars, but that was the point we received our first help from our operator. First of all it wasn't the same person who has shown us to the room, which wouldn't have been a problem if we were warned ahead. And secondly, he clearly had no idea how far we are in the game, so he had to ask us questions first (wasting our precious time) what we have found so far and what have we done. This repeatedly happened throughout the rest of the mission. When we got stuck, he asked us how far we are, and gave us pretty direct instructions what to do. There goes the satisfaction of figuring out the puzzle for yourself... At this point I was at 3 starNow, in the last 5 minutes, our operator wasn't paying full attention, and although we did great throughout most of the mission, his lack of focus on our final minutes cost us a successful escape. We still made it in the next 40 seconds overtime and escaped, and then I learned why he had no clue about our progress. He wasn't paying attention to our game at all, he was actually dealing with payment of another team.Also when we escaped no one greeted us at the door, no photo no chit-chat. We high fived, and celebrated for a minute, (we were a team of two btw.) and then waited a good 2 minutes hoping that someone will pick us up and chat us through our experience. But the operator was dealing with another team, and the other operator was resetting a room. So we finally grabbed our coats, paid and left.The room was 9000 HUF which is extremely expensive for 2ppl (this room was advertised for 2-4 ppl) especially considering the experience you get. (The operator is running 3 games at a time.) At this point they were clearly between 1/2 stars. I'll give this a 2 as the room set-up was nice, and there were a few enjoyable puzzles which saves them from a 1 star review.Might be an okay/good experience for first timers, but avoid if you are looking for a great experience, and a good service where they actually care about your escape."

We enjoyed this escape room and found the guy running it to be friendly but having only one person manning both the rooms and front desk is a bit problematic. I held off on asking for help for as long as possible but when we did really need help about 30mins in, he must have been farewelling another team - in all, we probably waited 5 mins for help. It doesn't sound very long but when you're really stuck and know you have an hour, it kind of adds frustration to frustration. A second person to check people in and out would go a long way to streamlining the experience."

We've never done a 90 minute room before so naturally wanted to do it. The guy said its for groups of 4 or more, but we wore him down and convinced him we could do it! I won't spoil the room, but it was absolutely incredible. Without a doubt, the hardest room I've ever done. It's based more on solving a series of puzzles rather than following a puzzle \"storyline\", so you can do different tasks at the same time. This was really hard with 2 people, but we managed it!It's hard to find an escape room that remains challenging when you've done a lot already - rest assured, this is difficult!"

In some part we had just to sit 10 minutes untill the operator notices we have some trouble and offered us a hint.One of the missions asked us to do 2 different things in 2 different rooms but with no written guideness. We were expected to guess what to do.After having fun in more than 4 rooms in Budapest and more than 30 worldwide, I can say this experiense do not worth the prise(or the rediculus demand for a deposit)."

Very logical, and great set-up. The game was a bit to the easy side (we solved it in only 38 minutes without hints), but challenging and great fun. The game master was very nice, and during the game he asked if we wanted help or not, which is good, because it's annoying to be given clues before they are really needed. We can warmly recommend this game."

I usually don't write bad reviews however after being in over 50 escape games around the world this has got to be one of the worst experiences I've had. We played the room \"The Serial Killer\", the room itself is average, and has pretty basic puzzles. However it's advertised as medium level so I guess it's ok.One puzzle had us stuck for about 15 minutes. Any attempt to call for the game master for help didn't work. We tried waving at the cameras, shouting, in the end we knocked loudly on the door and that worked. After a few minutes we then tried calling him again but no response.All in all we wasted about 20 minutes basically looking at the wall, shouting and waving. This was very frustrating. At the end we decided to just quit the room in the middle, we've never done such a thing before. After some convincing we went back in and finished the game.Bottom line, the room is pretty average but the game master kind of ruined the experience for us by not being attentive to our progress."

Myself and two friends took part in the bank job task at locked while in Budapest for a long weekend as we wanted to do something a bit different and had heard they were great fun! It was our first ever time doing this kind of thing and although we didn't complete it, we had a great time trying! If you are taking part in an escape room game for the first time I suggest you try one of the easier simulations as the bank job one was a bit trickier but it was the only time that worked for our schedule.. The only comment to make was that the first element of the task was a bit too fiddly, while we had figured out what we had to do it took too long to actually do it and as that's not the point of the game, I think something a bit less fiddly would be more appropriate. However this was just an observation and didn't effect our enjoyment levels and I would highly recommend locked to anyone visiting Budapest as something they really must do. I can't wait to go back and try one of the other tasks!!"

I came to Budapest really excited to try an escape game, especially one that was so well reviewed on this website. We booked the Secret Lab room because we thought it would have to do with a secret lab mystery of some sort. When we arrived, he gave the backstory of what our mission was, and sadly that was the most interesting part of the game. We paid 20 euros each plus a 7 euro booking fee to be locked in a cold room for an hour. The game itself was so difficult that it was not fun. It made no sense to American logic, because we tried everything we could think of and constantly hit dead ends. He eventually had to just walk us through it because it made no sense to us. And it was creative, but we would have never thought to do any of those things to get to the next room. We had no idea what we were doing (the briefing beforehand could have also been much more detailed). I ended up sitting on the floor and waiting for the next hint because it was that impossible. I left feeling like we wasted our money and part of the last day of our trip that could have been spent doing other things. I wanted to ask for my money back but did not know if that was okay in Hungary like it is in the U.S."

My group has done our fair share of EscapeRooms between us, and we did The Serial Killer, Surgery, Secret Lab and Bank Job in that order over several days. Overall, the rooms were fun, challenging, look really good, had a great variety of different props/puzzles combination/code locks etc. The Serial Killer also had a really cool storyline.So the negatives. First of all, the use of \"Do not touch\"-symbols. I think that the symbol brings down the overall feeling as it would've felt more genuine without them. There didn't seem to be enough justification for using it, so I would've preferred the added difficulty of not knowing what to use.Second of all, badly executed puzzles... I really dislike puzzles that aren't hard because you can't figure out how to solve them, but instead are hard because the logistics doesn't work... Now some people might say this is a part of a puzzle being hard, but when doing something correctly didn't result in the correct answer, I believe it was only frustrating...I think Locked could be an awesome escape experience, if you give a little TLC to the puzzles that makes banging your head into the wall feel more productive that trying to solve them."

They have to manage 2 rooms + welcome guests at the same time so they don't know what you have achieved and what you are doing + communication is done through a speaker with low quality.Still a very good experience but more for a group than for a couple since help is very limited and not so efficient."

I booked a slot and that meant that we had the game to just the two of us for the hour, it wasn't shared with anyone else. I chose the serial killer game based on reviews and wasn't disappointed. We arrived in advance of the time slot as advised, which was good as it gave time to put our belongings in a locker, pay the balance owed and use the bathroom. I was a little apprehensive as I'm claustrophobic and wasn't keen on being \"locked\" in a room. But after our induction, I was made aware that there was a two-way communication in place if we got stuck or wanted to get out, that we could easily do so.The game was a bit frightening, in a good way, I expected someone or something to jump out on me, which heightened my fear, thankfully that didn't happen!I won't ruin the experience, but will say that it's very challenging and fun, but as a couple and not a team, we did struggle with some parts, I feel it's probably easier with a group of friends.We managed to complete it, but did need a little help in the last room.

Myself and 2 friends visited the locked escape game on 24th October 2015, not really knowing what to expect we were greeted by the host who spoke brilliant English. He told us about how to play the game and if we were ever stuck on one of the puzzles to give him a shout as he was observing and listening if we needed assistance in any way. I won't say much about the game we played as this may spoil some aspects of the game however you really do need to experience it for yourself. It was called 'the serial killer' and the objective was to find clues and solve various puzzles which would allow us to progress through the rooms to find out more information about a serial killer, and to discover information about his victims and eventually (if you complete the game) stop him from murdering any more victims. All of the clues and puzzles were in English some more trickier in difficulty than others. The time allowed for the game is 60 mins which cost 12,000 HUF (approximately \u00a330) however it is possible for upto 6 people in some games. Myself and 2 friends finished the game with seconds to spare. The game will not only test your logic skills but also your team working abilities. All together a great experience but if you wish to play any of the 3 games due to the popularity you will need to book online and pay a deposit of 2,000 HUF (approximately \u00a35) via PayPal to secure a time slot. I would thoroughly recommend this game to anybody looking for a thrill and have some free time available."

As there were so many of us, we decided to book both the Bank Job and Serial Killer Escape rooms and run them consecutively. Both events were absolutely fantastic! We are from the UK and the escape rooms were designed for a number of nationalities, regardless of their native language. We have done escape rooms before in the UK, but these were in a league of their own, particularly the Serial Killer room, which is the room I was in with the B2B. It's a great team building/ bonding exercise and the tricks, surprises and problems solving made this one of the highlights of our trip. I strongly recommend that if you go to Budapest in a group of 5 of more then you should attend this attraction. It lasts for approximately 1 hour and the customer service and event are absolutely awesome!The Company are extremely hospitable and accommodating and were able to help me book a time slot in advance so I could make sure the hens had plenty of time to get there. We absolutely loved it - 5* event!"

Quite easy to find directly opposite the exit to the metro station - just up the hill a bit to the right.12000 HUFS for the game was a great price and we'll worth the money.Would recommend."

Went in and did the Bank Job and loved it so much we immediately booked to go back the next day. So glad we did as the serial killer was quite different and great. The guy in charge was so friendly and made us very welcome. People have commented that they would find it claustrophobic but it most certainly isn't and you are way too busy working out clues to even think about that. We managed well working as a team of four and clues were given only if we were really stuck. Otherwise lots of dashing about gathering info. As we came out at the end of the game a group of English girls came out of the other game and like us, immediately booked to go back. We would like to come back to Budapest and try every Escape Room going."

It took 5 of us an hour and 3 minutes to escape the room with just a little help from Eric (our game master) We preferred the serial killer escape game to other escape games we've played as the story/plot really adds another level to the experience.

We had heard a lot about escape games in Budapest prior to our visit and booked a session with Claustrophilia in advance. From what I could see, prior booking is essential! We set out in good time to find the location however both google maps and tripadvisor had it marked in two different locations, both of which were wrong. The confirmation email only had an address which was difficult to find however this is of no fault to the game itself. We choose the \"Voodoo Tales\" and game was challenging, spooking and interesting. It is a highly enjoyable way to spend an hour! Make sure to give escape games a go at some point during a stay in Budapest!"

Of course i am an \"expert\" player - so rules, question etc etc was no needed - so i dunno how would be as a first time Game - but for sure for me was one of the coolest start ever. The enviroment: no decoration And theme at all - Well - IT has is own style: the enviroment is just perfect for the situation - any extra decoration would be just \"fake\" - U Are closed in an old apartament - And This is the enviroment of the Game - And is simply great.Game play: i am not a fan of linear games - but This one Is really nice.We were 2 so We Did not Have any problem linked to the gameplay maybe in 4 Or 5 become too static.Give IT a try guys!

If you get too stuck you can ask for help and clues via the walkie talkie that you are given. This is great to do with teenagers and as a family as it gets you working together.

It might be helpful to look up how escape games actually work before going if you have not tried one before...A friend and I stated just around the corner from Claustrophillia. As neither of us had previous done an escape game (but it was recommended by a friend) we didn't know what to expect. This led to a rather slow start in the first room, with little clue of what to do! However, after a little help from (the amused) staff we were on our way. In the end we enjoyed it so much that we returned the next night to try our luck again (there are two alternative games). Give it a go!(One tip is to arrive a few minutes early to make sure you can find the right place - the rooms are effectively set in apartment blocks. As a result it wasn't always obvious where you have to go, and if you are late this means you have less time in the game itself)."

The game master gave us hints only when we really needed it and she was very helpful. The decoration of the room was nothing special comparing to many other rooms (which have put a lot more effort in the atmosphere and decoration). The interesting part of this room is that by surprise the game starts before you expect it. In the end of our escape, we were given discount cards for the next time we want to try another room by the same company.All in all, we are very satisfied with this escape room and we definately recommend you to visit it once."

However, we spent our entire journey home discussing ways this could be improved. You are given a walkie talkie on arrival, but whenever you are given a clue it completely destroys the feeling of immersion. The clues were given a little too freely, and because the walkie talkie cannot be switched off, there is no ability to choose when you do or do not want help. The puzzles are well thought out and implemented, but there are too few to really pad out the hour. This room escape could be really great, but it needs a little more time and care to make it truly challenging."

Very good way of spending an hour After initial trepidation at walking into a room and locking it behind us and without seeing anyone beforehand, it was a great experience. Putting together clues and working between rooms, thinking logically and outside the box, cracking codes and opening padlocks by searching everything in the rooms. We failed to make it to the end, but were rescued by a friendly lass who talked us through how we would have succeeded.There are a number of attractions on this theme now, but we'd recommend it to anyone"

The room was really well organized and the instructor always paid attention and gave us little hints when needed and everything worked out well. Since it was so much fun we also decided to do the wicklewood room.Wicklow Room (2/5 stars)The Wicklewood room is far more complex than the Voodoo room and is really well structured and COULD be in my opinion better than the Voodoo room (what was in my opinion already really awesome) if there wouldn't be the negative aspects:1. The instructor didn't pay attention at all so after we were kinda stucked after 30 minutes we had to ask for a hint but since she didn't pay attention she had to ask what we already collected etc so it needed really long until she could even give us a hint2. One of the problems that we solved didn't make sense at all (i don't want to go into further details but i can just say you read from left to right) and because of that we lost so much time and then just out of total desperation we tried the combination the other way around and it worked (also there was no hints given)3. Then due to technical issues one of the items stucked in the wall (don't want to describe it further) so we thought we didn't solve the problem properly although we already finished solving it and tried it again and again until we then decided to pull it out with some force. Also here the advisor must have seen that we already solved the problem and tell us that there is a problem but since she didn't pay attention at all she didn't say anything.Because of these 3 problems we lost at least 20 minutes and since we just have 60 there was of course no chance to escape. In addition it's also really frustrating because we were like trying to solve already solved problems for so long...So i just hope for others that you will get an instructor who pays attention and perhaps they fix the technical issues (which could have been compensated too if the instructor would have paid attention)."

We did the Wicklewood room and it was great. Our only regret, and if you want a 'pure' visit, don't read further... it sounds stupid but at first we didn't realize that there was not just the initial waiting room involved (since it is called a puzzle 'room'). In fact , we stood there for a little bit waiting for instructions or for someone to come get us. By the time it ended, we were so close that we lamented that initial lost time.

This was our first room escape game in Budapest and our first successful escape, so it's impossible not to give it 5 points, although there are other games equally good (if not better) throughout Budapest. We've only tried the Wiclewood Heritage (too scared to try the Voodoo Tales, I have to admit), but we plan on returning as soon as possible.The Wicklewood room is conveniently located on a main boulevard, Erzsebet Korut 8, so you should have no trouble finding it (especially if you like this kind of games). The game starts the moment you enter the room, so make sure you don't waste precious time. The only minus is that they don't have a toilet, but they let you know about this aspect the moment you make your online booking. Yes, you need to book your place in advance, since escape rooms are all the hype at the moment."

We had never even heard of escape rooms before but thought it would be a quirky fun thing to try during our visit to Budapest. Well we absolutely loved it. Being our first one, I am not sure whether this is normal, but I loved that we were not met by anyone and just went straight into the game. We absolutely loved the game. It was challenging but we managed to get out with 30 seconds to go. We wanted to do it without help but the woman did come over the tannoy once to give us a hint. I am hoping that escape rooms catch on in the UK because we both loved the game and the feeling we had after managing to escape. Would loved to have tried more whilst in Budapest but we went home the next morning. Would highly recommend a visit if you like puzzles and problem solving. I haven't stopped talking about it. Good value for money."

Due to the popularity of the game I booked via the website a couple of weeks in advance (FYI you don't actually pay til after you've played). We played Winklewood and yes, it is challenging! It took as quite a bit of time to get the hang of things, therefore we didn't manage to 'escape' :( The lady was very helpful throughout- she said that for first- timers we did pretty well and that only 30% actually escape in time. A tip for beginners might be to go in a larger group... The more people the more likely you are to crack it. Anyway even though we didn't win, it was still ridiculously fun and I'd definitely go back and do the Voodoo Tales!"

It is well created and can be done by families with children as well. I advice though to be at least 2 people, otherwise it might be hard to solve some things. Physical strength is not necessary, just brain power and a little dexterity. Don't be worried that your kids might get scared it is not scary at all. Also when you're claustrophobic there is nothing to worry about you will always have enough room not to feel trapped! So go and give your brain some exercise!"

We loved it so much we would have happily tried the second room but alas we were only in Budapest for three days.Couple of things to note - the road it is on isn't the nicest and the entrance into the building isn't very appealing but it is WORTH it.

Once you sign up you are given instructions (very good instructions) that get you buzzed into the apartment complex where the voodoo room is located. Once you are buzzed in the game begins. Honestly we would not have gotten through the rooms without some help, however the help was given only when necessary. We still felt like we accomplished the puzzles even though we needed some prompting. The rooms were setup so well and we really felt part like we were in a story. I highly recommend Claustrophilia. The price was better than some other escape rooms and I felt that the value for money was really there. Plus it was nice to take an hour out of sightseeing to do something we wouldn't normally do."

The whole concept was completely new to us and from falling straight into the game to getting locked in the corridor after the game finished it was brilliantly entertaining throughout. The game was 10000 forints so about \u00a35.30 each which we all felt was a complete bargain. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for something a little bit different - it is also very centrally located and near the hard rock cafe too - so all in all an excellent way to spend a couple of hours in Budapest :)"

We chose the Voodoo tales and although I was a bit creeped out at first, it turned out to be a good laugh. It was our first time and we were a bit confused in the beginning, but the owner was helpful and gave us some hints through the walkie-talkie. Half-way through we got the hang of it and it was awesome! There are four rooms, loads of different tasks to test your creativity, logic, powers of observation and even dexterity. All in all, it was a really enjoyable experience! There is a toilet and a clothes hanger in the welcome room, so you can leave your coats and bags there. The game lasts 1 hour.The location is another advantage of this attraction. It's very central, 2 mins walking distance from the New York Palace. It wasn't very hard to find, although I was worried. You just ring on the bell, the gate will open and the entrance to the Voodoo tales room is on the left, straight from the courtyard.Very good price as well, we got a discount because there were only two of us. Good value for money."

Apparently it's quite rare for couples to complete it but it definitely required a lot of teamwork and a lot of no-nonsense actions - my advice would be not to overthink things too much and just try EVERYTHING if you're stuck!The rooms get progressively creepier which was cool, the final room in pitch darkness was a great conclusion. The tension builds as you run out of time but it's all just exciting rather than stressful. We were a bit gutted we'd waited until the end of the trip to visit as we'd defo go and do the other room if possible! One of the best hours we spent in Budapest by a distance."

I must say it was weird in the last room to not be able to advance any further because I thought we would find a treasure or something fun but it was just the key to get out!!!The good thing is, when you are stuck a voice helps you. When we got out in less than an hour the lady mentioned that we did well because some people, event with lots of help, are stuck longer and finally have to give up.

We went to the website, followed the instructions to reserve, received an immediate response telling us what to do. (This is in contrast to escape game companies in Sofia which were rated but didn't seem to exist or Bratislava where we haven't received a response). There is a big sign on the outside of their building in a very safe part of Budapest. It gave us a comfortable feeling.I should add that the hour we spent almost getting out was quite enjoyable - and my kids are now looking for escape games in other cities."

At first we felt stupid and just couldn't figure out what to do, but we did got some help (truth be told, the person on the interphone had to help us several times, haha!).

Based on the reviews in Trip Advisor we chose to sign up for this given we were traveling with two kids. We were in the voodoo room and were frustrated in the anteroom. We had to get help from the magic Wilkie talkie (which couldn't always hear very well). We also found that the locks in the second room were somewhat tricky and we couldn't get the numbers to move. The person on the Wilkie talkie had to appear and show us how to use it properly (not the same as the ones in US). My 13 year old was the saver of the day he figured out one of the more difficult pieces. So, having a teenager on your team that plays a lot of video games helps because the adults felt kind of dumb a lot of the time."

A challenging series of puzzles designed to make you think and work as a team. We did it as a couple. Based on this experience I would definitely look to do more of this type of game. I think these are best done in pairs rather than played alone."

We were relatively unfamiliar with the idea of exit games and so didn't really know what to expect. The whole thing is totally immersive right from the start. Don't want to give anything away but one minute you're walking into a random apartment and the next you're suddenly trapped and solving puzzles. It took us the whole hour to get out (a couple of hints were given by a mysterious voice coming from a box) but the game was well paced and interesting. Was cheaper as there were just two of us and it would have been great value for entertainment at double the price.Incredible is the only word to describe it and if you've considered it enough to get to the tripadvisor reviews then you should definitely give it a shot. You won't regret it."

We weren't disappointed - all four of us (aged 10 to 48) loved every minute of it and felt a great sense of satisfaction for having solved a lot of the riddles without help, almost getting to the end. We were so impressed that we decided to book the Voodoo game for our last morning before flying home. This was also great fun, although we received a lot more help for this one which meant that we actually managed to finish within the hour. The children were able to contribute just as much as the adults as their insights and observation skills come in very handy for this game. I would highly recommend this, but do book ahead as it is very popular! The price is incredibly reasonable, at 5000 Forints for a family ticket.Please note that the Wicklewood game does not have toilet facilities, but the Voodoo game does."

Things that I did not like: it was very hot in there, even though it was arount 12-15 degrees outside, the tasks were not so witty, I mean that the whole game is not about using your logic, but mostly about finding hidden things in the rooms and using them in the same, or in another room, and that's it.

The adrenaline kicks in as soon as the time starts and we were buzzing for days afterwards! If you like puzzles, video games or always fancied your hand at the Crystal Maze then you'll absolutely love this experience.You need to book your slot and pay in cash (v. good price!) I looked up the address on Google maps street view before hand so we knew what the building looks like and so exactly where to go. It's true that you don't meet any staff upon arrival, (this only adds to the atmosphere and suspense of the experience and is a great touch) instructions are written in English on a piece of paper in the first room. The game is challenging but totally achievable (we are proud to say we finished it in 50 minutes! :) most of all its extremely fun, we are now on the hunt for all the other Exit Room Games. Book your visit now!!!!!!! Thank you Claustrophilia!!! :)"

We chose Claustrophilia because of the high ratings on here, and the great price.Since the Wicklewood room gets fully booked and seems more popular than Voodoo, I chose to book that one first. It was really easy to find, big signs outside the door. After you ring the bell they will let you in and you walk up the stairs to the room. We liked that you got no information at all, except for a piece of paper, and when this is signed the hour starts! Not knowing what to expect, we had a bit of a trouble at first before we got a hang of it all, and we didn't actually finish the game in time, but we were quite close.Afterwards we were greeted by the friendly girl who had given us clues when we needed them, and she told us only about 30% actually finish the room, so we didn't have to feel too bad ;)Wanting revenge, we also booked the Voodoo room for a couple of days later. This one is harder to find, you have to look for a big, black iron gate and ring the bell for the room behind them. We actually walked past it, stressed out as we were (we were late) but managed to find it when we looked up the exact number. Now we knew what had to be done, and we ran around like maniacs to find all clues in time. We had some small issues along the way, but we actually managed to get out with around 5 mins to spare! We were really happy that we actually finished it! The guy who came out to greet us at this one was really friendly as well, I thought he would be mad that we were late, or not get a full hour, but no sign of it. We told him that we had tried the Wicklewood before, and he thought Voodoo was a bit easier, and I might agree (although it's of course hard to tell when you only finish one of them)Remember to bring cash, and you're all good!"

I can see how groups can collect more clues and have a higher chance of escaping. PS Before you go in. If you do need the toilet, you need to go to a cafe or WC because when you step inside and shut the door, the clock starts ticking.......and you wont get let out. Hubbie had tea at breakfast and was close to bursting when we got off at the station. There are no toilet facilities at the venue, not even a face when you walk in, just you and the room......"

If you are from the UK, think 'Crystal Maze' and if you like that - you will like this.Great introduction to the game setting, and innovative puzzles and games that make the time in the apartment rooms just fly by! Any hints given on the intercom are given in a clever way i.e. they don't tell you what to do directly but give you a nudge you in the right direction. Expect to feel your head whizzing to process information, some puzzles which will make you feel like you want to go 'argh' but are sooooooo satisfying when you figure them out, and for time to vanish in the blink of an eye!We did this experience as a couple (12Nov2013) as first timers to this sort of thing, and found it very interesting how we were good at picking up on completely different things. We completed in just over an hour, and it took me at least another hour to calm down from the exciting tension and buzz of the experience.Thank you for your great looking after of us to make this experience memorable and worthwhile."

            "review": "Expertly Designed. If you've ever played environmental puzzle games like The Room, 999, or Zero Escape, then you'll have a good understanding of how Claustrophilia works. Much like those games, players are placed within a locked room and must search that room for clues to help them find their way out. Unlike those games, Claustrophilia takes place off-screen, in an actual apartment in downtown Pest. But taking place off-screen only allows for a broader array of puzzle possibilities -- even if you consider yourself a master of the video games mentioned above, you're bound to mind some of Claustophilia's puzzles quite challenging.Although this is the only game of this type I've played, and I've heard there's about 40 or so in Budapest, I can't imagine a game of this type being much better. It's crafty and entrancing well beyond what I anticipated, and the love poured into its design reveals itself from moment to moment. None of the puzzles are either too simple or too tough, but if you get stuck you can always ask for a hint using a callbox. All elements of its design come together to form a top-notch room escape game.This has been my favorite activity in Budapest so far, and probably the most unique. If you enjoy solving puzzles, you'll probably find this a very special experience. And for those who might be concerned this might be a frightening experience, you can rest assured there's nothing but a ton of cleverness awaiting you -- nothing is going to jump out at you, and the room is average size so even those with light claustrophobia should be fine."

The game starts as soon as you enter the apartment and the door is locked behind you. No one is there to greet you which adds to the overall experience. You are straight into solving clues and various types of puzzles. We where a team of four and successfully completed the challenge and managed to escape from the apartment in time. Highly recommended as an activity when in Budapest."

Apparently these games are really popular all over Hungary, but this one was really challenging and we had to think outside the box. The atmosphere is also set up really well - the game is in a residential flat and there is no staff to greet you at the door. Instead, you're plunged straight into the game, because the front door clicks and locks behind you. We were the 4th team to get out without any help (if you get stuck there's an intercom), but it's actually uncommon to make it all the way through, so good luck!"

Fist of all most of the room-escape points are located in a cellar in Budapest, but Claustrophilia is located in a flat. This makes it very accessible with any kind of transportation and also is easy to find (from the street you can already see the big advertisement)After a lot of exit games I tried, I was expecting in Claustrophilia the same: locks after locks and locks again and at last I have to find the out the 3-digits to open them......but this went quite different at Claustrophilia. They have lots of other creative ideas how to open the doors, find the keys, etc..I really liked those ideas which were very unique so far. On top of that when I was thinking the game was over....it was not :) The stuff is also very enthusiastic and were good hosts.Amongst the bunch of room-escape places in Budapest, my opinion is that Claustrophilia is definitely one of the bests, worth to try."

Actually it combines logical puzzles and ability games and also you need to find and use objects in order to escape.

The owners spoke great English and explained to us that we had an option of what to do if we needed help (we opted to wave at the camera) It cost about \u00a311 for the two of us for the hour and it was well worth it. I'm not afraid to admit we needed help on a few things but it was still fun. On this particular game there were three small sections so there was lots to keep you going, it was really good fun.

One of us had done an escape room before, but the other hadn't, and we both loved it. The puzzles set were diverse so that, between us, we were able to solve them.

The room is a little pricy compared to others 18,000, but we enjoyed the experience and didn't mind the price. Also, there isn't really a lobby to wait in, and we were told that there is no water to drink, so prepare yourself accordingly."

It was like being on a TV program with the level of effects and the design of the room. Without spoiling it, there is a boat/raft thing that will 100% blow your mind as well as mental puzzles with magnets, mirrors, props and so much more. Most other escape rooms I have done have fairly mundane puzzles that all usually just involve working out a combination with a code but Pirates cave offered several unique challenges that I had never completed anything similar to before. You seriously have to do this if you're in Budapest and wanting to have incredible fun for an hour. It is only about 10 minutes away from the center by metro and was very simple to get to. Richard is also great and is clearly very passionate about what he does. I even made this trip advisor account just to write this review. It really was superb."

My girlfriend and I look to visit some rooms wherever we go and always play as a duo.The location of this room is not in the city but can be found by taking a train to the end of the red line which costs all of \u00a30.95 or 350HUF and then less than a 10 minute very simple walk following either Google maps or the instructions provided by the company. This is one if the few games I've been to where there are environmental stimulation in respect of music, sound, lighting, air, water etc. There is a genuine attempt to make the feel more holistic which I thought was excellent. The game itsekf was well made and the puzzles I would suggest are moderate. As a team of 2 we completed it with 11 minutes spare with no hints. That isn't to say it was easy but that we are relatively experienced and some puzzles just clicked with us. Would be excellent for a family as the setting is fantastic. I'd liked to have seen an increase in the difficulty but beyond that I'd say this has been amongst the very best rooms I've visited. Well worth a visit and an absolutely lovey member of staff who was very friendly. "

One of the two things that seems to be a 'must-do' in Budapest are the ruin bars and an escape room or two...As newbies to escape rooms I wanted something that would be pretty challenging but didn't like the sound of some of the more 'scary' set-ups, like nuclear bunkers, science labs or anything too dark or claustrophobic (I love a scary movie but not if I'm in it!) so when I read about the Pirate Cave it seemed perfect.Tina was a fantastic host and the rooms and puzzles were fascinating - quite challenging, a little bit physical but nothing major. We were only two people, so I wasn't expecting to finish it but I think she might have made it a bit easier for us (can't tell how!) and we finished with about 20 minutes to spare. Yes, it's a bit of a way out of town but Budapest is easy to navigate and the public transport system's good, plus they give very clear directions, so no problem.It's definitely given me the bug, I'm about to see what escape rooms are on offer in London..."

I would really recoomend this room for experienced and beginners - we were a couple so it was a bit hard on the time challenge but we managed to solve most of the quests and were 10 minutes too late for escaping, if you can hook up a group of 3-4 you'll have really good chance of beating the room :)"

So we can have a minimum of other rooms to compare with the Pirate Cave.The Pirate Cave is indubitably in our Top 3 (and not necessarily in 3rd position), and, let us precise that our Top 3 contains only amazing escape rooms.We can give some reasons for this rate:- The scenery is incredible. We will not give any clue of why it is incredible, but yes, really, it is amazing.- You are actors. You do not play like a player, you play like an actor. You are a part of the scene, an actor in the scenario.- The scenario. The creator of the escape room come from movies' world and we can see it. The hour we spend in this room was a real adventure.- The puzzles. Of course puzzles are important. Actually, my (if I say \"we\" because we were 2 in the room, I can say \"I\" because I am alone with my keyboard here) preferred activity in escape rooms is solving puzzles. This escape room proposes a lot a different and original puzzles (a lot that I have seen nowhere else).- The search for clues is also nice and original.- ... other things we forgot to sayIf we have to sum up in one sentence this escape room from our point of view, it would be the following one:\"Pirate Cave Escape Room is an adventure with laugh, wonderful scenery, original puzzles and searches.\"If we shall have to find one negative point, we may talk about the localization of the room, but only because as it is not in city center, people could miss this experience, and it would be a shame !From Fabien & Elodie, a couple of french people, coming in Budapest for 4 days."

When you arrive, exit the station and cross over towards the shopping centre (Arkad) then turn right along the main road (following the tram tracks). You will then come across a street on the left called Gyakorlo (which goes towards residential tower blocks >> nb. do not go down this street as there is no way to cut across into the industrial park and it is a long way back or around). Cross it, continuing along the main road, then take the next left which goes towards what looks like the entrance to a Soviet-era industrial park. The gate-house is manned and they will direct you to building 8 on the map. Just to the right of the entrance to building 8 is the pirate themed door where the adventure begins."

As part of a recent escape room trip to Budapest I took three teams along and each team played all three rooms in Scavenger. While the rooms are all perfectly reasonable games, they didn't match up to the many other options in the city.Mozart - if you're into music then this will probably be fun. The backdrop is pretty but I found a few of the puzzles were a bit samey and never really felt confident in the answers.Surgery - this was the weakest although it had a couple of nice moments in it. Definitely the one that all three teams got the most frustrated with.Egyptian - by far the best in my opinion. Some nice puzzles and looked pretty. Like the others, not really much of a story but overall fun to play."

Played 7 rooms in 2 days and I must say Scavenger is at least 3 levels above others. We did all three room and the design in all rooms was amazing. A lot of effort (and money) was put into it and we really felt like in a movie. The Egyptian set is the coolest one. Music and the perfectly planed details contribute a lot. Some of the puzzles were already seen but some of them were totally new and interesting to us. What we loved the most is our game master. :) She was so nice, smiling and explaining everything to us with such a passion that we \"got infected\" with her good energy. It was very important to us since we came to Scavenger Escape after 2 really bad rooms....better to say after 2 really bad game masters who almost spoiled our fun. Luckily, Scavenger escape made our day! Highly recommended to all room escape addicts (like us) and all who are jet to become addicts :)"

We did the Mozart room - which is described as the hardest room they have. The look of the room is actually quite good, but sadly we had not a good experience playing the game. Although we were often able to figure out how the riddle was supposed to be solved, for some kind of reason we had a lot of problems actually solving them - even asking for tips or help didn't help at all. The staff was really unfriendly and we got the impression we were more of a hustle than a welcome customer. It's also the most expensive room we have tried - sadly not worth it in Budapest, where good escape rooms are on every corner.UPDATE:After posting this review, we were contacted by the owner of \"Scavenger Escape Budapest\" who apologize and (without asking) refunded us the money. He was very sorry and said that our experience with the Gamemaster was the first time he has heard about it, but he will def. make sure this never happens again. Also the \"not working game elements\" were partly because the Team before us more or less destroyed the items and the Gamemaster repaired them not correctly. Overall, this doesnt change the (sadly) bad experience we had in this room, but the owner really cares about giving the costumer a good experience and he assured us this will never happen again. We will definetly check out the other rooms when we are in Budapest again because the room itself looked really nice."

The room 1984 was based on George Orwell's book. We were two persons, who had done 5 escapes before this room. Neither of us hadn't read the book but after the escape we decided to read it. The room was really well made and I enjoyed every minute in it. The puzzles were different from each other and the difficulty level was perfect for us. The escape felt really great!"

We went to play the \"1984\" room and managed to get out well in time. The operator told us we should try \"Heaven & Hell\" that we played the day after and fell in love with the room. Ingeniosity and fun at its best. We can see passion and creativity all around the rooms we played. We even played the \"Circus\" because we had so much fun there and would not want to leave.I strongly recommend you try out this Escape."

We have done probably dozens of them already, but this one blew them all out of the water.We booked E-Exit's room titled Heaven and Hell for holiday in Budapest. The room was available in English (I believe all of their rooms are available in English). The room is in a nice location and it wasn't difficult to find. We got there a little early (it's always good to be a little early for escape games).Our host was very nice. He introduced us to the story (you are welcome to read about it in their website). The story was awesome and very well written.We started the room. I won't give you any details, but holy hell (pun intended). Very well built and extremely atmospheric. The puzzles were very good and innovative (even after playing many escape games).The game was quite difficult for only 2 people, and I would suggest to go in a larger group (perhaps 3, 4 or 5), but we were 2 and we had a blast.We have booked a total of 10 escape games for our stay in Budapest, and so far this one was the best.Bravo to the makers."

Even though two of us three we managed to get out of the Circus with 9min left and a few help calls. We got out 1984 with 20min left and help only once.we only booked Circus, but they had no more customers and offered us 1984 as well. For 12 CHF (10\u20ac) per game we were happy to do the second one as well. They made the room with love and they're atmospheric. Great place to have done the first escapes =)"

The staff is really very kind and they helped us when we were in a dead end, enough but not too much to keep the suspens and the difficulty.This is a very nice thing to do while visiting Budapest, especially in a rainy or in a too hot day.

Shortly after the planned starting time we were told there would be another short wait as the room was not set up from the visitors before us, again we didn't mind. Once we got into the game the puzzles varied in difficulty, ranging from relatively easy to fairly challenging, however you are offered help from the staff should you need it.We luckily managed to complete the game and escape the game with less than a minute to spare! Once we were congratulated and photographed we settled to bill and went to leave. As we were leaving one member of staff gave us a 50% off voucher for our game starting late (no time was deducted from game time).Due to us receiving this voucher, the weather being dreadful, and us having such fun the first time round, we returned the following lunch time to attempt another game!Definitely worth a shot if you fancy a challenge that isn't the norm!"

Puzzles were challenging but fair, and there were more than a few twists and surprises!

Suitably challenging, ominous without being scary (I am very easily startled). Had we not overlooked one key component toward the end, we would've made it just under the 60-minute allotted time. The experience was well-conceived, and it was fun to solve the puzzles as a team. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in escape games. The proprietors are friendly and enthusiastic, and I look forward to going back to try their other game."

Never been to an escape game before but I think we started with the best one! I looked online at the selection of games available in Budapest and this seemed like best value for money and we weren't disappointed! We did the 1984 game as the guy recommended it as the most challenging. It was just me and my gf facing the puzzling world of big brother and I have to say it was a good test on how we can solve problems together lol! We eventually made it to freedom but took a little longer than an hour (was really hard!). Anytime we got really stuck we had little helping hints from 'big brother' who was monitoring us through the cameras.The setting felt very 1984ish and commie music played through the speakers adding to the atmosphere.An excellent game for anyone visiting Budapest. Highly recommended.We're looking forward to trying new escape games but this one will be the benchmarking to which all the rest will be compared. Thanks E-exit!

There were plenty of decoy clues, and the hints were only given if you asked for them. This meant it felt like more of an achievement than just being fed clues like some rooms do. The staff were so lovely, which made the whole experience that much better. I would absolutely recommend this room!!"

If you have an hour to spend , e.g. Waiting for the airport shuttle, there's no other way to spend it by playing the escape game!I originally booked the 1984 escape game for my husband birthday, and we loved it so much that we immediately booked the circus game for next day before our flight home!The staff: customer service is second to none! We didn't quite finish the 1984 but he let us finish it anyway. And when we book the circus game we have some time constraint, but he's happy to work around us to make sure it fits our schedule!The game: the detail and the wit of it will impress you for a long time, it's an experience you won't forget easily! The design of the game really blowed our minds away!We personally love the 1984 better, but then you have to find out yourselves by trying them both! "

This is my fourth escape game in Budapest and was by far the best, we did the Haunted circus. It looked great, it was difficult but doable and really fun. Not only that but it was the cheapest and had the best customer service. David made us feel really welcome, there were no rules about not taking pictures like at some of the others and help in the game was optional. This was a huge plus. Other companies give help if you like it or not and sometimes it felt like they were trying to get us through quickly. Not so with E-Exit...if you only try one try this one. .we're going back soon to try their 1984 game."

If you get stuck, there are cameras and speakers in the room so the person at the desk helps you or you can ask for help.Two of us did this, and it would also be fun for groups and all ages.

The Japanese room has a good flow of game, while I cannot say the same for Egyptian room, where there is a lot of clues demanding to much guessing with no rational behind it. The flow was also seen in focus of the children. The rating goes for Shogun's Shadow room. Pharaos's Chamber would get ration of Average."

Not willing to go to another exhibition, we found the advert of Mystique Room on the back of a map. The booking was easy: we just checked, if any room was available on their website and just called them. You can reach it pretty easily from Nyugati station, it's just down the street. Now regarding the game itself: The rooms (we chose the cathedral) were built and decorated nicely and the tasks you have to solve, can be done by everyone. You get help, if you have problems somewhere. We were three persons and it nearly took us one hour to escape, though I think it can be done quicker especially when you are more persons. The woman that worked there that time was really friendly and spoke good english. The prize is also very fair, so if you have one hour in Budapest to spare and want to do something new, you should definitely visit Mystique Room."

They have Egypt and Japan themed rooms, and they're all amazing, but the most stunning experience has to be their newest addition, the VR room. You can fly in space and shoot lasers while sitting comfortably in a chair. Since the VR is new technology I didn't expect much from the visuals, thinking it will be relatively simple. Actually it looked the same quality as a PC game. I've never tried the Oculus Rift before so I had no point of reference, but later I looked it up on the internet and watching different videos of VR games now I'm convinced that I had a totally unique experience. Avatarico's COSMOS seems to be a trailblazer even among VR games. I went to Mystique Room expecting the usual hour of fun, but I got even more. I'm still under its effect. I even looked up how much a VR set costs and what games I could play with it, but then realized that COSMOS was on a whole other level. As individual gamers, we probably won't be able to enjoy such games in our own home, so Mystique Room is worth the visit."

The rooms are underground and are dark so this activity may not suit everyone, however groups remain in contact with reception throughout and there are panic buttons should anyone wish to exit quickly.

We split in to 2 groups my group did the Egyption room which was a matter of finding codes and keys, it's difficult to say too much without spoil ing the experience for you, we really enjoyed it and had a proper laugh. The other group did the medieval room which was more physical challenges, similar to crystal maze, again that group thouroghly enjoyed. All enjoyed it so much that we decided to do the opposite room, however on reflection we had given too much away, so it would have spoiled the experience. They staff there were really nice and were busy making a 3rd room, an oriental theme I think.We would all recommend a visit if you are in Budapest, it's not the easiest place to find, so give your self plenty of time."

Would be good for pretty much any age. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because some members of the group struggled to get into it as much as others. Still not entirely sure why but I guess it just wasn't their 'cup of tea'.Overall, was a good experience and would definitely encourage others to try it.Very cheap to do as well at under 11,000 HUF (approx \u00a325) between us all."

Although, in retrospective, it didn't have the most difficult puzzles on the most creative challenges, it took us the longest to escape and we needed some extra hints. The attention to details is crucial, as this room is full of hidden symbols. When you need help, just ask for a hint on the walkie talkie you are provided when entering the room. The hints are not that obvious, and will not ruin the fun. Actually, you may realise what the solution is while asking the gamemaster for an extra hint, as it happened to us:)Like in the case of all other escape games, here also you have to book your place in advance and to arrive on time. Since we enjoyed this game a lot, we are waiting forward for our next trip to Budapest, so that we can try also the new room: The Cathedral.

They were equally hilariously fun and exciting! :) They also have a nice background story to begin with. The staff is very helpful and polite, location is central and getting there is very easy.The one with the ancient Egyptian theme was full of old padlocks, hieroglyphs and every inch of the rooms were accurately designed to make an old, ragged and ancient impression. There are all kinds of sound and light effects, tons of logical challenges from easy to very complex. You need a group of more than three to accomplish the mission in less than an hour, even though you can have the staff to give you subtle hints on a walkie-talkie meanwhile whenever you need help.The other room was a bit easyer, but still very fun and the level of challenge was optimal to enjoy the one-hour mission. The tasks and the theme are completely different and you can come across brilliant ideas in this room, too. You have to be inventive to even swith on the lights in some places and every inch of the space contains hidden cues waiting to be discovered.It was awesome, woth the money! I' recommend it to everyone from 5 to 99. You can do this with friends or with your family, you can come here even on a double date :D So srsly try this!++++"

This was not our first room escape geme, sothe first half was chaotic and quite average, for us, there was nothing new in the puzzles, looked like a copy of another rooms, with all the codes, strange signs and UV lamps...second part was much more interesting.note for roommaster - you are right, treasure hunt must not be easy. But it must be hard because of the puzzles, not because of user unfriendly locks:-)If you have never played this type of game, you will like it...."

Team with max 4 people will feel comfortable there. If more, that it is too big crowd and hard to give and control tasks. What I liked is that the gentleman on the reception speaks English, what is very good for tourist groups. Besides, all the tasks to find the way out do not require from you local language skills. What was also nice, is that Mystique Room is located directly in the downtown, so you can continue entertainment and no need to travel far. I can recommend this place, definitely! Besides, as I understood they prepare now new rooms there, and I want to visit them as well, that's sure!"

In the end, we didn't manage to solve all the problems in 1 hour, but the friendly member of staff let us finish this adventure successfully in 20 or so more minutes. We all left the room feeling good and stronger as a family. So, it is a huge recommendation from us!"

It was a nice experience to decipher the clues and get out of the rooms. Felt like we were playing a live video game :). The person at the reception desk was very polite and helped us with some photo shoots as well as also gave us some hints from time to time, which was invaluable, because without those we probably would have been stuck inside the room for a few more hours."
