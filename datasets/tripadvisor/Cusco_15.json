The plaza is nice. There are a lot of stores that cater to tourists and there are plenty of restaurants (fairly mediocre, the better ones are away from the plaza). There are people selling art and offering massages. The cathedral is definitely worth a visit. What I didn't like is that when my travel partner and I sat on a bench to take it all in and just enjoy the afternoon, we were pretty much bombarded by the people selling art and massages. And, oddly enough, a woman and her husband who also appeared to be tourists asked to take a picture with us. The only reason I can think of is because my travel partner is well over 6 feet tall and we are both fair skinned and light eyed. It was definitely odd, but makes for a great story!"

The buildings seem more natural, the people more authentic, and the history more alive. If you visit Peru, use Lima as a arrival and departure destination. But come to Cusco, to get the full Peruvian experience."

We could wander around this area forever taking in it's charm, and never an uneasy or unsafe feeling.We were fortunate enough to be in this charming town for the Corpus Christi Celebration! WOW, do these people know how to party! No seriously, it's a holiday much like our 4th of July, with family picnics, sharing of their traditional dish couy, food and drink on every corner, and a celebration of not only the body & blood of Christ, but several saints as well (like 16), with an outdoor Mass in front of the Cathedral with hundreds of people! They parade the Eucharist on this MASSIVE float around the square, then throughout the day, on the shoulders of many men the 16 different saints! It was a sight to behold, and I felt blessed to be able to witness this wonderful celebration."

Also, the restaurants on the plaza are generally overpriced without necessarily offering great quality or even value for the cost.

You will find markets and pharmacies there, as well, but a quick tip - if you plan to use your credit card for anything in a pharmacy or market, you will need your passport. Otherwise, cash only.There are many people selling goods like paintings, alpaca gloves and hats, arts and crafts and other types of \"home-made\" rememberances. Don't be afraid to bargain, they're expecting it. Also, many women offering massages and men offering discounts on restaurants. Despite all there is to do or see just in this square, my highest recommendation is to sit on one of benches with a bottle of water or coffee and simply people watch. Enjoy!"

I had already spent several days in the ancient Inca town, Ollantaytambo, where many locals wear the traditional clothing as their everyday clothing and I got many photos of that. The touristy ones in Cuzco were a bit over the top with their outfits, as many of them were holding lambs with bows around their necks. Come on. It was too much. I had no interest in taking touristy Inca photos and so I constantly refused to take their photos. One woman was so bold as to actually stand in front of my camera while I was trying to take a photo of one of the churches. I had to move my camera away from her and wait for her to move so that I could get the shot of the church. And then there's 'artists' who are all of the place trying to sell you their art. One guy told me that it was all his artwork, but I noticed that the styles were pretty different only to look at the artist signatures, which were different. That's when I noticed many of these sorts of guys around the city selling these sorts of artwork."

On our visits it was always busy and vibrant. Some groups doing protest or celebrating something made it even more interesting. Seemed to be lots of dogs roaming and when they formed packs it was unsettling. Lots of tourist sellers in the plaza. Good idea to find a balcony and watch the people during lunch or over a drink.

The walk up to you and offer you to pet their alpaca and offer you to take a picture then afterwards say it is 20 soles for you letting and taking a picture. They do not mention this when they walk up to you, and theres armed military soldiers all over you are afraid to cause a scene by saying no, so you feel obligated to pay.

The Plaza is lively at all hours of the day, well guarded by police, and has plenty of restaurants, shops, and bars.The BIG problem is the overwhelming amount of hyper-egressive street vendors trying to peddle their junk to you. They will literally follow you for blocks trying to sell you massages, over priced tours, cheap looking paintings, or mass produced 'authentic' alpaca hats.Word to the wise DO NOT book a trip with ANY of the tour operators here or you will get ripped off."

Now, it is the core of modern Cusco with all the restaurants, shopping galore, tourist operators and of course the main attraction, the cathedral and the Juisuits buildings. They make up the most attention in the entire plaza. The two names Huacaypata and Cusipata both have symbolic symbol and these places were places where ceremonies took place. The plaza is enormous. It is a place to sit, relax, watch people, feed the doves, pose for selfies and relax. Hire a guide who can explain a lot of these. Then a journal to write them down."

This flies with the Peruvian red & white flag in the heart of the square. the Plaza is amazingly clean. Beautiful cathedrals & churches abound, but something unexpected was..... the dogs. Lots of them. And not the 3-legged, scary, scabby-beat-up-homeless type. But the longer haired (it gets cold in Cusco) gorgeous, overly friendly type. My kids had a whole crew (pack) running with us for 3 days straight. The dogs were well behaved, and .... fun. Like fetch a water bottle and bring it back, roll on your back, etc. etc. We found this to be common throughout the country, but specifically in Cusco. Felt the plaza was a bit more enjoyable at night over a hot Coca tea, but in day time was also worth a visit."

The Plaza is the center of tourist activity in Cusco and is ALWAYS bustling with activity. There are dancers in the street, peddlers, and it's hard to walk down any part of the street without numerous vendors trying to get your attention to buy trinkets, tours, or dining. it is a little overwhelming and the noise goes late into the night. However, it was nice to have a very central area with no cars - we ate all our meals within the Plaza de Armas. And the plaza itself is very beautiful with cobblestone streets (blocked to cars), a church, and a monastery. There is a McDonald's there when you need something American, and many restaurants, ATM machines, laundry services, etc. If you wantto avoid the noise, you should stay at least a block away from the plaza, but even then the music and drums will likely carry through the night."

It has no soul though as it is full of people begging and trying to sell massages, food, paintings, and other stuff. Every 20th step, someone approaches you for this reason. So, after a few minutes of taking in the sight, it becomes boring. For me, the areas above Cusco are amazing. The neighborhoods become very humble and the people nicer and less jaded against tourists. Overall though a pretty plaza."

Traditionally attired women and children with baby goats, lambs, alpacas and llamas - want a picture? Lovely to visit, wouldn't want to stay too close because the volume is loud and the festivities start early, even on Sunday.

It is always alive with people and activities. It is very safe, with police everywhere monitoring things. Around the perimeter of the square are restaurants, shops, tourist info booth, Scotiabank and KFC chicken. Most of the bus tours begin and end here. It was festival weekend when we were here so there were school marching bands from every region of Peru. Very festive. At night it is well lit and offers a wonderful, peaceful backdrop for a stroll. It was definitely the nicest plaza we have seen in our three weeks here in Peru. Go see it and enjoy."

There are tons of balconied restaurants just take your pick - in the four days we were here we tried several and I can honestly say didn't have a bad meal or experience. Nightlife abounds, just be careful with the alcohol consumption at this altitude. Just off the plaza there are a couple of huge artisan markets - if you're in the market for gifts to take home or all things Alpaca - at ridiculously low prices - well - you're all set. During our stay in Cuzco almost every trip out and about let through the plaza. Honestly, it's my favorite part of the city."

So you might be better off wandering on to a side street to find lunch or dinner. However I did hear from a local that Limo or Limon (?) - the one next to the KFC-was good, though pricey. Depending on how into history you are - I don't think you need to pay for a tour. Just entrance into the churches."

Restaurants & coffee shops are abundant, serving local and international cuisine. The plaza caters for all citizens of the world. You won't feel at a loss, trust me.

A couple of restaurants have balcony seating that makes for a pleasant evening watching the hills light up at night. It's also good people, and dog, watching"

There's no doubt the Plaza is very picturesque with it's perimeter of large colonial buildings but unfortunately it is heavily populated with hawkers selling everything from dodgy tours to photos with baby lambs. They are very persistent and quite annoying, although I understand they are attempting to make a living. The main activity here is to take the quintessential 'been to cusco' photos - such as one of the cathedral with the central fountain in the foreground. There are a few bars which you can frequent and it's pretty safe at all hours of the day. As a side note I wouldn't recommend going into the cathedral - it's overpriced at 25Sol and pretty underwhelming although for further details on that check out my other review."

The plaza is pleasant, nice to sit and chill while people watching with some decent pubs and restaurants around the square. Prices are higher here compared to other parts of Cusco.Churches, check, if your into Catholic Churches. Personally I'd rather experience the Inca culture while in Peru instead of a colonial powers system of subjugating the indigenous people..... and, if you want to see Catholic Churches, visit Italia ; Firenze, Venezia to suggest a couple.Back to Plaza de Armas...., very touristy, drug dealers offering Cocaine and weed ad every turn (although not pushy with it and easily told to bolt).Decent bars are Norton and Paddys to the right of the main church.Any ways, you can't go to Cusco and not wander round this Plaza, some will love it others will find it pleasant if not overly inspiring, I fall into the latter.If you find yourself here however, your going to have a ball as there will be so much more to see and experience during your travels."

While the Plaza des Armas itself is beautiful, and people watching can be a great time during the day, I was sadly very disappointed with the experience I had on New Year's Eve. I had actually specifically ensured I'd be in Cusco for New Year's Eve, to be able to experience the festivities, crowd and fireworks at the Plaza Des Armas that I had heard so much about. I also wanted to do my 12 running tours around the plaza at midnight for good luck for the year to come.Unfortunately, when it came down to it, the crowds were overwhelming. My friend and were not drinking, and could not find anywhere at all that was open past 11pm to serve coffee, undoubtedly because the crowds were unruly and overbearing for the restaurants and cafes surrounding the square. There was little to no safety for people standing around, my friend and I were almost hurt by large scale fireworks being set off incorrectly in the middle of the crowd more than once. Folks are setting off firecrackers everywhere, including right at your feet when you aren't looking.At midnight, we attempted to start the tour around the square with the mob of people, but I found myself being sexually groped, shoved, and ultimately I had my purse unzipped and my wallet and cell phone stolen, within the space of a few minutes in the crowd. My friend and I pushed our way out, approached the police, and were told there was nothing that could be done, unfortunately. So, ultimately, like so many other people before, I have learned my lesson about crowds like these and carrying money or cell phones at those kinds of times, and that no one can really be safe in a mob of people. Hopefully somebody reading this will think twice before making the same mistake I did!"

The name 'Plaza de Armas' literally means \"Warrior Square\" & you will find one in many South American cities. In Cusco, this plaza has been the scene of several important events in the history of this city, such as the proclamation by the Spanish conquistador, Francisco Pizarro, when the Spanish conquered Cusco. Tragically, it was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the Inca resistance.The square is dominated by the main Cathedral & the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda, together with stone arcades, built by the Spanish. Today, most of these arcades are restaurants or high end shops. We actually found that there were better restaurants located off the plaza, but it's nice to try one of them out for lunch & sit on the balcony & watch the world go by down below"

The Plaza was filled with the scent of fresh herbs, and there were many vendors with unique items I hadn't seen at any other market in my 4 day visit. I didn't purchase anything so I don't know if the prices were fair.The big thing to watch for here is something really special. There are free walking tours of Cusco. If you go in the next few months especially, look for Eric. He's a very funny, sweet local man who speaks fluent English, and Spanish, and he only works for tips. He shows you some really amazing local artisans and shops, as well as local landmarks and shares some great history. His tour ends with a free sample of Pisco Sour that he makes himself at an amazing local restaurant called Unpi. I have also rated this place."

The clouds were also beautiful surrounding the plaza. Great photo op. We saw several parades here as they have a variety of parades and processions starting in the area. In the evenings we saw people and dogs just hanging out by the fountain or on the benches. We didn't really eat at the restaurants too close to the plaza though as we found better places just a few blocks away."

It is beautiful at all times of the day, each one giving you a different taste and color of the plaza. Great for people watching, great for chilling at one of the balconies of restaurants and bars. My favorite thing to do is chill here on a Sunday from the morning as there will always be something happening throughout the day. Wethere it be a parade, live music, food and drink samples, art exhibits, fashion shows, etc. At night, it's the safest place to be, with many bars and clubs around and always taxis and police. If you want to party and drink for free, at nights there will be people handing out free drink passes from all the local clubs around the plaza, collect several of them and start visiting clubs and bars! :)"

It was a joy to stroll and appreciate the Spanish/Moorish architecture and the fountain with the Quechua Great Inka (who gave his name to the entire people).

The architecture is amazing and the diversity of shops and restaurants is what you'd expect from a central tourist attraction. Pedlars selling cheap art and massages will eventually drive you nuts however, generally, a firm \"no\" sends them the next passerby. Keep your valuables tucked away because I watched as young kids appeared to scope out unsuspecting tourists walking with too much camera gear in hand.. I don't know what the end result was, but be careful. North American and European tourists represent a vast amount of wealth to many of the locals and easy targets WILL be taken advantage of..Many of the shops sell what appear to be knock off alpaca items and art however stick to the higher end shops where the cheapo souvenirs can't be found and it's more likely that the \"baby alpaca scarf\" is in fact the real deal..Bring your camera and some small change..

However, if you are obviously a tourist (and it's hard to hide this -- you don't have to be dressed like you're on Safari to stick out), you will be approached by someone every 2-3 steps urging you to check out something they're selling or look at a menu or take a tour. It can get to be a little much. Having said that, my wife and I still wound up walking through the square all the time because it's beautiful and because there's so much worthwhile to check out in the area. It's also often on the way to many things if you happen to be staying in the vicinity. In the end, I'd recommend it so long as you either don't mind this sort of thing or you're prepared to put on your \"million-mile-stare\" and stride right on through to wherever you're going."

Also recommend a night visit, and after raining, as the wet cobbles give it a distinctive charisma. Don\u00b4t hurry and let the magic of this city catch you."

There are plenty of restaurants to choose from right on the plaza, as well as a bank, shops, and the central courtyard area with fountain and benches. Just a delightful place to hang out.

It is lined by the Cusco cathedral, many restaurants, cafes, shops - mostly all selling the same things, money exchanges and tour operators. The features that spoiled it for us were: 1) the gross opulence of the cathedral (the finest gold and silver inside) contrasted by homeless people and beggars just outside in the square, 2) the constant barrage of people coming up to you wanting to sell you hats, trinkets, sunglasses, a massage, etc and 3) you can't walk past a restaurant without someone pestering you to come in and eat. We often got the feeling that we just wanted to get away from these things."

It seemed to us to have a daily parade of fantastic musicians and dancers with amazing costumes. The locals are passionate about preserving their culture and traditions, which is evident in this epicenter. It is a great place to sit, people watch, gather your thoughts for your next foray. At night, it is the happening place - there were many weddings when we were there which was delightful to watch. The roads are old river stones and cobblestone and crowded with shoppers, and beautifully dressed older women with a lamb or llama happy to take a picture for a sole. The downside was the many art hawkers who would constantly come up to you with their lovely art, but it becomes a stress to be constantly pressured to look at the art and be begged to purchase it. While we were aware of the many warning regarding pickpockets, thankfully we did not experience this."

The plaza is very nice the large statue in the fountain in the middle is worth seeing as R the Cathedral and the other colonial buildings surrounding the square the one downside is the vendor's continually trying to sell you something if you can get past that and you really have very little choice in that matter it's a required stop in Cusco"

The plaza, boasts a grand church (The Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Virgin), and a smaller cathedral (Templo de la Compa\u00f1ia de Jesus). There are restaurants on one side of the square with the carved balconies unique to this part of the world. In the middle is a nice park with flowers and colorful flags - the Cusco flag is a rainbow of vertical stripes.In the center stands a status of the Inca, and because of the proximity to the sun festival, his plinth was getting a makeover in grand Inca style with paper mache rocks and a staircase with a red carpet. It was under construction for a few days, then being painted, and when complete was quite a sight to behold.Also because of the sun festival, children and older students would come at night and practice their native dances in the streets of the plaza, accompanied by a lone drum or flute. Part of the times, the entire streets were blocked off so the dancers had more room.The plaza is surrounded by straight, steep, stone streets which were very narrow. Tiny doorways cluttered with brightly colored handicrafts led into small single-room shops that offered:- textiles woven from wool or alpaca- paintings in two varieties - brightly colored landscapes, or religious art- tooled leather goods- carved and painted gourds- silver jewelry- knotted bracelets.In addition to the shops, people on foot were selling the same assortment of goods on every street corner, down every lane, and all over the square. It seemed like everyone in Cusco wants to sell you something."

At its heart it is a charming plaza that attracts a wide range of locals and visitors and a few weirdos to boot. As others have said it is a wonderful place to watch people and get connected to the city. There are benches and walkways, fountains and wonderful views of the cathedrals that flank the square. Lots of great cafes and restaurants, especially those that offer second-floor views of the plaza. There are museums on and near the square, high end shops for silver and gold and wonderful textiles. Places to change money at good rates but shop around for the best rates. Within a few streets you can get outfitted for the trail, find hostels and hotels, book tours, get provisioned and maybe even propositioned. Even get the massage of your choice if that is the kind of adventure that you desire. There are a few hawkers and street vendors but that is now being controlled to keep it reasonable. This year the streets on two sides of the square had been closed to traffic to create a broad pedestrian mall that makes it easier and safer to negotiate. One day we were there we found armed riot police sheltered under on of the protocolsas it was a day of protest in in Cusco. Despite that the plaza was full of people and shopping continued uninterrupted. The police themselves were very relaxed and good natured and essentially on hand just in case this got out of hand. Cusco has invested heavily in Tourism Police in recent years to keep visitors safe, traffic moving and everything in good order. This has worked well as it is a safe and enjoyable place to spend some time and to use a base for further adventure."

In the week I visited there were several parades and groups of children dancing. I love that, but you can't sit here for 5 minutes without \"Pablo Picasso\" trying to sell you art, kids asking for money, and others hounding you for a massage or a tour or to eat in their restaurant. Everyone is trying to make a buck here. I would also avoid most of the restaurants around here- go back a couple of blocks for better food."

The Plaza de Armas is a busy city park bounded by a cathedral and a church, several great restaurants (Limo, Inka Grill, La Estancia Andina ), a juice shop ( Yajuu ), the Perurail Agency office, tour service agencies, and shops selling alpaca clothing, jewelry, and hiking gear. There is also a currency exchange and even a Western Union Office. Peruvian children and adults dressed in colorful traditional Peruvian costume and usually holding a baby llama politely suggest for you to have your photo taken them. If you do, remember to give them a few sols for the honor. Artists walk around the Plaza offering sell their work, one man showed me every painting he had for sale, the ones that I liked had spiritual colors; He explained that he had consumed Ayahuasca (a tropical vine native to the Amazon region, noted for its hallucinogenic properties) and that it had inspired him to paint. I chose to eat around 3:30-4:00 pm to avoid the rush hour. I sat by a window facing the park filled with locals and tourists and along with a fine meal I enjoyed the people watching opportunity. On a street named Triunfo, you will find Peruvian women offering massage therapy, if you chose to partake request a 30 minute massage to see if they have the skill or they are just amateurs; if you enjoy their energy and skill you can request a longer session. I chose a woman outside of 338 Triunfo, her name is Vilma, she massaged me at 9:30 am for an hour ( 75 sols about $24 USD ) Her studio is on the second floor, Vilma is a young Peruvian woman, she enjoyed my company and I relaxed to her touch. Before leaving, I booked an hour Inca massage for 5:00 pm ( I gave her 25 sols to hold the reservation).The Inca massage is 100.00 sols for one hour; She used coca cream and baby oil to massage me. A pot of hot water with eucalyptus and muna leaves was placed below the massage table to provide a kind of aromatherapy. She also used hot stones to accompany the massage. The morning and late afternoon massage was exactly what my mind and body needed after the 4 day trek on the Inca Trail to Machu Pichu."

The pros are that it feels safe and it's a beautiful location for photos day AND night. If you crave familiarity, you'll find that here in the shape of the reliable McDs, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Starbucks in just the prettiest buildings ever! Our guide told us that just two weeks before our arrival, the city had decided to officially close off the plaza to all vehicles. It was a heated controversy among the locals, but in the end, our tour guide even said it was a good decision. You can now freely cross the streets in the plaza and it feels safe. Although the sense of safety could also be because there are extra guards on duty, not just for the churches but to also make sure that locals are not demonstrating against the street closures."

But hey, all to their own ! It was disconcerting or, rather, funny, to see some groups try marching stiff-kneed, out of step. Proud but need drilling, guys !The Plaza is large and a green park inset with paths and a statue. Shops surround the square - small and varied. All in all, a better Plaza than most.

Sadly your evening strolls in the square will be punctuated several times a minute by restaurant touts, tour touts and people trying to sell you anything and everything. Be Zen and float through it! There are two good places to watch the world go by from the second floor (1st if you are English): Paddy's Bar, and Starbucks.

I turned down the same four ladies offering me a massage every day twice a day for two months. As long as you don't buy anything other than a (legit) tour go for it! One small piece of info relative to Cusco. Depending on how long you are staying and what all you plan to do you will end up purchasing a boleto tur\u00edstico. A lot of the tour books will tell you that you can purchase partial boleto tur\u00edstico's. One for Cusco and one for the Sacred Valley. We were there for several months living in Cusco and thought oh we can just do the partial of each place. It turned out that the partials are only good for a day or two and have limited places you can visit. I wanted to go to the museo de historia regional in Cusco but it isn't included in the partial ticket Cusco ticket which is only good for two days I think. So, if you are in Cusco for a short period. Go big and get the full ticket because it will include everything and is good for ten days.If any of this info changes or is wrong let me know and I will correct it. If you are planning on visiting Cusco, it is amazing and you will love it."

From my hotel room, I could see rows of buildings with red roofs and white concrete walls, and brown mountains that surround the plaza for as far as eyes can see. I enjoyed seeing people rush through the plaza as they went to work in the mornings; pupils being guided to and from school; tourists taking pictures all day as they explored the plaza, the nearby Cathedral, museum of Religious Art, and Los Compania church; vendors and hawkers trying to sell their wares to tourists, yellow taxis racing through the plaza, couples taking night strolls, etc. There is a fountain at the center of the plaza with the statue of Pachacutec at its top and statues of mermen blowing horns at the bottom. At night, the plaza is ablaze with lights and colors and many residents and tourists hang out on its benches, and the stairs of the cathedral till the wee hours of the morning. The grand Cathedral, Compania, bright flowers, flowing fountains and its statues, all add lots of color and character to this plaza.

Most tourists get a glimpse but the trained eye spots the cultural emblems. Plaza with its five hundred year old history is one of the perfect spots in South America. Our hotel room had roof windows that looked into the square to capture the night. The Plaza square is very well planned and has ample security due to the bustling tourist community among which 3.2 million visit the Machu Picchu every year. The Spanish architecture is evident and the local people are very helpful and nice who mainly speak Spanish, with Quechua and Imara spoken sparsely. The Cathedral is quite different with paintings that are different such as the Last Supper depicting twelve apostles having a guinea pig. The ambitious Spanish have left a big dent on the Incan population during their invasion and most are converted into main stream Roman Catholicism. Interestingly, the locals deep rooted Incan values and traditions of reverence to \"Pachamama,\" meaning mother earth is noticeable. Cusco in the Urubamba valley serves as a tourist junction to many attractions. The fountain of the Incan emperor in the center of the square is a reminder of the beliefs held by the peoples of Peru. Every Sunday the square is full of activity at least we saw school bands and students dressed in Incan attire following a two hour presentation of the history - reminder to the youngsters who appear to be wooed by the western habits. Lots of restaurants catering to every taste is few steps around the block and so is San Pedro market. Tourists should be aware of touts and scalpers looking for a game. Evenings are colorful and the lighting is at its best and a light jacket will always help beat the cold or unexpected showers. Police women can be seen regulating the traffic in their smart appearance and always helpful to visitors. WiFi is everywhere for free!October 12 is celebrated as \"Tanta Raymi,\" meaning bread festival in the nearby Orepesa that shows off its secretly held family recipes of the special bread baked in their own earthen oven tasting of licorice, sweet fennel, allspice or some other aromatic blend achieved firing Eucalyptus logs. Bargaining is always welcome and coca tea is freely offered in most hostels and hotels and for the coffee lovers Peruvian coffee is a treat besides the Starbucks on the corner. High altitude sickness is usually got over after a day. Cristo Blanco offers an aerial viewpoint of the city from above the hill. Ride on the Perurail to Machu Picchu from Poroy to Aguas Callientes is an interesting ride to see the life by the mountain side.A true Andes culture with a lots of sights, sounds, tastes, smell and much more for the tourist within and absolutely no disappointment."

Yes, there are tourists; yes, there are some junky shops nearby; however, the square is well maintained and has places to sit while the two churches are large and dominating. If you relax you can see that local folks also use the Plaza. One day we sat with a older local man (actually,probably our age) and watched a parade and patriotic celebration. Despite limited common language between us, he communicated what was going on and we followed his lead in when to stand or sit. On another day a funeral group accompanied by a band emerged from the Cathedral and the casket bearers marched with the attendees along the Plaza. Do notice the local rainbow colored flag, and if you are open to interacting with folks, then sit down and enjoy yourself."

During our first day in town we were getting our bearings in the park and suddenly heard a parade coming around the corner. It was one of several we would see during our week in Cusco. This one was something related to a spring festival with costumed characters and a makeshift marching band.

The Plaza de Armas is, as many folks have pointed out, a good place to walk around and people watch and take in some of the city's more historic colonial architecture and culture. It is also a great place to be solicited with everything from \"massage, Se\u00f1or?\" to \"maybe some marijuana?\" Of course this is a common occurrence in areas of concentrated tourists like this, but these people are relentless! This (somewhat) aggressive solicitation was actually the only irritating thing I found being in the country (other than being ripped off in Lima). That having been said, a simple \"Lo Siento, no gracias\" kept the people at bay. Just don't expect to walk around freely without offers for products and services being fired across your bow every few feet, especially if you're a gringo - doubly so if you're a pesky American. But, there are several wonderful restaurants, the beautiful architecture of the cathedrals, as well as souvenir and outdoor sporting goods shops, plus a few internet cafe call centers, ATMs, and other luxuries/necessities of the modern traveler. The square is also the central location for Cusco's many celebrations - such as Corpus Christi and festivities leading up to it, which was a site to behold. Check it out, have a look around, relax a bit, just don't plan to lay in the grass and be left alone. There are better places in town for that."

The restaurants are great, the Pisco Sours never fail to please and the shopkeepers and vendors never too obstrusive.

Newly married, or about to be married couples frequently come to get their pictures taken on the steps of the Basilica.Be warned that you will be approached a thousand times to buy any number of items for sale. A \"no gracias\" is enough to keep most walking on by.. very few vendors were at all aggressive, and most will leave you with a \"maybe you'll buy tomorrow?\". From time to time there will be little girls holding lambs and they will offer to allow you to hold the lamb for pictures. The price is usually 2 soles PER GIRL, and they, above everyone else we encountered, were the most rude when demanding their money.

Other thing to say is about security. One woman in my group had her backpack stolen, with all her documents. She just left it in a chair in one restaurant of the plaza, then it vanished. They said that some burglars keep an eye on one person, and then starts following until find some breach to act.

It made for good pictures and a lively scene, even if it did cause us to occasionally change direction because of a blocked off street."

If not for the issue of the pickpockets and the almost constant assault by people trying to sell you (mostly) junk like mass produced earrings, \"paintings\" and \"crafts\", this plaza would be rated as an excellent place to visit by me. You really shouldn't miss it, but while you are there, you need to pretend that you are on the seedier side of Times Square and be extremely vigilant. Keep your valuables close to you (front is best) and don't flash a lot of $. (I-phones are especially targeted!) Be very careful at the ATMs and practice saying the phrase \"No, Gracias\" politely - but firmly - to the vendors who roam the plaza. The more time you spend here, the more annoying it becomes and the more you feel as if you are being viewed as a walking wallet. What bothers me more than anything else here is how shamelessly and frequently very young children are used as tools to entice potential customers. There are many, many beautiful, locally made arts and crafts to be seen and purchased in Peru, but you will not find much that falls into that category in the plaza. If you do decide to stop and buy something from a vendor, get your money ready before you do so, try to have close to - if not exact - change, and be prepared to be besieged by other vendors who see you making your purchase. When walking about this plaza, you will likely also be approached by traditionally costumed women and children with llamas offering to pose with you for a photograph, for a small price. If you decide to go for it, again, pay attention to the people around you and don't put down your belongings. (I'm more comfortable doing these kinds of things and souvenir shopping in general at the market in Pisac, about 40 minutes outside of Cusco.) The plaza is beautiful and always clean, the cathedrals are both well worth a visit, especially the main one (Cusco Cathedral?) and you'll find some decent cafes and restaurants here, but you need to go up to San Blas, or to one of the big markets (like San Pedro) or to neighborhoods outside of the main plaza to find the more authentic and unique arts, crafts and eateries. There is a pretty good little juice place that offers a huge selection of freshly squeezed tropical juices and blends, with a menu that lists and describes the health benefits of various juices...they also have a delicious coca tea with lime and mint ... yum! Sit upstairs for a great view of the plaza. (BTW, the absolute best place to go for juices is the \"juice ladies\" at the San Pedro market, where you will get a FRESH blender-full of whatever you'd like for about $5!) TRAFFIC ALERT! If you are planning to take a taxi somewhere that will require going through the plaza, check first at your hotel to see if any activities are scheduled for that day. In the week that we were there, there was a large demonstration by public school teachers and a large sort of parade/competition/ceremony involving hundreds of school children from around Peru. Cars coming in to the square from the side roads were trapped, some for a very long time, before they could get through!Speaking of taxis, do yourself a favor and ask BEFORE you get in how much it will be to reach your destination. The prices vary widely depending upon how much they think you'll pay, basically. For the most part, they are within reason- but just don't assume that because you took a cab from your hotel to San Blas for 3 sols yesterday that the same ride will cost the same tomorrow...and cabs arranged through your hotel will often cost more than if you go flag one down on your own."

Atahualpa, the last Inca king, was beheaded here by the conquistadores. A couple of hundred years later, the Plaza saw revolutionary leader Tupac Amaru II have his arms and legs pulled off by ropes attached to horses, before his head suffered a similar fate to Atahualpa's. On two and a half sides of the square are the remnants of numerous Inca palaces and other large dwellings, stonework still in incredible condition, converted into houses by conquistadores (who added balconies and a Spanish-style series of arches, making a covered terrace round the square) and most recently turned into shops and restaurants (including, unfortunately, a McDonalds and KFC). To the north east is the imposing edifice of the cathedral, and on the south eastern side lies the Jesuit church. Almost everything you'll want to see and do in Cusco lies within a 10 minute walk of the Plaza de Armas, so you'll inevitably find yourself passing through here frequently. Or else simply find a place to have a coffee (preferably not Starbucks; yes there is one of these too) and watch the world go by. Be warned that you will inevitably be mobbed by locals trying to sell you tourist tat, either acrylic hats or tacky artwork that is mass produced in a factory elsewhere in town, despite whatever claims the seller might make that it's \"their\" work."

At one time, it is said that the Inca had beach sand brought in to cover the Plaza for his pleasure.At another time, the Spanish Conquistadors were holed up in one building here, completely surrounded by Incan warriors who *nearly* crushed them completely, which of course would have completely changed the entire history of Peru from 1500's on.Today, it is the centerpiece of Cusco- both architecturally as well as culturally. Budget some time to simply spend here doing little more than soaking in the ambiance, feasting on the architecture, and watching the people, tourists and locals, doing their thing.It is highly advisable to additionally visit at night, as it is a spectacular sight ( before 10 pm, the fountain turns off and the shops go dark ) to see it lite up, glowing, and surrounded by the foothills beyond... and, of course, the ever present and trippy \"floating Jesus\" up near the long-ago sacked and dismantled old fortress. If a nice dinner is in your budget, there are a number of fine restaurants located on the second floors of these buildings with enclosed balconies offering splendid views of the entire Plaza, church, and Cathedral. Simply keep an eye out for the menus at the foot of the stairwells leading to the second floor, as the restaurants and not easily seen or identifiable to the casual passerby.If you've done any advance reading about the history of the Incan empire, and the Spanish Conquest, your imagination will be full of vivid recollections of the history that took place here. I recommend The Last Days of the Incas, by Kim MacQuarrie. This should be required reading for anyone traveling to MP & the SV, and it's a delightfully easy read."

Quaffing a cold one on a sunny day and people-watching from above provides a distinct pleasure.The one downside of the square, which the authorities should correct, is that there are no toilet facilities within close proximity of the square, so one must use one of the establishments that line the adjacent street which means popping for a purchase of some kind."

Another good thing about PdA is the presence of the police though we never felt like we needed them; sure there are hawkers galore but most just end with \"Okay, see you later then?\" when you say no thanks -- most stuff pretty cheap currency-wise although the quality looked decent. Walk up and down nearby alleys for better deals. Crosswalks seem advisory.

If you think the buildings are impressive from a first glance, it's definitely worth taking a look inside. The golden altar piece in the Iglesia la Compania de Jesus features an image of the Virgin as well as other symbols that echoes the Roman Catholic heritage. Make sure that you grab a piscola [ pisco (is a liquor distilled from Muscat grapes) and coca cola blend ] at one of the restaurants in the square.

By the way, this is the only place that the Spaniards couldn't destroy. The perimeter of it is exactly as it was in the time of the Inkas. So when you step on it think how many of the Inka feet walked around where you do... This plaza was very important. It's call the Huacaypata - Huacay=Crying - Pata=Plaza. Here is where the Inkas brought in shame whom ever rebelled or didn't comply with their laws. Their laws were quite simple but very strict. Ama sua=Don't steal, Ama llulla = Don't lie - Ama llulla=Don't be lazy, Ama llenka=Don't kill. Revere the Sun as the only God, respect mother nature, be good to all. Reciprocity was the bases for their way of governing as much it's still a way of life in the high lands of Peru in the Andes. Here in this plaza the Inkas also brought after their battles the leaders of conquered lands for all the people to see, some of them were kill in front of the Wacas (deities) some whom were affiliated to the Empire were honored and giving feasts. On this same plaza thousands of the Inka people died defending their land, their Sacred City Cusco from the invaders. Here was executed the last hope of freedom Tupac Amaru on which four horses stretched his body to death, with his last breath shouted... Hayk\u2019aqpas yuyayniyku saruchasqa karanchu!! Our minds will never surrender!! Here in the Plaza of Huacypata now a days Cusco celebrates all it's traditional costumes, modern and old. What goes in Cusco on this plaza has a double meaning. Nothing done in Cusco is what you see. It always have a deep inner explanation. Here Meztizos, criollos as much as the aboriginals direct descents of the Inkas hold hands to reminiscent their glorious past.Here on the Huacaypta were shed tears of blood of joy, defeat and desperation. From my point of view, this plaza holds the spirit of the Inkas."

The fountain was also a nice focal point. On our first evening, there was a parade of various bands dressed in traditional costume. (I am not sure what the celebration was, but it was fun to watch.)The restaurants we tried at the plaza were the Inka Grill (good sandwich spot) and Limo (great for drinks, appetizers, and dinner). Limo was upstairs and has a nice view of the plaza. For shopping, the stores here are a bit expensive as they are in the tourist area. However, the 3 ladies in our group all bought alpaca scarves at Kuna. For those who want to buy Pisco to take back home, the airport was cheaper than the stores near the tourist areas."

Do shop around and compare prices as I found the wool cape I wanted for 400 soles (monetary unit of Peru) and previous stores had wanted500 soles for it. Quality sterling silver items may also be found here. There is also a small alley where the vendors sit in open stalls and you can deal for best prices on local items. This area is very scenic for photos. There are many women dressed in traditional costumes and holding baby goats for you to take their photo then offer a monetary donation. Most tell you that you decide how much to offer. It can get very crowded here.

Actually, it was very peaceful and not the dangerous thing I might have imagined, they were asking for high pay for educators, and they weren't getting too out of hand, because it was a school presentations in the square with kids in uniforms and band music. Demonstration doesn't mean riot. There are lots of street sellers, but a person selling their own art is completely different from selling plastic things made in another country, really."

The cathedral is definitely worth exploring, though if I recall correctly you had to pay an entrance fee. I suppose if you came during mass, you wouldn't have to pay. Someone recommended to use that we come during the Quechua mass every Sunday. The plaza and other public places in Peru were kept very clean. My main objection is the aggressive street vendors. While they are not as persistent as in Mexico, they are still annoying and really dampened my enthusiasm for spending any time at all in this plaza."

There is park in the middle with a fountain.The culture is so evident here. Everyone is so friendly. So many things to do that my advice would be to not try to rush anything. Just relax and take an entire afternoon (or longer) to soak it all in. My wife and i spent like an hour at the Starbucks (which is located on the second floor of one of the buildings and has a fantastic balcony which overlooks the Plaza) just people watching and relaxing.Literally my only complaint is the constant onslaught of vendors trying to sell you something or other, but what are you going to do? Everyone has to make a living."

Without expectations of any kind, much less high ones, we were pleasantly surprised not only by the friendliness of the people but by the stunning beauty of the country. The Plaza was an example of that. The shops and restaurants surrounding it are of a tourist quality that would be acceptable in any developed country, and the square itself, with beautiful landscaping, stunning architecture and the Andes Mountain backdrop, proved to be beautiful by nearly any standard. We were surprised and pleased by almost all aspects of the city of Cusco in general and the Plaza de Armas in particular."

            "review": "If you've never been here (or to South America) before... read this!. If it's your first time visiting Plaza de Armas (or South America for that matter) here is some advice and suggestions based upon my experiences here. I spent 3 weeks in Cusco and spent time in Plaza de Armas nearly every day while there.Getting Around:Hustle and bustle as thousands of people are touring the area and the best way to get around is often to walk or take a taxi. I would not recommend taking a bus because they are extremely crowded (if you are tourist it's best not to give easy access to your wallet in your back pocket). Bring a good pair of tennis shoes because there are cobblestone roads and flip flops, heels, and sandals often end up causing you to trip or fall. Many of the roads include a good amount of elevation so you'll find it best to be comfortable. Taxis are plentiful, but use caution when taking them because there have been many cases of people dressing up their own cars and pretending to be taxi drivers to rob tourists. If you are staying at a hotel or dining at a restaurant, ask someone that works there to call a taxi for you. Taxi drivers will often \"up\" the cost when they see you are a tourist. You might want to ask them how much it will cost beforehand. I took a taxi at least 2 times each day & what I would do is not ask the taxi driver how much ahead of time. When I arrived at my destination I would quickly hand him a specific number of soles based upon how much I anticipated the ride being. This actually worked out best. Act like you are a frequent traveler there and that way they won't try to get an extra sole out of you. Speaking the Language:Most taxi drivers speak very little English so be sure to know some Spanish before you go. Shop owners speak a bit of English (as they are used to American and European tourists) but you'll get by just fine pointing at things on menus or in shops. Buying Items & Money:You will constantly be approached here to buy paintings, gloves, candy, sunglasses, etc. It can get rather annoying after awhile and sometimes it is heartbreaking because it's young children begging. Walk at a fast pace and when they try to stop you or walk next to you simply say \"No, gracias\"and keep going. If you stop walking, they'll surround you. I went with a large group of people and those that kept a fast pace were left alone while those that were trying to be polite and explain they weren't interested got the worst of it. If you typically use US Dollars as your currency, you'll be glad to see your money go further here. It's a developing country so you can expect that you'll spend less on this trip picking up souveniers. People are going to try to sell you \"Baby Alpaca\" items (gloves, scarves, hats) and none of them are real Baby Alpaca if you are just walking down the street. So be aware of that and that you also can almost always bargain down on any item from a vendor! An example of how far your money will take you:15 minute taxi ride for 2 people - 4 soles = $1.80Huge 60 ounce bottle of water - 2 soles = 90 centsBefore you Go: Stock up on waterless anti-bacterial hand sanitizer, kleenex, daily vitamins, and baby wipes. Almost all of the bathrooms you'll be using cannot be flushed with toilet paper in them (the plumbing isn't as advanced as other places) so you'll have to dispose of your toilet paper in a trash can located by the toilet. They do use Western style toilets, but you won't want to sit on them. You'll develop quite the strong leg muscles from squatting so often. There is often not soap to wash your hands or towels. I found that just using moist baby wipes when using the facilities and anti-bac hand sanitizer afterwards seemed to be the best bet. Take plenty of vitamins and kleenex with you. The level of sanitation leaves a lot to be desired. There are not laws for emissions on cars so there is black smog from exhaust and when you blow your nose the snot often comes out black (yuck...and hence the Kleenex)Cool Places at Plaza de Armas:I enjoy a pub/bar feel so I spent a good amount of time at the Cross Keys (1 block off of Plaza de Armas) and is a British style pub. Roomy, good food (menu in English), and lots of tourists from Europe/USA hanging out there watching futball ...or soccer as we like to call it in the US. There is also an Irish pub 1/2 a block down from that and it's nice but gets very crowded quickly.1. I never would have guessed! (things you probably didn't know):If you choose to get your photographs taken with the adorable little girls dressed in native outfits (and they are often walking small llamas or holding lambs) you must tip them! 1 sole per person. Don't stand a distance from them and take their picture either unless you plan on going over and tipping them afterwards. It is considered very rude not to tip them. They are quite poor and make their money off tourists.2. You could say it's \"a dog's world\" here because most dogs run freely around town. You'll see them everywhere and all of the time. I'm an animal lover myself, but I didn't pet any of them due to the danger of disease. Again, this is a poor area, so it's not like these dogs are being taken in to see vets on a regular basis. 3. Why yes, that is urine you smell! You just read there are dogs everywhere, right? Well, they've got to do their business just like everybody else so they pee on the streets and on the walls of establishments frequently. People (mainly men) will urinate in public as well."

We had a tour of La Catedral, and the area of Cuzco by booking it through Llama Path travel agency. They picked us up from Cuzco airport and took us here and around Cuzco and I really enjoyed having a guide and a ride for the trip. We had to pay the ticket prices for entrance in additional to the tour price, but I think it was worth every penny.If you are here before hiking Machu Picchu, don't forget to buy bug spray, sun screen and TOILET PAPER!"

Peru received the fountain with the Mayan leader atop. The statue was changed last year for a celebration. There are sellers there, but with one exception of a seller who followed, saying, \"No, gracias\" seems to work. The only negative is that modern fast-food is now infringing in the Plaza. Starbucks (which I have to admit I did visit), McDonalds, and KFC now all have locations on the square. We felt more comforable walking around Cusco than we did other locations in Peru."

Parades seemed to happen every time we passed through. There were however workers there on a regular basis keeping the streets clean. At night local teenagers did traditional dances along the borders of the square. It was amazing. The night before the actual solstice there was a giant party. It seemed like it was more for local Peruvians since we did not see that many tourists in the crowd. There were thousands of people and a giant stage was erected with live music. Children through adults were drinking an large quantities of rum and coke. But even with all the drunkenness no one got out of control and by the next morning the streets were cleaned and hosed down like it had never happened.Yes there were always peddlers and people trying to lure you into their restaurant but it was not more imposing then any other similar city that depends on a tourist economy. The only thing that was excessive was when small children would try to block your path to buy their wares. My husband had to lift up and move a small girl who blocked a doorway with her body and separated us while trying to exit a restaurant. Otherwise just say no and smile and they usually move on."

There are a number of restaurants overlooking the square with upper-floor dining to watch the action from above if desired. We saw a couple religious parades in our brief time here which just added to the local vibe.

There are several restaurants facing the plaza, and it was nice to sit up on their balconies, sipping a Cervesa and just people-watching. At night, the old churches and buildings a lit up and it is beautiful. Our only complaint about the Plaza - the hawkers are relentless, you can barely walk five feet without people constantly trying to sell you something."

Give your empty plastic bottles to the older women in the square, you will know who they are.Touts selling you massages, and printed paintings and food. Just beware the massages and the kids selling you paintings and women selling jewellery. The massages are not very good, they will get you to take of all your clothes quite unnecessarily. They are lovely people, and although everything is quite cheap, they are not as fortunate, so dont expect 5 star massage, beauty and travel advise.

The intricately carved and colourful wooden balconies on the buildings are another attraction. It's the place for processions and we were lucky to see one, that of alpalca rearers pass by with its music and dancing. There are cafe's and bars around. A night visit to the Plaza is a must.

I had read about the Christmas market held here on Christmas Eve but I had no idea that it would be such a memorable event. I knew something big was going down when campesinos were coming out of their villages and staying in the street at night. I think they were saving their spot at the market. Many people come from far away villages with moss covered branches, patches of moss , pine branches , ceramics of farm animals, just about everything a Cusqueno would need to build a Nativity scene in their home. Outfits for Baby Jesus like you never imagined, everything from knit booties, to little crowns.  Besides that there was an incredible selection of many types of artesanias and textiles as well as art. I bought an amazing painting of Archangel Michael done in the old colonial style for about $100.00. I had seen something similar here in the states for $2500.00. Also something I hadn't seen elsewhere in the sacred valley, hand carved wooden spoons super cheap. We spent the day , people watching , shopping and eating street food !"

If you can't find someone or get lost, make your way back to the Plaza de Armas and it will only be a matter of time before you find the same people passing through again. There are tons of locals selling their craft. Beware of hats and woven things being dirty before you buy them. They are a great price if you don't mind cheap stuff, just don't ever put it in a dryer or it becomes Barbie size. Just inspect it first. These \"vendors\" are not legally allowed to be pedaling in the plaza so if you don't want to be bothered by them stand close to one of the police women in the plaza and they won't come near you. If you talk to one, you will soon be swarmed by many that assume you are a willing buyer. I enjoy talking with the vendor even though I rarely buy anything. There is great food to be had in this plaza also. My favorite is the a balcony resturant that faces the smaller church. The owner is Pedro. I got food poisoning at the Sumaq on the upper level. Don't advise it. There is also a KFC and McDonald's in the Plaza for those who insist on fast food. The lights in the Plaza come on at 6pm sharp."

The atmosphere is great even though tourists (like me) wander everywhere endlessly."

Here is where you'll see protest marches, parades, live performances, speeches, or anything else that matters in Cusco. The square is simply magnificent, surrounded by cathedrals, with a fountain in the middle. All around the outside are restaurants and bars (very touristy ones, mind you), most with a chance to sit on a small balcony overlooking the square. There is shopping and all your conveniences at the square too, and it is a very safe area, always patrolled. This is the one place in Cusco that pretty much every visitor has seen.The downside is you'll be hassled by street vendors selling you massages, paintings, hats, gloves, entry to museums, or whatever else. There are some beggars, but mostly people selling things, even if just to take a photo of them or their alpaca for 1 PEN. You'll also be hassled by restaurant greeters trying to get you into their restaurant. This is all typical of any tourist area in Latin America, so nothing to get worked up about. Relax and enjoy the beauty of the square, sit on the benches in the middle and just watch Cusco go by. Don't forget to check out inside the cathedrals, they are very nice."

Most of the major hotels are within a couple of blocks of this Plaza. we were fortunate to watch, a huge parade of police and other security folks there. It was a pleasure to see it clean, and no beggars anywhere. Lots of art hawkers and women with sheep wanting money for getting their photographs taken.You can take a tram from there for a ride around town but it was a challenge to discover its timing, and we gave up! The cathedral has regular services but tourists are barred from it.Folks, the native peruvians are very poor, but they don't beg, so do be generous with your tips."

The police do their best to keep vendors away, but they will probably assault you with their wares. If you're not interested smile and firmly say \"no, gracias\". If you show any interest in what they have, you're sunk! If you ARE interested, my advice (I speak the language and did some intense bargaining):Don't buy from the first vendor; get a feel for what they're asking. Most sellers ask at least 1/3 more than what they'll settle for; I bought chullos (wool caps) for 6 soles, but most will ask 8-12 soles. Walk away if you don't like the deal, most will counter offer as you leave. Be polite and friendly, they're just trying to make a living."

We had seen so many Inca sites along the way we didnt feel like seeing the ones in Cusco. We ended up spending most of our time in the Plaza De Armas. This was by far one of the nicest squares we came across on our travels. It was very clean and was patrolled by the police at all times. They stopped everyone from walking across the grass - which was always maintained. And they stopped people from trying to sell paintings, sunglasses and other general stuff. So it felt very safe. It is also towered by the beautiful cathedral and church along 2 sides of the square. The other 2 sides are full with tour agencies and souvenir shops.The Plaza De Armas is the center of Cusco with many events happening here. While we were here (a week in total before and after we did the Inca Trail) all the local school kids - from the ages of 3 up to university level dressed up and paraded around the streets with music and crazy costumes. At this time the square was extremely busy but always watched by the police. Definately worth a visit!I also agree with below, if you plan on doing the Inca Trail, make sure you book with Peru Treks! They are just the best!"

            "review": "Tourist Trap. My girlfriend and I just got back from a wonderful vacation in Latin America. We spent four days hiking the Inca Trail in Peru. I recommend that every able bodied person do this hike (and do it with Peru Trek). Cusco is the staging ground for Inca Trail hikes. Most companies require us \"gringos\" to be in Cusco at least two days prior to the hike to acclimate to the altitude. I wanted to stay in a hotel that was close to the center of action, which, based on reviews I read, I had deemed to be Plaza de Armas.I've traveled quite a bit (China, Japan, Europe, Australia, Costa Rica) and have lived abroad for several years. Plaza de Armas is a tourist trap by definition. A) the prices are equivalent to what one pays in the US for food/drink, and B) the local vendors see you coming a mile away and hard sell you on paintings, sun glasses, massages, hats and gloves. And they swarm on you every time you walk out of your hotel. My girlfriend had to leave the bench she was sitting on after a vendor refused to stop trying to sell her stuff after five minutes.My advice, stay in San Blas which is a 5 minute walk uphill from Plaza de Armas."

We walked over to the plaza de Armas after the parade had ended, and took a closer look at the fountain. You can see Spanish influence all around the square.

Cusco's Plaza de Armas is a lovely square - at first glance, I thought it would be the perfect place to hang out, relax, and people watch under Cusco's sunny blue skies. Unfortunately it is plagued by hoardes of street vendors young and old, who constantly approach and pressure you to buy things. I've never been anywhere where this was more of a problem - it was so overwhelming and such a turnoff that we ended up not wanting to go there at all. It's a shame, because the cathedral is there, the Compa\u00f1ia de Jesus church is there, the fountain in its park-like setting, etc. The plaza is beautiful at night, too, when the fountain and churches are all lit up. The only thing I can recommend is going upstairs to one of the many restaurants or bars that ring the plaza , so you can enjoy the view from one of their balconies without having to put up with the hard sell of all the vendors."
