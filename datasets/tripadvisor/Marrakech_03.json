            "review": "Very Trustworthy. I heard about these guys from a couple in Essouira. I was spending way too much time on the internet trying to figure out a reputable company to do the tour to Merzouga so I came away with a positive life experience.  They did a tour with Rachid who I emailed directly because of his excellent reputation. Unfortunately my dates didn't work for his own personal tour but after telling him my budget he promised me he would get me into another reputable group. When I met him after, he had an associate get me from my Riad to avoid confusion and he informed me I had paid an extra 300 Dirhams which was included in our agreed upon price for a different camp and accommodations than the rest of the group I joined. Wow was I EVER glad he did that. My camp was unreal with my own personal tent with a toilet and shower. I was quite shocked because I didn't expect much in the desert and for the price. The next morning I met back up with my group and their experience was very different than mine. They had shared accomodation and not very nice toilet facilities. They also had to be up really early and spend a few hours on a camel in the morning as well which , for me, the day before was enough. I was grateful to wake up, watch the sunrise at 7:10 and after breakfast had the option to take a jeep back into town to meet the rest of the group who weren't overly impressed with there camp. Thanks again Rachid, you rock and came through for me with an unforgettable experience at a very good price. I am not familiar with dealing with the rest of the company but if they are anything like Rachid they are very professional and really care about the clients experience!"

            "review": "2 day tour to Zagora - Beautiful, but don't expect to be on time. The desert was a wonderful experience and our driver made sure everyone was happy. He even took me to Starbucks at the end of the trip! We got to play in the sand dunes and the camp was more like \"glamping\" than real camping. But...I have to remove a star because nothing was on time. I understand there were variables that could not be controlled (construction, etc.). However, the itinerary said that we would be back between 6-7pm but we didn't get back until 10pm. The reason was that we didn't leave Zagora on time (it was about 2 hours later than we had agreed). We also took an unexpected trip to a spice store and to a pottery store. Every time we stopped, the driver decided to have tea and a snack, so bathroom breaks turned into half an hour excursions. My sister and I had to cancel our reservations for a dinner show because the driver could not keep to a schedule. Also, we did not arrive to Zagora on time because the driver was late in picking everyone up. We had to take the camel ride in the dark - not exactly the trip I was planning. Every time I mentioned that we need to hurry up and get there, I was shut down and told to \"stop being fast fast like a Ferrari\" whatever that means. I am very type A, so maybe this trip would work for someone who is more relaxed, but it didn't work for me."

            "review": "Desert experience not to be missed. Myself and my son took the 2 day private tour from Marrakesh which saw us staying overnight in the Dunes of Tinfou which was an amazing experience. With a driver and guide, day 1 included a visit to the UNESCO listed kasbah at Ait Ben Haddou, which is worth a visit in itself. Just beyond the village of Tamagroute, we transferred from 4x4 to camel (dromedary, actually) for a short ride to the camp. Although just on the edge of the Sahara, Tinfou does include a small selection of dunes to give that authentic desert experience. We then settled into our tented camp for the night where we were the only paying guests which was wonderful and which included a fantastic authentic meal and drumming entertainment,The following morning, we climbed the highest dune to watch the sunrise and tried a bit of dune boarding, before breakfast perched on the dunes - what a wonderful memory. This was a well organised trip with the overnight experience well away from the main tourist destinations. There was the obligatory visit to a local community/collective pottery project in Tamagroute (thank you Tariq) but the pressure to buy was not too great and this added some interest to the experience.This was definitely an experience to remember. Thank you Rachid, Lahcen, Karim and Tariq."

Our driver was great, very experienced, communicative and friendly. His willingness to teach us about Morocco when we had questions combined with the experiences on the tour gave us a much better understanding and connection with Moroccan culture than we would have had otherwise. We also took the Essaouira tour, which again was super. Both tours were packed with experiences! Our drivers/guides were first class and the experiences were unique and memorable."

            "review": "Visiting morocco - beware money exchange in UK. Morocco is probably the friendliest north African country I have visited. Less hassle from vendors although you need to keep your wits about you not to get drawn into unwanted activities such as henna tattoo or cuddling a snake. I felt safe everywhere and we did explore off the beaten track on occasions. Check prices of things like taxis before the start of activities. Beware non French or Arabic speakers - not all the taxi drivers speak English - thank goodness I had my daughter with me for the first taxi ride we took. The biggest con you are likely to experience is exchanging money at a UK airport. They quoted 8 dirham per \u00a31 but got 12 at Marrakech airport. Very easy and quick. We would have lost a third of our money. Change currency back at the same place as difficult to do so in UK. Also if you have the time do a two centre stay - Marrakech and Essaouira for instance - wish we had."

            "review": "Great trip, good driver and awesome experience. We went on the three day trip to Merzouga dessert. It was a beautifull trip, through the most beautiful drive to the different landscapes. Our guide, Youssef, was really a nice and fun guy. He drove safely and took the time at the places where we stopped. We never felt pressured (what we sometimes heated with bigger groups) and if we wanted to stop at other places was no problem. He also taught us more about the country. We booked this trip one day in advanced and Rachid replied really quick and was very friendly.The trip itself is worth going and we thought this company had a really good price for the amount of people you were traveling with. We started in Marrakech and wanted to finish in Fez. Only they found out the day before that our bus was not leaving to Fez until the evening. Racjid and Youssef did everything they could to arrange a other option (with more people in a taxi to Fez). So that was also a good service.The only thing i could think of is that with four persons in a car there is not too much space. So i hope for the bigger people they have bigger cars :pYes, like almost every organised trip abroad, this is very touristic. This means you get to places (restaurants, sights) there are lots of tourist. Touristic also means you get to see the most beautiful places. If you don't like this, you can better go private with or without guide.Thanks again Youssef and Rachid."

Booking with them was easy and they were always very open and kind to respond quickly to our inquiries. The tour we took included 3 days and 2 nights (one in the Sahara). Overall the route (Marrakech - Fes) is well planned and includes stops to admire the landscapes (kabasas, an oasis, impressive mountains, etc) but also to stretch your legs and have a cup of meant tea or eat :) The company booked in advance local guides which were very helpful. As to the camp site, it was spectacular and with luxury standards (electricity, shower, wc). It includes a camel ride from the road to the campsite and back. Bottled water is available to purchase on the camp. We got the chance to see the sunset and sunrise.... hands down it has been one of my best experiences.Special mention to our driver Kammal who was always very very nice, respectful and helpful."

As we didn't have enough time to go to Merzouga we found out that this was a way better option than Zagora which most companies offer. It's a bit further and you get less tourists and cooler dunes. The whole experience with Discover Morocco was amazing. From the time they picked us at the airport until they dropped us off there we felt really taken care of. Rachid is also very fast answering all kinds of questions as it felt at almost any time. We didn't hesitate to tell him any of our concerns. He was always very friendly and professional. On the day of the tour we had a very early start with Kamal, our driver and guide, who is an extremely cool and knowledgable guy, who even went out of his way for one of the meals, when we wanted to eat some sandwiches instead of sitting in a restaurant, and took us to a really nice snack place. I also got my best souvenir from the trip from him. You can ask him about it. The camp itself was amazing and Nordin (the chocolate guy as they call him) and the gang there made for a great reception and even lovelier night with drums, fire and star gazing. Thank you for everything."

Rachid was a perfect guide and host throughout the duration of the trip. My boyfriend was sick and poorly on the first day of the trip and Rachid went out of his way to look after him and make sure he was as comfortable and happy as possible. He made us laugh and had great knowledge of the history and culture of all the sights we were seeing. The driver (I didn't catch his name) was also absolutely lovely and a great driver. They both exceeded our expectations and by the end of the trip we felt like they were both friends. Highlights were sleeping out under the stars in a comfortable bed (we wanted to sleep outside rather than in the tent-the tent was comfy but we really wanted to sleep under the stars!), the music by the fire and the delicious tagine we ate at the camp. I would say that if you get travel/car sick, make sure you have some medication as the roads can be bendy and bumpy!All in all, fantastic experience and we had non stop smiles throughout both days of the trip (even though one of us was ill!)"

Sunrise was no exception to the previous sights, which we were able to experience during breakfast atop of a dune.

Went to Morocco for the first time with one friend, having 10 days to spend along the southwest and a lot of options to choose from, when booking a trip to the desert.From the whole lot of offers, Morocco Discover Tours offered exactly what we wanted: 3 days trips, with plenty to see in a tight but flexible schedule, at what seemed a fairly reasonable price, at the moment. As I write this review, I actually think it was the best spent money in all the trip.Rachid is a young, funny and versatile guide. He will not just present you Morocco as it is written in the books or just point out through the window what you're supposed to watch... He actually teaches you the way of living in Morocco, the mixed cultures, the less turisctic aspects and has a fair share of surprises under the sleeve (have you ever heard about the Berber pizza?). We were actually very lucky to be able to travel in a small pack (5 tourists + Rachid + driver) - and after the first day together, you're like family! - since it gave us the chance to personalize the tour and discuss many options and places to visit. It was a great way to experience the desert, the mountains, the monuments, the people and end up feeling like you've grown a fair share of knowledge and a secret or two about the places you visited, after only 3 days. And for solid Rachid will be the guy who has your back: he'll make sure you have fresh food every day, he'll know where to stop, he'll know what to show you and you'll fell rewarded for your choice.I really hope to come back to Morocco to a Northern/East trip to explore more of this magnificient country... And I know I'll call Rachid.Safe trips!"

We were 2 female travellers visiting Marrakesh for the first time and booked the 3d/2n trip to Erg Chebbi Sand Dunes and were offered complimentary airport transfer. Our flight arrived close to 12 at midnight and as soon as I walked out was greeted with Ismail, a colleague of Rachid. He immediately made us feel at ease. U will absolutely feel like Ur meeting a good friend instead of a tour guide. Our tour was couple days later with a bunch of other Canadians. It was great cause all of us got along great. He drove us through the high Atlas mountain and the mid Atlas. The views are stunning and he would stop frequently for us at good spots for pictures and as and when we needed a drink or to use the washroom. He is quite patient, I must admit because at times we did take our own sweet time with washroom breaks and he was totally fine with it. He is probably one of the few ppl I can say who has beyond excellent driving skills down winding roads, maneuviring with precision. That is how much of a careful driver he is. He has an exceptionally clean car with air conditioning and it's a brand new Ford, so very comfortable. He also made us an excellent sheesha and chilled with all of us, just cause we said we would liked to do that. Many companies offer this very trip to see the ait Ben haddou, ouarzazate, rose valley, Dades valley and night spent in Sahara Desert camp, but rest assure with Ismail you are guaranteed an awesome time."

The small price diference made all the difference, since a car is more comfortable and given that we were able to get a much more personal experience. I'm very glad me and my friend chose Discover Morocco. Rachid is a great guide, very knowledgeable, nice and funny. He took us to all the important place and he even gave us the chance to personalize our tour a little bit. I'll definitely recommend him to all my friend who visit Morocco and I honestly hope to see him again on one of his others tours. PS: if you're thinking of renting a car and head out to Merzouga on your own, I'd advise against. Me and my friend did so on another part of the country: money-wise it was practically the same but experience-wise we ended up missing some gems on our trip. Trust Rachid, he knows where to stop, he'll show and talk about all the hidden places, he'll make sure your food is fresh and you won't be tired from driving for hours and hours (which means you'll take more out of what he shows you)."

Morocco is such a beautiful country and we highly recommend this trip and Discover Morocco. Their guides are friendly, intelligent and helpful. The trips can be tailored to your interests so make sure you talk to your guide and let them know if you do not want to do something. For example, we preferred to get back to Marrakech earlier rather than see the TV studios so we skipped that! They are not intrusive and will give you more/less information where you show interest. Read the small print - it is a long journey so be prepared to spend around 12 hours on the road although there are plenty of stops of interest along the way and lots of information from your guide. The guides speak multiple languages. Camping is in the desert and we had a tent to ourselves, food is great and there is music and a fire afterwards. Highlights included the camel trek, the stars in the night sky (unbelievable), the sunset and sunrise in the dunes and the scenery during the drive. Would highly recommend this company (and the transfers to and from the airport are great)!"

My 2D-1N at the desert birthday experience:Friends recommended me the tour with them, specially Rachid, and it was the best advice I have been given in various years. Rachid was very responsive and keen to help even from before we formally booked the trip, recommending hotels and everything. This would only increase and get better along the trip. He and Risham picked us up from the airport and got us to our hotel. Next day picked us up early morning for a nice history lesson along the way and along a great music mix of anything you can think of. We made a great bonding since the beginning and dance in the car and everything. Breakfast was perfect, Risham's driving was exceptional, Rachid's stories, history lessons, funny anecdotes and fun facts made our morning. We stopped couple times to enjoy the views of the mountains, Berber culture, etc. We enjoyed of the famous Ait-ben-haddou where we went to a Berber's house, saw techniques of art and a lot of time to enjoy and take pics. We then headed to the desert where it was one of my best experiences of my life. On my bday getting to a camel a ride it for 1hr+ then got treated like a king by very friendly, charismatic, funny, humble and most unique Berber people, specially Negrito por el mundo. We gave ourselves nicknames, made jokes, talked about life, etc. it was full moon amd the view couldn't get better. We had dinner made and served by the Berber, which was the best I ate at Marrakech, on top of a dune with wine which Rachid helped us picking. After that we had the bonfire and music. I engaged playing percussion and guitar and to be honest I felt home, like I was spending my bday with friends and family.For my surprise they started singing happy birthday in various languages and one of them picked me up to the restaurant and there was a bday cake. That reassured me that I was part of them and they were part pf me, as well that the decision to book this tour was the best decision ever. Next day woke up early, after sleeping well in the tent, to watch the sunrise and they got us a full-on breakfst. We made our way back to Marrakesh with some stops to see the culture, how the Berber made their living, etc. it all ended dropping us to the hotel. Next day they picked us up and dropped us at the airport. Finally, I will definitely recommend this experience to everyone I meet. And even to myself, bc we all need a break like this from the stress at work or simply life. I feel really grateful and blessed for the service, gifts and efforts done by Rachid and Risham. Will never forget what we lived through and it is virtually impossible to top this birthday trip. Thanks to both for everything and making me feel at home and with friends and family. Rauluy"

It was a 2/3 days long trip where we ate with local people, dance, play music, talk and know by better hand the culture. It's a tour indeed for all the family, at it's not rough or too challenging.

We had mini tours in historical sites like Ait Ben Haddou and the Draa Valley with very knowledge local guides. The highlight was visiting Tinfou dunes for a camel ride and camping in a berber tent. The night there was magical! Everyone at the camp was friendly and professional providing food and music to round out the night. Mustafa got us back to the city safely and it felt like we took a trip with a friend not just a tour guide. The whole team at DiscoverMorocco are excellent!

            "review": "Best Birthday Surprise EVER- Thank you, Rachid for making us feel so SPECIAL and LOVED ! Expectations exceeded !. It was my second trip in Morocco so i have a good base to compare and i must say Rachid exceeded my expectations and managed to make me and my partner feel so special...The first time I did this crazy road trip, we were with a local guide on a private tour which was quite exotic (think sleeping on an old carpet in the middle of the palm trees with the muddy river as our luxury swimming pool in hot August).I must admit I had reservations if the group tour would be as good as the private one (i am a fan of authentic experiences) but being on a very tight budget and with limited time to organize, I started contacting the best tour operators on Trip Advisor...All of them said they don't organize group tours which is quite understandable considering it's half the price... and just when i thought it's impossible to go to the desert for less than 350 euros per person, Rachid replied- YES and i was so happy and excited...120 euros for 3 days including petrol, 2 breakfasts, 2 dinners and 2 nights, 2 guides... sounded more than reasonable... He replied to all my emails very quickly and accommodated even the smallest request- from organizing vegetarian meals to recommending a good hammam for our last night in Marrakesh...What i didn't expect was the BIG surprise Rachid had prepared for my birthday... In a country where so many people try to take as much as possible from the tourists (understandably so as this is their main source of income) and during their high season, Rachid decided to reduce the initially agreed price by 50% purely because he couldn't be our guide (his group tour was cancelled in the last minute but he didn't cancel ours). On the morning when he came to pick us up at the agreed time , he gave me a beautiful silver necklace with Fatima hand which i felt protected me throughout the whole trip (totally unexpected as i am just a stranger, a customer who happens to have a birthday) and then announced that the last surprise is that instead of being in the camp with the 2 groups (which we later discovered had no toilet, running water or any facilities but tents with 6 mattresses), we will be alone in a luxury camp as a birthday present.... What an experience- just the two of us on the camels in the middle of the sand dunes watching the sunset, a whole camp for us with 3 friendly, welcoming people waiting to serve a beautifully presented, delicious 3 course meal that we were trying to finish as it was so good but we were too full just after the delicious starters... the tent had a king size bed, en-suite bathroom with hot water powered by the solar panels just next to the camp, everything was immaculately clean and it was our best night in Morocco (even if we stayed in good riads in Marrakesh)... Just the perfect 5* gateway - Desert Camp Bouchedor True, the private tour allowed more freedom to explore many places... but did I feel like a princess? We saw so many things- beautiful canyons, high cliffs, green mountains, the highest desert dunes, exotic palm gardens- a diverse landscape offering so much to photographers like us that we beat our own record with the 1600 photos taken in just 4 days :) recommend it ? absolutely, undoubtedly, totally YES ! For couples, for friends, for families, for solo travelers.... You will all have an experience that will stay with you long after you are back home.... so different from the all inclusive type of holiday when all you do is sunbathe, eat and explore the souks in Marrakech (not that this is bad- it's ok for people who need a total break from everything) .... but this will give you MEMORIES FOR LIFE.... truly magical..."

On the way we also visit many point of historical interest. When we arrived there were camels waiting for us in our camp into the Dunes. We spent an unforgettable night with the guide and the Berber Trib, who were singing and playing bongos for us. Your guide to the desert and the people who you gonna meet there will be part of your journey so is very important choose the right person.

The evening with the Bedouin was great fun and we were surprised to have our own tent even though it was a group tour. The camel ride was good fun with the group. Being in a group wasn't a problem at all, I would definitely recommend this over a private tour, which is much more expensive. There were only 2things which were slightly disappointing: the food at the road-side stops was not very tasty, and tourists prices. Also the Tinfou Dunes are not massive, I was expecting Sahara-like landscape but the dune rises out of the flat rocky desert. But these things didn't ruin the trip and overall I would definitely recommend this tour. The Moroccans couldn't have made us feel more welcome and really made the experience enjoyable."

Kamar drove really well and was very patient when my daughter felt car sick. Eventually we were turned back as the snow had closed the road. So we regrouped and took another option to visit the waterfalls. The following day Rachid and Kamar took us to Essaouria for the day. We had a brilliant time. Rachid looked after us so well and organised a guide in Essaouria. He chose the best of the fish and seafood and had it cooked fresh for us. We all enjoyed an amazing lunch.

Never once did he make me feel rushed during our stops. When we arrived to our destination in the desert we kept our bags in his car so we wouldn't have to take them with us on the camel ride. After the camel ride he met us at our camp site right away and asked us how everything went. He seemed very receptive and intuitive to all of our needs and when we all wanted to have privacy within our group. On the trip back he was just as good about letting us stop whenever we wanted.

We were all in the same age.I like roadtrips and you drive a lot!!! For me it was the perfect way see the beautiful landscape of this country. Everyone in Marocco drives crazy. Our guide (forgot his name) was a very good driver. I felt nearly always safe except when he drove sometimes with 70 km/h just 2 m behind another car. But he saved our lifes as he evades very quick off the road as another car was falsely on our lane in a curve. That was very good, because the passenger airbags were turned off!!! We were also not allowed to turn them on!!! We did not get a lot of information about the country from our guide. Unfortunatelly I recognized only now that we neither visited the town Telouet nor the Atlas Film Studios!!! Instead we had lunch in overprized restaurants with dry chicken. Just at the third day we could conviced the guide to bring us to a local place. 6 people ate for the same price as one did in the other restaurants. He also brought us to shops, but himself bought his water and snacks somewhere else... this is embarrassing!!! We had also no chance to dicover A\u00eft-Ben-Haddou alone. We were pushed through the town by another guide without information.The first night was in a clean hotel. There was also a maroccan family and we did music until the night. This was very nice.I have no problem with stopping at local manufactures and cooperatives which want to sell blankets, argan oil and carpets, but then I also want to stop at a beautiful place to enjoy the landscape and do some photos.The tour to the berber camp by dromedary was organized very well. We had a spacious dinner with other young groups. Then there was music again but everything was agganged and inauthentic. We got very good information from the desert berber guide and enjoyed the incredible stars in the sky.The last day was just driving. I liked it, but we did actually just stopped for lunch.All in all a good way to see the country. I had a lot of luck with my group. The guide did a good job driving us around, but a very bad job giving us information about his country. That he also forgot to bring us to Telouet and the Film Studios brings me to the conclusion that I can not recommend this company! I also do not understand why the passenger airbags were turned of!

            "review": "A Good Start to the New Year!. This was our second booking with Discover Morocco. We travelled in early January with our family. Again, Rachid was excellent in making all the arrangement for the trip. This time, we decided to travel more locally around Marrakesh. It gave us the opportunity to visit several Berber villages. The trip comprised of trekking in the High Atlas mountains and spending time in local Berber houses. The hospitality was amazing and the locals so friendly. Speaking little French or Arabic, we were still able to interact with the locals. My daughter had a wonderful time playing with the village children. Overall, I feel that Discover Morocco offers us a peace of mind. no worries about pick up from the airport, getting from A to B, accommodation and what we are going to eat on a daily basis? its all pre-arranged to your personal preference. Personally, for me this is my ideal holiday/break. It takes you away from the daily routine of work etc in your normal daily life and truly gives you that relaxation that you need when you getaway! A word of thanks to Rachid, our lovely tour guide Abdellatif and all that we met who made our break so memorable. see you next time!"

We were only in Morocco for a short holiday and this was a great way to see the Atlas mountains and some of the Moroccan countryside. Booking the tour was easy, Rachid replied promptly and provided answers to any and all questions within 24 hours. Having a Moroccan driver/guide was great opportunity to ask questions and learn about Moroccan culture. We were encouraged to stop for pictures whenever we wanted. I was a little scared about what driving on the Moroccan mountain roads would be like but it was fine! Our driver was very safe, the car was comfortable, clean, and a newer model, the roads are in great condition and it was a beautiful scenic drive. If we ever go back I would book another tour with them again!"

In fact it exceed our expectations. Our first contact was with Rachid, with whom I communicate only via email. After a few discussion we agreed for a 2 days trip to Tinfou Desert and 1 day trip to Setti Fatma Waterfall.Both tours were great and one of the main reason for having this nice time was also our driver/ guide Youssef \u201cScorpion\u201d. Our experience did not start perfect in Marrakesh as we had to wait almost 3 hours at the passport control in airport. But Youssef was still waiting for us and he did not even received our SMS in which I was trying to let him know it will take a long time to get out from the airport.The road to the Tinfou Desert is long. So be prepare for a long drive but there are stops on the way were you can enjoy nice sceneries, villages and also there will be breakfast and lunch breaks.In the last day we enjoyed a lot the visit we made to the traditional Berber house and the breakfast was wonderful.I was together with 3 girls (one teenager) and we did not had any kind of problems. Marrakesh city was also a really nice surprise (except Medina part that was too crowded for us and did not spend much time there).Thanks again Rachid and Youssef and hope we manage to see each other again in the near future."

Rachid was quick to reply and I had a very smooth pre-trip arranging for this tour. Our driverguide for the trip, Abdellatif, was really amazing as well! He was super humorous and informative, and we were very entertained by him throughout the tour. He spoke good English, and was accommodating to stopping the vehicle whenever we want to take photos(: He was also great in giving food recommendations. We tried all the exotic food he recommended and were not disappointed! Sunrise, sunset and the night sky were gorgeous too.Everything about this tour was great except for a small incident: After the nomad camp stay, we were brought to a mini pottery tour. Everything was great until the pottery tour guy explicitly asked for tips when we refused to buy any souvenirs from him. It was quite ridiculous because he had this small talk with us the previous night, saying stuff like he just wants to make friends and not be concerned about money. And in less 12 hours he's asking us for money?!That aside. I would strongly recommend this tour to people visiting Morocco! (but we felt that 2D1N was a litte too short)"

When my friend and I decided to take a tour to the desert while visiting Marrakesh, we got overwhelm by the tons of offering available in the market. After reviewing some of the options, we decided to book a 2 days desert tour with Discover Morocco Day Tours as its review were quite nice and the price was very competitive. Communication was very good before the trip.The day of the tour, we got pick up at our Riad right on time and transportations was very comfortable. Rachid was with us all the time and he proved to be very knowledgeable regarding the different points of interest and the berber culture. When we got to the desert, we were immediately greeted by our rides, in other words, Dromadaires. The \"camel treck\" lasted around 1 hours and allowed us to enjoy the beautiful sunset and the moon coming up. Priceless! After the camel ride, we got to our camp that it was run by nomads. They prepared delicious food for us! We also gather by a bonfire and dance to the rhythm of their drums and other musical instruments. I had so much fun, that the night passed by so fast. I would definitely won't forget that night.On our way back we visited Kasbah, which is a famous location where movies are filmed. If you have seen movies like Cleopatra, Gladiator, just to mention some of the bunch, you have definitely seen this on the tv or movie screen. It was surreal been there.My friend and I had one of the most wonderful experiences and were very please that we pick this tour company for our desert experience. Rachid was always going the extra mile. Definitely, the best tour guide that I have ever had. Totally would recommended this tour!"

Prior to booking this trip, my friend and I searched many companies offering a very similar experience throught the Atlas Mountains and Zagora Desert. Several were far more expensive and seemed to offer the same exact thing. After reading reviews, pricing and communicating with the others, we chose Discover Morocco Day Tours and the 2-day Tour to the Desert. Rachid was fantastic in completing our booking, confirmed with us the day before and was punctual when he sent for someone to pick us up promptly the morning of the tour. Our guide, spoke fantastic English, had a great sense of humor and was incredibly knowledgeable of every town and culture of the \"Berbers\". The first stop was in Ait Berka for Breakfast of which was a cute spot with fantastic tea and coffee overlooking the mountains, next we passed through Aglmous Village then stopped for lunch in Ourzazate. The drive continued through the vast mountain range passing through Ait Souen, Agdez, Zagoura City and then we arrived in Tinfou Desert. Upon arriving in Tinfou Desert we were immediately greeted with two Dromadaire (Camels with one hump not two) I quickly learned! Lol. We rode them for about 45-60 min and our guide for the ride was adorable he would stop in several spots to take pictures of us. As the sun came down it was quite unique to see the moon coming up over the mountains at the same time. As the ride concluded we were greeted by our tour guide and the Berber community at this camp. We had a great dinner, bonfire, music (they are so talented!) and slept in a tent. In the morning, we were served tea/coffee and pastries before we hit the road. On the way back we stopped in Kasbah for lunch and the tour of a famous location where many movies were filmed. In fact, they were filming one while we were there. The village is elevated of what appears to be in a mountain and centuries old that certainly takes you back! It was a wonderful and very memorable experience and I would certainly do it again! Thank you Rachid for your wonderful hospitality and for making this experience possible!"

I have chosen this travel agency after all great review on Tripadvisor.I was ready to pay more, and when you are ready to pay more YOU MUST READY TO RECEIVE MORE\u2026Unfortunately it did not happen and besides the service received, also the tour itself, it is not such a great tour,At the end I would say, be ready to find the cheapest tour as all of them offer the same service, at least you will not feel robbed.Here my personal comments1) The promised English speaking guide turned out to be an elementary English knowledge guide.2) As the lunch was not included, I would expect to have the possibility either to eat with the entire group or to eat somewhere else, or go for a walkHe always took us in the restaurants he wanted without giving us any alternative. On the way back we stopped for Lunch in a stranded place, in the middle of nowhere.Therefore no other places, or possibility to do something different.3) We were promised to have a private tent, for 2, when we arrived the guardian told us that all of tent are for 4 people and he would not have cared.Besides he was smoking JOINTS..yes JOINTS...he even asked my gf a rolling paper, in front of us, and the guide left us to go to the camp on ourselves with locals without any support. At least he would had came with us and check if everything was fineBefore leaving all group alone. We were told: other companies are cheaper because they offered tent for 8 people. The real truth is that ALL TENT ARE FOR 4\u20264) Food quality in the desert is really poor from Dinner to Breakfast5) You ride the camels just before the sunset is over.6) The camp is just located on the border of the desert just a couple of Dunes, if your expect to be surrounded by Dunes, forget it7) Ait Ben Haddou, the only place, which was worth visiting and maybe staying there to have lunch walk around, I gently asked: why do not we have lunch here? The guide answer: because we take you to a placeWhich we trust\u2026.well we ended up in a small caf\u00e8/restaurant in the middle of no where\u20268) The tour should be tailored IN A BETTER WAY\u2026I talked to Rachid and he offered me a compensation of 400 Dirham, which was a good-gesture form his side, and he felt sorry, however instead of the compensation he tried to offer me a complimentary taxi to the airportAffirming that for a transfer to the airport at 04.30am next morning, would had cost euro 30/35\u2026well I gently denied his offer and I took back the 400 Dirham, in fact the taxi cost me JUST 70 DIRHAM/7 euro\u2026At the end I would suggest, if you really want to make this kind of trip (I will not do it again even for FREE..LONG DRIVE..all curves/bends), check for the cheapest company which offer you the same tour for 50/55 euros. You can also have (asking) the transfer from airport upon arrival to your accommodation. At least you would not be disappointed with all great expectations."

My boyfriend and I booked the 3 day Desert Tour with Rachid after we compared many different tour & excursion companies online. Not only was the price the best out of 6 that we asked, Rachid was the only one who was patient with all of our questions and emails. You'll be amazed by how fast he replies! The trip was amazing from beginning to end. On our first day, Rachid came and picked us up from our riad on time like he said, helped carry our heavy backpacks to the car, introduced us to the friendliest driver, and our wonderful journey begun. Every stop we made on our way to the Sahara was amazing. Rachid would explain the area and sites to us, give us as much time as we like to explore the place, and even help take wonderful photos for us. & because of Rachid, we also met some of the most amazing people, including the local Nomads, Berbers, and our camel ride guide Hassam. By the end of this tour, we truly became good friends and promised he'll always have a place to stay if he came to visit us in Canada! If you are considering any type of excursions or tour in Morocco, definitely go with Discover Morocco Tours! After a long 3 weeks of visiting Italy, France, and Morocco, my boyfriend and I both agree that the 3 day Desert Tour was definitely the best part of it all. Thank you again, our Moroccan brother Rachid!"

Our guide Abdel was amazing - his knowledge of the Morrocan history and landscape was astounding. Not to mention he was a really fun guy. To top it all off, after the tour, Rasheed, the owner, invited us into his home for dinner (homemade Tagine). It was clear this was way more than a business transaction to them.

My wife and I visited Morocco for the first time and we booked the 2 day Sahara tour with Discover Morocco based on the excellent reviews online and our own experience is no different. From the moment we sent our inquiries, Rachid was very prompt in answering all our many questions before we even booked their service. We are very pleased we decided to go with Discover Morocco. From the time we were collected in our Riad at Marrakech, to our many significant stops at the Atlas Mountains, Rachid made everything as smooth as possible, he was very knowledgeable, flexible with the schedule and our route. Each step of the tour has its unique and amazing impact on me and my wife. Particularly noteworthy to us is how Rachid involves locals outsourcing so they would also earn and the local economy benefits. We stopped at a local cooperative at the Atlas mountains, Rachid worked with locals in the Sahara, from the camel ride guides, to the nomad camp where we stayed. On the way back the following day Rachid involved another local guide when we stopped at Ait Ben Haddou. We had an amazing time from start to finish. We learned a lot from Rachid, met amazing people, partake into the local culture and totally enjoyed the sights and sound of the Sahara. First hand experience from picking dates from trees, stopping at Henna farms and showing us some local cotton trees. I rarely give a 5 star rating. Discover Morocco has exceeded my expectations and deserves the 5 star rating. Its all worth it. If we are to have another trip to Moroccco I would not have second thoughts booking another tour with Rachid."

Our first day we drove through the Arlas mountains and filled our eyes with amazing sights. We also stopped at a woman run Argan cooperative and my biggest regret for the trip was I didn't bring cash to buy the products - they were amazing and the woman who showed us the process was very informative. You cannot believe it but we actually got rained out of the Sahara desert the first evening so we could not to ride the camels to the camp but Rachid rearranged for a dawn ride which was amazing! In stead we had impromptu delicious tea at his friends house and shop and then we drove to camp where we honestly ate the best Tagine we've ever tasted. We were serenaded by drumming and songs by a campfire under stars that night. And we woke up the next day to watch the sun rise from the top of a sand dune - and of course ride the camels! The second day was equally fantastic - Rachid stopped to buy us the best dates from the Draa Valley and we even stopped and picked them fresh off the trees. We also visited Ait Ben Haddou and had a personal tour of it and inside a local home. At all times Rachid was full of local and personal knowledge about the Berber people and culture, and ever ready to answer my many questions. We can't thank Rachid enough for our amazing time!

From the moment, we landed in Marrakesh, we were well looked after by Discover Morocco . The friendliness and hospitality was really lovely especially since we were travelling with our children. The whole booking and organisation of the tour was really good. Also, I feel what made it so special is that our input of what places we wanted to visit was taken in account. A copy of the Lonely planet was good to have as a guide when discussing with the tour operators of what and where to go!Overall, we travelled north to Fez visiting many places en route with plenty of breaks which made it quite a chilled out experience. It didn't feel that you were always in the car! Amazing views we saw as we took the Atlas mountain scenic route.Two days in Fez was wonderful. To experience the wonderful historical and cultural experience with our city tour guide. Quite a contrast from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. In my opinion, Fez was quite laid back and relaxing while staying in a beautiful Riad in the old Medina. Our journey took us south to the Merzouga desert with daily activities en route. Observing the monkeys and horse rides. Again, the journey was long but well-planned so there were sufficient breaks to relax with the locals. I've experience desert camping before but Merzouga experience was out of this world. A camel ride to our camp, which took 2hr and then greeted with Morocco Tea on arrival. The food was like a banquet and the accommodation was clean with excellent bathroom facilities. The camp fire and the singing was uplifting to experience.The rest of the tour involved travelling west back to Marrakesh. Gorges, mountain villages etc. After an overnight stay in Marrakesh, we were travelled for a few days to Agadir which was arranged by us but, Discover Morocco arranged the transport.. Since, we travelled from London to Marrakesh, we had our outbound flight from Marrakesh. we phoned Discover Morocco who arranged transport back to the airport.what more can I say except I'm going back at Christmas!!!!!"

We were collected at our hotel by Abdull spot on 8am and taken to our transport for the day. He was great at explaining what we were going to do and in what order and sharing information as we went.Our first stop was at a Berber house for breakfast, I am always sceptical about these types of visits as ones I have been to in the past feel like set up houses but this felt so real. We wandered down a path through a gate in a wall and were inside a little compound, the family greeted him as a long lost friend and there was a genuine warmth on both sides. He showed us their personal Hamman and how they would light the fire to heat the water for it, onto the animal area where there were a couple of cows and a week old calf. Back to the house and he showed us where the stream outside had been channelled through the wall for washing and then into the kitchen area. The cooking area was two open fires where pots, tagines, trays could be placed over them. We were taught how to make mint tea, which was lovely and watched as our bread was cooked on the open fire. It was served with butter from the cow we had just seen and was like cottage cheese in texture and just the most amazing taste, there was honey (local and the most amazing ever) and olive oil. I could have stayed there all day eating that!Then on to our camel ride, just 20mins and to be honest that was enough to say we had tried it, Abdull took some great photos of us and we had a little caravan going as there were 3 camel calves that wandered along with us. The owners were lovely and also took photos and encouraged us to hold the camels while they did, no hint for tips simply nice people. On to the Atlas Mountains and we met another guide who trekked with us up through two villages where we had lunch at the 3rd on a balcony with amazing views. More mint tea and a tagine as requested by Abdull when we expressed an interest in them.On the way back to Marrakech we stopped for our quad biking, which was fun but the goggles are not that clean so a bit hard to see through at times.When we got back to Marrakech as we were not sure how to get back to our Riad from where we had parked Abdull walked back with us without hesitation. We were contacted by Rachid afterwards to make sure we had enjoyed our day and offering a free airport transport if we wished, having already arranged the hotel we declined but otherwise it would have been brilliant. All together we had been out from 8am to 6.30 by the time we got back, what a day!"

After 10 days together I felt like being part of their family. Rachid and Abdul have given me an incredible attention and service. I really recommend them for woman who wants to travel alone to Marocoo or also for couple and familiy. Part of my days there my boyfriend could stay with us and the other days just with Rachid and Abdul and the treatment was like if I were a Queen. Thanks a lot for everything! I will have all memories with me! Carlos is also thankfull for everyhting!"

He made our experience 10 times better and we were more prepared in the desert than any other tour. We were two teenage girls exploring and thanks to Abdellatif we never felt endangered. He knew how to fix every problem that we had with the upmost quality. I would recommend this tour to anyone and specifically Abdellatif."

Rachid was a good friend by the end of the day; he was gracious in telling us about the local area/sights as well as Moroccan and Berber culture, and answered all of our questions as well as just being very fun to chat and joke with!We had another guide for a small section of the tour around the waterfalls themselves and then met up with Rachid for lunch overlooking the falls (which was lovely, proper lamb tagine)..... Lunch/breakfast/drinks and things along the way Rachid paid for, he was incredibly generous and bought us souvenir gifts too and we got to meet some monkeys on the way back. Such a wonderful day, I couldn't recommend this more especially if you want to chat to somebody local and learn a bit about Morocco itself. Thank you so much Rachid, was an absolute pleasure meeting you!!"

We then made our way up to the waterfall where a guide arranged by the driver guided us on the short trek to the waterfall. The guide was great very informative.We ate lunch in the river then returned back to our hotel.Our driver Kareem (sorry for the spelling!) was just great, he made sure we were at a comfortable temperature whilst in the car, he kept on telling us if we wanted to stop off anywhere then just say (which we did), he was full of information, just small things which it was nice to be able to ask a local.It was made more than clear at each point that everything was included in the price, there was no pressure at all to tip the different people that we came into contact with, of course we did as it is only polite and the people were wonderful, I thought it was just with noting literally everything is included in the good value cost of the trip!We spent 4 nights in Marrakech and this was the best part of the trip by far! We are already looking to return to Morocco and if we do then we will for sure make another trip with this company.If you have any questions message me."

We left early in the morning and arrived in Tangier by mid-morning. Not having selected a tour guide beforehand, upon our arrival we were greeted by several industrious but questionable people. But then an middle aged man approached us and assisted us navigating our way through customs. He showed us his credentials and we decided to use him as our tour guide. His name is Foad Bssari from Discover Morocco Tours. Foad proceeded to take us on a wonderful all day tour of Tangier. His English is excellent and he was not at all pushy. We had a magnificent, thoroughly enjoyable and easygoing, walking and driving tour for 6 hours or so. Our experience in Tangier wound up being one of the highlights of our entire vacation. We saw local markets, religious and cultural sites, did some sightseeing, a little shopping (where we picked up some amazing, authentic Moroccan spices that we cherished and enjoyed when we returned home), and had delicious coffee (the only thing we were brave enough to drink or eat while we there) at a local coffee shop. I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful Foad was with us. He is a true gentleman and a great ambassador for Tangier. I look forward to returning to Tangier and using him again."

Our group consisted, of myself an my wife, a group of 3 from USA, Ouidad and the driver. The vehicle used was brilliant, enough space for all, and powerful AC!We were picked up on time and then we went off on the tour, seeing the tombs, the palace, the gardens and many other things too.Lunch is provided on the tour, but I would not call it a lunch, its a FEAST, there was enough food to feed a small army, from little tapas plates of pickles, to breads and olives. Then the main course, then the dessert, then fruit, then tea. Simply amazing. Ouidad also took us to several shops that only the Moroccan use, where we got a few bargains, cheaper then the Souks.We cannot thank Rachid enough for this tour and in general for all the help with other things. He arranged to pick us up and take us to a Beautiful Hammam place, all off his back.Thank you Rachid for an amazing tour and for everything else. You are a great credit to your business."

My colleagues from the travel industry recommended Discover Morocco and we booked three trips with them. That was definitely the best decision, as we had a fabulous time with our guide Rachid and our driver Essaleh there. Both were very professional and disposed of a huge knowledge about the country, culture, history and locals and revealed a great sense of humor. Especially the fact that on all three tours it was only the two of us and no big groups was a huge bonus. Our trip to Morocco was my first, but certainly not my last one there... If anyone intended to travel to Morocco, I would definitely advise to book their tours with Discover Morocco, especially if anyone is looking for a tailor made, private tour. Even if there might be other companies which offer their trips for less: I doubt they can offer the same professionalism - Some I kept track on myself and they were noncompetitive by far and even gave wrong information about history and culture."

Rachid and his colleague did everything and beyond to make us comfortable and to show us as much of Morocco as possible. We not only visited the major sights, but also got an insight into the lives of local people, local cuisine and customs. The night in the desert was amazing! Tents were big and comfortable, we even had regular bathrooms, all in the middle of the desert.

We stopped at a Berber house first where Rachid explained the various rooms in the house and talked about the Berber people. We also went on a short camel ride which delighted my daughter.The walk through the valley to the waterfall was amazing. Rachid hired a fantastic guide for us who held our daughter's hand right through every tricky bit and made sure she was completely safe. We asked to turn back at one point, thinking it was getting too much for us, but he assured us that she could do it and she was SO glad she carried on! The views were spectacular and our son is now desperate to come back to Morocco to properly tour the country.Rachid was extremely efficient, from the first email to enquire about prices through picking us up from our riad. It's always a bit nerve wracking booking an unknown guide, but I would highly recommend Rachid. He made both children (and us!) very happy.(I have photos which I will add later!)"

We were fortunate to have Abdul as our driver and Rachid as our guide. The excellence of our tour started from the time we landed. Although we were only due to start our tour on the following day, Rachid arranged for us to be picked up from the airport and he also ensure we were brought to our hotel. He told us what time he would arrive the next morning and also kindly offered his personal contact number just in case we got lost in Marrakesh that afternoon. We started our tour travelling in a comfortable SUV car and I must compliment Abdul on his excellent driving even on the curve roads along the Altas mountains. There is quite a bit of travelling by car throughout this tour to get from one town to another however the end destination is always worth the long journey. Rachid would give small talks along the way while we drove in perfect English. As the tour was private , the start timings each day was flexible and we could ask to stop along the way at scenic places if needed. Off the road, Rachid is happy to share more about the local experience in Morocco - more of the current picture rather than the history which one can easily read off the internet. Hence why the title the Real Morocco as it was interesting to learn about Abdul and Rachid perspective of current issues. They were also always happy to answer any questions we have about the country and its culture. The choice of hotels during the tour were also fantastic - each having its own charm. The highlight of the tour for me had to be driving through the Altas mountains and seeing its majestic views - although slight warning to those who are prone to motion sickness that it might be a difficult ride. The overnight stay in the desert is also a once in a life time experience which I highly recommend. To end of our visit to morocco, Rachid extended his generosity on our last night back in Marrakesh with a home cook tagine meal and freshly brewed mint tea. This was not on the tour outline but an extension of friendliness of our guide. Overall, this is a fantastic tour company to go with if you want to experience the real and amazing morocco. Our group of 4 girls always felt safe on the tour and Abdul and Rachid made it their personal mission to keep us entertain during the long car rides and well feed with good moroccan food. I would highly recommend this tour ! Thank you Discover Morocco!"

We were originally meant to do the one night Zagora desert trip but the roads were impassable due to snow so instead we did a day trip to the Ourika Valley and a day trip to Essaouria. The Ourika Valley trip was amazing - the scenery was beautiful, we got to ride camels, hike to a waterfall, had lunch at a stunning restaurant and visit a Moroccan home. Ismail our guide was fantastic... a really genuinely lovely person! I could not recommend this tour company more highly and we will 100% be going back to Morocco to do a desert tour with them as soon as we can."

I was going to Morocco and a friend recommended me this company for the dessert, and I have to say that is AMAZING in every single way. 1. The tour guide was extremely friendly, spoke spanish, english, french and arab. He made sure we were having fun all the time and had a lot of knowledge. Also, he took us to some great spots on the middle of the road for pictures. 2. The firs night we went to Dades Valley and it was great! We slept at a hotel, very comfortable and food was delicious. 3. Second night we slept at the dessert. Unforgettable experience. We did the camel ride and had a great experience. The Berbers at the camp were super cool, friendly and fun. 4. One thing I love about this company is that the main thing they focus on is that you are having a great time and they care about you. 5. We also spend NYE with them and also they picked us at the airport and everything was GREAT! Do not hesitate to contact them if you are going to Morocco. They would make your experience even better!"

You can be in contact all the time before the tour with its friendly manager Rachid, who can gives all information you need to know. The tour was guided by also friendly guy called Othman and he introduced all interesting places all around Ouarzazate and Dades Valley stoping in nice places for lunch and a good hotel in Gorges de Dades for sleeping. The price was really the cheaper I have found there. No minimum problem and you will envoy all details during the three-days tour to Merzouga."

There are a number of Sahara tour of the same kind available on the internet.and I discovered that many of them actually take the exact same route, activities and even end up in the same camp in Sahara. So the important thing is who you book the tour with. In that sense, we were so lucky we booked with Rachid! He is a very responsible person, always care about his guests, making sure everything goes well for us. We did only Sahara tour with him due to our limited time in Marrakech, but if we had more time to explore, we would definitely have gone for other tours with him too - next time for sure. Totally recommend this tour!"

We were given lots of interesting information and taken to lots of interesting sites such as an ancient hill town made from mud blocks, an old Foreign Legion fortress, film studios, Argan oil producers and many more besides. I would very strongly recommend Rachid because he was so helpful and supportive. We got far more out of the trip with Rachid's great help. It was excellent value for money as well. Liam"

I bought some shampoo, which I can confirm does amazing things for your hair!! We then travelled on, stopping off at lots of places on the way for photos and then on to Ait Ben Haddou, where a fantastic guide had been arranged for us. The whole place is utterly amazing and well worth the visit. The camel trip into the desert was an interesting one. I am used to riding horses, but this was an entirely different experience. The camp was brilliant. The tents had proper beds and were beautifully decorated on the inside. Dinner was absolutely lovely and the music and dancing very entertaining. Waking to watch sunrise was very special. We were sad to say goodbye to Rachid and the driver, both of which had been really good company over the two days. I would definitely recommend using this company!"

We visited a Berber village where we had a lovely lunch. We then drove to the desert through incredible scenery. We had an hour long camel trip to the tents and then returned to Marrakech the next day. They were great hosts very friendly, and good with children. We found it really interesting hearing about Morrocan culture and way of life. They also introduced us to some great music. Highly recommended if you are staying in Marrakech to get out of the city and see rural Morocco. Also if you are travelling independently they arrange for a driver to meet you at the airport which makes for a very easy start to the holiday. Nothing was too much trouble and they did their best to make the trip as interesting and comfortable as possible. Also we felt 100% safe - no need to have any concerns about leaving the city. Happy to answer any questions. Thanks again Rachid. Cath, Liam, Dom and Ollie."

From the moment I enquired about the tour, Rachid was incredibly helpful and not only booked us in on the day we had suggested but also arranged to meet us at the airport on our arrival (despite arriving two nights before the date of the tour).

We took a 1 night excursion to the town of Mhamid which is situated south of the Atlas mountains and is the last town before the Algerian border. It was a truly unforgettable experience and I highly recommed Discover Morocco Tours. We paid 4,600 Dirhams (about 460 Euros) for two people in cash because paying by card would have incurred an extra 45 Euros charge from the bank in Morocco. Our only recommendation to Discover Morocco Tours is to try and find a way to reduce the commission as paying by card would have been so much easier and convenient for us. A few days before, we had gone on a terrible excursion with one of the cheaper tour companies to the Ourika valley and completely regretted it. They just wanted us to spend money at many stops and didnt care about our experience. Discover Morocco Day Tours on the other hand, was the opposite! Rachid is very friendly, knowledgeable and keeps his promises. Rachid and his driver picked us up at 7am as promised. The journey through the Atlas mountains is long and heavy going, but his land cruiser is very comfotable and it made the 10 hours (in one day) a lot more bearable. We took many bathrooms stops and the cultural stops were insteresting and there wasn't any pressure to spend money. The scenery on the way to the desert is just stunning.When we arrived in M'hammid (around 5pm) we were greeted by Ismail, one of the Berber guides. We went by camel into the desert and arrived at the berber camp in time for sunset. Needless to say we took many (many!) photos. There was full moon and the peace and light of the desert is something everyone should experience!Ismail served us tea when we were finished with our photo taking and he seemed genuinely interested in talking to us. His helpers cooked us a tasty tangine and the singing began to the beat of the African drum. We had our turn on the drums and didn't do quite as well but it was fun and we had a lovely evening. The boys then took our beds out of the tent and we slept in the open air. Again, magical, romantic.... we loved it! We set the alarm for sunrise (6am) and after taking so many photos of the morning light on the dunes (again, stunning!) we headed back to M'hammid town on our trusty camels and then onto Marrakech by car. We were truly exhuasted on the journey back but Rachid couldn't have been more kind, helpful and attentive. Thank you Rachid for being an honest and accomodating guide. We highly recommend this tour company!"

            "review": "Great trip with Brother Rachid. After deciding on Morocco for our honeymoon, we knew we wanted someone to take us around the city of Marrakech and the countryside of Morocco. Reading the reviews on TripAdvisors, we found nothing but great reviews on Discover Morocco Day Tours and a guide named Rachid. I had emailed many different tour groups in Morocco and Rachid was the first to get back to me. Not only the first time, but ever time we emailed him with any questions, he would get right back to us without hesitation. I found that very comforting in a tour guide. From the day we got there, Rachid was waiting for us at the airport with a sign that had our name on it. He gathered our bags and we were off. From the moment we met him, we knew that we were in good hands. After a brief ride through the city, we arrived at the Souks where our Riad was located. Instead of dropping us off to find our way, Rachid walked us through the labyrinth of Marrakech markets to our hotel. On our walk, we mentioned that we wanted someone to take us through the Souks and he said that he would take care of it. Sure enough, the next morning we had a lovely gentleman named Mohammad waiting for us at our hotel to tour us through the Souks. It was an extra charge for the tour through the souks but well worth it. Mohammad spoke perfect english and was very informative as we toured.The next day, Rachid arrived promptly to our Riad at 7:20am for our Sahara Desert adventure. We jumped in the very clean and comfortable LandCruiser and were off! The journey to the Sahara was a long ride (about 8-10 hours) but the scenery was breathtaking. We drove over mountains that could rival the Colorado Rockies and next to cliffs that resembled the Grand Canyon. We stopped plenty of times for bathroom breaks and places that Rachid thought we would find interesting. We also stopped for a delicious lunch that was included in our package. Finally we arrived at the Sahara Desert (make sure you have plenty of water!) and our next mode of transportation, camels! Rachid and the driver let us out and we were then led by the Berber people on camel back to our camp site. Rachid and the driver drove themselves and all of our luggage in the car to the campsite. That was very nice because our other camp mates had to carry their own. The camel ride was about one hour through scrub and up and down sand dunes. It was beautiful and so much fun.After a lovely night sleeping under the stars (we pulled the beds out of the tent), we had an early start back in the car with Rachid and the driver. We skipped the camel ride back to the town and just got back in the car. Rachid had even more points of interest to show us on the drive back. We stopped at Ait Ben Addouh and took a great tour of the Kasbah, dozed off and on in the car and before your knew it, we were back in Marrakech. Rachid dropped us off at our next hotel, we said our goodbyes. It was hard to part ways after such a great couple of days! There is nothing better than taking a shower after a night in the desert. Once we had rinsed off at the hotel, we had to begin to make plans to get to the airport a couple days later. Our hotel was going to charge us 30 Euros for 5 minute ride to the airport. Obviously we did not want to pay that so I emailed Rachid to ask him what we should pay a taxi driver to get to the airport. Of course he got right back to us and said that he would send a driver and not to worry about what it costs. It was such a kind gesture to take of us like that. We did tip the driver but it did not seem necessary.All in all, Rachid literally was like a guardian watching over us the whole time we were in Morocco. He treated us like family. Even though we always felt safe, it was nice to have Brother Rachid looking out for us in such a foreign country. He said that once you do a trip to the desert, you are now family and that is why he will always be Brother Rachid to us. We highly recommend booking any tour with Rachid. He will exceed your expectations and made our trip to Morocco an incredible, once in a lifetime experience!"

We also took in the Majorelle Gardens (Yves San Laurent's), a much welcome oasis amongst the heat and speed of pace in the Medina. Our second day, was a trip out through the Atlas Mountains to Ait benhaddou. With Rachid as our guide, we were well looked after with plenty of water, photography stops and local information (and much laughter!) We spent time at the Kasbar (walking shoes essential), with amazing views across the desert land and mountains. We also had the privilege of finding more out about the Berner culture from our guide.

We met some people in our Riad who had booked this tour (two nights and a camel trek into the Sahara), and the day before they were set to leave, I phoned Rachid and asked him if we could come along. They managed to fit us in with no trouble whatsoever, much to our delight! Our guide for the trip was actually Kamal who was absolutely brilliant. As other people have said, nothing was too much trouble and we were able to stop whenever and wherever we wanted to. During our trip we stopped at a Kasbah which we were guided around (for an extra 15 dirham, I think). It was actually a very interesting visit with panoramic views of the surrounding landscape and a beautiful little town to look and shop around. After our visit to the Kasbah we went to a restaurant and were able to have a swim in the pool - a very needed cool off. Later that day we visited the Dades Gorge where we stayed the night in a nice hotel that was very welcome after a long day's drive. We had tagine for dinner and were then seranaded by a group of drummers which was really fun! The next day we drove down to the Sahara and, after our drive, went for a swim in a hotel swimming pool before our trek into the desert. We got onto camels and trekked into the desert where we stayed in a very authentic camp (although thankfully it had beds!). Overall we had a fantastic experience and, as one of the cheapest tours offered around Marrakech, it was certainly worth the money we paid for it. Kamal was the perfect guide and although he drove us over 400 miles, remained 100% happy and helpful. He also navigated the bends of the Atlas mountains expertly! I would definitely recommend this tour company and would use them again if I were to return to Morocco. Thanks Kamal and Rachid from Rachel and Zanny"

Our guide, Kamal was extremely helpful, happy and friendly. He also turned out to be a pretty good driver as he navigated his way around lorries on the mountain roads and kept us all safe in the car! We travelled in a 4x4 as there were only 6 of us on the trip which also meant that we could drive across a river and up to a few view points to get some good photos. The Riad was also good. The only thing I could say that was bad about it was that we had no hot water in our room but the staff were very friendly and we were serenaded after dinner by some Berber boys playing the drums. We then travelled towards the desert and got to have a swim in a pool before getting on our camels to ride into the desert at sunset. The Berber camp that we went to was great: friendly men and a fun camel ride with great pictures. We also had a good tagine and couscous dinner. We then travelled back to Marrakech the next day which was a long drive (10ish hours) but Kamal stopped enough times along the way to have breaks etc. I would recommend this tour to anyone and after doing some research into it, it looks like it's a pretty good price (120\u20ac) each. Kamal was a great guide and the company was very trustworthy. We had a great time and it really made our trip to morocco a bit more special."

            "review": "Marrakech & Merzouga Desert. This was our first visit to Morocco and Discover Morocco Tours made it such a memorable trip. We had only a few days and wanted to see as much as possible. Rachid put together an itinerary and made sure that every last detail was taken care of for us. MARRAKECH:We flew into Marrakech and Rachid was at the airport waiting with transportation to our riad (primary form of accommodation: equivalent to a b&b or guest house). We stayed in the heart of the medina (which was amazing) but vehicles can only take you so far. When we reached the gates Rachid had arranged for someone to meet us with a hand-pulled cart for our luggage. We were very grateful for this as it was still a good 10 minute walk through the narrow busy streets/alleyways of the medina to reach our riad. He gave us a little time to settle into our accommodation then arranged for an orientation city tour of Marrakech with a local guide who specialized in Marrakech walking tours. This was a good way to start the trip. We were able to see the different areas of the city, visit the palace, learn some history, see some of the local handcrafts in progress and shop in the market. If we hadn't taken this tour we would most likely not have ventured outside the medina on our own so it was great to see a little more of the city. Our time in Marrakech was amazing but the primary reason we chose Discover Morocco Tours was to see more of Morocco and visit the desert. Rachid met us at our riad early in the morning and off we went on our road trip! He had arranged a driver with a spacious van. We left Marrakech and began our adventure over the Atlas mountains into the desert.ROAD TRIP ACROSS MOROCCO:We chose the Merzouga desert trip because of the red sand. This was the Sahara we had always pictured. The Merzouga desert is almost twice the distance from Marrakech compared to the Zagora desert (the other option with white sand / smaller dunes). So the itinerary we were interested in is usually a long excursion. That said, we only had a few days in Morocco. Rachid was amazing and worked with us to put together an excursion that would allow us to visit Merzouga in our timeframe and budget. The downside would be a lot of traveling in a short time (hundreds of miles in a matter of days) but we were prepared to deal with that and Rachid did his best to break it up for us. Considering how far we had to go we still saw so much! It's incredible how different the mountains, villages and deserts are from the Morocco we experienced in Marrakech. The stops that Rachid chose gave an incredible taste of the country. It was a really good balance of known attractions and \"real Morocco\". At most of the stops Rachid accompanied us as the guide but for some sites he arranged a local guide to take us around. These local guides rely on tour companies to bring visitors to see their villages so we were happy to learn from the locals.DESERT CAMPING:It took two days to get to the red desert. Rachid arranged accommodation at a hotel just outside the Dades Gorges for us the first night (which was excellent). When we reached Merzouga the next day we established base at a desert hotel. The camels and desert camping excursions are all associated with hotels just outside the dunes so that there is a place for the drivers to stay while visitors are in the desert. This arrangement also permits visitors to lock up their belongings and allows use of the facilities (showers) when visitors return which we were very grateful for. Merzouga is actually the name of the town where these hotels that offer desert excursions are located. The dunes themselves are called Erg Chebbi. The desert was worth every second spent on the road to get there. We were met at the hotel by one of the Berbers from the camp. He had a camel for each of us and led us over the dunes into the Sahara. About an hour into the camel trek we stopped to watch the sunset. We were already deep enough into the desert that nothing but dunes could be seen whichever direction you looked and the sun hitting the red sand is like nothing I could ever describe. I can't imagine anything in our lifetime will compare to the half hour spent on top of that dune. Ever.When we were ready we continued our trek into the desert. It was another hour before we reached camp but when you are on a camel trek in the Sahara you take in every minute. The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars provided plenty of light. In fact when we reached camp we spent the first half hour laying in the dunes watching shooting stars.Dinner was delicious. Typical Moroccan tagine: bread, meat, potatoes and vegetables with fruit for dessert. After dinner a campfire was built. There were five other groups from all over staying at the camp so we all tried to introduce ourselves. Then the berber men joined the campfire and performed traditional berber music for about an hour. They got us up dancing and even passed their instruments around for everyone to try. It was fantastic.We did not know what to expect from the camping experience but it was very enjoyable. Sleeping tents were all together and faced inward to a communal area. We had our own tent complete with cots dressed in blankets and pillows. Dinner was served in a large tent at the front of camp decorated in beautiful moroccan textiles with tables and chairs. And there were outhouse-style toilets just outside the tents. It definitely exceeded our expectations.On the morning we left our camels were waiting for us outside of camp. I will admit that this second camel ride was felt far more than our first. Despite the padding from the blankets on the harness, riding camels will leave it's mark on your inner thighs. But despite a little discomfort the views of the Sahara were no less spectacular on the way out.Because of our limited timeframe we had to head directly back to Marrakech from Merzouga. It was a long drive (12+hrs) but the views along the way were incredible. When we arrived Rachid walked with us to our riad, making sure we found it in the dark. The following morning he met us for breakfast where we marked our travels on a map bought in the market and he arranged transport back to the airport in time for our flight. Rachid walked with us all the way to the check-in desk. By this time we were saying goodbye to a friend, not just our guide. You will not get an experience like this with any old tour company.If we are fortunate enough to return to Morocco in the near future we wouldn't think twice before booking with Discover Morocco Tours again. We had such a fantastic experience. Thank you Rachid!!!"

I can quite easily say it was the best part of our time in Morocco. We were picked up by Kamal who was our host for the two days. Kamal was a fantastic tour guide. He was easy going, had a great sense of humour and always made sure we were comfortable. We stopped at a number of different places to explore and take photos. He was very knowledgeable and was happy to answer any questions we had. I would highly recommend Kamal to anyone thinking about doing a tour with Discover Morocco Tours. If you have 4-5 days in Marrakesh, this tour is perfect. We were joined by another couple from Britain which we got on with very well. The landscape on the way to Zagoura is truly breathtaking and the people were friendly wherever we went. We eventually reached Zagoura and were picked by the Berbers who provided the camel ride and night in the desert. We stayed in the Berber camp and had a great time. The dinner, atmosphere and morning sunsets were all fantastic. The next day Kamal picked us up and we commenced the journey back to Marrakesh.Many thanks to Kamal and the team. You guys provided a memorable experience.Shane and NicolaSydney, Australia"

We then hiked for an hour and a half in Ourkia valley to a wonderful waterfall (this was tough work in the heat but well worth it!). The day finished with a great lunch by the river. Our driver and tour guide were very kind and helpful - they also played some great music on the drive between stops! We very much enjoyed the day and highly recommend this tour company."

I went to Marrakech with 2 friends, at first we weren't sure if we wanted to visit the desert, partly because the drive was so long and many of the tours were really expensive. Luckily my friend found out about Discover Morocco Tours. We booked through email and Rachid was really patient and informative to respond to all our questions. They even arranged a driver to pick us up at the airport. The 2 day trip to Zagoura Desert was definitely the best part of our trip. We stop every hour or so to take pictures of the gorgeous scenery and to stretch our legs. We even visited the Berber villages where many movies were shot. This made the 8 hr drive pass by in a blink. When we arrived at the desert we rode camels to the camp which was another exciting experience. We were expecting to have to sleep in sleeping bags in the tent, but the camp was a lot better than what we were expecting with electricity and actual beds! Looking at the stars in the middle of the desert was another unforgettable experience. We woke up early to see the sunrise in the desert the next morning and they served nice coffee, mint tea and bread for breakfast. The drive back to Marrakech was comfortable with the friendly driver and Rachid who is very genuine, helpful and made us feel very welcomed. I would definitely recommend Discover Morocco tours and hope to go back and see more of Morocco!"

The Trip started with Rachid (our host) and Abdul (our driver) coming to our Riad (Matham) to pick us up, so we wouldn't get lost trying to find them. The kindness didn't stop there, throughout the two days with Rachid and Abdul both went out of their way to make our trip great even when they didn't have to. From little gestures such as buying us Moroccan sweets we had never tried before, to bigger such as secretly getting a birthday cake for my dads birthday with his name written on it - and getting the whole camp to sing happy birthday. He was touched by Rachid's kindness and I was grateful for the gesture. As for the trip itself, we made lots of stops at interesting places which I won't go into, but as a photographer, they were all awesome.We took a camel ride (my first experience of this) through the Zogora desert at sunset which was beautiful, then stayed over night in a tent which was a massive surprise - It wasn't cold, wasn't cover in desert bugs, and was actually quite comfortable. Food was also provided at night and in the morning. Was a lot of fun!I recommend this to anyone, even people who aren't so 'outdoorsy'. Thanks Rachid for a great trip."

I have just returned from a week long trip to Marrakech for my honeymoon with my wife and chose discover Morocco tours after wading through various options on trip advisor. I wasn't disappointed. I was in contact with Rachid before the honeymoon and he was extremely helpful and patient in asking my numerous questions (I wanted to get it right!) and so that filled me with confidence before getting out there. We chose the 2 day trips to the Ozud waterfalls and the 3 valleys and they were really worth it, we both thoroughly enjoyed the trips and gave us a good flavour of Morocco life. What particularly struck us about Rachid and our driver Abdul was how professional and knowledgeable they were but also so down to earth, friendly and good fun they were too, and they seemed to get the balance perfectly. We liked how they were leaving us to chat and be by ourselves for a lot of the time too - they weren't in our faces all the time, like I guess some tour guides might be, and we appreciated that. Rachid was flexible too when we decided to change one of our trips and we thought this might be a problem but he was fine with it. What was also good was how it really felt like we were incontrol and he accommodated us so well - from giving us a chance to stop and take pics etc whenever we wanted to picking us up bang on time at our Riad and giving us lots of helpful info about life in Marrakech. 2 things that also impressed me about this compared with other options were that Rachid picked us up and took us back to the airport as part of the package, and the money for the day trips was for everything - lunch and drinks included, so we didn't have to worry about anything.All in all a brilliant time with Rachid and Abdul who felt more like friends than guides by the end of the week. We are keen to return one day."

We then met Rachid and he showed us to our Riad I had booked. Rachid provided us with a map and his telephone number and some really good tips for our stay. The following morning Amanar took us on our overnight trip to the desert and we had a great time, he went above and beyond, he has a great sense of humour and was very knowledgeable. On the 2nd day he found us a donkey to have pictures with as I had mentioned it the day before. We stopped at many stalls/shops on the way through the mountains and he was patient whilst us girls shopped! Finally both Amanar and Rachid met us on our last day to get us back to the airport. I know I have waffled on but these guys are brilliant, I cannot fault them in any way and I highly recommend them. We had a great time and have returned home with some lovely memories."

Rachid answered very promptly and was more than willing to tailor the trip to our needs. I booked two trips (12th/13th Feb 2014). One was a day tour around Marrakech and the main attractions and souks. This was by a local guide and not Rachid. This really gave me and my husband a real life in sight into the medina. This was a trip by foot and we saw many famous sights and also went deep into hidden souks. On the second day we had arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains/three valleys. The day started at 7.50am. We were with Rachid and his friend Abdul. We travelled first to have camel ride. We then went to eat breakfast in a Berber house where we were really looked after and had fresh home made traditional food. We then stopped at various places on our journey to see beautiful picturesque views. The next stop was a mountain bike ride. Me and my husband have never laughed so much. We are slim but unfit and in our late 20's and attempting to do a mountain bike ride! Although physically difficult for us (we also wore jeans and it was really hot!) the views and experience was incredible. After this we needed some much needed lunch! Rachid and Abdul treated us to some traditional street food which was gorgeous - think of a spiced barbecued burger. The day did not end here. We then went on to finish the day quad biking! This was fantastic. The views were stunning and Rachid really knew the best spots! We were back to our hotel by 5.15pm despite such a busy day.Throughout the day Rachid and Abdul were always joking with us and answered any questions. We spoke about the Moroccan culture, politics and religion. No question was left unanswered. They were open minded and like they both said they treat you like family! Would definitely recommend Rachid and his company. I will never forget these memories!"

Rachid was a very very outstanding guide. He was friendly, fun, helpful, and most of all very informative. We were picked up right at the promised time. The journey consisted of many beautiful and interesting places, to which you can adjust to your interest. To name a few: Ait benhaddou, todra gorge, atlas mountain, etc.. We can stop whenever we want; we are the king! In addition Rachid would be very happy to take our picture. The hotels provided during the tour were top class. We couldnt ask for more!I would very much recommend Rachid as your guide when you have the chance to visit Marocco. Thanks Rachid! I would really love to visit Marocco again."

Call into a Berber house on the way for mint tea, fresh baked bread and local honey.And then a camel ride. Definitely worth it although I warn you the hike/climb up is not for faint hearts or those who are totally unfit. Wear suitable footwear. There is in fact an easier way which you come down by. Our guide Rachid was a pleasure to meet and helped make it a great day out."

He was there to pick us up in front of our riad, right on time. He was very friendly and had a good sense of humor. The tour was just what we needed for a nice get-away from Marrakech.

I also felt that his rates were quite competitive. Go for it!! Have a blast!"

Rachid and the driver picked us up at our hotel at the exact time he said he would, and drove us about an hour outside of Marrakech and showed us a great day. We did so many different things (ride camel, hike to waterfalls, eat traditional food, dress in traditional garb) which made the trip exciting. I would absolutely recommend him, he was a lot of fun, very honest and very kind. He even bought the two of us bracelets on his own!"

We booked two tours with him and were not disappointed. He accompanied us on both. The first tour was to Ait Ben-Haddou with another couple. It was a long day but worth it. We had an off-road adventure and were able to stop wherever we asked. Breakfast and lunch were included and well-worth it. Best tour meals I've ever had. The second trip was to the Ourika Valley, a lovely place. This time we were with three other people, so the tour was extremely personal. Again, breakfast and lunch included. Rachid is a wonderful host. The tour is well worth the money and his prices are extremely competitive. We have made a friend for life!"

Rachid out-sourced this, and we got the impression he is trying to find the right guides for this particular tour to meet his high standards. Our guide was ok - not bad, but certainly not great... The tour finishes early afternoon. The second tour was the Ait benhaddou/Ouarzazate/Atlas mountain trip. A long day from 8am to 9pm, but what a day. Rachid and his outstanding driver took us not only to the highlights of this special tour, but also took time to do some extras (taking a more scenic route there, doing a great 4x4 \"race\" across the desert towards Ouarzazate, etc.). I would HIGHLY recommend this day out with Rachid. The 3rd tour was the Ourika Valley trip, which was pretty good, particularly the last climb from the first waterfall up. Overall we really like Rachid. He is clearly proud of his tradition and country, and we got a small taste of this beautiful place with his warm hospitality and engaging character! I regret not doing a 2 day trip into the desert with him - other reviews seem to be raving about that too!"

The trip was amazing, we went through Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah, Ouarzazate, Todgha to the Todra Gorge, Tinjdad and finally to Merzouga. The landscape changed every 20 minuten, and so did the colors. The hotel was good, and the nomad camp was even better. Great camel ride watching the sunset and sunrise, lovely food, nice berber music and the sky full of stars was amazing! The last day Rachid joined us and guided us back to Marrakech. He was great company, and offered to help us at any time, apart from the desert trip. We really felt comfortable with this tour agency and its guides, they really love their work and know a lot about the Morrocan culture and sites. We would definitely book this tour or another tour at this agency again!"

I had seen some very good reviews of Rachid on the internet and I was not disappointed to have booked with him!! He took my girlfriend and me on an excursion to Ait Benhaddou and made it the experience of a lifetime!Rachid is very knowledgeable, friendly and funny! From the start of the day until we returned to Marrakech, he made it a fun, exciting and interesting day. He gave us lots of information about the Berber culture, Moroccan history and the sights we were seeing; he answered all of our questions and was an endless source of knowledge.We stopped at many places on our journey through the Atlas mountains: for a Berber breakfast (which was included in the price of the tour), to see some amazing and interesting settlements and views, at a place where they made argan oil (a lady there gave us a short tour and explained how they produced the various oils used for cosmetics and eating), to stop for coffee breaks, and at a number of Berber stalls selling souvenirs and the likes.The driver was very safe and experienced but managed to take make the journey quick and pleasant. His car was very comfortable with air conditioning; Rachid chatted with us throughout the journey and even played Berber music for us on the car stereo!When we reached Ait Benhaddou we stopped for a delicious lunch (also included) and enjoyed views of the Kasbah before proceeding to see it up close. Rachid showed me how to tie a Berber style turban (I think it is called a Shesh or Chan) which helped protect me from the bright sun. He let us take our time and stop to look at things that we took interest in, he never rushed us.I cannot explain what a great man Rachid is, he is very down to earth and has an amazing outlook on life! He told us of some of his life experiences, some of which are very moving. He is a Berber himself and knew most of the people we met along our journey. He explained that some guides are in cahoots with the traders and will take tourists to places that overcharge you and give commission back to the guide. He doesn't take any commission from any of the traders and even told us which places were overcharging customers and not to buy anything from them.If you get a chance to take an excursion with Rachid then you simply must do it! You will not regret it!! If I am able to go back in Marrakech again then I will definitely go on an excursion to the dessert with Rachid as I would love to spend a night or two trekking through the dunes and seeing the stars!Thank you Rachid, this was the highlight of our holiday!"

We booked this trip with complete ease - we contacted Rachid the evening before the trip and had a reply within hours confirming that we would be able to travel the next day, which we didnt expect. We initially chose Rachid due to the great price that was offered, and we weren't disappointed. We were picked up from our Riad on time by our friendly, English-speaking guide and taken to Rachid's comfortable mini-van with seatbelts and air conditioning. We then proceeded to drive out of Marrakech with our guide explaining a few things about the Berbers and Morocco. He was polite and friendly and Rachid drives very well and is very careful. The hour and a half journey is split well, meaning we weren't in the minivan for the full time before we were seeing our attractions.Our first stop consisted of visiting a traditional Berber family home, where we were provided with a tour as well as a delicious breakfast made by the family themselves. Although there were other tourists there, it did not seem overcrowded or make much of a difference. The people and the sights from the house were wonderful.Following our stop here, we continued ahead to our camel ride, which was a little shorter than stated on the website, but not by much. We were still pleased with the amount of riding we got to do, with beautiful views either side. We also stopped at a small place where Argan Oil is produced and sold, with an English speaking lady who provided all the information we needed.Our final stop was in the Ourika Valley itself, where we walked to the waterfalls. It was quite a journey, which took around 50 minutes each way but the sights were excellent and we felt well looked after by our guide who was friendly and chatty throughout. We seemed to pass the touristy waterfall and headed to another one which was more secluded and private, which was great. After we had walked back down we were provided with a delicious free three course lunch, where we only had to pay for our own drinks and a tip.This concluded our trip and we were escorted back to our Riad by Rachid and our guide. The drive back was pleasant and a well deserved sit down!"

You will soon learn just how much Rachid feels for and dedicates to the people of his part of the world. Most of all it's fair to say, you will also learn Rachid is really not interested in making commissions or great profits as he'll purposely steer you away from dodgy sellers and overpriced restaurants - don't just take my word for it, use your own judgement here.The tour itself covered great distance and many cultures that you travelled to Morocco to see.

Rachid always delivered what he promised.My two kids got on with him great."

It was an amazing trip where we got in touch with the Berber culture: living in the desert and in the Atlas mountains. A minibus brought us to several places where we could enjoy the view, taste the local food and learn about the culture. We were accompanied by a sympathetic guide (Rachid), who showed us the most beautiful places and entertained us with his humor and open-minded view. We did a long distance, but that didn\u2019t really bother because we stopped so much. We\u2019ve also seen Ouerazate, a Kasbah town were the gladiator (and many more) was filmed. The most exciting part of the journey was the camel ride through the Sahara and the feast afterwards in the Berber camp. We ate traditional food and we danced the camel dance under the moonlight.It was an amazing experience, that I would surely recomand!The price is fair and all-included (food, sleeping place, camel ride, transportation\u2026)We did this during ramadan and this was not a problem."

The price is more than fair and Rachid doesn't waste your time taking you to nonsense places to make commission. He's an honest and genuine guy, as is his driver. Wicked tour and an awesome time.

Had the chance to visit a Berber family and was treated to traditional breakfast (all the meals included in the price!) and got to see how Moroccan mint tea is prepared and served. Got to ride camels too and visited an institute where Moroccan oil and other natural remedies are being made. The height of the day was however the hike up the mountains to see the waterfalls. It was cool in the mountains and the scenery was extremely beautiful. It wasn't an entirely easy hike but our guide made sure that everyone safely made it up to the waterfalls.

It was hands-down our best decision during our entire stay in Marrakesh. During our trip we visited the Merzouga Desert and had an amazing sunset camel ride through the red sands and giant dunes. We got to stay with a berber camp and look at the stars, which are simply stunning in the Sahara Desert. Our trip was lead by the owner of the company Rachid, and he was an amazing guide. In my previous trip to Morocco (a couple of years back) my guide simply pointed out landscapes without much explanation but during this trip we were very lucky to have Rachid, who is very knowledgeable and made an effort to tell us about the history and culture of the places we were visiting. Rachid made everything in our trip run smoothly and he even made a point to help us with other logistics of our trip after the excursion was over. Rachid and Discover Morocco helped make our trip a wonderful and memorable experience and I recommend Discover Morocco to anyone planning a trip to Marrakesh. I also recommend taking time to visit the Merzouga Desert which is the desert you see in photographs of the Sahara (orange sand, large sand dunes). During my previous trip I visited the Zagoura Desert which was still a great trip though not quite as gorgeous and memorable as the Merzouga. Thanks so much Rachid for an amazing trip and experience!! -Ana from California"

We found Rachid to be warm, friendly, easy to talk too and very responsive to our emails and questions; plus he and his assistants were punctual (which clients always appreciate). He was flexible enough to work with us so as to deviate a bit from the norm and include a trip to an authentic Berber market - which we found facinating.

I did the 3 day, 2 night excursion to the Merzouga Desert (has beautiful red sand, large dunes) and it's for sure one of the best trips I've ever been on. There was suppose to be another group joining the tour but they cancelled last minute and instead of cancelling the tour altogether, our guide Rachid still did it (for the same price) but with just me and my two friends. He always went out of his way to accommodate our needs and made sure we were always comfortable throughout our trip. Rachid, along with the driver who were both very considerate and always had our best interest at heart, made us feel more like family than just another regular tour group. Rachid was very knowledgeable in Berber culture and Morocco's history, and we were able to see everything from the Kasbah to the gorges and the Atlas Mountains. The camel ride to the Merzouga desert was incredible, you start right before sunset (and get to stop while the sun's setting to take some epic photos) and the return ride is right before sunrise. We had a hilarious nomad guide that led our camels to the campsite and when we arrived we were served a nice traditional dinner along with live music and dancing. On the way back we were able to shower and change at a hotel so the overall trip is well thought out and very accommodating. Rachid is hands down the best guide you could ask for, so I strongly recommend this tour (he is the owner) as well as doing the 3 day, 2 night excursion to get to the Merzouga Desert (it's worth the extra day!!) This is definitely going down as one of my most memorable experiences. Thanks Rachid!! -Natasha, USA"

Firstly we would like to thank Rachid and his colleague, a very responsible and smart driver, for everything they did on the trip.Before coming to Marrakech, we contacted like 20 different travel agencies with the same quote: 3 days, 2 nights in Merzouga (Erg Chebbi sand dunes). Rachid (Discover Morocco Tours) gave us an offer we couldn't resist: the price was really good, the tour was private (for 4 people), we didn't have to worry about anything apart from memorizing all that interesting information our guide was giving us. I have to point out the fact that everything was included in the price (a night in a hotel, three meals per day, a camel ride, night in a tent in nomad's camp). Because most agencies only include one or two meals. You can get a better price from other tour agencies if you join a shared tour with many people. But in this case you will not get a guide (only a driver) and no freedom at all. And we could freely ask to stop and have a short break in some scenic areas on the way to the desert, we could ask about anything and Rachid would answer as he's very knowledgeable and attentive.Thank you and hope to meet you again!Lithuanians:)"

He exceeds all of the duties of a tour guide.

I soon as I arrived home I emailed my mom everything that we had done and learned that day. She replied: \"In the end I'm glad that you went to Morocco and I'm glad you did it the way you did-- you will remember [Rishard for] your whole life.\" She is right. Here is a summary of my favorite day in Morocco:(he picks you up at your hostel/hotel)Stop One: Berber House- tour of a traditional Berber house (mini history lesson by Rishard)- Berber breakfast (included in the price and possibly the best bread of my entire life!)- lesson on how to make Moroccan mint tea (and a few cups of course)Stop Two: Camel Ride- everyone needs to ride a camel when in MoroccoStop Three: Moroccan Oil/Spice Tour- tour and lesson in the garden about all of the native plants in Morocco- demonstration on how Moroccan Oil is made (you can even help the ladies make some)- lesson on how all the plants are turned into beauty, medicinal and edible products- drink the best cup of tea of your entire lifeStop Four: Waterfall Hike- farther in the mountains there is a hike up to the waterfalls- if you aren't an avid hiker Rishard will hold your hand and lift you up over the rocks so that you make it to the waterfall safelyStop Five: Lunch by the River(included in the price)- three course meal that is delicious**I never had a bad meal in Morocco but this was definitely a really good oneEverything was included in the initial price, which for all the services is an amazing bargain."

Beside the wonderful experience in a Berber House( breakfast) beside of the views and the camel ride, the guide , Rishard Amallah was very freindly all the time. He was a very good representative of his country, not only teach us everything about his culture but also helping us even to bargain!All the guys I meet that day became my friends and we discovered Marrakesh together the following days. So that was one of the most interesting tour I have done there. The meal was wonderful as well Really worthy!!! thanks for making those days in Marroco really amazing..Hugs from BRAZIL"

Everything was beautiful and exciting, but the thing we loved the most was the journey to the waterfalls with Rachid and his driver. We really enjoyed the tour, the taxi was clean, Rachid was smart and helpful and show us what it means to be a berber, free people, in 21th century. It means to be passionate, have a strong ethic and be honest with tourists, and help them to understand what are the real things to do in Morocco. He's like a friend, he doesn't take you to useless shops, we smiled a lot. Great experience!!"

The guide was timely, polite, and helpful. Everything we needed was provided. I would stress that you should be sure the terms of your tour including cost are very clear before booking the tour. We had some mis-communication and it left me feeling more like a 3 star review than 5 star. However, my review is 4 stars because my family realy enjoyed the tour."

We emailed 2 days before going and Rachid gave us 2 quotes, one to go with a group and one to go by ourselves. We went with the group and Rachid was the best value of 4 other quotes apart from one which we didn't trust. He came to the hotel the next morning to discuss what we wanted to do and we wanted to stay in a Berber tent, ride camels (still got camel bum) and visit Ait Ben Haidou.Rachid looked after us very well. He has had experience managing a hotel and it shows because he is very professional. He has been brought up on a strong set of Berber ethics and seems to be reluctant to charge for his service! He is a good tour guide as well with previous agency experience and being brought up in the mountains he knows his stuff. His English is good but a little hard to understand at first. Rachid will quickly become your friend rather than a guide. I am particularly grateful for him getting my bag back after leaving it on the wrong bus!Other tour guides will take you to shops where you will be pressured to buy stuff but Rachid isn't interested in commission. Instead he uses his network to get you the best price. All the restaurants or cafes were good quality and Rachid will pay for it for you which makes things a lot easier. He is quick to buy you drinks even if you don't really want one! But it is all included. The best value though is Rachids time. Despite paying group price, Rachid was our private guide, we only piggybacked another vehicle to keep costs down."

Right away, Rachid calmed our worries about the hectic and unfamiliar city, and sat down with us to show us on a map where we were and how to get to key attractions such as Djemaa el Fna and the souks. He even lent us his cell phone so that we could call for help if we got lost! That really impressed us, since he showed such great trust and hospitality before even getting to know us. Later on in the trip, my fiance got kind of sick (probably from some bad food at the food stalls). My fiance didn't feel up to trying to find food ourselves while he was sick, and we didn't have a lot of money, so we talked to Rachid and Rachid took us to a reliable, clean little local restaurant (not catering to tourists). Rachid helped us order and buy some roast chicken with bread and veggies. Nothing fancy, but very solid and we knew we could trust its cleanliness and quality because of Rachid. Overall, Rachid is extremely friendly, personable, considerate, knowledgeable, and helpful for anything you might need. He speaks good English, and you will not regret taking a tour with him. You will feel like you've made a great friend in Morocco--one you'll want to hang on to. I highly recommend his services."

After walking, lost, around Marrakech trying to find our riad, I thought the trip was going to be a little hectic. Then, I met Rachid!!! For the rest of the time I had no time getting around the city and the surrounding area. Rachid knows so many people and places and has such a loving family, that you will feel like you belong in Morocco! Traveling around Morocco can be a bit daunting, but Rachid, with such a kind heart and open arms, can make anyone's trip wonderful. It helps to have his knowledge of the Atlas mountains, Marrakech and Morocco to feel like you've really seen Morocco, really gotten a feeling for its people and culture. I recommend taking a tour with him if you visiting Morocco. It will be the highlight of your trip.\u0634\u0643\u0631 Rachid"

Rishard set up and took me and 2 friends on this awesome trip to check out waterfalls and some of the beautiful wilderness in the interior of morocco. We had a private car pick us up at the hotel and drive us a couple hours. Just the car ride alone was great since Rishard is the man and made the trip feel like 2 minutes. Hes the nicest guy. After we did some hiking and saw the waterfalls, we had a beautiful authentic moroccan tajin lunch with monkeys running around the all-outdoors restaurant and the waterfalls as our view. This could have been the highlight of the trip since we were all just chilling enjoying the food, friends, and scenery. Life doesnt get better. Anyways, we did some more hiking and sight seeing and loved it all. We also took a 30 minute rafting adventure down one of the rivers which was chill. Overall, i'd recommend doing this trip again, but make sure you do it with Rishard. He made the trip go smoothly & memorably."

We met Mohamed, the director and owner of the Marrakech Travel Services, in his modest office and were instantly warmed to him and his team's attentive and professional approach to our travel requests. We wanted to make a day trip into the Atlas Mountains and Ourika valley but also requested to make a stopover at the famous Richard Branson owned hotel called Kasbah Tamadot to enjoy lunch whilst soaking up the amazing panoramic views of the mountains. This section of the trip was not part of their regular excursion route but Mohamed was happy to accommodate and assured us this would not be a problem. He said he would explain everything about the modified route to his driver ahead of the trip the next morning. My wife and I were picked up promptly the following day from our hotel by his courteous and professional driver & guide Abdellah. He had obviously spoken to Mohamed, as promised, as there was a clear understanding and no confusion of our intended itinerary at the outset. The minivan was air-conditioned, clean and comfortable which was important for the long day ahead. Abdellah, himself born and brought up as a Berber, kept us informed and entertained during our journey with his occasional amusing quips about the Berber taxis (mules) Berber Wembley stadium (a small sandy make-shift soccer pitch) and Berber McDonald's (a lone roadside meat vendor)!!Our visit into the Berber village, across the mountains and back to Marrakech was very smooth with occasional strategic stops for photographs. We returned with fond memories of life in the mountains. We felt confident and safe with our driver throughout the day and would have no hesitation in recommending Mohamed and his team at Marrakech Travel Services to our friends and family for future reservations. Thank you and hope to see you all again in Marrakech soon. Dr Sanjay Gupta"

Keep in mind though that the guide is not included and you have to pay 3 euros extra for him.

We didn't set off until almost sunset and left before sunrise which felt like not much time considering we spent nearly 2 days getting there!It seems that MTS provide the transport and the driver and the driver arranges the rest of the tour en route.

We noticed this group have really good reviews so we thought we'd try them out, rather than spending a fortune at our hotel for excursions. It was an easy 15 min walk from our hotel, sofitel, to find the marrakesh travel service office. You can also take a 5 min taxi drive to the office, which costs around 15/25d to get there. We met Abdullah and Ali there where we discussed some excursion options. They were really helpful and offered us three excursions at a very good price. All in all we payed 1,250d for the full day Atlas mountain trek, half day walking city tour with guide and the half day quad biking. where we chose to have one quad for us both and swapped half way because it worked out cheaper. Excluding the walking tour where we met the guide at the travel office, Ali or Abdullah would promptly pick us up from the hotel, along with the driver, at the time specified (they were always early). We had a fantastic time on all of the excursions, all of the guides and drivers made us feel comfortable, they are very trustworthy and they all have fluent knowledge of many languages, mostly European. If you want to go to the souks and the square without any hassle, we definitely recommend making use of the guide, our tour guide was called Mohammid, as they know the local language as well as people within the souks therefore yoy can geberally get the best price for whatever you want to buy.Overall, we would highly recommend, especially if you dont want to be ripped off for excursions by your hotel.

On our first day we actually went to the office in medina and booked this trip. We were greeted by friendly faces and we were looking forward to the trip ahead. I had researched this 3D2N tours extensively before coming and realized there are many companies which provide this tour. Some are quite cheap and some are quite expensive. This seemed to be a mid range option and with all the good reviews, it seemed like a easy choice. We were picked up right on time and taken to a minivan in the square. The minivan went a short distance to pickup other people and then the 3D2N people were asked to change vans. We thought this was a bit odd as our company agent dropped us to the first van.The new van was fine with AC and we had around 18 people which was pretty comfortable as it could seat 20. However as we started to chat with everyone, we realized that most of them were from hostels in Medina and had booked their tour directly from the hostels through various different tour companies and had paid the cheaper rate of about \u00a365-70 Euros. We soon began to realize that there is no difference between the cheaper and mid range option of these tours. It's seems like all the companies group the customers together when it's not so busy so there is no point in paying a premium. As such, our driver was very nice however, spoke little English and gave very little guidance about the plan of each day. Also, when we booked we were told that we would be making 5-6 stops along the way to see different sites. Of these, we actually only did three. However the three we did were really amazing which was the Ksar of Ait Ben haddou, the gorge and the visit to a berber family. We had local guides which was great. They did ask for tips but that's expected in morocco.The desert part of the tour was simply amazing and a great experience. The camel rides are only 1 hour each but that's more than enough time to appreciate the ride and enjoy the view. After 1 hr on the camels you will be happy to arrive trust me! The camp is quite basic but comfortable for one nights sleep. Don't expect to shower or feel clean however the food was great and the bathrooms were surprisingly clean. The Berber hosts were really great and made the night. The drive back is very long as per all the other reviews! But given how far you have to go, it's kind of expected. I didn't mind the traveling however I didn't appreciate the lunch stops along the way. We were taken to restaurants in the middle of nowhere even though we drove past several town centers along the way. Their prices ranged between 90-130 dirhams per meal. The food wasn't bad, however I didn't like how we were forced to eat here because we had no other choice. These places are made for tourists. But I think that's their plan. Overall, we really did enjoy the desert experience and would still recommend this tour, however we do feel slightly ripped off and cheated. Unfortunately I wouldn't book through this company again because you will be paying a premium for no reason. There are many other places to book for cheaper and you will all be grouped into the same tour."

The minivans are quite new and comfortable the driver spoke good english and the tourguides told interesting stories about the sites. Furthermore, they were among the few people we met in morocco, who did not ask for extra money. The hotel of the first night had a nice few in one of the green valley of the atlas mountains. The hotel had a pool and the dinner was served at the terrace during sunset. The camel riding and the night in the desert was fun, climbing the dunes in the sunset and playing drums with the local guides there. The last day back to Marrakech is a long drive, but its a long distance back. There is nothing to complain. I highly recommend to choose this agency, we liked this trip a lot!"

Over the course of three days, our driver, Mohammed Gadoma drove us through the Atlas Mountains and surrounding deserts all the way to the Sahara, where we road camels into the desert (as cool as I ever hoped it would be) and slept in Berber tents. I actually chose to sleep out on the sands it was amazing. I highly reccomend the trip for anyone who enjoys road trips and amazing landscapes. The Berber villages were every bit exotic as I could have dreamed and it really felt like a setting for Game of Thrones."

They warned the tour operator that I am intolerant to gluten and our tour guide also warned people responsible for food in hotel/camp. I recommend brining your own gluten free bread or rice cakes to the trip, for everything else it was taken care of. In restaurants for lunch you have plenty of options so GF lunch is not a problem.In case of a solo traveller or a single-sex couple travelling together, you might get another person in your room on the first night in hotel. So if you don't want to share, make sure that agency confirms private room (for me it was at no cost). For the second night you don't have much of a choice, you will (most probably) have to share the tent :)You can leave your stuff in the minivan, so I recommend taking an additional smaller backpack for repacking for the night in the desert.Don't expect too much of other than Sahara or A\u00eft Ben Haddou - you get to see these two pretty well; in other cities you only make a short stop or only drive through."

However, the agency should inform you about the real conditions. The first hotel was really basic, in fact we were really cold, see the pictures. People were nice, friendly, but I was expecting something better, specially because I know people that did the same trip with another agency and stayed in a hotel with more facilities. For the desert, we were told that we would stay in one tent alone, and we had to share it with other 2 couples. Please go prepared to a really basic structure. They also told us that the cost covered 3 hours of camel riding, 1:30 in the sunset and then 1:30 in the sunrise. In fact, it's just 30 minutes. I suppose 1:30 it's to much, but just did not liked that they did not gave us the right information. All in all, it was a good experience, specially because the group was really good!"

Suitable attired with tough walking boots, we scrambled over extremely rough rocky terrain for about 20 minutes at which point sadly I started to feel unwell (? Altitude sickness). We decided not to continue and returned to base alone. When the group returned from the waterfall, many of the participants who were considerably younger than us said they really struggled as the \"walk\" became extremely steep, rocky and hazardous. At the end of the tour, the guide was very blatant in his request and expectation of a tip. As Europeans we found this very embarrassing.

You could do it with your own rented car but might feel somewhat lost along the way and it is quite nice to have a (already paid) guide and dinner waiting for you.Winter is a good time to visit: Less tourists and less heat, but do bring a jacket and scarf for the evenings and dessert night."

Even before arriving in Morocco I already had a good impression about marrakesh travel services. I emailed back and forth with Mr. Abdellah who answered every single one of my questions. He gave me all the details and confirmations I needed and was always very quick to reply back. I hoped that this same type of good service and attentiveness would be apparent on the tour itself. I must say I was definitely not disappointed! Mr Ali, who is one of the main organizers of the trip, arranged a pickup for me from the airport. Not only that but he also walked me all the way to the doorstep of my hotel. As a first time solo traveler who was anxious and a bit uncertain it was nice to have someone who was willing to lead the way which made me feel much more at ease. He was very nice and welcoming.The next day was the pickup to start the drive towards the Dades gorges. I had booked a 3 day trip to the desert. Along the way there were stops to take pictures of the many beautiful landscapes that were truly amazing. The tour of Ait Benhaddou was very informative and interesting. It was a filming location for movies/shows like gladiator, the mummy and game of thrones which was cool. The hotel we stayed at was nice and we were served a delicious meal that night which was a great way to end the day. The next day we visited a berber village and were invited into their home to drink tea and see how the intricate carpets are made by hand. Later that day we arrived at the much anticipated location, the sahara desert! We hopped on our camels and made our way through the dunes and enjoyed a beautiful sunset. Later on we arrived at our camping site where we enjoyed some delicious food and sat by the campfire. The next morning we hopped back on our camels to our transportation and drove back to the city of Marrakech. The driver of the tourbus was good at safely maneuvering around the winding roads along the mountains. He also spoke four different languages which meant he could communicate with everyone in our group!I definitely would recommend this trip. I had a wonderful time and memories that will last me a lifetime. You definitely will not be dissapointed!"

There are numerous companies to pick from, and it was becoming quite the challenge to pick a company that would actually include what they promised in the package. After scouring the medina and checking out about half a dozen companies offering the same package, we finally went with the 3 day 2 night Desert Trek with Marrakesh Travel Services. Ali was very professional, answered all our questions and never pressured us to book with his company. Their prices are very reasonable and the tour itself was very organized. The vans were clean, tour guides spoke English, and we felt taken care of. The best part of the tour is definitely the last night when you ride the camels and camp in the desert underneath the amazing stars. It's an unforgettable experience with a great tour company, highly recommend!"

First we went on a tour with some other company, but we didn't feel safe, because the driver was most of the time on a phone, even writting and reading during driving a very narrow road. Also a car was in bad condition.So we looked for another company and we were very lucky to find Marrakesh Travel Services with its manager Mohamed. He tried to do his best to pleasure us. He gave us his probably best driver Mohamed, who was not only a driver, but also a very good (personal) guide. Also we got a very good car. Usually you have to pay for a guide with personal guide around 100 EUR/person, but a cost of a trip is much lower when you take just a driver. But as I mentioned our driver Mohamed was better guide than a professional (official) we took for a city tour in Marrakech. We took 2 trips: first to Essaouira, a beautiful city on a cost. The cost was 25 EUR/person for a whole day trip. Second day we took a trip to Ouarzazate with a highlight of a trip, a special place called Ksar of Ait-Ben-Haddou. But before you come to this place it takes a very, very long (4 hours on way) adventurous drive over Atlas Mountains, but is definitely worth it. This whole trip cost us 30 EUR/person. Children payed half price. Despite a dangerous road we felt very safe in hands of our friend Mohamed.We would definitely recommend this company since you get almost a personal tour for the price of ride only. And with that, they give you 1.000 smiles."

When we arrived in the Sahara desert, our camels were waiting for us and we rode them about an hour to the camp site. The camp site far exceeded our expectations. Groups of four shared a spacious tent with beds and they even had electrical plugs in them. Once we settled in, we listened to live moroccan music and ate traditional tagine. The musicians performed and danced for us all night, I will never forget this amazing experience. Our tour guide \"brother raad\" was extremely accomodating and he even invited us to a surprise dinner with his boss after we returned to Marrakesh.

For experience, it was a bit hard but excited. There is a bathroom and toilet for man and woman, each. Dinner was good. The music was good and special.

He explained the differences between Riads and Dars and why the city is built the way it is. The last part of our tour was inside the Souks, assisting us with our first haggling experiences and giving us advice and guidance on how to find our way back to the main square. He also helped me to locate an authentic natural henna tattooist as I have a very severe allergy to the black henna.

And I have to say, we weren't let down. He lived up to every review. He met us at our hotel, which was a 10 mins walk out of the medina bang on time. We then took a slow walk in to the medina with him explaining the layout of the city and the area we were in as we went. We then spent the next few hours (we finished at 4.15) walking around the medina with him explaining many interesting bits. We stopped for a drink in a lovely riad, he left us for lunch in his favourite snack bar (whilst he went to the mosque), showed us the school he'd been to, the bakery (the baker has been there for 50 years), the hammam, and took us on a winding walk through the bits of the medina where you can still see the items being made by the craftsmen. We'd have been very lost without him.At the end of our tour he helped us get a taxi home (we were very hot, sweaty and dehydrated by then) and when the taxi driver wasn't sure where he was going Abdul came back with us then went home himself.At no point did he take us to his 'favourite' stalls. He was happy to give advice along the way - we subsequently went back and tried some of the bars and restaurants, which all lived up to his comments - and just gave us a good flavour of the medina. The reviews are justified. We felt like we'd seen some good things, learned a lot and got a few good photos along the way. We'd absolutely recommend this tour.Warning: it is a walking tour so take plenty of water (although you'll be able to buy along the way), wear a hat and comfy shoes and grab shade where you can."

He did not disappoint, exceeding all of my expectations. My goal for the tour was to feel comfortable navigating the medina on my own and Abdul helped me do just that - identify landmarks and an easy path to follow on future outings. Abdul introduced me to all the wonders of the medina, including countless talented artisans, beautiful crafts, delicious snacks, engaging history lessons, and breathtaking buildings. A visit to Marrakech is not complete without a tour with Abdul! He is a kind and thoughtful guide who is incredibly knowledgable about this beautiful city. I would highly recommend his tour to anyone visiting the city for the first time, and when I return, I look forward to signing up for one of his day trips, as I know it will be equally terrific! Abdul, thank you again for helping me discover the magic that is Marrakech."

Marrakesh was for us an exotic bucket list item and seeing it for one full day thru the proud and knowledgeable eyes of a local, made it that much more interesting. By the time we separated from Abdul, we felt as if we were leaving behind a family member. We were picked up promptly at our hotel and started the journey on foot around the city and the famous jamaa el fna. I will preface by saying, this is not a shopping tour.. Although Abdul was very accommodating and patient whenever we wanted to look/touch/haggle and purchase something , (even helping us with suggestions and translations), we felt that his whole purpose was showing us the city and teaching us the history he is so proud of. One of the most calm and dignified demeanor ive ever encountered, he walked with us for an entire day, taking us to hidden spots where locals clearly knew and respected him, protecting us (lol) from the sometimes too aggressive market vendors in the market and sharing his knowledge. Abdul, it was a pleasure spending the day with you and we appreciate it that much more given that you spared no effort in showing us everything you could, although it couldn't have been easy doing it in all that heat, for that many hours all while observing the holy Ramadan. As-Sal\u0101mu Alaykum! We will see you again!"

            "review": "A must when visiting Marrakech. We had a brilliant experience with MGDT. We were a group of 8 and usually I think Youssef would suggest a smaller group; afterwards I can see why! I would say may be up to 4 is ideal and everyone should be fully engaged unlike our group as there is so much to see and so much history. Youssefs representatives Hassan and Noura were excellent however; patient and knowledgeable. We had to split our time into two 3 hour tours as we could not complete everything in one day due to the size of our group. Thankfully Youssef was able to arrange for Noura to come on the second day at short notice. Youssef has always been pleasant and cooperative. All our communication was by email prior to leaving the UK. We paid after the tour.In away we were fortunate to have split the tour between Hassan and Noura. Hassan is from a Berber background and had a lot of knowledge about his people. At the end of the tour he took us to a rooftop berber restaurant which served us totally top drawer food. Likewise Noura was from a Arab background and was able to give us a different perspective on things. She also took us to a great restaurant in the Medina which would have never found by ourselves. Both tours were great and worked out well for our group. Everone was happy with the experience which is difficult to achieve. We saw a lot, took plenty of great pictures, ate some great food, and our guides were excellent."

Right away he asked us what we would like to do so he could plan the best route for us. We decided on going to the medina and exploring the souks and ending our tour in the main square. Abdul is very informative and was happy to answer our many questions. He also pointed out many of the famous buildings of the city such the big towers and hotels . Along the way he gave us many of the local secrets on how to navigate the medina which we found very useful. Abdul told us his favorite stalls in the markets (stall #14 and #98), where the best views are, where to get fresh orange juice, how to get to the main square from a certain point and much more. The snack breaks and the lunch spot were overall pretty good. A plus is that he gives you privacy to dine with your own family during lunch. Abdul was also happy to take pictures of the family and he took us to some of the best photo spots in Medina. Another plus about Abdul is that he is great with kids and accommodating their needs. Abdul made it fun with lots of interesting facts and places to look forward to. He was very patient and was very flexible when one kid was tired. Abdul also brought us to all the shops we wanted: dried fruit and nut, slipper store, jewelry etc., and most importantly he saved time and effort (and stress) but negotiating the price for us. We never felt any pressure to shop or buy. The day went by very quickly and all four of us, including the kids, enjoyed the tour very much. We highly recommend Abdul and Morocco Guided tours!!"

Abdul had really great information regarding the medinas, the squares and the culture. He was extremely relatable and spoke very great english. He showed us some of the people and the places he really considers to be the heart and tradition of Morocco, and I won't reveal those to you but they were exactly what this tour is all about.

The first tour was really good, Abdul showed us around the markets and the mosques explaining all about his beautiful country, people and culture. Abdul is a real fountain of knowledge and keeps the tour interesting. Our second trip was up into the Altas Mountains, again we loved this trip. I won't go into too much detail as it will spoil the day if you go but it is truly magical. We loved the whole day even the walk and the views are breathtaking.

I had read many reviews about Abdul, one of the Tour guides prior to going to Marrakech and was fortunate enough to have been able to book 2 half days. We were interested not only places to see and shopping , but an understanding of Moroccan history and culture . I learned lots, not just facts and figures, but a glimpse at life, in a culture steeped deep in history, beauty , family and spiritual life.I learned lots about the craftsmanship and what to look for in the different things I was shopping for. Abdul's tips and teaching was helpful as my husband and I navigated the souks later on in the week on our own. He will also provide suggestions for a variety of other activities such as cooking schools, and massages. In addition to a walk within the medinas souks, and historical places, we were taken into one of the residential area homes (now a gallery) in the medina which was away from the busyness of the market.It was a wonderful walking tour at a pace that provided ample time for conversation as we explored. If you want to get Abdul as a guide, book ahead of time because he is in demand and you will understand why if you are fortunate enough to get himThanks Abdul. we will treasure the memories of this trip, one of the best I have ever taken.Alice"

This trip with Abdul is not to be missed. He is incredibly informative and answered all of our questions, ranging from cooking to history. We were picked up from our Riad, bang on time, and escorted to the lovely air conditioned car. Our driver for the day was brilliant, we felt very safe with his driving skills. Our first stop was a local market, we had a walk round with Abdul, very interesting to see a market for the locals selling the wares. This is not for the squeamish or vegetarians. It gives you a real insight into life here and we would not have missed it. Then onwards through beautiful countryside, Abdul gives you information all the time. He is extremely amusing with a great sense of humour. We then opted for the shorter walk through the villages, this also is a must, the people are so friendly. If you do this be sure to take writing books, pens etc for the village children. We were impressed with Abdul he had a list of names of some of the children and their ages and their particular requests. Very thoughtful man. We then had lunch with a Berber family and a tea ceremony. Delicious and fun. Then continued on with our walk, wear good shoes. On our way back we passed Richard Bransons hotel Kasbah. As my friend had got engaged there the week before Abdul arranged for us to have a little tour. When I have saved up I am definitely going there for a visit! To sum up, this tour was both informative and amusing. I can not rate Abdul highly enough, we were a bit nervous being on the slightly older side but we need not have worried. Abdul will adapt the tour to suit you. We felt we had a real insight into life in the Berber villages."

We ended in the souks where I put my haggling skills to the test.Another day we were picked up from our hotel and taken up the Atlas Mountain. Again Abdul displayed brilliant knowledge and answered any questions we had, the photo opportunities were brilliant too. We met the local Berber village kids and handed out cookies to them. I would recommended bringing some colouring books and the like to hand out to the kids.We stopped off for lunch at a local Berber home and I was shown how to make Moroccan tea.

Abdul responded promptly and based on the information I gave him about our family, our likes, and interests, he recommended the Hidden Sides and Souks and High Atlas Mountains tours. We enjoyed both immensely! Abdul met us at our riad promptly, and I could immediately tell from his calm but enthusiastic demeanor that we were going to have an enjoyable two days! Abdul expertly explained history, culture, religion, and the beauty of his country. He is a patient man as we asked a million questions! Starting with the obvious we quickly delved into the hidden gems of Marrakech. I'm not going to give away Abdul's secrets, but he took us to places we'd never find on our own. Such neat experiences that I will always remember and cherish. I had told Abdul that I loved all the carpets in our riad and asked if I could buy any in the souks. He looked at a picture of my favorite carpet from our riad and told me he could take me to the store that sold the riad all their carpets. I purchased two carpets and will always remember fondly the experience of learning about and purchasing these treasures every time I look at them in my home. I purchased some other treasures in the souks. I appreciated Abdul's advice. He never told me what to do or not to do, but made subtle suggestions. There was never any pressure to buy from any merchant he introduced me to, but I quickly discovered he introduced me to the merchants with the highest and best quality goods. I also appreciated that he asked us what we were interested in seeing. For example, I didn't have any interest in spices or argan oil, so we skipped that all together. This was our tour based on our interests. I didn't have a lot of information about what we were doing on our second day of touring. However, I learned that Abdul was great at reading people. He figured out our likes and interests pretty quickly, and I trusted that whatever he had planned for us was going to be memorable. Again, I don't want to spoil his secrets, but I will always remember riding camels, trekking in the Atlas Mountains, and learning how to make mint green tea (including the proper way to pour it) in the home of a local family that shared lunch with us. Thank you, Abdul, for memories that I will cherish for my lifetime.I appreciated that Abdul encouraged us to bring pencils, pens, notebooks or trinkets to give to the kids that we would meet along the trail hiking. We brought a bag of pencils and bought some hard candies in the first village along the trail. I loved watching my daughter give pencils and candies to the children. I also loved the smiles on their faces! I can't thank Abdul enough for making his city come to life for us and for sharing it with us! I have had many private guides show me their cities, but Abdul is one of the best we've ever had the pleasure of meeting!"

We did the Marrakesh city/souk tour one day and a day trip to Essaouria another. I would highly recommend both! Abdul helped us navigate the labyrinth that is the souk and took me right to the stalls I needed. He even haggled for me which was was wonderful and saved me stress of having to do so myself. The products that I walked away with were good quality and I didn't have to be fearful of falling for the for the other kind. Abdul went out of his way for us so many times during our stay. He took us to a phone repair shop and waited for a while after my husband's phone fell and the screen went black. He also offered us things of his own in case we didn't get the chance to buy them in the market. Only family does that and that is exactly how we felt. Abdul, we'd love to return the favor one day, so if you are ever in Boston, please look us up!"

We found Abdul, and we are so glad we did. Abdul met us on our very first day and took us on a tour of the Medina. Abdul asked our interests and adapted the tour to suit our party. Abdul is incredibly knowledgeable and gave us a fantastic insight into the history, architecture and culture of Marrakech. Whilst my sister and I loved shopping in the souks (and Abdul gave us some tips how to behave!) it was great to see the locals at work behind the scenes and their general way of life. Most of all Abdul made us feel safe, in what may seem a little daunting in such a busy city if you were on your own, pointing out landmarks and best paths back to our Riad should we get lost. It was the perfect start to our holiday and we happily ventured out confidently on our own the next day. We booked Abdul again for our last day and took a light trek up the Atlas Mountains. What a diverse delight! The views were incredible. Abdul took us to a Berber village where we learnt to make mint tea, had a huge tasty lunch and whiled away the afternoon soaking up the fresh air, sunshine and amazing views. It was the perfect end to a great few days. We loved Marrakech and made all the more enjoyable by such a diverse itinerary and all thanks to Abdul.

He made the tour fun as well as informative, he even took the time to learn everyone's names and ask about our professions back home. He then used this information to make the tour relevant for us."

It was indeed a once in a lifetime experience and his knowledge and expertise of his trade is indeniably great. From the time I inquired about the tour few months ago by email until the day of the tour itself he have shown excellent professionalism.We left the Riad on time as agreed and his choice of vehicle and driver was very good as well. I felt very comfortable and safe throughout the entire journey to and from the mountain.Also, I have to mention the amazing La Kasbah du Toubkal where Abdul has arranged a sumptuous lunch for me. Thank you to all the staff of this amazing lodge for your great hospitality.I will definitely avail of Abdul's services if ever I will be back in Marrakech in the near future hopefully and will gladly recommend his company Marrakech Guided Day Tours to anyone who wants to have a unique and authentic experience of Moroccan culture."

Abdul has outstanding English (has a degree in English literature!), very professional prompt email responses & on-time pick-ups for all tours, excellent car service for day tours outside of Marrakech, tailors each experience to your tastes/interests, extremely knowledgeable (we asked A LOT of questions about everything from food culture to geology to economic policy to history, etc\u2026), promotes responsible tourism, takes excellent photos (always nice to get a picture as a couple or family now and then!), will show you the hidden side of the real Morocco, and all at a very reasonable price.

He asked everyone going on the tour what they were interested in and taylored the tour accordingly. During our 5 hour tour we were shown the beautiful Koutuobia Mosque, walked around the winding alleyways of original riads, taken to the tranquil Secret Garden where we stopped for a drink and lunch and then finally shown around the souk. Abdul gave us some very useful haggling tips and took us to see his 90 year old friend who hand sews the most beautiful slippers. Abdul did not tire of our constant questions and we were sad to say goodbye at the end. Thank you for sharing your beautiful city with us Abdul."

He engaged really well with the four teenagers in our group (not an easy job for anyone) and took us to see some really interesting sites and places in Marrakech, but our favorite day was in the Atlas mountains. The views very amazing, and we really enjoyed just hanging out with him and asking him about his culture. The lunch that we had lunch with the Berber family was the best food we had all trip, and just kept coming. I cannot wait to return to Morocco and will be booking Abdul as a guide to Essaouira, and would recommend him to everyone."

He asks you before you start what you are interested in (history, shopping, architecture, etc.) and then designs the walking tour around that. We went to a local bakery which was the highlight for me. To learn about the history of the community, what it was centered around, and to be able to experience a truly authentic place was amazing. You do not feel like a tourist, you feel like a local is inviting you into their culture."

We hired Abdul to walk us around the souk on our first day for 3 hours.I highly recommend you do this, especially if this is your first time in Marrakech! The souk / the heart of Marrakech is very. very old. It's expansion over the centuries has created this crazy labyrinth where you can easily get lost! You need to know what Derb is really :) Abdul explained us everything. How to walk, how to shop & history. We were so pleased we booked this tour. The next day we already knew what we are doing. We never got lost actually. Even remembered the locations of favourite shops / stands. Abdul is supernice and very knowledgeable! His English is perfect! Book it, you will have so much fun!!!"

I had read about Abdul's tours on another blog, and came upon his tripadvisor website which had raving reviews. A private tour of the High Atlas Mountains for the 7 of us including transport and everything came out to be very reasonable, price-wise! He knew so much about the city of Marrakech and answered all of the questions we had about the country as well. We were very impressed!We embarked on a light trek along the High Atlas Mountains (total took about 1-2h), and stopped at one of the local hotels to have tea with a great view of the mountains. We then continued on and had a traditional berber village lunch up on the mountain with a phenomenal view. Overall, this experience was an incredible day-long trip and I would highly recommend it to anyone! Especially for those who are looking to do something outside of the main city (even if you want to tour places around the city, I'm sure it would be great!), this is a fantastic tour experience!!"

He met us at our hotel, and we plunged head first into some of the more fascinating points about the history of the city. Our tour of the Medina was thoughtfully planned -- we entered by means of a small back street and not through a main artery. We visited a variety of sites, both old and new. He provided some fascinating context about the \"urban planning\" and organization of the Medina. We visited several merchants, both small and large. A late lunch at a street side vendor (apparently a friend of Abdul's) was on par with a dinner at a luxury hotel featuring a Michelin-rated chef. And we ended the day with an absolutely stunning stroll through the main plaza, the Jemma El Fnaa, where stalls, spices, snake handlers, locals, and tourists were all bathed in the gorgeous light of the setting sun. It was a really magical way to end the day. Highly recommended."

We tried to get him for an additional day, but he was unavailable. He is extremely knowledgeable about history and religion and tactful, but honest, in discussing Muslim interactions with the west. I was particularly touched when he described his own feelings about the day Baghdad fell, as a Muslim, even though he was no fan of Saddam Hussein. A big reason for travel is to have your horizons expanded and your views challenged and stretched. Abdul was marvelous for that. Abdul was also the only guide we had in Morocco that did not direct us to a tourist trap restaurant and the only guide that joined us in eating lunch. As a result, we had our favorite meal in Morocco with him. We mentioned that we were adventurous eaters and would like to try something unusual. He asked us if we would like to try sheep's head? We said yes and he took us to an alley off the main square where they cook sheep and showed us the pit they are roasted in, tangia pots where another type of cooking takes place, and also where the sheep heads are cooked. We then had a meal that involved beef cooked in tangia pots, roasted lamb from the pit and sheep's head. It was fantastic. I really felt Abdul was there for us and did not have a side agenda to direct us into various stalls and restaurants where he would earn an extra commission, something that we experienced with every other guide we had in Morocco. In fact, he stayed with us longer than we had contracted with him for, as there were some things he wanted us to see. I recommend Abdul without reservation and wish we could have had an extra day with him."

After we had a gentle trek to a Berber village where we stopped to enjoy lunch with a local Berber family - a true experience to be hosted in a local family home and dine on some exceptional food. Abdul is a very considerate guide, making sure to give us a great experience while also being very sensitive to the local Berber people (he brought gifts with him which we have to children we met along our trek!)After a long and leisurely lunch we made our way back towards Marrakech, with Abdul keeping us entertained with his throws of the area and pointing out all the sights along the way.All in this was an exceptional day, we loved it and would put us at the top of a 'must do' list for anyone visiting the area.

I was on my own and found his company very enjoyable. As we wandered through the souks Abdul pointed out landmarks so that I could find my way around alone, and at no stage was there any pressure to visit a friend's shop. He also shared his knowledge of the history and local customs of the area, and showed me interesting things I would have missed on my own (a school and a bakery etc). I paid more for my tour than some colleagues who found a guide themselves but they did not enjoy their tour as much as I did. When I went back to the medina later, I was able to tell them things that their guide had not told them, and find our way back in the souks because of the landmarks Abdul had noted. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for. I can't speak highly enough of him. Abdul, I wish you well, my friend."

Highly recommended.On our last day at Marrakesh we received a parcel left at the reception by Abdul containing some Moroccan spices and also some recipe\u2019s for us to try.Can\u2019t recommend him more, guys don't think twice just go and take Abdul as your guide ."

It\u00b4s hard to find the exact words to describe the wonderful experience we had getting to know Marrakech with Abdul but still I will try.First of all I would remark his easy going personality that makes you feel comfortable from minute one. On top of that, his remarkable use of english makes things very easy not only to understand what he has to say but also, like we did, to ask him hundreds of questions which he will always answer.In second place, Abdul shows you the every day life of Marrakech. You get to know hidden places and people which you would never find by yourself. But the best part of all is that the tour is pretty much taylor made to your own interests. Abdul will ask you which things interest you more and design the perfect tour for you.We spent two and a half memorable days with Abdul. One day and a half seeing Marrkech hidden sites, the souks, the square, etc and one day on a trip to the Atlas Mountain to visit a Berber home, trip which I strongly recommend.All in all, visiting Marrakech is a great adventure which Abdul can turn into a lifetime experience. Don\u00b4t miss it."

Adbul adjusted to us though and without anything having to be said, he figured out how to make us get the most out of our tour. He was brilliant. Our tour started at our hotel and before long, we were in the Medina and then into the souks where we visited Dar Cherifa and Ben Youssef Madrasa before having our own rooftop table set up for us to enjoy some street food. We saw locals schools, bakeries, mosques and even bumped into Abdul's family along the way. The tour was EXACTLY what we were looking for. We would never have seen any of the above without Abdul - a local taking round his city. After 6 hours, we even felt brave enough to head back into the souks on our own at night...and we didn't get lost. Thank you."

Even before we met things got off to a good start as he asked me what I was interested in and what I'd like to see and my tour was custom made. We met in a central location as my hotel wasn't in the centre of Marrakech. He had sent me directions, a photo of the meeting point and a picture of himself and he arrived promptly.The day was wonderful from start to finish. It was evident that he had put a lot of thought into planning the day but at the same time made it appear spontaneous and fun. Abdul provided a real insiders guide to Marrakech we saw many of the famous sights and visited the souks but the best thing was exploring the hidden side of the city, this included walking through charming, little alleyways, visiting a local bakery and even seeing his former school. We met some of the local craftsmen and even enjoyed some musical entertainment. His tour was fun and very entertaining and he really brought the city to life and made it very memorable.Abdul is a very knowledgeable guide, focused on the things that interested me and was able to answer all my questions. He was also very thoughtful as he build in comfort breaks for refreshments and toilet stops.The tour was scheduled to finish at 3.30pm but was extended, at no extra cost, by about 30 - 45 minutes. During the tour we discussed my love of mint tea and afterwards he sent me a PDF about how to make it.The tour was a fabulous introduction to Marrakech and I would highly recommend booking a full day tour. Thanks Abdul for an unforgettable day."

We saw some amazing things and had a few stops for refreshments. We were out until about 2000 but although tired none of us were exhausted and the day went like a dream. Abdul went to pray twice during the day while we had tea which made for a nice break. We had some great conversations and it was wonderful to hear his ideas and thoughts on several topics. I would not hesitate to recommend his services and we are very grateful to him.Thanks Abdul"

Thanks to his lifetime experience with this magical city he showd us not only the sights described in books, but also let us feel the city's atmosphere, showed how people live here, there was not question which he would not answer in a very interesting way-my 12 year old daughter and her friend of the same age were not bored at all and today after our return back home they still remember many details and are thrilled with the trip. Abdul knew how short of time we were and so he even arranged that a seller of nice antique teapots met us on our way back to our Riad with 5 teapots to choose from. Truly unforgettable was the trip to Atlas mountains, where Abdul arranged donkeys for our kids to take them up the hill to the Berber home, where we had the best meal of our stay, true Morrocan food which we could enjoy from the terrace having view of beautiful valley and high mountains. Abdul together with the Berber host arranged a typical local dress for our dauhters and had them experience preparation of tea in Morrocan way dressed as Morrocan ladies.

He was also funny and made us laugh, telling my mum she was the queen which made us all laugh. He was also brilliant in the souks - took us to some genuine artisans and even bartered for us to get us some amazing quality goods for great prices, this really helped us as the enormity of the souks is quite overwhelming and we would have had no idea where to start without him. There was also some really nice touches - he bought lovely hot bread, chick peas with cumin and even gave us a bottle of his special olive oil which had been freshly pressed and he didn't even ask for any money for this - really beyond what you would get on a standard tour. You can't fail by booking a tour with Abdul and you will miss out if you don't."

Before my arrival in Marrakech he was highly responsive and polite over email, asking what I wanted to see in the city so he could customize our tour. From the moment he picked my friend and me up at our hotel, he was absolutely charming and a veritable fountain of knowledge about the city. His pride in Marrakech is palpable and contagious, and we learned so much from him about this fascinating, friendly, unique place. Besides his boundless knowledge about the city's history and character, Abdul is also the ultimate guide if you're a shopper, as my friend and I are. Abdul took us to the wholesalers in the souks and helped us find literally the best of everything, from argan oil to light fixtures to handmade leather poufs. He also took us to a shoemaker who's well over 90 years old and has been making the best handmade slippers in the city for decades, as well as a tailor who makes exquisite linen clothing that you won't find anywhere else. Abdul helped us negotiate prices everywhere we went and, always the consummate gentleman, even insisted on carrying our bags.Having had such a wonderful day with him on Saturday, we hired Abdul again on Sunday for a late-afternoon trip to Jemaa el Fna (the city's sprawling main square) to watch the famous sunset. He took us to his favorite spice shop so we could buy saffron and then for tea at a spot with a lovely rooftop terrace before he took us to the best vantage point from which to watch the sun go down. When he walked us back to our hotel we were sad to say goodbye to him after he gave us such an amazing insider's view of Marrakech.As a travel writer, I constantly travel all over the world and have met many guides, and Abdul is the absolute best you will find. There is a no question he can't answer, and more importantly, he is an absolutely lovely man who goes out of his way to show and teach you everything he can about the city that he so clearly loves. I consider him a true friend and cannot wait to explore Marrakech again with him when I'm lucky enough to return."

We engaged Abdul and Marrakech Guide Day tours for three days - the full-day tour of the medina, the High Atlas Mountains tour, and the tour of Essaouira. I wish I could give Abdul 10 stars instead of 5, as his guidance these three days has shown us a part of Morocco we would have never found on our own.The tour of the medina was essential for getting us oriented to this maze-like city. Abdul explained how the addresses within the medina work and gave us detailed and helpfully repetitive tips such that we would be able to find our way back to our riad when we ventured out on our own. You will see so many sites on this tour that you would never find on your own. For example, we visited a baker in his traditional bakery and a man who stokes the fire for a hammam. Abdul grew up in the city, so there were constantly people greeting him and shaking his had, which was really special. One of the things that caught my eye on their website is the information about responsible tourism. While in the city, Abdul took us to visit a co-op of disabled women who make beautiful linens and crafts. Most guides don't go there, as there is not a commission for the guide. Abdul helped us barter when we wanted to shop, but only took us to places we wanted to see. The tours were totally planned around our interests.I can't stress enough how the tour of Marrakech shaped our vacation. The city is maze-like and a little intimidating for this South Carolina girl due to the language barrier. Having Abdul guide us allowed us to see more than we would have ever seen, without fumbling around for the map. Again, we packed in more sites in one day than we would have found in a week on our own.Next we took the High Atlas Mountains tour. We chose to have lunch with a local Berber family, which was incredible. They were such lovely hosts, and Abdul taught our daughter how to make the traditional tea service. The highlight of the trip for me was greeting the local children and giving them small gifts like pencils and pens. They were absolutely precious. The views in the mountains are stunning, and you feel like you are a million miles away from the city. It was super relaxing after the exciting hustle and bustle of Marrakech.Our final trip was to the fishing village of Essaouira. This is a beautiful coastal fishing town. We toured the buildings and saw incredible sea views. Abdul gave us the option of eating in a restaurant OR having our driver go to a seafood market and buying fresh seafood, which would then be prepared especially for us. We chose that option, and it was an amazing meal. I dream about the shrimp dish -- it was sooooo good! At the end of the day, Abdul treated us to a drink at a beautiful seaside cafe, which really touched us. He was such a pleasant person to spend three days with!!I cannot say enough good things about this tour company or about Abdul. He was truly our guide in all matters. He showed us the sites and was our navigator, but also helped us with any questions we had about what was considered polite behavior vs. \"no-nos\" in his culture, which was something that was extremely important to me. I left with an amazingly positive view of the Moroccan people, and I wanted them to think we'll of us, too. The communication prior to our visit was excellent, and Abdul completely arranges the trip based on your needs. Since we had him for three days, he got to know us and knew we always wanted the most traditional experience, not McDonalds or the mall (both of which they have in Marrakech, if that is your preference!). For example, my hubbie has a short window of time between bathroom breaks, and Abdul always made sure that we had a clean restroom throughout the day. This may seem like a little thing, but it is a major problem if you are uncomfortable on a vacation.Again, my highest, highest recommendation to Abdul and his company. He \"made\" our trip to Morocco!"

It was a great introduction to the city; I would definitely recommend booking this for your first full day in Marrakesh."

Abdul picked us up from our riad, and introduced us to his city. He was answering patiently our many questions and explained the background that foreigners can understand. He adapted his pace to our needs, and tailored his tour to our curiosity. We experienced and learned so many things that we would have missed without his kind introduction e.g. the local baking place or the food in the souks within the leather area where only locals eat. When he learned that we were planning to visit Essaouira he even sent us a detailed description where and what to do - after our tour - in such detail that we were not able to get it wrong. We can fully recommend his guided day tour! Abdul was really making somr efforts and took very good care of us. Thank you, Abdul, for introducing us to your country! We took a lot from your day tour and were even able to make friends in Marrakech thanks to you!! We wish you the very best!"

I'd been told stories of inflated prices and being ripped off so I wanted someone I could trust. Abdul stood out to me because of the many postive things people had to say so I decided to take the plunge and check out his website, then when I was completely happy, I contacted him for availabiliy and prices. Abdul was very professional on email and in person. He was prompt when arriving to meet me at my hotel, welcoming and warm.He told to me the routes we would be taking to the souk and pointed out landmarks along the way and explaining history of Marrakech as we walked. He asked me what I wanted to buy/look at and took me to the best places to shop for these items. Abdul was patient and happy for me to stop at stalls if I wanted to. He negotiated prices for me but only at the stalls he took me to, not at the random places I wanted to stop at, so be prepard to haggle if you stop for yourself. Overall I throughly enjoyed my shopping experience and I felt safe and less hassled walking with Abdul. He carried my bags during the trip and walked me back to my hotel at the end of the tour. I couldn't have asked for a better guide and I've recommended him to a few colleagues who are travelling to Marrakech next week."

So Knowledgeable he answered all our questions on all aspects of Moroccan life and culture. His kind and warm personality was evidenced by him handing charity and food to the less fortunate in the local market and sweets for the children in the villages. (We toured the high Atlas Mountains and Berbere villages as well as the Souk).In the markets he asked us what we were interested in buying and assisted us, there was no random stops to see items in which we had no interest. He also directed us to dinner at a local restaurant away from the touristy traps.After spending 11 hours together, we ended more knowledgeable and had a greater understanding of the soul of Morocco. It was a pleasure having him as our guide and I highly recommend him."

He did a fantastic job showing us the city, explaining the culture, and answering all our questions. We stopped at a few places to eat that were amazing and after going through the souks we were comfortable enough to go back and explore more on our own. He even helped us track down our missing luggage and arranged a car to pick us up to take us to and from the airport to retrieve our luggage. Even after our trip he followed through in e-mailing us Moroccan recipes to try at home. Abdul really went above and beyond and you can tell how much he loves the City of Marrakech and his culture.

But above all he gave us important insights about the history, the economy, the architecture and the social life of the city. He was also very useful with suggestions about things we would do on our own (hammams, list of other places to visit). We absolutely recommend him.

Abdul gave us interesting historical information about Essaouira, and took us to some local artisanal shops. When I visited in October of 2015 it was absolutely torrentially raining, but we still had a great time. Abdul made us feel comfortable and took care of everything that was needed to make this day trip a great experience.

He was ready to answer any questions whether it was about the Call to Prayer, Moroccan marriage traditions, or current Moroccan politics. After the trip, Abdul took the time to take us through the square and point out all of the good food stalls, which I proceeded to sample the rest of the trip. Marrakech can be a bit overwhelming for a newcomer. A great way to ease into the city and Morocco in general is to book a day with Abdul. Ryan"

Abdul wove the history of Marrakech into our wonderful trip and told us about architecture and founding kings and the Morroccan way of life. He was a very thoughtful guide and really undsertood our needs as a group and found us some lovely little resturants along the way. In Essouira, we heard about the history of the town, the Mellah, the beautiful old port and he gracefully answered all our questions about every aspect of history and Morrocan life. He took us to meet a shepard with goats in trees, a womens' co-operative (which we loved) and we felt safe, happy and looked after at all times. His driver, Uniss, drove us with care and made little stops as often as we wanted. We have never hired a guide before and we now realise how much we have missed that cannot be gleamed from guide books.

Abdul tailored the tour to focus on our interests in architecture and history. Our day with Abdul truly prepared us for the week in Morocco. There's no way a visitor can truly appreciate the gems that Marrakech has to offer without a knowledgeable guide like Abdul to set the backdrop.Abdul and a driver escorted us to Essaouira for our second tour. The drive was a short 2.5 hr drive west of the city. This was a very laid back day with no set itinerary. We arrived at the GORGEOUS port by late morning. We were able to choose the best catches of the morning from local fishermen. We then took our fish to a type of \"restaurant\" where they grilled the seafood for us. This may have been the BEST MEAL we've had our entire trip. Abdul is simply the best guide we've ever had. He answered all of our questions and made sure we were prepared for the week of \"haggling\" in the souks. We also appreciated his willingness to take us to local eateries that were off the beaten path. These gems turned out to be the best food we'd eaten during our stay.

We did another tour to the desert which was fantastic but would have been so much better if Abdul were with us!We were happy to let Abdul show us around without a particular agenda but he is very quick to pick up on the types of things that you enjoy and tailors the trip according to your tastes. We saw so much beautiful architecture and Abdul was so knowledgeable about the history of the place, the culture and he makes it seem so easy to navigate when you are with him! He took us to a fantastic place to eat which we never would have ventured to if we were alone and this I think is the best thing about taking a tour with Abdul. Marrakech is a wonderful place, but it can also be slightly overwhelming and having someone so calm and knowledgeable by your side immediately makes you feel at ease so that you can relax and experience things that you may not allow yourself to if you were alone. We met a local baker, the man that lights the fires for the Hammam who sang for us and many tradesmen and skilled workers that Abdul thought we would be interested in meeting. When he takes you to meet these people there is no pressure to buy anything from them or to give them money (although we chose to), it is all for the experience and this was the part of the tours that we loved the most, so interesting and such good memories to take away!On the souks tour I assured Abdul that I was skilled at bartering and did not need his help so he stood a short distance away pretending to look the other way while a merchant wrapped scarves around my head and I tried to barter with him. Eventually I just heard a calm voice say \"Sam, would you like some help?\". I immediately accepted and he gave the merchant a telling off and let me barted again. I was really pleased with the deal I got but then Abdul spoke to him again and he gave me some more change so Abdul clearly wasn't pleased with the deal that I got! After that Abdul gave me a good talking to about how the merchants are just trying to earn a living to feed their families but that they can sometimes be very pushy and that I should not be forced into buying something that I did not want or paying more than I expect to pay for something. From then on he kindly did all my bartering for me but after he left us his talk still had an effect on me and I would find myself walking away after either buying something or deciding not to, saying to my husband, \"I think Abdul would have been proud of me then!\"He was so respectful, polite, warm, friendly and protective of us and went out of his way each day to make us happy. When I visit Marrakeck again I will definitely book Abdul for his knowledge and company and I will recommend him to friends as I am recommending him to you now. Book a trip with him, it will make your holiday."

We did two tours with Abdul, the first was a half-day tour that combined \"hidden\" Marrakech with some major sites and a tour of the souks. On this tour we learned a lot of history and really got a sense of how Marrakech is laid out as well as a sense for the daily lives of the people who live there. Abdul answered dozens of our questions about everything. He was very helpful in giving us acceptable ranges of prices for items in the souk where both buyer and seller would have an acceptable deal. His tours are completely customized as to what you what you want to do, but as he gets to know you, he will make sure to add on things he knows you should not miss. Best of all, he is really your personal guide, there were no attempts to make you go anywhere and/or visit merchants/restaurants he has a relationship with. My parents took a guided tour organized via our resort and wound up listening to an Argan oil presentation for 40 minutes; this will not happen with Abdul.Our second tour was a day trip to Essaouira from Marrakech with my parents and our kids. The van we had was brand new with air conditioning that worked! (the only time that happened during our trip) We had a wonderful walk around the city with lots of insight from Abdul. Once again he adapted our tour to allow us to go off and do what we wanted (art shopping for us, ice cream for the kids). My kids especially enjoyed a stop along the way where shepards put a flock of goats in a beautiful Argan tree!To top all of this off, it was Ramadan so Abdul was unable to eat or drink during our tours which made it all the more remarkable how patient and accommodating he was."

He complied with our requests and filled in with just the right experiences to make it a lovely tour. We were concerned about it being Ramadan and it wasn't an issue at all.

Both of these tours I would highly recommend, we got a great feel for the city, the people who live and work within; including the heritage of Marrakech. He is very knowledgeable of the city as he has lived and worked there all his life so is very keen on sharing his stories, he showed us a local Souk eatery which did not look much from the outside and we were a little nervous about eating there as you hear all the horror stories of people getting upset stomachs, yet we enjoyed this experience greatly and didn't suffer the next day either which was a bonus! Not being used to the negotiation in the Souk Abdul used his experience to recommend highly quality items, even helping haggle for the best price.We particularly enjoyed our second day, the tour of the mountain's taking a nice few hours walking through the villages themselves, which a large tour group would not be able to do; from doing this we got a over powering feel for how the Berber people live and work everyday. The day finished off by having a meal with a local family and a tea ceremony. Abdul also is a great photographer, knowing great spots and letting us take any opportunity we wanted to take pictures and taking a few snaps for us. Overall a very knowledgeable and interesting two days and highly recommend."

I walk daily( never trekked) and my sister is not even a walker as such..and she was rather anxious at the thought of it but have no fear we really enjoyed it and its at you're own pace, walking through Berber villages we, had an opportunity to stop at a local Berber house for a comfort stop and the kettle was on for a cuppa!!Abdul nominated me to assist with tea making ceremony.. I'm a mug and tea bag girl so it was somewhat of a challenge but we had a good laugh.. and amazing the tea was actually drinkable. We arrived at Toubkal Kasbah in time for lunch on the terrace.. views breathtaking overlooking snow capped Mount Toubkal and the valley below..it was a lovely relaxing 2 hours, wishing we could have stayed there longer, I hope to return to Toubkal Lodge and do some more trekking in high atlas soon( I've got the trekking bug!!) we then headed down to Imlil 20 minutes down a very uneven path and certainly not for those with any kind of walking difficulties.( mules are available for hire)Both tours were superb, Abdul is such a really nice laid back type of a guy and we just loved his dry sense of humour..Inshallah we will return to Marrakech sometime soon.. We would certainly recommend Abdul.. He is the perfect guide.... Simply the Best!!!"

We tried to book Abdul for the hidden sides tour for 1 day and a second day in the high atlas but there was a slight mix up so he made alternative arrangements for us.However, the hidden sides tour with Khalid was great. If you cannot get Abdul to show you around ask him to arrange for his friend Khalid to take you instead as he was very friendly, humble, knowledgeable and humorous. He not only showed us places of historic and religious interest, but also gave us an insight into the everyday working life of the ordinary Marrakshi, taking us to meet craftsmen making things from metal, wood and even the man who stokes the furnace of a Hamman and cooks the Tanjia for anyone who will pay a small fee at the same time! We felt a part of the city for a short time rather than confused tourists wandering around getting lost! We cannot thank Khalid enough.Now, back to Abdul. Having made alternative arrangements the first day we did not expect to meet him at our Riad the following morning but there he was to explain he would see us later during our trip to the Atlas Mountains. The driver was friendly, scenery spectacular and the Berber guide who took us on a trek was excellent. All this had been arranged by Abdul and we later met him properly at a Berber house for a wonderful meal and mint tea. He was a very interesting person with excellent English,great knowledge of his country and a funny guy as well! Even though he was not with us the whole two days he left a great impression on us and we would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone who wants a personal tour as he makes it all go so smoothly.

There was one of about 90 minutes that didn't involve so much uphill climbing but instead took you around some waterfalls. We opted for the one that was about 2 hours and took you up to a Berber village higher up the mountain before coming back down to the Berber house where we had lunch. Warning...don't book a meal for when you get back that night , you won't need it !. After the Tea Ceremony we had a huge salad, supplied with lots of break and Olive Oil. Following this we had a delicious Lamb Tagine. By then I was full, bit then another Tagind of Chicken and Cous Cous arrives. Finally fresh Fruit for dessert if you can manage it.After the meal it is about 20 minutes back to the car and 1 hour drive back to Marrakech.Overall best day of our trip to Marrakech.

In total we walked around 10 miles (calculated by my iPhone steps) so it's not for the feint hearted, but I'm sure he'd accommodate everyone's needs and abilities (we are an early-30s couple).His English is exceptional, and he showed around the whole medina, orienting us without being too forceful; 'you remember this?', 'look for this sign', etc, all things we used throughout our stay. We went to Dar Cherifa, a beautiful converted riad, a fully working community bakery where we sampled some homemade bread (we loved this bit - very rustic) and we also went to Ben Youssef Madrasa, an old Islamic college. We had to pay a very small fee for the latter but it is well worth seeing. He helped us haggle and orient ourselves in the souks, and recommended some very good stalls in the night market on Jamma el Fna.

I told them that it was the lunch at the Berber home -- the Toubkal Lodge, with our guide, Abdul."

My wife booked the services of Abdul for a day and a half based upon reviews on this site and the array of glowing terms used do not exaggerate just how good he is. Abdul made us feel part of Marrakech, his knowledge, patience, intelligence and sense of humour stand him apart. Also, unlike some other tour guides, Abdul makes you feel like he enjoys your company, finding the best food and drinks and joining you in enjoying them. We never felt like we were pushed towards shops/stalls to buy things, instead Abdul took us to meet fascinating people who do seemingly mundane but important jobs. He helped us in the Souks when some sellers became too overbearing and gave excellent tips on finding the best price. The best compliment I can pay is that we missed him for the rest of the holiday."

As it was our first time in Morocco, we wanted to utilize a tour guide to provide optimal usage of our time and to have a sense of security, being all females. I chose Abdul based on his high reviews in Trip Advisor. Several reviewers mentioned that would customize his tours based on individual needs. This was important to me. Abdul not only met our needs but he went above and beyond. As our teenage girls would say to him, \" You've Abdul yourself!\" During our week, we visited Essaouria, the souks in the Medina and the Atlas Mountains ( bring proper footwear!) The highlight of our trip for sure was learning about the Berber way of life in the Atlas Mountains. Abdul bought pens and coloring books for our daughters to hand out to the Berber children. The look of delight on their little faces were so precious! We later enjoyed a delicious traditional lunch on the rooftop of Berber home. Our daughters learned to make mint tea and was given Moroccan outfits to wear. Great weather, views, food and company, a perfect day!  At the end of our week, we felt we made a friend and Abdul left a lasting impression on our girls. He is very proud of what he does and genuinely wants you to have a great vacation. He's also a walking encyclopedia of Morocco so you will also learn so much about the beautiful culture of Morocco. Don't hesitate to book with Abdul. You will not regret it!"

My wife and I were so impressed by others' reviews that we booked three days of tours (Souks, Marrakech Hidden Sights, and Essouiara) with Abdul. We told him exactly what we wanted to see and do, and that is exactly what we got. Not only did we see and do exactly what we asked for, our conversations with Abdul gave us a great understanding of Morocco, including its history, people, customs, and religion. During the Souks tour, we told Abdul what we were looking for and he took us to very high quality craftsmen. He bartered for us, and the money he saved us more than covered the cost of the tour. The same thing happened during the Hidden Sights tour the next day. My wife is an artist and I am a photographer, so he took us to the stalls and gardens that were perfect for us.Adbul's English is excellent. He is well-educated, knowledgable, and truly interested in making each visitor's experience memorable."

We were taken through many back alleyways to different parts of the souks, spent time with the local baker and also the Hamman fire stoker for mint tea and a music interlude. Met several local craftsman and visited the Ben Youseef Madrasa. Abdul clearly enjoys sharing his knowledge and answers all questions freely and openly often dispelling westernized views of Islam and the Arab world. The walking tour introduces you to the medina and its surrounding area, allows you to get your bearing and feel less intimated when out alone. A very enjoyable way to while away a few hours."

The tour was conducted at a leisurely-paced walk which was nice since we were toting along a child. He suggested several stops to give us some insight into local life, but these were always proposed as optional and there was never any pressure applied to visit them. If there were additional costs involved, such at the museums, Abdul was very upfront about these costs and again everything was completely optional. There were conveniently timed and adequate bathroom facilities throughout the tour, which lasted a total of about 3 1/2 hours. We wanted to see the souks, but not waste too much of our time with Abdul there. He walked us through a few sections, but more importantly gave us some orientation so we could return again later on our own time.

We organised a full day city tour with Abdul on our first day in Marrakech, on the first day of the new year (1 Jan 2015). This turned out to be a most enjoyable way to start the new year, and gave us an excellent orientation to the Marrakech medina. Abdul began by asking us what we wanted to get out of the tour, and after reading a number of reviews on TripAdvisor, we wanted to focus on the 'real' Marrakech, behind the scenes, along with a focus on art, architecture and history. Abdul collected us from our Riad on time and we spent the day exploring the medina and souks. His English was excellent, as was his historical and local knowledge. One thing that we particularly valued was that we had just come from Granada and visiting the Alhambra, and Abdul helped us to better understand the impact and links of moorish art and history between Granada and Morocco. The tour took a relaxed pace, and overall we found Abdul's relaxed demeanour reassuring in the hustle and bustle of the medina. (We adopted his relaxed approach for the rest of our stay, helping make this a fabulous holiday). We took plenty of stops for photos, browsing, discussing and food as needed (he took us to a delightful little place for local, selling delicious broadbean soup for lunch - one of my favourite meals of our trip). We found Abdul very trustworthy and honest and if we had needed someone to help guide us on a shopping trip, he would have been perfect. Be sure to book home well in advance."

As he lead us there we stopped at numerous places so he could explain the history of Marrakesh. He also explained to us how the city is laid out, which was very eye-opening. After this tour we had much more confidence of how to navigate in the city. We stopped by one of the big local markets where locals shop each day.We also walked through a neighborhood Abdul knew well and stopped in at the local bakery and hamam to meet some of the locals going about their daily activities--definitely not something we could have done on our own.After visiting the Madrasa and the other nearby museum, Abdul guided us through the souks.Abdul is very knowledgeable and speaks English very clearly. We loved our experience and would recommend Abdul to anyone visiting Marrakesh."

I briefed Abdul on what we wanted to see before we met as I was keen to avoid the 'hard sell' that seems to follow you around the city. He took good note of this and we had a good mix of day to day life - local markets where people shop for fruit, vegetables and meat etc. along with history culture and even a brief glimpse of a funeral cortege(!). Abdul was on time and waiting for us on the day, and took excellent care of us, we walked steadily around the city, and enjoyed an excellent lunch at a place packed out with locals.As an introduction to a city and culture quite different to what I am used to I can't fault the day we had. It gave us the confidence to strike out on our own and explore much deeper into the city than I would have previously imagined."

We booked 2 full day tours with him in advance for a party of 10 adults: one was the Hidden sides tour and the other a trip to the Atlas mountains to have lunch with a Berber family. On both days Abdul met us promptly at our riad and was friendly accommodating and very knowledgeable throughout. On the hidden sides tour he took us to some fascinating and lesser known sights of the city as well as the \"must see\" areas. We had an excellent lunch on a terrace of a restaurant called \"Kui-ZIn\" which I would also highly recommend- the food, service, cleanliness and prices would be hard to beat. On the Atlas mountain tour Abdul arranged a very nice mini bus for us all with a careful driver who took us up a mountain pass into the national park. We were delighted to meet a Berber family there who made us extremely welcome and cooked an amazing 4 course lunch for us. We also had great fun joining in traditional tea ceremony and meeting the local children. Overall we had a memorable weekend and thoroughly enjoyed Abdul's company along the way. We learned a lot about the history of Morocco and Islam and had some interesting discussions along the way. He made our trip effortless and took care of all the little things like tipping( if we wanted to take photos), negotiating the public toilets etc as well as advising us on local customs etc He is a genuine person and did not try to sell us anything or pressurise us into doing anythingThank you very much Abdul! We wish you well in the future and will contact you againLindsey"

I'm not one for wringing long reviews but I can only say that a guided tour of Marrakech is easily the most essential part of any trip to the city.We booked a half day tour of the Souks in the Medina as we wanted to do some serious shopping and to learn the intricacies of craftsmen and the market.Abdul was prompt, arriving at our Riad and to begin with spent some time just chatting to ask what we thought we were looking for. Quickly he geared the tour to exactly what we liked and took us into the souks, explaining how they work, how the developed and then looking at each craft/trade in turn. What became apparent is that he knows a lot of people in the media, which is a good sign and that he has a great sense of humour!. Abdul took us through how to judge quality and price, including haggling, but more that just lecturing he encouraged us to assess for ourselves how to spot cheap tourist products and the real local high quality products. What was good to see is that he picked up items for his family on the way round which steered us to the types of things that we would like.Anyway, I'm waffling, the highlights of the tour are: - Visiting a 90 year old shoe maker and looking at his handmade slippers. - Picking our a second hand Moroccan tea pot in a genuine tea pot shop. - Drinking mint tea from a seller which had been operating in the souks for hundreds of years. - The glass seller who my wife thought was lovely - Seeing the places where the craftsmen work rather than the touristy market stalls around the Jemaa  - Sitting and chatting with Abdul over good coffee, where his natural friendliness, knowledge and humour kept us captivated Marrakech is a bit like and iceberg, you only see 10%, but with a guide like Abdul you get to see and understand the other 90!"

If it's your first time to Marrakesh then there's no better way to explore the old Medina then with a private guided tour with Abdul!The Souk can be quite daunting with the numerous alleyways and passages leading off the main road - Abdul was kind enough to show us how to navigate the Souk, the landmarks to watch out for and also how to find our Riad again! After that we didn't need a map any more!There is so much heritage and culture in the old medina that you really need someone who knows the history, architecture and the people in order to fully experience Marrakesh! If you end up on one of those large guided tours, then you are just shepherd from place to place and only get to see Marrakesh from the outside.Abdul made the tour personal, he took us to all the nooks and crannies of Marrakesh, places that you would never experience on a big tour!We broke bread with a local community baker, we had tea with the person who heats up the community hammam.Abdul was fantastic! He is very knowledgeable, professional, kind and willing to answer all our questions.We've been on numerous private tours around the world, and were amazed at how much he knew about the history of Marrakesh. There's not an area on the walk around the town where he wasn't pointing out a historical fact or figure!What we really appreciated was how much Marrakesh and the Moroccan culture meant to Abdul. His passion for his work really shines through!Abdul also knows all the good places to eat in Marrakesh and took us to Chez Lamine for lunch, we enjoyed an excellent Tangia and Mechoui, so much so that we went back again for our final meal in the city.We actually went overtime by half an hour but he didn't mind at all... now I call that dedication. It was such a shame we were too late to book him for his other tours as I'm sure we would have enjoyed his company at Essaouira or even the Imlil Valleys (which we did on his recommendation!)We left the tour fully enriched with Moroccan culture and also happy that we had made a new friend."

We delved into the changes in architecture, design and layout of the Medina throughout time and how it affected the everyday lifestyles of the locals. To cap it off we ended up in the Souks and took in the vibrance and colour of the main square. We grabbed a bite at one of the market kiosks (highly recommend their food, was the best food we had during our stay).

From the moment I arrived in the Medina, the walled city, of Marrakech, Morocco I encountered a world unlike any I had ever seen. To the uninitiated it seems at first an incomprehensible warren of narrow walkways and narrower alleyways, with occasional streets wide enough for automobiles. It is a world of deeply hidden interiors, lived enclosed, all of which presents as a mystery to the traveler. Thankfully my husband and I and another couple had the wisdom to engage a guide and we spent our first full day in the Medina exploring the city with Abdul Aissaoui of Marrakech Guided Tours (contactmarrakechguidedtours@gmail.com). With him, a native of Marrakech, we soon began to see order, the warren of streets became neighborhoods, we discovered amazing and beautiful worlds behind inauspicious and locked doors, we heard stories of the city's almost 1000 year old history, we saw the snake charmers and the monkeys and the myriad of activities in the central square, we paused for coffee in an ancient arched and tiled inner courtyard, we had a delicious lunch of lamb roasted until tender in a giant clay pot buried in the ground, varieties of olives, marinated, spicy and mild, sour pickles, rounds of fresh warm bread and pots of beef, olive oil, garlic and rosemary cooked for hours in the steam used to heat the hamams, we learned about the Koutoubia Mosque and heard the call to prayer from its magnificent minaret, walked deep into the souks and saw how the vendors were sorted by type of merchandise offered, watched the end of day rug auction, saw the food vendors, marveled at the many varieties of olives, the mounds of dates, and the many aromas of the spice vendors, and we timidly forayed into the world of bargaining for purchases. By the end of our day together we could begin to pick out landmarks and had a general idea of how to wend out way back to our hotel. Abdul loves his city, he knows all of its hidden secrets and he delights in their revealing. He patiently and thoroughly answered our many questions, deftly maneuvered us in and out of the city's many byways, and laughed with us as we gingerly made our first attempts at bargaining. While he showed us he taught us and he opened our eyes to the many facets of the Medina and by the end of the day we had a vastly enlarged sense of its varied pleasures and delights. I am certain that had we ventured out on our own even with many days we would never have seen what we saw with Abdul in our one day together. If you are planning a first visit to Marrakech, or even if you have already been, engaging him as a guide will vastly enlarge your appreciation and enjoyment of the city. He is a charming man, very knowledgeable and speaks excellent English. As I write this I am smiling as I remember what a marvelous time we had together. If you choose to engage Abdul I am certain that like us you will have a remarkable and memorable day. After realizing how much we had enjoyed our time together and how hopeless we were at bargaining we decided to avail ourselves of Abdul's shopping tour of the souks. We had one morning to shop and doubtless on our own we would have spent most of our time just trying to find our way around. With Abdul we were introduced to the artisans and the best vendors for the items we were wanting to buy. He interpreted for us, acted as intermediary, helped us negotiate, and judging by the number of bags we carried back to our hotel, helped us have a very satisfactory shopping experience. There are many, many wonderful things to buy in the souks and markets of Marrakech and without help you will most assuredly pay considerably more than you should. With help you will go to the best vendors and you will pay a fair price. It might seem absurd to hire someone to take you shopping but a few minutes in the souks will convince you of the wisdom of doing so. In this I can guarantee you will be 100% satisfied!"

Abdul tailored the tours to our interests (including photography), and showed us parts of Marrakech we would never have seen without him, including 'behind the scenes' tours of the public Hammam and community bakery. He even took the time as we walked away from our Riad on the first day to look backwards when we reached certain landmarks to show us how to find our way back. Really useful in the maze of the Souks. Take a comfortable and trusted pair of shoes, mine broke after 2 1/2 hours of walking and despite Abdul and the local cobbler's best efforts I had to walk barefoot (in the rain) until we could buy a new pair of shoes (and it was my birthday)! Abdul's best tip for crossing the road: 'If you're scared, just close your eyes and walk...'. Hilarious (if a little unnerving!) but it definitely worked :o) He was also happy to advise on things like what a taxi should cost, which street stalls served the best food, where to buy the best spices, etc etc. He even checked with us regularly about bathroom visits as he knew where the cleanest facilities were...We thoroughly enjoyed our time with Abdul, he was interesting, intelligent, and extremely knowledgeable and his English was perfect.

We contacted Abdul who was not free on the dates we wanted, he made a number of recommendations in terms of people to contact and we had a wonderful guide called Khalid Amor. His spoken English is perfect, he is intelligent and knowledgeable and has much patience.The other very noticeable thing about Khalid is his kindness to others.We had a day trip to Atlas Mountains, which is a must. To have the opportunity to witness how families live, the simplicity of their lifestyle, is humbling. The Berber lunch was tasty, loads of food, amazing hospitality, nothing was too much bother. We were able to appreciate what the impact of tourism has on families. The owners of the house where we had lunch showed us their home and told us of plans to extend and add new features to it so that they can offer short term accommodation to trekkers. Without tourism this would not be possible.The majority of the trip was made in a 4x4 -the short amount of time we spent walking was pretty arduous. Gravel, loose stones and rocks, steep inclines, dust and dirt....and this is how the locals get around! From when they are able to walk, their terrain is exactly this. They walk, jog, run, confidently and fluidly, the children play and the adults work. Animals, rabbits, cats, sheep, goats form part of the village.We loved our day and I highly recommend you do this.Our 2nd day with Khalid was the Hidden Tour of Marrakech. He picked us up at 10am from the Riad and we walked around monumental buildings and gardens, the souks, down dark alleys and into a very talented friend of his who was a blacksmith and then on to see a baker, who works 18 hours a day in front of an open oven, baking loaves for the locals.. We had lunch in the heart of the medina. The table and chairs and general surroundings were basic to say the least, but the food, once again was awesome. The service was spot on.Food generally was salads, fresh bread, oils, olives. Meat grill, cous cous, vegetables including Quince which I ate for the first time. All very tasty and generous portions.The square comes alive at 5pm onwards with food stalls, snake charmers, dancers, musicians, smells, noise, people. It is absolutely full on...oh- there were also 2 stalls selling false teeth!Do not expect to be able to take a photo without paying the subject matter some money. They will chase you for money and are very insistent.At one point I wanted to photograph some cats getting fed innards by a local butcher counter. I could, as long as I paid the butcher a tip.The souks are alleyways crammed with goods and people wanting you to buy from them. So be prepared for constant interruptions. Also be prepared for the chickens sold live then slaughtered on site, the goats heads and feet on display, the prepared carcasses hanging up waiting to be sold. Like many other countries, Marrakech have to feed themselves and the whole process of animal slaughtering is just a part of life.You will see mules pulling carts and will have to develop amazing senses to deal with the scooters being rode through the streets and souks at incredible speeds. Khalid helped us to make sense of it all. I would recommend to anyone visiting here for the first time, get a guide or you will miss so much of what makes this destination so magical.The only one downside and it wasn't really a down side as such, just a bit disappointing that we were taken to a shop that sold oils and tea and natural products. We were actually taken here for mint tea but quickly had a price list put in front of us. We succumbed and bought a few items and came away \u00a337 lighter! Once I got home and unpacked and looked again at what we had bought I realised we had been well and truly over charged...but there we are. The traders rely on us to provide a market for their products and I guess I should feel thankful that I can afford to be on holiday in Marrakech in the first place."

By the time we contacted him for our holiday he was only available for one day during our visit. Thankfully that number was greater than zero and we immediately booked for a day trip to Essaouira for our family of four with two teens (boy-15, girl-13).On the previous three days we engaged four other guides/companies for an all-day tour of the city/museums/gardens & souk; mountain biking in the Atlas and visiting a Berber family; and a cooking course. While those experiences were all fantastic, here's what I feel differentiated Abdul:* The pace of the tour. Granted, the Essaouira trip was designed to be more relaxed than say ticking off five museums in a morning in Marrakech, but you know when a guide is already walking away while you are still reading a sign or taking a photo or just their energy is restless? That's not Abdul. We managed to tick all the boxes on the agenda for the day - the argan cooperative, the souk, lunch, the fort, tea on the beach, etc. - without feeling rushed.* The conversation. I appreciated having a driver to focus on the driving (hours) AND a guide to focus on our experience and answer questions. I appreciated his perspective on politics in the region and the dozens of other questions I asked. It was educational.* The initiative to take photos. Before we asked he volunteered to take photos of us and was an experienced location scout. Usually I'm taking all the photos for my family so I'm glad at the end of a trip to have a few which include all of us. And his photos are good. I have some hilarious trees-coming-out-of-people's-heads or bizarre-framing or blurry photos taken by random helpful tourists, so it's nice to have some good family snaps."

Professional, friendly, knowledgeable and interesting, he helps you navigate the Medina, and shows you to bits of Marrakech you would ordinarily just walk past and miss. You can't miss this, especially on your first day in Morocco. It helps with getting your bearings immensely. Thanks Abdul!"

En route we stopped at the local saturday market which was interesting and vibrant. At Umlil we walked for about an hour to a Berber village and chose to eat at a local home. This was the best meal we had both the food and company. The host was delightful and my 17 yr son learnt the skills of making mint tea, all with the most stunning views of the valley. Would highly recommend both tours."

Abdul gave my husband and I plenty of time to look around at different places and take pictures.

There was no pressure to visit Souk's or buy anything. Abdul appeared to be friends with every other person living in the Medina, it was quite inspiring to watch. Was interesting to hear about the currently political situation in Marrakech. His style is very laid back and was a pleasure to take the tour with him. I was surprised at how quickly 4 hours passed. My brother and I did the tour with Abdul, and I would recommend doing it in a small group like that, as the larger tours didn't seem nearly as personal or fun. We found loads of places and hidden streets we went back to after the tour too. Thanks again Abdul!"

Abdul got back to us almost immediately and everything was straightforward in meeting him in Reception at our hotel. Although we were frequently asked if there was anything we wished to do or see in particular, this was difficult to answer as it was our first visit to Marrakech so we were very much in Abdul's hands. We needn't have worried as Abdul took excellent care of us and we all enjoyed a fascinating and interesting tour including a visit to see the Koutubia Mosque ( you can't go inside ), Gemma El Fna Square, a refreshing mint tea on the rooftop of a beautiful riad with gorgeous views, a tour of Ben Yousseff School, a tour of the Souks, useful information regarding cafe's and restaurants, visited a working traditional Moroccan flat bread making oven and Abdul even took us to his local school and the area in which he grew up as a young boy. All thoroughly enjoyable, even though the sun defeated some of us in the end! The parts I enjoyed most were the mint tea riad, the bread making, school and souks. Oh we did stop for a well- earned lunch in the cafe des epices which was good. But don't hesitate to ask Abdul anything you wish to know or about anywhere you wish to go - the only thing you'll be short of is time and / or energy. Thank you Abdul"

First, Abdul was very warm and friendly. His English was impeccable and easy to understand.

If we had a question about something, whether history related, social or religion related, there was no topic off limit, and he was more than willing to help us understand his country and people.As an added plus, he led us to a fabulous place, which we would never have ventured into by ourselves, for lunch.The price for a full day tour with Abdul was very reasonable and I can't overemphasize how great of a guide he was. If we return to Marrakech, you can bet your bottom dollar that we will book another tour with him in order to see a different part of the city with his help next time.And, if like us, you are doing research for your first visit to Marrakech, please strongly consider making a day with Abdul one of your 'must-dos' - and do it as early into your trip as possible.

We were travelling with our 4 young children so we booked a half day tour for our second day. I can't rate Adbul and his tour highly enough. We were a little apprehensive about taking the children around the souks etc, and we did want our \"hands held\" slightly to give us a quick orientation. Abdul covered all this and more. He specifically tailored our tour to suit the children and their little feet not wanting to walk too much, and for our desire for them to see different parts of the souks. It was lovely to see Abdul greeting people and taking us to places we NEVER would have found unless by accident, while sharing his love and knowledge of this amazing city. I believe that this experience seeing the city through Abdul's eyes really helped shape our opinions and experience of the city from there on in and has left a true love of the city embedded in our children who can't stop talking about when they are going to come back when they grow up. We saw so much, but at a leisurely pace that suited our needs. If we had visited the souks without Abdul initially we may have felt harassed and perhaps put off revisiting but he quickly explained the love of life, happiness and banter that characterize the souks, let us try haggling and even when the tour was finished took my partner back to buy waterproof shoes (the hotel pool floor was cutting the childrens feet) The fact that he could find somewhere to buy them straight away is evidence of this mans true knowledge of the souks!! We wished we had booked him for further tours as he is such a lovely gentleman. Please do not hesitate to book with him..it will be the best choice you can make."

We arrived in Marrakech with the intention of seeing as much of the city attractions that we could and also wanted to visit a Berber village in the Atlas mountains.Our Riad owner had a leaflet for the mountains but it wasn't really what we wanted so we logged on to Trip advisor and chose this one,(Having already briefly looked before the holiday at tourism sites).The website was clear and precise so we sent an online request through to do the half day city tour and Atlas mountain trip with a couple of date options, Abdul promptly replied and arranged to meet us as our Riad.Having a guide to take you through the maze that is Marrakech centre makes it so much easier and clearer to get to the attractions and also get your bearings and sense of direction back! (We had spent our first 2 days wandering around the same route not realising there were shortcuts!).Abdul's knowledge and pride in his home city shine through and it is so much more interesting to hear personal stories too, you can literally talk about anything with him from politics to football or religion to lifestyle. He also shows an interest in you as well and is really easy to get to know, this obviously makes the tour a lot easier, comfortable and informal.It's useful to have a photographer on hand too, to be fair he takes a good photo!Next up we did the Berber mountains, this trip is such a great experience, that really made the holiday for me, Abdul and his driver picked us up from our Riad, drove us to the foot of the mountains (About an hour and a half) and we then had a light trek to a Berber home, the views are absolutely amazing, the air fresh and the local's warm and friendly along the way. I urge anyone with intention of doing this trip to take some stationary for the local children, they are so grateful for it and you will feel glad you did when you see their reactions.We met the home owner who was preparing a meal for us but first we had a tea ceremony, it takes half an hour to make but is worth the wait!Lunch was a nice salad, tagine and cous cous, followed by fresh fruit picked that morning, we commented on how nice the cherries were so en route back down the mountain we stopped to pick our own!!The home owner was a pleasure to meet, 26 years old, speaks four languages, does trekking tours and has aspirations to set up a lodge style business for the serious trekkers, he deserves every success and we swapped email addresses so hopefully will be able to see his progress.Overall we were very pleased to have done both of these trips and I would recommend them to anyone, also I wouldn't leave it until you arrive in Marrakech to book them as you can arrange from home before you go.We were lucky that it was a quiet time for tourists when we went so we got our chosen trips, but I would hate to think that we could have missed out on these experiences by not booking in time.Also in case you were unsure about going around the city with an old man, that isn't Abdul in the profile picture above, he's a bit younger than that!!!!!!!Thanks Abdul, 2 great trips that made our holiday! ;-)"

Abdul was very knowledgeable about the history and culture of the city and it was fantastic being able to spend the day with him.He knew the city really well and left us feeling at the end like we had truly seen the true Marrakesh and not just the tourist areas. Abdul also takes really good pics which is great when you are sick of trying to take selfies!! He took us to a local caf\u00e9 and I had the best beef tagine of the whole trip. My husband got to eat sheep head there as well which he does not stop going on about!It was so much nicer walking around the souks with him and not having to worry about getting lost, as well as not getting hassled anywhere as much. I would definitely recommend booking a tour with Abdul and will be booking again should we return in the future."

We wanted to live a real experience in Marrakech and to discover some non-touristy things to do and some hidden places in Marrakech. At the beggining, we wanted to do the Shopping tour in the souks, but Abdul suggested to mix the visit with some cultural sides of the city to have a complete vision of the Moroccan culture. So we walked around some historical quarters and monuments, we visited the Ali Ben Youssef Madrasa learning about the beautiful islamic art and architecture. We ate a typical dish with locals and we visited a traditional bakery and leather and wood workshops: we also learned the art of haggling in the souks! It was definetely what we were looking for, a real experience in Marrakech. We highly recommend Abdul to everyone traveling to this fantastic city. Thank you so much for this memorable day.Katharina and Lara."

Contacting Abdul via mail and/or via FB was easy, adequadte response time.Abdul tailored the tour around our neeeds/requests and put in a lot of little \"hidden gems\" that are interesting and are normally not found in a book. He showed us his own old pre-school and told us about the local school-system. Abdul managed to show us not only the the classic \"must-see\" sports in marrakech, but also some places, that show the way, people life in marrakech. He is a very nice guy to have around and we truly enjoyed the time with him. Most importantly, he does not constantly talk, but also knows, when to just let someone have their own time to see and feel the city. I will most definetly reconmend him to anyone who would ask about a tourguide in marrakech."

This was our first visit to Marrakech.Abdul met us promptly at our riad and led us on a tour that combined the medina, souks and several of the major historic and cultural sites as I'd requested. Abdul was vey willing to tailor the tour to our desires and adjusted to our needs as the day went on. As some other reviewers have described, Abdul can expose you to some truly local experiences that I'm sure many tourists never enjoy. These experiences proved to be some of the highlights of our entire two-week trip to Spain and Morocco. When I told Abdul that I'd made my own ras el hanout (a traditional Moroccan spice mix), he took us to his favorite spice vendor on our way back to the riad so I could purchase the authentic thing. It was so fragrant I couldn't believe it. I cooked with it the other night and not only did it taste great, it brought me back to our time in Marrakech.I highly recommend Abdul for his knowledge of this amazing city and his professional service."

I wanted to see the Medina, the souks and get a feeling for the people and the place. I wanted to see the craft and the craftsmen and to be able to navigate around Marrakech by myself. Abdul did all this and so much more. His well spoken narrative of history, surroundings and culture was informative and captivating.. He reminded me of a rhyme: \" I knew six very learned men they taught me all I knew, their names are what and why and when and how and where and who.\" This was Abdul - Very thorough and solicitous of my safety who allowed me to do things at my own pace. Even well after his ...responsibilities as a guide for one were over, he helped me with more than one crisis that arose. I am indebted to him, his graciousness and generosity and would recommend him to everyone.

We spent the day with Abdul yesterday and it was all we could have hoped.We are always a little nervous about spending a lot of time with someone we've never met but Abdul was friendly, interesting and had a rich vein of humour that put us at ease. Walking around Marrakech it was clear he knows many people and is well liked but we never felt that the day was outside of what we were interested in. There was not a long line of cousins waiting to sell us their goods.His English was very good and he took us around what we were interested in. On the way we did a large circuit of the city where we visited Dar Si Said (a museum of Morrocan arts), the old Jewish quarter, a number of nice places to have coffee and cake, a cobler, spice markets, a lamp shop, bakery, hammam oven and a general cross section of the souks. Really just a tour of life in Marrakech.Interspersed with all this he explained the culture and history of Marrakech and was never unable to answer our many questions. I couldn't recommend Abdul enough and if he hadn't been booked for the rest of the week we would have done more with him."

Abdul helped us understand the culture and also gave us a lot of tips on remembering our way around and ways to haggle with the souks! Abdul also helped us with directions on other places we wanted to visit later that week and also best places to buy things and exchange money for the best rates.I cannot thank Abdul for a great day, we really enjoyed our time with him. My advice would be make sure you have plenty of money exchanged in Dirhams, especially in small change as we made the mistake of only having big notes! Abdul can speak English really well, we had no problem understanding him at all. I recommend booking a day with Abdul if you really want to understand Marrakech and have a good laugh along the way.

A tour with Abdul is a different, and I imagine much better, experience than you're likely to have with many other tour providers in Marrakech. Abdul led a group of three of us around the city--rather than insist on hitting a handful of big and well-known sites and moving us from place to place, Abdul was an oasis of calm in a busy city, taking the time to really explain the history and culture of the city, how it's changed for better and for worse, and taking the time to answer our questions thoughtfully and in depth. His knowledge of Marrakech is deep and personal and his style focuses more on the experience of the tour group than rushing everyone around for it's own sake. If your own personal travel style places a greater emphasis on really getting to know a place over simply checking the boxes that you've seen a site listed in the guidebook, do yourself a favor and contact Abdul for a tour--you won't be disappointed."

We know Abdul is well respected in the community as frequently people would come up to him and greet him kindly. He patiently answered our questions and taught us a lot about the Moroccan culture. Abdul helped us buy some Moroccan products (such as bitter orange blossom oil for cooking, Argan oil and couscous), using his negotiating talents to ensure we got the best products from the most reputable sellers that he, himself, even buys from. He brought us to a local tagine restaurant just off Jemaa el Fna where the locals eat, and we got to see a community bake oven and taste the bread. We met the man in charge of the fire for heating the hammam waters and heard him play his traditional goat skin guitar.

I can not recommend this tour highly enough. Abdul arrived promptly at our Riad at 9.30 and our journey began. The tour is as specific or general as you want it to be. What my friend and I found invaluable is that Abdul took us places we would not have come across had we wandered the streets alone. For example we were taken to see the local bread ovens, where the women and children left their bread to bake in the mornings. This was in a very discreet doorway and had you not known it was there you would have gone straight past. Abdul not only gives you a sense of the history or Marrakech, but also gives you an idea of how the inhabitants live. The guide of the souks was fantastic, we were taken to corners that I am sure we would never have found had we been left to wander alone. Being able to see the metal workers and tanners working at their craft is a must see. Thanks to Abdul, we were not only able to find our way back to our Riad and to navigate the Souks successfully but we also had the confidence to go out and make the most of what Marrakech has to offer.Adbul has a great sense of humour, is very knowledgeable and was a pleasure to spend the day with.

Both of these days were the absolute highlight of our trip. Abdul really helped explain the history of Marrakech, and showed us some amazing off the beaten track secrets throughout the city. The man has a veritable map of hidden passageways, interesting characters, and local hangouts pinned up inside his head. Not only that, but he is very keen on responsible tourism \u2013 making sure to support the right people, pay fair prices and give back to the local community. Marrakech can be a very confusing city for outsiders, but it's guides like Abdul that can give you a greater understanding of its people and culture."

For her it became the highlight of our 6 days in Marokko. Especially eating the smoked sheepmeat with salt and cumin. Never booked a cityguide before. Would certainly do it again. It is an efficient way of meeting the heart of a city. Especially if your have such an experienced guide. And who will absolutely will not take you to any commercial shop. If you want to bargain he is more than willing to assist you. The funny thing is we met by accident a colleque at the middle of Jamaa el Fna. She and her partner looked somewhat bewildered of all the intense impressions. We on the other hand found ourselves totally confident and relaxed in Abdul's company. He thought us a lot of all different aspect of the city and we came in places we would never found on our own."

We met Abdul on our first full day in Marrakesh which was a great way to familiarise ourselves with the city as well as learn a whole lot about the culture and history. Abdul is very knowledgeable and has a great love for his 'home town' and tailored our tour to take in the sights we were interested in. If you're more interested in the lives of the people rather than the history leave out the Badi Palace where the storks next - you can go back to this on your own. I would have liked to have seen a school and the bread makers and wool dyers - but there just isn't enough time to do it all!We were particularly grateful that Abdul was willing to assist us in bartering for a couple of souvenirs which we just wouldn't have bought without him. He gave us the confidence to have a go ourselves the next day. As well as guiding us around, Abdul also made several suggestions of things we could go back to or do on our own - his great directions got us back through the souk to the Caf\u00e9 de Espice which is a lovely place to people watch. On another day we also took Abdul's tour to the Berber Village in the High Atlas mountains, which was a fabulous day. We were driven by a mountain guide who was happy to stop when ever there was a photo opportunity (quite often) and Abdul was very informative about the area we were passing through and the Berber house experience was something we would have missed out on without his help. We were shown the correct way to make mint tea, crack walnuts and eat with our hands with much laughter and good humour. I particularly enjoyed the opportunity to sit with the women of the household teasing wool and watching the children playing on the lower terrace.Thank you, Abdul. You made our holiday one to remember for a long time."

I was very clear - as two females (mother and daughter) travelling alone, my main concern was to be able to walk confidently round Marrakech and be able to orientate ourselves in terms of the key central areas of the city. Abdul clearly understood our concerns and managed not only to achieve this but also to show us some key historical sites and introduce us to something of the values and culture of Marrakech. We particularly loved the chance to visit a little kindergarten ( which he had attended himself as a child), the local bakery and a great place where locals had lunch ( we tried the tangia which was excellent.). Abdul also gave us advice on prices and bargaining in the souks and places to eat in Jamaa El Fna. All of his advice was totally sound and stood us in good stead for the rest of our visit.Abdul is a charming and respectful guide who is clearly passionate about his city - our private day tour was very well paced, with plenty of time to absorb the atmosphere and ask questions. The next day, when we were shopping in the souks, we met Abdul again, with another couple of visitors. It was great to see how pleased he was that we were happily and confidently negotiating the intricacies of the souks and the square. Job done!."

On viewing other past positive reviews on Abdul it made sense for us to book him for effectively our \"one day\" city tour. Abdul is very flexible on what places and things you would like to see. But obviously in the end it is impossible to practically fit everything in in one day. Overall, we were very glad that we booked the full day with Abdul. Nothing felt rushed and we were able to see pretty much most of the top five or six things we had selected at the beginning of our discussions to see (tanneries were unfortunately too far outside of the City centre to include and the tombs we prudently skipped as we had arrived too late in the morning and the queues were up to an hour long). If you truly want to experience the real side of Marrakech (not mentioned anywhere in 3 guide books I had)- where the locals buy their spices, meat, fruits and vegetables, where they actually eat (the chef in one of the restaurants we saw actually cooks for the King on occasions - and yes the food was very tasty as we had time for some lunch); where people take their bread in the morning to be baked; where the local people and also restaurants take their little clay pots for the meat and veg to be slow cooked; and also take in the whole manufacturing industry behind the souks giftware offerings (leather makers \u2013 shoes, belts; metal workers -lampshades etc. etc.) Abdul is the guide you need. Abdul, is very knowledgeable about most things we discussed, and made us feel instantly at ease walking around the city's secret back streets where inevitable we would have got lost and wasted our critical valuable time if we had gone alone. Overall, for all of the bad rumours we heard about being hassled and unfriendly people before we came, I would say that Marrakesh is the complete opposite. Abdul helps you understand that, and how life is there! After all, in the end, everyone is only trying to get by and make a living (including the snake charmers in the square \u2013 so don't try to be sneaky, just pay them a few coins for a picture = meal for their families). Even walking around the souks Abdul gave us an idea of finding our own way around whilst explained the art of bartering. On our own later, we did walk away on a couple of occasions when we were not happy with the price, and to be frank, in comparison we had more hassle in Istanbul main souk market a few years back. If we had had more time, or indeed decide to come back again for some winter sun, I would definitely book another tour with Abdul. Price is reasonable relative to time and other alternative guides that were available, plus he is flexible (we were a party of 2) but he allows up to 5 people should you are a bigger party or wanted to join up with other people."

We can nothing but to recommend Abdul for a day in the myriad of things to visit the Medina.Tove Elin Karin & Lennart"

I came armed with my list of things I wanted to see, and Abdul delivered on everything, and even more. He really knows his way around the city, and showed us things we would have never found on our own, or even thought to look for. We visited various markets, a hamam where local bread gets baked, and got an introduction into the souk. We stopped for lunch at a place that was excellent and did not feel super-touristy. Abdul's knowledge of Marrakech and its history could not be beat, and we are so glad that we were able to learn so much from him on our first day in the city."

He was great in responding to his emails, as we only contacted him on the previous Saturday night, and was he was efficient in making plans for the following morning. The tour itself definitely did not disappoint and there was no doubt that Abdul was the best man for the job! He showed us corners of the city that we would definitely not have visited otherwise and his explanations and descriptions during the guided walks were incredibly detailed. Furthermore, his willingness to answer all of our questions and tailor the tour to our interests made it that much more enjoyable. He was also able to give us really good recommendations of where to visit and eat at during the remaining time of our visit. I would happily recommend his tours to anybody who wants to see the real Marrakech and learn about it's culture and Abdul's sense of humour will guarantee you a great visit!"

It's not easy to navigate through the streets of Marrakech (street signs are hard to find and are in Arabic), so it is important to get a guide. Abdul was most knowledgable about the city, it's history and life. He brought us to where the locals would go to, including local eating joints (where we had the best lamb lunch). On route, we noticed that Abdul was well respected within the community. Top class professionalism!"

The E-mail replies from Abdul gave me confidence and this was confirmed when he came to meet our family (4) at our Riad for the start of our tour. We then spent 7+ hours in his company walking around Marrakech learning the history and culture of this fabulous city. I had asked Abdul to tailor the tour to take account of our two lads, 14 & 12 and their limited attention span for Museums & Gardens and to keep it interesting for them in other ways and this he did in spades; watching dye-ers, tin makers, bakers, a private viewing of a synagogue etc with the tour of the Medina interspersed with detours into great places that we would not have otherwise have found.Don't waste any time looking for another guide for city tours in Marrakech, period. Our tour was great from start to finish. Abdul is intelligent, and a caring and friendly guy with a good sense of humour and with a huge encyclopedic local knowledge which he is happy to share and he will tailor your tour exactly to your wishes. So If you are heading to Marrakech and you should, post him an e-mail and book a tour, but for early on in your stay, as we did, and then you have time to go back and spend more time in the many areas he will show you and one's you don't have time for but want to see more of."

I'm normally quite critical when it comes to reviewing holiday services / tours, however Abdul and his company fly way above any other experience we had during our recent holiday to Marrakech (and believe me they were good). My partner and I were a little apprehensive about booking a guided tour outside of the normal 'Holiday company organised ventures', but were so glad we did after our half day private guided tour with Abdul. It was fabulous from start to finish. Abdul is a sensitive , intelligent and very amiable chap with a great sense of humour and simply the best local knowledge that he will tailor to whatever you want to know/ do whilst on your tour. With him we saw, tasted and awed at things we would never have seen or experienced in Morocco. From historic buildings, local eateries that welcomed us back after the tour, to the real traditional fibre of the day to day life of local Moroccans plus all at fabulous value ! You need not worry when travelling to meet him as he welcomes you straight from your shuttle bus to start your tour. A huge thank you Abdul for your time. Yours was a top, top, top experience and we'll contact you for sure next time we're in Marrakech to book more private tours"

We also booked Abdul to take us to a Berber house in the Atlas mountains where we enjoyed the hospitality and food of a young man who has set up a sustainable tourism destination Imlil Authentic Toublak Lodge for trekking holidays. If you have the good fortune to go to this place you will be amazed at the totally different way of life. The tranquility and beauty of this area is truly breathtaking.

Our son got see so many things and taped some great stuff to show his classmates back home. Abdul is very polite and patient and his English is great. We also learned some Arabic words from him. He really caters the tour to what you want to do/see. I honestly wished that we would have hired him the whole time we were in Marrakech because it was so much easier and calmer when he was with us. He knows a great leather guy for Moroccan poufs and I might just take him up on his offer to send us one as we didn't buy one right then and then never found him again! The quality was great. I'm thinking of doing a girls shopping trip and believe me, he will hopefully be able to be with us the whole time!

Whenever we go to a city where we have never been, we have gotten into the habit of hiring a tour guide for the first day to acclimate ourselves to the new environment. We found Adbul here on Tripadvisor while researching our trip to Marrakech. We arranged for him to meet us at our Riad the first day and hired him for a full day.From the first few minutes with Abdul, we knew we had made a good decision to hire him. His knowledge of the city, and the history, politics and religion that shape it, are truly second to none. We learned so much just by listening to him as he guided us through the Medina. I am certain we saw things that we never would have found without him.He took us to an amazing little restaurant in the souk, not sure of the name, but ask him to take you to the place where they serve steamed lamb. They lower it into a deep hole in the ground and slow roast it all day and then sell it by the kilo. You eat it with your fingers and dip it in salt and cumin. So delicious! We never would have found this place on our own and if we had, never would have dared to go in and eat, mostly because of the sheeps heads on stakes at the front! LOL! But it was amazing!He guided us through the souks with such expertise that it was actually a great, non/stressful experience. If you tell him what you are looking for, he can take you to the best places to get it and also tell you what you should expect to pay, which is very helpful.After our full day with Abdul, we dared to go out on our own the next day. it was a totally different experience. We got lost, got hassled by guys on the streets and were just not having fun. We looked at each other and laughed and said *We miss Abdul!!*. So we sent him an email and crossed our fingers that he had the next day available. He did, so we hired him for our last day, for another full day tour.The second day was just as good as the first. We went to the Jewish quarter, the Yves St. Laurent gardens and lots of shopping for fabulous Morrocan textiles.Abdul really goes the extra mile for his clients. NOTHING is too much. If you want something and cannot find it, don\\t be surprised if he drops it off for you at your riad. That is just the kind of guy he is. Thoughtful, generous, kind, smart and just nice to be around.Don't waste your money using anybody else. Abdul is as far as you have to look. He will make your Marrakech experience unforgettable and you will also leave having made a friend.We wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone who asked! Book him! NOW! Seriously!"

This time we decided to organize our expeditions with a local tour guide as we did not dare to go everywhere last time.We found Abdul over the internet as he already had good reference. The alternative was to book the tours through our hotel. In the end I decided to go for Abdul as he was aready very proactive in suggesting interesting trips. We spent two days in Marrakech, one in a small Berber village in the Atlas mountains and one in a fishermen village called Essouira. Abdul was great and we could not have expected a better tour guide, as he showed us the secret cornes you would never see without a local guide. Abdul is not only very professional and highly educated but very much concerned and responsible about social minorities like children in Berber villages. I do highly recommend him. If you want to book a tour with Abdul you better get in contact with him at least two months ahead, as he is totaly booked out. One last thing. If you want to buy anything in Marrakech or during your trips, like spices, tea, argan oil, etc.. you have to tell Abdul as he will not take you for shopping. This is very unusual as guides tend to take you shopping. This is the difference between a professional guide and a \"shopping guide\". But when you ask Abdul for high quality Maroccan products he will take you to the right places or even offer you to buy you the spices at his home shop - which probably will cost 5 times less than what you will be ever able to bargain on the market ..."

I will say that I have always been a little hesitant on taking tours in general, but after experiencing it with Abdul, I can honestly say that it has CHANGED! Abdul is EXTREMELY informative not only in the area, the culture, and the way of life in Morroco. This HELPED a lot since I will honestly say that I was somewhat apprehensive being in Marrakech, at least initially. He explained that the houses are built with the inside of the house in mind, which then can make it SEEM as though the house is somewhat run down, at least from the outside. He also made sure that we saw what are the highlights of the area, but MADE sure that we would see what we wanted to see. He even was able to get a picture of my wife and I - she does not \"usually like\" having pictures taken of her. As stated in another review, he made it VERY easy for us to not only find our way around, but also with the local customs. Now on our other tour of the Atlas Mountains, he again was EXTREMELY informative about the area and also was able to arrange for us to have lunch in someone's house where he is converting part of it to a Riad. This not only made it quite comfortable, but also VERY welcomed since we were able to meet and interact with the \"local people\" and NOT with a typical tourist trap. He is great as a guide, I wish I could clone him and have him give us a tour in other parts of the world as we go and visit it. I know that if/when we go back and visit Marrakech, we would love to not only see Abdul again both on a personal and business level, I feel as though I have made a good friend \"half way around the world.!\""

He took me to a hamam fire pit, we saw where the locals pick up their bread and he assisted me with my souks purchases. Overall, this was a wonderful experience and I would recommend Abdul to anyone who has a thirst of knowledge for different cultures. Much appreciated Abdul:)"

Abdul came highly recommended per TripAdvisor reviews, so I quickly booked a half day city tour. Abdul picked us up at our Riad at 14:30 on the dot and proceeded to explain his suggested itinerary. Importantly, he was completely open to changes depending on what we had already seen during our sightseeing, and what we were most hoping to learn during our touring. We decided on a walk through the Jewish Quarter since this was where our Riad was located. Then we proceeded throughout the Old City, taking in the Souks, Djemaa el-Fna, Koutoubia Minaret, and finally on to Ali Ben Youssef Madrasa and Museum. Being guided by Abdul was truly a relaxing experience as he knew the intricate narrow lanes of the Old City like the back of his hand. My husband and I had gotten lost numerous times on our own (trust me! even with a map the Old City is very difficult to navigate). Abdul is an extremely knowledgeable guide. He provided a very through introduction to the rich history of Marrakech. He patiently answered all of our questions and was happy to extend the tour when we asked for his assistance with a purchase. We didn\u2019t realize until near the end of our tour but Abdul had been going non-stop since 9AM that morning. He had an earlier half day tour and hadn\u2019t even had time for lunch. We never would have guessed. He spoke enthusiastically about his hometown and was a joy to tour with."

He responded vey quickly and was able to fit in with our suggested time (even though it transpired it was his day off). We had a brief email discussion about what we wanted and he checked on this hen he came and met us at our Riad. We very much left the Tour up him and he guided us on a circular route around the Medina including the Bahia Palace and the Mellah area. He pitched things just right with plenty (but not too much) of detail. The pace was languid as he wanted to give us time to look at things as we went. He pointed out good places to come back to and eat and also gave us advice to help us find our way around the Medina on our own (which can be a challenge) including showing us to the restaurant we had chosen for lunch the end of the tour (making the tour longer than agreed). He finished the tour with a visit to local we will never forget that was fantastic but I won't spoil further as I think this is a regular highlight. The final remarkable thing about Abdul is never once did he try to steer us into his \"cousins\" shop. Highly recommended for a laid back introduction to the Medina."

When we first met Abdul, we were struck by how friendly, calm, warm and engaging he was. Abdul made a point of spending time clarifying exactly what we wanted to get out of our tour, which really helped to personalise our experience. I understand this is something that Abdul sees as being very important. Once he had a sense of our desires for the tour, it was very apparent that he made every effort to tailor it accordingly, which meant that we saw and did things that we found really interesting, vibrant and fun! For example, he helped us source a beautiful handmade leather pouffe for our home from a reputable merchant, took us to an awesome little restaurant for tangia for lunch, showed us around many beautiful historical sights including a museum, palace, the Katoubia Minerate, the many souks, and the main square. He also helped us to purchase some beautiful bitter orange oil which you can burn for the scent or use as a salad dressing! He was super knowledgable and passionate about Marrakech and was able to answer literally any question we had for him. He clearly loves what he does, and is good at it. Abdul is certified and professional - I understand there are some less reputable guides who are not certified - Abdul came highly recommended and we were very happy with our experience with him. Abdul was generous with his time and energy, and has great interpersonal skills. He also speaks fluent english which we found helpful. Abdul really helped us orientate ourselves in a city which can be quite overwhelming - the tour really helped us to feel confident in navigating the place ourselves in subsequent days, and helped us to feel excited about being in such a vibrant and interesting place! We could not recommend Abdul highly enough - you leave feeling like you would like to be friends with him! We went as a couple, but would recommend the tour for families, friends, solos - anyone really!"

            "review": "Unquestionably the best: Abdul (Marrakech Guided Day Tours). I traveled to Marrakech for four days and spent three on tours with Abdul because I wanted to experience as much as I could in such a short time. I chose him because of tripadvisor reviews and his beautiful website. The first day Abdul came to the riad and we made a general plan that included the specific interests I had describe when I booked him: day to day life, music, richness of the culture, the beauty of the architecture. As the day unfolded, I discovered all of that plus the framework of history and the rhythm of a city whose attraction stems from historical sites spanning centuries, the high energy square and colorful souks, and the private backstreets that protect the intimacy of family and home. Each quarter of the city held surprises: a literary cafe that sponsors artists and poets and community events, an explanation of the door within a door on family homes, attention to the layers of materials used to construct buildings down through the centuries, a stop at the primary school Abdul attended as a kid, attention to the craftsmanship that it takes to create the beauty that surrounds you, a demonstration of making slow cooked lamb on the coals of the furnace that heats the hammam (expert multitasking), the caravanserais or fondouks in the old medina that that supported commerce on ancient trade routes and so much more. Then on to the souks to get a feel for the layout. There was no pressure to buy, but invaluable advice about specific things I was interested in getting later when I returned on my own. There was food to nibble, like dates and olives and pomegranates. And serious food-- the most delicious, tender lamb dinner in the world. That evening at the riad no one had similar tales to tell. All the words in previous reviews are true: comfortable, knowledgeable, engaging; it felt like we were being guided around with a friend. Book Abdul early in your stay in Marrakech, and you'll feel at ease in this magical city."

We learnt so much and went to places we would never have thought of or knew about. He is also on hand for advice after the tour so it doesn't just end at the last stop in Jemna-el-fna. Abdul guided us through some Dars, the souks (briefly as you can spend hours there) and the museums. He provided us with restaurant and bar recommendations.

I travelled to Marrakech in June 2013 with my other half and we booked a half-day tour with Abdul on our very first day in the city. I cannot recommend this tour enough, especially at the start of your holiday so you feel confident in navigating the souks and with the culture. His English was excellent and he was a calm sort of guy- a good thing amongst busy Marrakech. As we were staying a bit outside the centre, we met Abdul outside the Mosque and it was easy to find him. He greeted us warmly and gave us a brief but interesting history of the area and was able to answer my questions. We then wandered through the Medina, having navigation tips explained to us as we went. He loves his city and seems very settled.We met locals, saw their daily routines, drank tea with them and learnt that it's ok to say 'no' in the souks when you don't want to do a deal! I probably would have found it unnerving to haggle but having a local with us, gave me the confidence to try it out before I did it on my own later in the holiday. At some points during the tour, I wanted to take photos of certain things and I looked to him to see if it was appropriate. He generally gave a reassuring nod of approval... as an ex art student, I'm a bit snap-happy but didn't want to cause anyone offence by photographing their shop fronts/family.We saw so much more than we ever would have found ourselves as he knew exactly where he was going. Lots of people knew him as we walked along, shaking his hand & saying hello - it was nice to watch! I cannot recommend booking this tour enough. Don't hesitate, just do it :)"

I also used a private tour guide later the next day recommended by my hotel who was cheaper (200 Dirhan for 3 hours), but perhaps not as seasoned nor knowledgeable as Abdul. would use Abdul again when I come back to Marrakech.

I contacted them and my emails were answered promptly. It helps if you have some idea of what you want to see during the tour depending on your interests. Otherwise they will put something together for you. You can do half or full day tours. As the working souks are closed on Fridays it is better to choose another day. Wear comfortable walking shoes.Our Guide, Abdul, met us at our Riad in the Medina at 9.30am as promised, for a half day walking tour. We learned all about the history of Marrakech as we walked through the alleyways of the Medina. As we walked he told us when each part of the Medina was built - he was born in the Medina and knows much about this fascinating part of Marrakech. The pace was leisurely and there was time for taking photos. We visited the bakery and watched the bread being baked. We visited the hammam, meeting the man who cooks the tangias for the locals. He is also a musician so he played some music for us. We took photos at each of these places - take your 20 dirham notes if you want photos. No money - no photos! We visited some of the working souks, the Medersa Ben Youssef and the Museum of Marrakech, which is close by. As we walked back to the Djemma el Fna through the souks with Abdul we realized how much knowledge he had shared with us during the tour, which ended at 1.00 pm. Abdul answered all our questions and took some photos for us. We could not have wished for a better Guide."

Due to Ramadan and the heat, we did a half-day tour, and I can imagine it very hard for one to be fasting and guiding clients through the city in the middle of summer. Yet that didn't stop him. He brought up many interesting facts and historical references that led to many more follow-up questions. He is also very attentive to details. We asked questions we wouldnt have considered asking for we just wouldnt have known. This makes him a true exception unlike some other tripadvisor-recommended guides who say just a little more than that already captured on the Lonely Planet or on Wikipedia.

A tailor made fun and historic filled three and a half hours. We paid a one off payment for the tour which was extremely reasonable and there was no 'carpet showroom' or 'silver factory' visits to be seen. I had let Abdul know roughly what we was after and he made sure he covered it all. We saw some great architecture and went through the winding souks in the medina and learnt a lot about the regular day to day lives of how moroccans conduct their business from baking bread, cooking in tangines (different pot shape to the tagine) and we went off the beaten track into the winding alleys and corridors of Marrakech. Abdul is extremely knowledgeable and has perfect ensglish and got the 'humour' of our group very quickly. Our time with Abdul went very quick and overall is a great intro into sightseeing in Marrakech. He will also tailor make/copy any package tour you could get from your travel agents and a much better cost. If I go back to Marrakech I will certainly look Abdul up and organise another trip or two with him as there is so much to see and do. Abdul looks after you with care and tenacity and made sure we had a taxi back to the hotel and we never felt worried or stranded. We went on our tour at 9:30am whilst it was still fairly cool. Many places to stop for water and comfy shoes a must. Please try Abdul as I cannot express how comfortable he made us all feel and he has a very good sense of humour too. Thank you Abdul, you were a mjaor part of our holiday as we then visited some of the places for longer rather than pay Thomas cook or First choice fees which aredouble if you DIY."

He was even more amazing then we expected (because we already read so many good reviews)! He was very easy going, relaxed and had so many interesting things to say! From the first contact (email) to the tour itself he was honest and very helpfull. He had interesting facts to tell about marrakech and answered al my questions. He is like a father because he's always concerned about his guests! If u visit Marrakech and u didnt get him as guide you dont know what u will miss!"

            "review": "Excellent Tour Guide!. We were ten tourism students from Switzerland who were staying in Marrakech for one week. To become more familiar with both the Medina as well as the history of Marrakech, we booked a half day guided tour with Abdul from Marrakech Guided Tours. Abdul picked us up from our Riad and showed us the way to the main entrance of the Souks. On our tour through the Medina we not only explored the Souks but also gained an insight into a traditional bakery, were able to listen to a traditional musician while enjoying a tea and visited an old Koran school and the Museum of Marrakech. During the whole tour, Abdul provided us with very interesting and profound information about the Medina and the local people\u2019s traditions and everyday life.All in all, Abdul was an excellent tour guide and we could not have been more pleased. We would highly recommend Abdul to anyone who is interested in exploring Marrakech."

Right from the very start, Abdul was quick to answer my emails and very helpful, assuring me that we could see everything we wanted to in his incredible Marrakech in the short time that we had. We met Abdul on our first evening, he arrived at our Riad just as promised and right on time. We had a introductory tour of the night market on the main square. Incredible experience to watch the sun set over the hundreds of food stalls billowing smoke, the buzz of entertainers, story tellers, snake charmers, fortune tellers, acrobats - it was truely unforgettable.The next morning we met Abdul again (feeling much more confident navigating through the twisty back streets if the Medina now thanks to his help the previous night!) We spent a day together which is difficult to put into words, we covered many of the main sights in this beautiful and historical city, but more than that, we learnt so much about the history, culture and daily lives of the people here. We met a community baker, hammam fire stoker and musician, local school teacher and young students, some of the best stall owners in the souks (no pressure to buy anything, just helpful advice on who to see for the best quality things we wanted), fantastic restaurant where even the King himself has eaten, but is so reasonable that the locals eat there everyday, plus as mentioned, sights such as Koutoubia Mosque, Majorelle Gardens, Ben Yousseft Madrasa, Marrakech Museum and many more. Abdul is such a generous, knowledgeable, kind and sincere man with such a deep understanding and love of this city and the people here. Having lived here all his life he knows every part of Marrakech intimately. By the end of our time with him we had learnt so much and felt like we had a really good understanding of this amazing place and can't wait to return to experience more. If you come to Marrckach you simply must try to book a tour with Abdul, given how good he is book early - as he is in demand! Truely a life changing experience to vistit this beautiful, vibrant, historical city with such a wonderful guide and lovely person as Abdul. Thank you so much Abdul, and we look forward to see you again when we return to Marrakech!"

We were a little dubious about heading out alone into the Souks of Marrakech.Abdul provided a half day walking tour around the main sites within the Medina and insightful history and general information about the city and the Moroccan people.We were supposed to finish at 6pm but Abdul was happy to continue our tour until after 8pm to make sure we saw as much as possible.We highly recommend Marrakech guided tours near the beginning of your stay in Marrakech in order to give you the confidence to \"go it alone\" during the rest of your holiday.We also went on the Atlas mountains tour which was a very relaxing experience. Off the general tourist path you can meet and eat with the local Berber people. A great experience."

We only had a day and a half in Marrakech, so we opted for the half day tour as an introduction to the city, and we are delighted we did. We were initially wary about Marrakech (travelling with a young daughter of 2) but those concerns seemed completely unfounded by the time we'd finished our tour. The tour was excellently paced, informative, and a great insight to the medina. It's a good way of orientating yourself. Abdul really knows his stuff, and is happy to on practically any topic. We had regular stops so the little one could get out of the backpack and wander about, he covered all the major things that we asked to see, and he had lots of recommendations for bars and restaurants for the rest of our time in Marrakech. We ended the tour at our Riad, and Abdul walked us back there, giving us lots of pointers so we could find our own way home next time. He was very prompt at responding to emails, and arrived to collect us from the Riad bang on time, as he said he would. In short: our half day tour was time very well spent. We have no hesitation in recommending Abdul."

From the 1st email conversation I knew that Abdul was going to be the perfect guide. He grew up a few metres away from the Riad where we were staying, so we had some great images of growing up in the area from the very first minute. We were taken to a local baker and ate fresh bread and pizza straight from the oven. We were given an impromptu concert from the boiler man for the hammam ( after stoking the fire, he played a few songs for us.) Abdul was able to show us Inside Marrakech and also showed us the sights that I asked to be included in our itinerary (museum of marrakech and the Koran school) This was the best way to be introduced to Marrakech and as this was in the afternoon of our arrival, we didn't even have Moroccan dirhams at the time, Abdul was very generous and paid entrance fees until we were able to get to an ATM. If you are looking for genuine Marrakech with a genuinely honest and knowledgeable guide, then look no further, Abdul IS your man. Many thanks Abdul, hopefully we will meet again someday. J & S"

It was a day well spent in his company, exploring the entire Medina following in the footprints of history. At first I thought that a full day tour would be too much for my 2 teenage nephews and my 2 young adult daughters, but he captured all our attention with his knowledge and passion for Marrakech. He opened our eyes to a culture so interesting and beautiful and made our tour a fun learning experience. Before the tour began, he asked us what we wanted to see and gave us a brief summary of what we could expect for the next 7 hours. Surprisingly, time just flew by so quickly. I loved the fact that knew how to capture the attention of all 4 kids and made sure they were engaged and participated in our conversations!We walked into the oldest part of the Medina and visited with the local baker, was entertained by the hammam water heater/tangia cook, saw artisans working their crafts and he even recommended the best restaurant for Roast Lamb right smack in the middle of the Souk! We wanted Shawarma for lunch and he took us to a pretty good place (kids went back the next day!) He also treated us to his son's favorite cookie as we wandered through the streets of his old neighborhood! Abdul is a Superb Tour Guide - with his excellent command of English and remarkable knowledge of Marrakech, its History and Culture comes to life as he walks you through the tiny cobbled streets of the Medina.Email Abdul and Book the Full Day Tour - it will be a day well spent!"

Abdul knows a lot of things we didn't find in our travelling books (we always prepare and read a lot before travelling to a country/city).We did a half day tour with our children (age 8 and 10). They don't speak English so we had to translate for them. In the beginning we had to ask Abdul to stop giving more information so that we could translate for the children but after a while Abdul saw when we needed to translate and gave us time to do it (this is very important because the children get bored if they have to wait for a long time for new information)For our children a half day was enough and they liked it very much and also learned a lot. For them it was very important that Abdul had also answers to their (child)questions !Just a small tip for improvement: we didn't realise we needed some small money to tip some people (for example the man of the backery).

This in itself made the whole place so much less daunting and a whole lot more comfortable and safe! I would say to have this information and to feel so welcomed on your first day is priceless and definitely worth the money for the tour.AbdulRazzaq was very knowledgeable of the city, having lived in the old city through his childhood, which we later got to see. He took us to the hammam where the coals were warmed and we were met with amazing musical entertainment and mint tea when we got to meet the coal burner up close and personally. This moment alone was worth the tour- absolute once in a life time opportunity which a normal \"tourist\" probably won't get to see easily. Following this we also go to see the bakery and how the locals have their bread baked.We must have seen everything there was to see just in this one day, so had a really good idea of what we wanted to spend more time on in the following days.The best part of the tour is getting close to the locals, and really choosing what you wish to see.Definitely recommend to all."

            "review": "Genuine, ethical, knowledgeable: Perfect guide for crazy city. We actually just finished the last 2 days with Abdul and are still in Marrakech. He was such a fantastic guide that I needed to write this review as it was still fresh in my head. First, we are a family of 3 which includes a rambunctious 4 year old. Abdul was a breath of fresh air in a city that will completely disorientate you and was a calming influence. The things that I expect from a guide were completely blown away by Abdul. He always looked out for our best interests, he entertained our 4 year old, he made sure that vendors were being genuine, showed us activities that no one else can show you on a mega tour, his knowledge base is amazing and no question was left unanswered. His love for his country completely shines through -- while he obviously made this a career you can still see his genuine appreciation for showing us his country and enthusiasm.We booked 2 tours;1. Full day tour -- lasts about 8 hours -- he showed us all the major sites -- he let us contour or tailor the tour with our interests during the entire day. For example, I needed a US travel adapter because our hotel did not have one that worked and Abdul helped me find one, it was rather cold weather here and he helped my wife find a shawl -- some private guides have a set agenda that they follow and that's it -- not Abdul. He constantly said that he would like to how us this if its okay or we can tell him something different. He always was looking out for my son -- talking to him, racing with him -- genuine and sincere acts as I can easily spot people who are faking it. He is a guide that is independent -- no kick backs, referrals, or commissions with anyone -- for eating we wanted something genuine whether it was street food or restaurant. He had thought about me, a vegetarian, my picky 4 year old, and my carnivorous wife -- he picked the best food. Abdul makes you feel comfortable because you're not going to know how to negotiate, not know the language, how much to tip... For example, many times he would argue with the locals when he felt they were overcharging me, or he felt that the tip was too much -- who does that? If you truly want someone on your side then he is your guide. Let me say this, whatever you want to see he will show you with confidence or he will show you what he thinks is important -- complete personal tour. I wanted activities for my son -- delivered with restroom Breaks, ice cream shops, camel rides, monkeys, snakes, looking at different animals....2. Essaouira day tour -- amazing tour. I wanted to spend an hour on the beach so my son could play and Abdul said no problem. He made sure that we saw everything in a concise fashion and we were able to make my son happy. No one else would allow this much contouring. One last example: my son wanted to ride the camel on the beach and Abdul had a heated conversation with the owner as he wanted to charge us 300 MAD and Abdul said that was a total scam And he brought it down to 100 MAD. Abdul is passionate about being ethical as does not like it when locals try to overcharge or scam others. Look at his pricing for the tours -- it's well below especially in what he delivers.Basically, if you want someone who will tell you the ins and outs of Marrakech, make you feel you have a friend in the city, makes sure you are not being taken advantage of, can easily handle children as little as mine, please book Abdul early. You will not make a better choice and your vacations will be so much better.April 27 and 28th -- tours with Abdul"

And if you have been before you will still enjoy the tour as it shows you things you would never have found out just from walking around in your own. I have some fabulous photos to prove this! Abdul made us feel totally comfortable to ask any questions and never seemed tired despite having done the tour a million times over I'm sure! He will also guide you to the best eateries, handmade goods, and authentic oils and spices... thank you Abdul."

Traveling as a single woman I was a bit apprehensive in such a chaotic city. Abdul made me feel at ease as soon as the tour began. He spoke excellent english, is passionate about his city and has so much knowledge to share, an excellent photographer and is interested in tailoring the tour to exactly what I was interested in seeing and experiencing. He walked my pace and made sure I was seeing everything I had hoped to. We were able to interact with the locals, eat lunch from a street vendor (at my request- I wanted to try true authentic Moroccan street food. He is very careful to only take you to restaurants he trusts are clean and will not make you sick). On my second day we took a trip to the Atlas mountains where I was able to hike through Berber villages and have drinks at The Kasbah du Toubkal. The views were amazing. Book early because he is very popular!"

We recently got back from our trip to Morocco, and although we went to a lot of places we were able to see Marrakech the best because of the tour. I say it was a much needed tour because there is so much we would have missed if we had not done the tour. Our guide Abdul was kind, very knowledgeable, and very patient with us (we were traveling with our 2 1/2 year old). I really did enjoy this tour very much and was sad when it ended because I had so many more questions to ask. I really would recommend this tour to anyone visiting Marrakech. It is an awesome city but you need someone who knows there way around to truly let you appreciate it."

Our main objective was to broadly see the city and get our bearings so our next few days we could walk around and feel comfortable we would not get lost. Abdul took special care to ensure we knew where we were and what to look for if we felt unsafe. This was especially important because we were traveling with a two year old. He even gave us his cellphone should we get lost during the rest of our stay. During our tour he provided a great deal of historic knowledge and showed us many off the beaten path areas that were very fascinating and beautiful. Thanks for everything Abdul!"

Abdul came to our Riad and together we planned our day. Having ventured out by ourselves the day before, getting hopelessly lost and at the mercy of unscrupulous 'helpful' guides, we could not have made a better decision or choice when opting for the full day tour with Abdul. We took it at a pace to suit ourselves, I have mobility issues, which Abdul took in to account on our trip at all times. He is a courteous, intelligent, well-informed and friendly man who, by the end of our amazing day together, we felt as if we'd known for years! He took us on a wonderful tour of the hidden treasures of Marrakech, which definitely needed extensive local knowledge to find and access. Lunch was a truely Moroccan 'foody' experience, delicious and a meal never to forget. Abdul also arranged a trip in to The Atlas Mountains with his associate Mohan--another brilliant day with a another lovely young man and excellent tour guide. Our Mitsubushi vehicle was comfortable and very easy for me to access. We visited a Berber House for tea and again ate lunch in an unforgettable place.Both trips were great value for money. We saved time and energy because we knew exactly where we were going and became much more knowledgable about Marrakech , the place and its people. It is difficult to describe how lost one can get in the souks especially. For us a guide was essential, and a bonus was to have met the best two guides possible.Many thanks again chaps. We hope to see you again.100% recommended!PS If you do need a bathroom whilst out, these two guides always know how to get you to one!!"

The two experiences, obviously, were very different, but Abdul's wide ranging knowledge, sensitivity to our needs, useful advice and unfailing charm and good humour were common to both. The half day tour is highly recommended as early as possible in your stay as it provides a first-rate introduction to the city: we walked for about four hours at a leisurely pace through an intelligently planned itinerary which introduced us to so much about the city: its structure and the rationale behind it, the nature of a riad, the way of life, the commerce [in the legendary souks], bread baking customs, hammams, the Medersa, historial buildings.. and much more. As others have said, Abdul invites you to specify your areas of interest, and he will tailor your tour to suit.Our second trip was a day out in the High Atlas Mountains - again specially tailored for softies like us - though a more physically strenuous version was offered had we wanted it! We drove in a very comfortable Land Cruiser which cushioned the rugged off road trail we took in order to see more of the fabulous countryside and views. In Imlil, we had been offered the choice of a smart hotel lunch or home cooked food in a Berber house - we chose the latter and the hospitality, the tea tasting ceremony and the excellent food were all perfect. Definitely the right choice! A post lunch walk through chestnut, cherry and olive groves was fine for us - though a longer walk up the mountain was also offered. Throughout the day, we enjoyed chatting to Abdul about a wide range of aspects of Moroccan life and culture (and, indeed, English: he has a degree in English Language & Literature!) - he is immensely knowledgeable. The service provided by Abdul is first rate, flexible and we would highly recommend him: I cannot imagine anyone doing a better job."

After a slightly inauspicious start (we gave him the wrong address), Abdul showed himself to be an excellent guide- knowledgeable, interesting to listen to, patient and willing to discuss all the subjects and questions we directed towards him. He had an excellent command of the English language and showed a breadth and depth of knowledge about the city and its past. We ambled around the city seeing and discussing numerous interesting sights and had the opportunity to go to some places we would never have found or tried by ourselves. To be honest it felt more like walking around with a knowledgeable friend than a guide. His relaxed pace and style gave a unique contrast to the hectic pace of the city and I was amazed how we could just stand and chat about something whilst the city buzzed around us. He will pay attention to where you want to go and where you have already been, give good advice about how to buy and who to buy from (if you ask) and take you to great places to eat and drink, again, according to your needs. Although we had already spent a day looking around Marrakech our full day with Abdul built on that easily and gave us a different perspective. Invaluable. In fact, we dubbed him the Obi-Wan of Marrakech!P.S. The negative reviews for Marrakech guided day tours do not match our experience at all. In fact, one that looks like it is from a Londoner has very poor use of English and all the other reviews from that reviewer are from the same day with single word comments. They look like false reviews -treat with caution."

A new place to visit can seem worrying or unnerving meaning people miss out of some amazing things. From the very beginning our guide made us feel comfortable and safe offering reassurance and light hearten dialogue.Historical to geographical, religious to numerous, There was nothing our guide Abdul was not able to express. We were shown food production, riads, markets and restaurants. I particularly liked Abdul's approach offering choices and allowing our family to plan what we wanted to do during the trip, making sure we didn't miss anything. Some guides have told us what we are to do and where we must go, but with Abdul, we were able to spend a day seeing all there was to see, with a smile on our faces and a relaxed yet safe feeling to the day. All the we were promised was delivered from the peace and tranquility that the riad offered, to the satisfaction we got from interacting with the market traders, knowing our guide was not far away if we needed him. I think we asked a hundred questions, all of which received a smile and logical answer. Rarely have I felt so calm and content in such a busy place, thank you so much Abdul for making our families trip so amazing. So in my opinion, if you want to speak to someone who knows all there is about this beautiful town and country, and can help you to see and do all you could wish for...look no further than speaking with the person we had the pleasure of meeting, Abdul.Thank you so much and \"Our hearts remain frozen from all we have seen\".

I.e. Where the typical Moroccan bread is baked and the nursery. Abdul then explained to us the type of houses (Riads and a Dar) and how the homes are built for privacy. He was able to answer all our questions. We were taken around Ben Youssef and Abdul explained in great detail the history of the buildings architecture and uses. He then took us to explore deep into the Souks, explaining how to best examine the quality the things for sales (i.e. tea pots). I could not recommend Abdul enough.

Abdul asked us what we would like to see and experience, however as there is so much going on that we opted for a sample of everything, which is exactly what Abdul delivered. Abdul guided us through the south of the Medina, visiting various places of interest whilst explaining how the different quarters began. We then traversed up through the Souks to a lovely Riad for lunch, after lunch we continued through the north finally ariving at the main square at 5.30pm.....a full day for an excellent price. If your going to Marrakech I would highly recommend booking a day tour with Abdul, at all times we felt safe and got no hassle from street sellers, nor did Abdul take us to any of his 'friends' souks for good price gifts.

He was extremely charming and courteous at all times. As he was already booked for the Monday, he arranged for a colleague, Ben, to take us to the Atlas mountains. Abdul arranged the transport and fantastic lunch at a Berber house for all 13 of us. Abdul himself came to the Riad to introduce Ben and ensure that all the arrangements with the bus etc were just perfect. Ben spoke excellent English too and gave us a fabulous day. Most of the party climbed and walked through the villages, I found I couldn't manage, so a mule was whistled up for me which was amazing. All our party said the High Atlas trip was a real highlight.

We didn\u2019t want a cultural tour of the palaces and museums as we were confident that we could take in as much as we wanted to by exploring these ourselves. We told him that instead we wanted to meet the local people and craftsman, not just the places accessible and discoverable by an inquisitive tourist. We had intended on booking him for a full day to accomplish this, he very kindly explained that it was not necessary to book him for the full day as a half day was enough for him to show us around and allow us to orientate ourselves. We booked him for the afternoon of our first full day in Marrakech and also booked him for a full day to see the Atlas mountains the day after. Abdul arrived at our riad at 2.30 and we had a quick discussion to confirm our preferences. He first took us the best way to reach Jemaa el Fna square through a busy alley buzzing with locals on foot, donkeys and mopeds. When we reached the square the heavens opened and we sheltered for about ten minutes under the cover of an orange sellers stall until the rain eased and we could continue. After explaining the important landmarks in and around the square he led us through some increasingly quieter alleyways to the northern area of the Medina where the most beautiful riads are to be found. We stopped in a lovely riad for drinks of fresh almond and orange juices. A few minutes later we were deep in the heart of the souks where tourists were very sparse. He managed to perfectly balance his observations for us with quiet times to let us take it all in. He stopped a street vendor to buy a bundle of sketchbooks and then took us to a local primary school to meet a teacher and her class. Kristi had said that she wanted to see a public bakery and he took us to one that I defy anyone to find on their own, it was tucked away, tiny and magical. As was the next stop to meet the men who keep the fires going for one of the public hamams. They made mint tea for us and one of them sang a song whilst playing some strange stringed instrument, wonderful characters, kind, gentle and very funny. We finished our tour back at the square as we had requested so that we could experience the bustle in the early evening. The following day Abdul and his driver picked us up in a 4-wheel drive to go to a village in the Atlas Mountains. On the way it was very cloudy and as we got higher it was either very foggy or we were in dense cloud, visibility was about 20 feet but the driver was very safe. Abdul remained cheerful and confident saying that it would clear soon. We stopped for mint tea with a local Berber family before continuing through the mist. Finally it cleared and travelled through beautiful valleys of fruit and walnut trees before reaching our destination. Abdul gave us the option of taking lunch at the Kasbah Du Toubkal or to visit a family in a Berber village, we opted for the latter and reached the house after a short trek. We were greeted by a Berber called Lahcen who led us to his balcony overlooking Mount Toubkal. He brought us dates and almonds and encouraged us to make mint tea under his guidance. After a tour of his house (which he hopes to make into a guest house called Imlil Authentic Toubkal Lodge later this year), Lahcen brought us the most incredible lunch of Moroccan salad, a superb and authentic lamb tagine with preserved lemons, onions and prunes and a couscous and vegetable tagine which we all shared. Abdul had already explained that a 400 Dirham contribution for the meal would be ample but we tipped an extra 100. It was easily the best food that we had on our holiday. After saying our thanks and goodbyes we elected the \u201cmedium\u201d length walk to see the Kasbah and were astonished to be greeted by Lahcen who had taken a short cut to his second job! After a drink we made our way back to Marrakech and the riad. We said our thanks and goodbyes to Abdul, a warm and gentle man without who our experience in Marrakech would not have been the same. I must say that we travel widely and often but very rarely take any sort of a tour. Abdul absolutely made our holiday in Marrakech and we thoroughly recommend him, we saw things that we would never had without his local knowledge. On a final note, he never, ever, gave any hint that we should visit any shops or buy from traders and I would view any comments to the contrary with great scepticism."

After reading wonderful reviews I contacted Abdul and he got back to me straight away, the prices were so reasonable that we booked a 1/2 tour. We met Abdul by the Koutoubia at 9.30am and he put us at ease straight away, he was so knowledgeable and totally flexible as to what we wanted to see. It was so nice seeing Marrakech with a guide, Abdul knew so much about the city and guided us around the souks, the medina and the derbs, all while giving us the history of the city. While walking through the souks, one of the shopkeepers tried to get us in, but Abdul very kindly told him were weren't interested, which was such a relief as the shopkeepers can be VERY persuasive. At no time did we feel he was taking us to any shops, which was good as we just wanted to walk through. At the end of our tour, Abdul very kindly said we could contact him should we have any further questions - which I thought was such a friendly gesture. I would without hesistation use Abdul again for another tour if I head back to Morocco, and also recommmend his Guided Tours to friends and family. Thank you Abdul for making our start in Morocco so enjoyable. Natalie and Liz"

It was a great idea as the medina was initially quite confusing with its many lanes. Abdul is a great guide who tailored the tour according to my interests and did not rush the tour. I even called him the next day when I wanted to back to a specific part of the medina but couldn't remember how to get there and he was kind enough to give us directions and even to send a text to make sure we are ok.The tour is 45 Euros and definitely worthwhile especially if it is your first time to Marrakech."

We decided to contact Abdul before going to Marrakech, as he had so many good reviews on tripadvisor....and he certainly didn't disappoint! A gentle, friendly man who has a lovely manner about him and introduces Marrakech to you in an almost 'organic' way. It's a very hectic place and perhaps even a little intimidating if you've never been to somewhere as busy, but because we had our tour with Abdul the first day of our visit, we were made to feel very confident about exploring the city further on our own, once our tour with Abdul had finished. He didn't rush us, and was very happy to answer our many questions in an informative, engaging way.Highly recommended - and we would definitely recommend trying to do a tour with him right at the start of your stay if you've not been before. For one thing, he really made sure we understood how to get back to our Riad (not easy within the Medina as the little lanes can be confusing).Thanks Abdul, we greatly enjoyed your tour."

All the excellent reviews on here are fully justified.Having arrived late at night the tour was arranged for our first morning. Marrakech is an overwhelming, frantic city and more than anything Abdul's tour help us to acclimatise and become familiar with our surroundings. One of the advantages is that the tour is very flexible and Abdul will fit the tour to your requirements. We wanted a basic grounding so that we could orientate ourselves in the city and this was more than delivered.Abdul proved to be an excellent guide and great company. He seems to know everyone in the city and we thoroughly enjoyed our tour. As well as pointing out the main sites he took us into the souks and we visited places we wouldn't have discovered ourselves. He also advised us on etiquette and pointed out a variety of places to eat at our request. His English is excellent and there was no hard sell of any stalls or shops so it was easy to relax and feel comfortable in his company. It's very good value and a much better way of seeing the city than with a large tour group. We would certainly seek him out again if we returned and can highly recommend him to everyone."

Abdul speaks perfect English, and educated us in the history of the city, as well as providing a great insight into day-to-day life in Marrakech which we wouldn't have seen if we hadn't opted to go on this tour. He is very knowledgeable and genuine in his explanations; I say this because we heard another tour guide talking nonsense to a tourist at one of the places we visited. My only criticism is that during the very last part of the tour, which was in the Souks, he was walking a bit ahead of us and not really saying much. I believe this was to let us take in the sights and sounds but we spent plenty of time by ourselves in the Souk in any case. Overall a great tour, very personal and a great way to get an introduction to Marrakech!"

One thing to note is that Abdul is clearly in demand as for the last part of the tour when we were wandering through the souk he picked up a number of calls on his phone (maybe sorting other tours?) which was a bit frustrating when we paid for his time.

We booked Abdul for a full day tour of Marrakech as we didn't want to be in a large tour group and really wanted to get away from the usual tourist route. So pleased we decided to go with Adul as he totally tailor made the trip to what we wanted to do.We visited the Palace, Saadian tombs, Ben Youseff and Museum and more interestingly for me the jewish quarter, spice markets and souks. It was my second time in Marrakech and I loved seeing parts of it I just wouldn't of without Abdul. I think the most interesting part of the tour was having coffee and simply discussing the culture, it was fascinating to have an open and honest conversation about the traditions and about aspects of the culture you would normally never have a chance to discuss. I feel I have come away with a better understanding of the Muslim religion and culture, and one that you simply wouldn't get doing a tour through a hotel rep or in a large group.I would thoughrally reccommend doing a tour with Abdul - I would also say do the full day as you will see so much more and is 100% worth the money - you won;t regret it and will learn and see so much"

Marrakech is a vibrant, bustling city with endless windy roads and alleyways and surprises hidden behind every corner. But to some tourists it can be perceived as daunting and even a little threatening. We travelled with a tour operator but didn\u2019t really fancy their standard tours with around 30 people, attracting negative attention wherever they go. We wanted to see the real Marrakech, learn about the history and the way of life.So, after doing some research we settled on Marrakech Guided Tours. I contacted them and had a very swift response from a guide called Abdul, who was very polite and helpful and even arranged to meet us at our hotel. Abdul arrived on time and was very polite and spoke excellent English.We started our tour at the Koutoubia Mosque and Minaret where we were given a fascinating lecture on its history and the history of Marrakech. You can specify what you want to do and see, but we just wanted a general introduction to the city and advised Abdul to show us what he felt was significant.We made our way through streets full of locals and learned all about the history, architecture and the culture \u2013 even stopping at a local school and bakery. We visited a museum and the former university (costs extra), then we visited the Caf\u00e9 de Epices where we sat and enjoyed the views other a smaller market square.The whole time Abdul was friendly, helpful, polite and informative. When we pressed him for recommendations of where to buy things, he was reluctant to advise, a sign that he was trustworthy, but did provide some useful tips on where the locals shop. He offered to take pictures of the two of us, which was really nice, as I'm not very good with a camera it means there are usually more pictures of me than my girlfriend. Abdul spent several hours with us and even arranged a taxi for us to go back to the hotel (at an extra cost of about \u00a312 - evening rates)."

I tried, in vain to book a last minute tour with Abdul from Marrakech Guided Day Tours (I emailed on the Wednesday for a Saturday tour!). Abdul was already booked for that day, but fortunately he put me in contact with Khalid Amor, another Marrakech Guided Day Tours guide who (as well as being great friends with him) was a colleague of Abdul's. Fortunately for us this proved to be a most auspicious recommendation! Khalid promptly emailed me back to let me know that he was available to take us on a guided tour of the Medina. Khalid arrived promptly at our wonderful Palais Sebban and we discussed where we would like to go for the day....we just asked him to show us the real Marrakech...map out, we were on our way. To say this was a superb day would be an understatement. Khalid was superb - showing us all those places that would normally be inaccessible to a weekend tourist. We visited a locals' fruit market which was tucked down some winding alleys which was fabulous - Khalid treated us to some just picked oranges which were much appreciated (we were walking miles!). We visited everywhere from the backstreet artisan courtyards to the leather auction, from the metalwork district to the stunningly beautiful Bahia Palace, from the winding streets of the Jewish quarter to the atmospheric and mind-blowing souks. One of the most enjoyable parts of the day was sharing lunch with Khalid in his 'local' cafe in the souk - fantastic kebabs, chickpeas and lentil broth - stunning food with amazing company. Khalid made what was a fabulous long weekend in Marrakech even more special - he even arrived at our hotel on the Sunday with a birthday present for me which was so heartwarming. If you want to see the real Marrakech with a real gentleman with a passion for his home town and country and a wealth of knowledge - please look no further thank booking with this fantastic pair of guides. (We bumped into Abdul twice which was an absolute pleasure - he greeted us like old friends - and it was clear that he and Khalid were kindred spirits with a passion for their work). Khalid spent from 9am-4pm on that Saturday and we felt like we were saying goodbye to an old friend when he left. We will certainly be back and we will certainly be booking another tour! Money well spent and highly recommended."

It's easy to get lost in Marrakesh and our riad was south of the medina and though beautiful once we were through the front door, it was situated in what looked as though in was not in the best of areas. Abdul met us at our riad at 9.30 as arranged, and showed us the best way to reach the Jemma El Fnaa square which is the heart of Marrakesh. We needn't have worried, it was all quite straightforward once we knew.Abdul will tailor your tour to your particular interest. Whilst we were interested to find out lots about Marrakesh, we are particular interested in the food. Abdul took us to a bakery and showed us where all the local women take their bread to be baked - it was amazing to see all the very similar loaves that had been/were waiting to be baked - the baker knew whose was whose though the looked the same to us!He showed us a boiler room for one of the hammams where a man was continually stoking a fire with wood shavings which was heating the water. Local people brought their tangias (cooking pots - not tagines), a Morrocan dish containing meat and vegetables which he cooked for hours in the resulting ash from the ovens. The man then kindly played us a little Morrocan music on an instrument we have never seen before! Both these visits were particularly interesting and we would never have seen these without Abdul. He also took us around the souks - pointed out the spices, the sheeps heads (we passed on them), talked about the herbs and other dishes, dried fruits, the stalls that spring up in the square every evening cooking all sorts of food etc. as well us showing us some of the Marrakesh architecture and talking about the Muslim faith and the mosques and general way of life for Morrocans.We would recommend Abdul - especially if it is your first visit to Marrakesh!"

My parents booked a \"last minute\" holiday to Marrakech and I booked this trip on behalf of my parents as I am always advocating how much more you get from a private tour. I got the name of the company from Trip Advisor and then went to their e-mail. I e-mailed the company directly about the Hidden Marrakech walk to confirm that my 78 and 80 year old parents would be able to cope with the itinerary. I exchanged a number of e-mails with Abdul and once I was happy with the responses (all of which were really speedy and covered the information I needed) I settled on a date and time for them to be met at their hotel. Abdul was there waiting to take them to the old city centre and when my parents returned to the UK their enthusiasm for the tour and Abdul himself was unabated. While I cannot comment on the trip directly as I wasn't there I am incrediably enthusuastic that people realise how easy this company was to deal with and they provided everything they promised in my dialog with them. Thanks to Abdul for making my parents holiday more special and I look forward to a tour with the company when my partner and I eventually get to Marrakech."

This year we didn't spend our Christmas at home, we were eager to find something different, something not red, white and green, something that reminded us of the humanity behind the festivity and not the capitalism around it. We decided to spend our Christmas in a place where there is no Christmas. We spent it in Marrakech.Abdul was our generous guide there, showed us all the best views, we discovered the food not served at fancy restaurants, the richness of his culture, and all the wonderful things the Medina has to offer. We had the best of times.However, through his work, I learned who the real Abdul is, what he has for lunch, what his wife thinks of a happy marriage, what he's wishes are for himself and his family\u2019s future, what his religion means to him... Trough his work he was able to give me a piece of his soul. To me, art means connecting with people, and therefore, Abdul is an artist in his own right.This is what I take home for Christmas, the touch of an artist, his people and his city."

Leading a tour of 6 and a 10 month baby around the busy and narrow streets and making sure we were safe can't be easy!He asked us what we wanted to see and led us there. There were a few things we ran out of time on but he helped to orientate us so we saw those things the following day. He gives great advice for us first timers and also provided suggestions that we welcomed with open arms - like the mishwi restaurant hidden near the square - absolutely worth it!A highly recommended tour guide in our opinion.Thank you Abdul!"

After reading other reviews on this site, we concluded that Abdul must be special and so decided to ask him to orient us to Marrakech during our first morning. The email communication was easy, prompt, and clear, and the resultant tour was as advertised. He asked us what we wanted, and then delivered. After staying in Marrakech for 9 days, in hindsight the tour was an excellent introduction to many aspects. He taught us much about the history and culture of the region. After the tour, we were readily able to navigate on our own, and comfortable going anywhere. He was full of advice about what to do during our stay. He was willing to stop where we wanted and take as much time as we needed. Explanations were complete and clear; he is easy to talk to. Unlike other guides, he never steered us to any merchant or store; in fact, he took pains to avoid favoring any.The only problem with Abdul, as he told us, is that his reputation as a guide is becoming so strong that he may be 100% obligated during busy times. This is a good problem to have: book early -- and you won't be disappointed."

After earlier excellent reviews I booked Abdul for a half day tour on the 26th December. Abdul asked what our interests were by mail and we indicated we would be most interested by seeing the craftsmen of the souks at work and seeing how they lived their lives. Abdul began his tour with a little bit of the history of the establishment of Marrakech a thousand years ago, then illustrated how this history has shaped how the city and souks, and neighbourhoods were constructed. We saw a leather hide market, metal workers at work, shoe makers and the communal bakeries. All done attentively listening to us and our thoughts and giving us his personal insights into his city. Marrakech is confusing, noisy and shocking in parts to the Western eye, but Abdul made us feel safe and there was no time wasted getting lost in the souks or trying to avoid the guys who hassle you to buy their wares or services. I would recommend Abdul without hesitation. Thanks again!"

Over the years, we have travelled extensively and enjoyed getting to know the people and places we visit. Not being fluent in French or Arabic, I chose to engage a knowledgeable local english speaking guide to help us. Upon reading the reviews, I engaged Abdul to show us his city. It proved to be the best decision I made. He is an intelligent, courteous and attentive guide who knows much about the city\u2019s people and but how Morocco has evolved. He patiently answered our questions and gave us a better understanding of the daily lives of the people. Besides all the \u2018must see\u2019 tourist places, Abdul showed us sights that we would have missed. So we were able to relate everyday activities with what we had learned. We passed through myriads of passages, old and new, encountered local markets and caught glimpses of craftsmen focused on their work.We began our tour in the southern part of the Medina, walked to the Kasbah and onto the Mellah. We meandered towards the Medersa and through souks until we finally reached Jemaa el Fna. Having soaked up the atmosphere there, we took a caleche and rode to Jardin Marjorelle. The garden was a delightfully tranquil place and a lovely way to end our day with Abdul.Watching Abdul interacting with his countrymen showed us how one should behave. We were never harried by unsolicited sellers or unnecessary distractions. He was punctual and as I had arranged, met us at our hotel on the edge of the Palmeraie. Thank you Abdul for making it a most enjoyable experience for my son and I."

Let me start with the conclusion: after a whole day guided tour with Abdul you're really ready to conquer this wonderful city all by your own. The method? Walking around with Abdul in Mellah, Kasbah, Mouassine and other of the colourful but not so touristic quarters of Marrakech while you listen to his intelligent and knowledgeable presentation of what you are seeing you step by step understands the city, the atmosphere and its people. When you're witnessing Abdul's polite and respectful greetings of the tradesmen in the souks you understand that the sometimes agressive rejection that you were ready to show towards eager Morrocans is not the right way. Show people respect and they will respect you. This attitude that we learnt by Abdul we tried to perform the rest of our holiday and it worked. So besides all the factual information you get from Abdul you also get a peep into the soul of Marrakech and its people."

There were so many things on my \"must-see\" list and I only had 2 days to see it. I started reading about guides when I came across Abdul Aissaoui Marrakech Guided Tours and immediately checked to see if he had any reviews. Every one of them was a 5 star rating. I emailed him and we booked a 2 hour night tour (with my husband) to the Jemaa el-fnaa for some local fair and then a full day tour the next day starting at 9am He was prompt and professional right from the get-go. We started our walk from the Hotel Sofitel and already he was giving us some history of the city. We ate in the center square, had a nice meal, some local tea and he made the whole experience so easy. He helped us order and made sure we tried some new foods native to Morocco. The next morning he arrive to the hotel and again...made me feel at ease. He knew so much about the history of the city and kept saying, \"I hope to show you everything...I want to be sure you see all that I have planned for you.\" And we did!! I could spend all day trying to remember it all...I don't think we missed anything (except for the gardens which he offered to show me but I was too tired). Each stop was filled with more information and he even took me to a beautiful cafe (inside a riad) to the rooftop to enjoy the sun and quiet. Don't allow the concierge to book your guide for you. You'll be disappointed. Our friends ended up shopping all day and learned nothing of the rich history of this region. I could go on and on but needless to say, I left there feeling like a made a new friend....and probably did. He is excellent at what he does and it comes off as effortless. You will be very pleased with Abdul as your guide."

We couldn't have been more pleased. He is a trained and certified guide with a huge breadth of knowledge about his country and his countrymen. Although we enjoyed the main sights in the three areas where he offers tours, the medina, the Atlas Mountains and the Atlantic coast village of Essaouri, it was the special, unique parts of our trips that we loved the most. We visited a local bakery where women of the medina bring their dough to be baked in the wood-fired oven every day. We walked in the old Jewish quarter in the evening. We had tea and fresh bread and honey with a Berber family in a small rural village and we visited the weekly market in a small town on the way to the coast where we were the only tourists. Abdul told us a tremendous amount about Moroccan culture and it's treasures - the people, the crafts, the food, the scenery, the history. He was very generous with his time, so we never felt rushed. He adjusted his pace and the itinerary to our preferences. We had told him a little about our likes and dislikes before we arrived and he understood them perfectly and tailored our tours to accomodate them - thus we were never pressured to shop, we did not spend endless hours in palaces and museums, but had active days and not only the evening chaos of the Djemma el-Fna, but also visited lovely gardens and galleries, saw craftsmen at work, people going on with the chores of daily life, goats in trees and women grinding argan nuts into precious oil. He gently deflected the occasionally pushy vendors, and carefully and sensitively guided us in appreciating the role that the Muslim faith plays in the everyday lives of the people of Morocco. It was a wonderful experience to get to know this intelligent, curious, thoughtful, and gentle man who truly enjoys his work and loves his country and its people. I would recommend him without hesitation to visitors of all ages and all interests including families. We learned a tremendous amount and are curious to know even more when we return and ask him once again to be our guide."

We visited a baker and hamam (but no to bath, but to see men who is heating). We could also see how people play Gwana music. Naturally you could not experience those part without having guide.Abdul is calm, modest and comfortable person, speaks very clear English. Since it is a private guide, he can create a tailor-made walikng tour for you. Or you can tell him what you want to see.

Abdul is a knowledgeable,serious and friendly guide who will open up the place for you. I'm a very demanding traveller always full of questions about history, my friend Monica wanted to photograph every stall in the bazaars. Abdul carefully and thoughtfully accommodated both of us so we both got what we were looking for, not an easy task. Thanks Abdul and we hope you continue to help many more people unlock your beautiful city."

I was with my 20 year old daughter and two of her friends.We had an amazing time thanks to Abdul. He took us to places in the Medina that we would have never known about like the bread maker for families in the medina, a tour of a school of spices.He kept all the merchants at bay , so we never felt harassed during our shopping. It was truly a wonderful experience. our only regret is that we were there for such a short time. But we will definitely be back to spend more time in Marrakech with our wonderful guide and friend Abdul."

If he's already booked we really have no one else to recommend.\" We'll second all the positive things said in other reviews after our morning with him, but add that he was more than willing to find places for a few minutes' resting or bio-breaks and other necessities that just aren't apparent and available to the self-guided. We learned much about the history and architecture, our preferred topics, but learned even more about the culture of the Moroccan people, characteristics of Islam in normal practice, and many other topics that really enriched our visit to this fascinating country. Hire Abdul, tell him about your interests. Ask him a lot of questions. You'll have a wonderful day."

We booked Marrakech Guided Tours (Abdul) through our Riad as they ensured us that Abdul is the best of the best as far as tour guides in Marrakesh. We were nervous about exploring the Medina and Marrakech on our own for the first day, so being able to take a tour with Abdul was exactly what we were looking for and more. The minute we met Abdul, we got a great vibe from him and his English is excellent. He asked us what we were interested in seeing/not seeing and he took us around the city based on this - which was nice as neither me nor my friend really cared to see too many museums. While on our tour with Abdul, we learned about the history of Marrakech, stories behind specific sites, personal stories from him about growing up in Marrakech - it was perfect! We had such a great day on the tour, that we hired Abdul again for the next day and we toured Majorelle and Menera Gardens which was really great. Another important thing to note, he never once (on either day) tried to take us into any stores so that he could get commission on what we bought. Apparently, this is very common with tour guides in Marrakech, but not at all the case with Abdul. All in all, it is definitely worth spending the extra $$ to have such a wonderful, knowledgable and trustworthy tour guide like Abdul. What a wonderful experience!"

When we booked a guide through our Riad, we did not expect to find someone as fantastic as Abdul! Abdul speaks absolutely excellent English, and he is charming, good humoured, professional, intelligent, and courteous \u2013 it was a real pleasure to have his company. We were so pleased after our first day with him that we immediately booked him for a second full day! The first thing that Abdul asked us was what our interests were and what we wanted to do and see. The great thing was that as well as being able to see and experience everything we hoped for, Abdul also took us to some amazing places that we would never have been able to find on our own. It was very helpful to get aquainted with the layout of the medina with a guide before we ventured out on our own.Abdul is extremely knowledgeable about the history and culture of Marrakech and Morocco and we were fascinated by his commentary as we visited many historical sites and beautiful buildings in the medina. We were delighted that through Abdul we were able to visit traditional bakers, musicians, leather craftsman, and stucco carvers and see them in action. It was a great experience to be able to meet some of the locals. My partner is very interested in music and he was thrilled to have the opportunity to play a traditional Moroccan stringed instrument. Abdul also helped him find some great CDs of Moroccan musicians.We had read in our 'Lonely planet' guide book that sometimes tourists can have difficulties with shopping in the markets of Marrakech, but Abdul made it a pleasure, with no hassles, and no pressure. He even carried my shopping bags! When we told Abdul what we wanted to buy, he helped us find the best quality authentic items for very reasonable prices. My favourite souvenir from our trip to the markets was a beautiful traditional Moroccan leather pouffe. We were able to watch the craftsman hand-stitching the leather pieces together - very fascinating! At the end of each day I relax and put my feet up on our beautiful pouffe, and I am always reminded of Marrakech! Abdul was an excellent guide in all respects. We can thank him for some great memories of our time in Morocco and we are very pleased to keep in touch with him on our return home. We would highly recommend his services to anyone visiting Marrakech. Our guided tours with Abdul were the highlight of our time in this beautiful city."

In 3 days, we covered more than 1200 KM of beautiful Moroccan countryside with treasures and adventures all along the way. From the High Atlas to the sands of Erg Chebbi in the Sahara Desert, it was a visual and informational feast of the senses - and I have not even mentioned the mint tea, tasty tagines, and traditional Berber meals yet! This is a perfect way to see Morocco (especially if you are a bit short on time like we were) and fit in a ton of different things. You have your own private vehicle and guide (ours was Ibrahim) thereby making it a first class adventure. The hotel we stayed at on our first night in Dad\u00e8s Gorges, Chez Pierre, is one of my favorite hotels of all time (and I have traveled a lot). The people of Morocco are beautiful, kind and welcoming. Having a local guide like Ibrahim makes the whole experience that much better, as he knows everyone and will happily tell you what is what, and who is who. He knows how to make you feel like you are the star of your vacation. Don\u2019t miss out on a night or two in the Sahara \u2013 it\u2019s something you will never forget. The best advice I can give you is to sit back, let go of all expectations and enjoy the adventure, oh and pack light. You will not be disappointed. Don\u2019t hesitate to talk to your guides about the Berber/Nomadic way of life\u2026it is something to behold\u2026and as we learned, in the West we might have watches, but the Berbers, they have all the time."

He would also take the initiative to stop for photos and help us with group photos. There was extremely heavy rain during our time there, causing floods and closing roads. In spite of this, Ibrahim was able to find alternative means to get us to our destination. The tour was also very well-planned despite our short stay. It was comprehensive enough to cover the city of Marrakech, a night in Sahara desert, having a taste of local cuisine, and seeing the various berber villages. Food and accommodation was always top notch and the stay in the desert was one of the best experiences i've had. This company is highly recommended as the price of the whole package was very reasonable and they are able to tailor the tour to whatever duration you have. Ibrahim is a great driver and guide and can speak several languages as well."

The experienced team of locals provide an itinerary beforehand but the tour is really up to you. Ibrahim made sure we saw all the sights but also provided helpful suggestions about places we might find interesting as well as locations for the best photos! The hotels and organised activities are second to none - don't miss out on the desert sahara tour or the todra gorge. Both are absolutely breathtaking. The highlight for us was meeting Ibrahim's family who live in the desert near Merzouga. We happened to be there for the end of Ramadan and got to meet the whole family and share a traditional Berber pizza with one of his twin brothers. From the moment we got in the car, Ibrahim made us feel like family, no question went unanswered and we ended up dancing in the car to Berber music more than once.

We traveled all over the country, round trip Casablanca, where we spent our first & last nights. Moha was very easy to work with, making it clear that the published itineraries on his website were very flexible and he would arrange anything we wanted; there was never a problem with making changes. Mohammed was also very flexible and when there was something exciting along the way that wasn't planned, we went there--like a Rose Festival in the Rose Valley, the closing Fantasia of an agricultural exposition, and going off-road to a salt mine, among others. We stayed in riads in the medinas and most were very authentic and, in some cases, really outstanding. Mohammed & Omar were very good companions. Mohammed's English was very good and he was very patient with us. We learned so much about Morocco and the Berber people and there wasn't anything we couldn't talk about with him. We had a lot of laughs as we traded sayings in various languages. I did not give the review a 5 because Moha wanted the first payment sent via Western Union and cash for the balance when we were there. We did manage a payment by WU but it was a pain to have to go to an ATM every day to amass the $ we owed. (Morocco's dirham can only be purchased in Morocco). However, if you want to have an in-depth experience, I can recommend Moha & crew."

Not only the variety of places that Moha chose to show us in a perfect balance of rural life, luxurious architecture, great food and real culture, but also his personal and unique stories about living in the desert and being nomads or farmers: he gave us Berber perspectives on many aspects of their history, society and culture. He is also great company, gives useful advice, and has secret qualities: he speaks fluently 8 languages and happens to be an excellent player of Berber castanets, which made the night bonfire in the desert even more attractive and fun.

We arrived late because our flight was delayed but Ibrahim took the initiative to reshuffle the itinerary so that we could maximize our experience in Morocco. Everything went really smoothly, and he made the long road journey very enjoyable by sharing everything about his people, the berbers. He introduced us to berber music, berber food, and explained about the history of the land. Excellent accommodations, especially the night out in the desert in the tents, a thoroughly memorable experience!"

But lo and behold, it was a trip really worth every penny -- everything would not be possible without Camino Bereber Tours!Touchdown in Casablanca, we were greeted by Idir (our driver) who is very passionate about his work. Instantly, we knew that the tour will not be a bore for us because of the personality of Idir, bubbly and full of excitement. We toured the cities of Casablanca, Marrakech, Essouira, Ifrane, Merzouga (dessert), Ourzazate, Fes, Meknes, Volubilis, and Rabat. All that in just 8 days of stay in Morocco. (Dont forget to get the Desert Camel tour when planning for your itinerary)It was a pleasant experience to have seen not just deserts -- but mountains, beaches, rivers/lakes, forests, and main cities. I couldn't have expected to tour almost all these places in just a short amount of time. Idir was very well versed with English and knows a lot of things on different places. He is a very knowledgeable guide and is always happy to assist you. Highly recommended tour and offers one of the most attractive rates too. Moha, who I initially contacted, was also very accommodating. He replies to mails very quickly and is able to assist us with our requests. He is also able to accommodate our suggestions for the tour for our own comfort. Never had a problem communicating with them. The riads which were also included in the package were very good -- if not one of the top riads that you can find in the cities. I could not think how we can tour and see this much in Morocco if not for our tour package. It was well worth every penny that we spent, thanks to Camino Bereber for making it truly a memory worth keeping!"

Moha showed us the amazing Imi-n-Ifri, a natural bridge in Marrakech. We then went on to the ouzoud waterfalls which were magical. Moha knows the area well and even arranged a camel ride on the way back to the riad. Moha noticed when we were getting tired and even carried my bag for me. He is a gentleman and made our holiday that much more enjoyable. Se'hha Moha - I hope your mum liked her olive oil! Adam & Sarah"

Overall the experience was fantastic. Our guide, Hassan, was very knowledgable and his english was excellent. We gained a deeper understanding of the country and especially the Berber culture. The 2 nights in the Sahara were unforgettable and we then spent a night in a hotel called Chez Pierre and had one of the best meals of our trip. The only downside to the trip was the amount of driving but this is of course out of the companies hands and we chose the particular route. Working in the travel industry, I would not hesitate to recommend this company to my clients and to friends and family as I believe they offer fantastic value and a great experience."

He replied very professionally to my emails, and also the western union deposit transfer was done without any problems. I travelled with my wife and 7yo son, and Moha really made Morocco an unforgettable experience! It's quite a big difference to the larger tour companies: Moha is a real berber, born in the desert, and he knows the country like no other. He knows the nice and authentic places to go, and knows many of the locals. Also, he was very flexible at moments we wanted to change the program a bit, he really did everything to make our stay perfect. My son still talks about Moha and Ibrahim, the driver: more than a tour guide, they really became friends. The tours are done in Moha's Land Cruiser, a perfect vehicle to explore Morocco, also beyond the paved roads. In Merzouga, his home town, he really made sure we had the best camel trek, because there is quite some quality difference between the offered tours. I am typically very critical to tour operators, but Moha stood out in any possible way. Moha, I wish you all the luck and keep up the good work!"

The 4x4 was great and had a wifi hotspot. We left and explored all the way to The Dad\u00e8s Gorges where we slept for one night in an Auberge/hotel. The next day we met our second and last guide Mustapha who brought us through Merzouga and the desert where we slept in a Berber camp. The next day we slept in the Nomad Palace which seems to be the only near \"hotel\" in the desert. For the last day we travelled to our final destination F\u00e8s.Overall this was a great experience, the guides are friendly and speak proper english/french/spanish/arabic (from what I've seen). Throughout the trip you visit several places where you can buy souvenirs however you are not harassed to do anything. Be prepared for a lot of traveling because it is far from main cities obviously but worth it in the comfortable 4x4. What's great about this trip is you can ask the driver to go where you want as it's a private tour. Mustapha was a very interesting guide we were with him for the most part he knows the place and was interesting to travel with. The one thing I would like to see improvement has nothing to do with the company it's about the Nomad palace which was partially in construction and offered minimal services.It was an excellent trip thanks to Morocco Desert Trips."

Due to some last minute travel glitches on my end we had to depart for the excursion a bit later than we had originally planned, and Said was super accommodating the entire time. Of course the excursion was absolutely amazing. It was so authentic compared to other proposals we received, and it ended up being one of the most beautiful parts of our trip. (Our quote was also extremely fair and reasonable compared to others for much lesser quality excursions.) My friends are still raving the experience, which is hard to even put into words. We rode camels and enjoyed traditionally-prepared tea at sunset in the middle of a stone desert with no one around for miles. It felt surreal. And they brought a few baby camels who were \"learning\" which obviously was one of the most adorable things imagineable! Don't hesitate to book with Said. He's a true professional (along with the other guides who accompanied us) who genuinely cared about making our experience amazing. He succeeded 100%!

We've had an unbelievably wonderful trip with my wife starting with the city tour in Marrakesh, 3 day desert trip to Merzouga, and returning back to Casablanca; and for the whole journey from the very moment our plane landed in Marrakesh and till the time it took off in Casablanca, we were accompanied by Said, from Morocco Desert Trip, who helped us to break the spell and to \"open the doors of this Castle\"; not to say that the majority of stigma we had as those people who previously experienced Africa only through the National Geographic Channel eventually disappeared.

He is educated, speaks excellent English and is very knowledgeable in just about every subject connected to Morocco, including painstakingly trying to explain the Western Sahara to me. On a lighter note we greatly enjoyed hearing about Moroccan wedding customs, Berber history, including their alphabet and even visiting (from afar) what will eventually be one of the largest solar power stations in the world. We also appreciated the beautiful roses he bought for us in the valley of the roses. Just one of the little personal touches that made this tour special. The drive over the Atlas Mountains was breathtaking, and our two excursions into the exotic Ait Benhaddou and Taourirt Kazbahs were very educational.

One of our favourite experiences came on the final day when, since we'd been talking about our interest in Moroccan cooking, Said arranged for us to have a home-cooked meal with a local family.

After that I think we exchanged a few dozen mails because of the the \"few\" questions I had. For every mail that I wrote I received a response very quickly. It did not take to long before I decided that Moroccan Desert Trips would be ideal for us. So here it goes:We booked the following tours with Said:Two day, one night desert tourHalf day Marrakech tourTransfer from Marrakech to CasablancaAs you can see we pretty much relied on Said almost our whole stay in Morocco and I have to say that it was the best thing we could do!First we started with the half day tour in Marrakech. In the morning a man named Kamal came to pick us up. I did not know then that Kamal was one of the best drivers we ever had on our tours. Simply put he was friendly, forthcoming, patient with a great English and a good sense of humor. He was also our personal Dj and put on some nice tunes for the road!! I want to add that he is also a professional driver and we were never afraid with him on the road.We have seen many things in half a day but the tour was not rushed at all. After having one day off we started the 2 day desert tour. Fortunately we had again Kamal as our driver. We already knew from the start that it will be great. In the meantime I was always in contact with Said through e-mail so if we had any questions he was also there for us.After a few hours into the tour we had a nice surprise of meeting Said as he was also driving another couple who booked the same tour. After that almost every time we had our break we got the chance to sit down and have a talk. Said is a great person, very friendly and helpful so it was a great pleasure to also meet him in person.Of course, the two day tour went great and we had absolutely nothing to complain about!We can say that having booked the two tours and the transfer with Said, we could not be happier about the professional service we received!All in one I have to say that I would encourage everybody traveling to Morocco who is searching for a trustworthy and professional company to contact Said. After the first mail you will most probably feel at ease and book a tour with him!! ;)Thank you Said and Kamal for the great and unforgettable Moroccan experience you gave us!!!!Regards,Ervin"

When we asked where we could find a supermarket to buy water and some beers we thought he would show us the place on the map - we could not have been more wrong. He drove us there, waited until we finished buying things and helped us carry them!Not to mention the fact that Kamal had to pick us up at 8:30 am for the desert trip but we arranged with him to start at 7:30am in order for us to get \"a breakfast with a view\"Now, for the fun part:2 days later after we met Kamal, he again picked us up and we started our journey to the desert. As promised he drove us to a place to have breakfast which was at least breath taking. You would expect to pay at least 50% more for food when you book a tour because of the deals that the guides have with restaurants right? Well WRONG! Amazing food, amazing coffee and breathtaking view at a decent price - even low compared to other places. During the whole trip Kamal answered our questions, told us facts about everything in Morocco, was our personal DJ and drove at his best because one of us was car sick. I'm not going to go on about the views and landscapes because it would be to much but I am going to say this: Kamal managed to keep us on track time wise whilst stopping at every beautiful thing so we can take some photos and learn something new. The desert itself was beautiful, the camp and people there very nice, the food and tea were awesome and the music was authentic. After our night there, Kamal gave us the bad news: because of the rain, a bridge in the Atlas mountains (our only way back) collapsed. That meant we had to go to Agadir first and then to Marrakech to literally go around the mountains. The way back was awesome. We saw new places, ate BBQ goat and beef and had the most amazing time!I can go on and on about this trip but I don't want to spoil it for you.To sum it up I will say this:1. It was easy to organise and very fun to take part of2. Kamal and Said are amazing people3. Our trip wouldn't have been the same without themIf you decide to visit Morocco I most definitely encourage you to contact Morocco Desert Trips for the perfect holiday!"

            "review": "Mostly good but with some problems. We booked the 3 day, 2 night trip to Merzouga from Marrakech by e-mail with Said. As others have mentioned the communication was clear and efficient. Kamal was our guide and was very helpful, knowledgeable and kind, especially given that I was unwell during most of the trip (travel sickness on the first day crossing the Atlas and upset stomach for the remainder of the trip). It was great to see such diverse, beautiful landscapes and get to know Morocco better. Also we enjoyed lots of the shops we stopped at (such as in the Valley of Roses where we bought rose cosmetics and in Merzouga where we bought scarves and spices). We were lucky to experience a snow storm on the return journey to Marrakech which completely transformed the landscapes and gave us a different view of the Tichka and the Atlas mountains.Unfortunately there were a few issues with some of the trip:-The restaurant we visited on the first day for lunch (L\u2019Oasis D\u2019Or in Ait Ben Haddou) was a total tourist trap-poor quality, overpriced food, very limited menu and terrible service. We were not given a choice about where to eat and I think that people doing the tour should be given the option to choose where to eat. The restaurant we had lunch at on the last day (Cafe Almanadir) was also distinctly average, at best. -Before visiting the desert we were brought to a shop to buy scarves for the desert to protect us from the sand. It's not a big deal but this was a separate expense that should maybe be mentioned when booking.-The desert was, overall, a disappointing experience. Firstly the guide who took us into the desert on the camels spent almost the entire 1 hour trip on his mobile phone. He completely ignored us and we got a very bad vibe from him overall. The camp itself was a disappointment also, mainly because there was no music provided (as described on the website- \"amazing Berber music show\"). When we mentioned this to Said he told us that we should have requested this ourselves in the camp- this was never mentioned to us by Kamal or Said at any point so it is an unacceptable excuse. We were really very disappointed about this. -The guide spoke to us only after the 1 hour trip back to the hotel the next day when he stopped us before getting there, made us get off the camels and proceeded to try to sell us some (vastly overpriced) soap dishes/other handicrafts. At the hotel where we had to shower in the morning after the desert unfortunately the showers available in the little outhouse were not working- one was completely broken and the other had only scalding hot water so we had to travel 650km back to Marrakech without showering.Despite the above there were also some highlights such as the Dar Panorama hotel in Skoura which was very calm, clean, friendly and welcoming. The food for dinner there was also very good. The restaurant where we had lunch in Erfoud (Cafe-Restaurant des Dunes) was great- surprisingly tasty food with reasonable prices. Overall we enjoyed the trip but would recommend that certain aspects be revised, especially the restaurants visited and the camp/guides used."

We started in Marrakesh and drove south, over the mountains, to meet our ride to the desert camp ground. Along the way, Said shared the history of each region and highlighted interesting spots along the way. The drive back on the second day was just as engaging- new sights to see and stories to share. This trip was so fun and well organized, we decided to book a second tour with Said, a day trip to Essaouira. The drive to the coast and back and comfortable, safe, and fast. Throughout both trips, it became clear how well connected Said was throughout the region. His influence helped make both trips even more meaningful. Thanks for an amazing introduction to Morocco!"

The Sahara trip is one of the most important reason for us decide to go to Morocco. I have been asked around 5 companies, with different reasons I was not satisfied, then I found Said through Trip Adviser. Because the reviews about him and this company was really good, so I sent Said an email, we started contact, Said was not just friendly with patient. But mostly importantly he gives very good suggestions also options which not in the point of view as businessman but friend. I have never been to Morocco so had lots of questions, I believe before we arrival Marrakesh, he have replied me at least ten emails with all my necessary and unnecessary questions.The day we arrival Marrakesh, Said came with us for a half day City Tour, he was very on time, and we did enjoy Marrakesh so much even the time was limited, but he really tried to let us have the most of it. Also he explained us the whole plan for the following day Sahara trip. The Sahara trip started really nice, because one of our friend normally have car sick, we thought with mountain way will be really difficult for her, but Said\u2019s driving skill was really good, so my friend was absolutely fine for the driving trip. Everything for Sahara trip was perfect, we reached on time for sunset, was beautiful , we have been treat really nice, and enjoy the night spent in Sahara. And we will definitely go back join a longer trip with Said. And will recommend said to anyone we know if they plan to go to Morocco!!!!!!!"

Said was our point of contact with the company and he was fantastic right from the start. He was quick to respond to my many emails and even gave advise on how to organise the tour to minimise my travel sickness! On the first day, Said met us at our Riad on time and took our luggage to his well-maintained 4x4. Although each day's travels were long, Said catered to our every need, be that rest stops, photography opportunities or simply answer our questions on the area. The tour was well managed in terms of time and every night we stayed in beautiful accommodation and served hearty traditional food. I have taken many tour in multiple countries. For us, what made this special was the personal touches. Said really listens to your interests. As we passed by his family home, we stopped in to have tea with his mother and see how rural Moroccans live. After I showed an interest in their farming, he arranged a friend of his to guide us around the fruit groves and small holdings. Best of all, after discovering I had arranged the night's stay in the dessert to fall on my birthday. He traveled through the dessert in the dark to surprise me with a birthday cake! That really was a fantastic night, celebrating in the tranquil dessert with friendly strangers, dancing to traditional music.For all of this, he expected no more than the originally agreed, very reasonable price. Said really does believe in delivering exceptional service.Throughout the trip we felt safe and achieved everything we had set out to do and more. I would definitely recommend this company, and Said, to fellow travelers."

We emailed MDT and they got back to us straight away with recommendations and options to suit. We chose to go to Zagora for a two day, one night trip with a camel trek to the edge of the desert and overnight stay in a Berber camp. From the outset the guide was extremely friendly and professional, advising us of exactly what to expect all the way. He was an excellent and safe driver, had a modern 4x4 (it was just the two of us and him on the trip), which I was relieved about as the drive over the Atlas Mountains is very windy. While the trip to Zagora and back is a long drive (8 hours each way), we didn't notice it so much as the guide had so much knowledge about the region and culture to share. He also stopped for photos and coffee, and lunch. We were very lucky to be taken to his house to meet his family on the way home. To see inside a local family's home was a real treat. We're very grateful. But most of all, the guide was very punctual as we needed to be at Zagora by a certain time to make the camel trek to the desert before sunset. The timing was perfect. He left us with a Berber guide who led us for just over an hour to a desert Berber camp. The sun was setting as we made the trek and it was magical. Other people doing a similar tour arrived to the camp late and had to make the trek when it was dark which wouldn't have been a great experience. At the camp we had a private tent, lots of blankets, our Berber hosts were very friendly (we weren't sure what to expect), they speak 3-4 languages. They cooked us a wonderful turkey tagine, we drunk tea (whiskey of the desert) and sat around the campfire beating drums. The sleep in the desert was strangely quiet except for the moaning of the camels! The camels are all beautiful, well looked after and the Berber people clearly have great respect for their animals. For sunrise we made the trek back out to meet our guide and stopped at various places on our way back. We got back to Marrakech about 7pm. It was a long day driving, but worth it. Because of all the knowledge of our guide, we felt much more able to understand Moroccan customs for the rest of our trip - tricks of the trade etc. Tips: tip the Berber guides at the camp, try to learn some Berber/Arabic, don't give money to the Berber children when your guide drops you off, get to Zagora before sunset, take warm clothes."

Said was very helpful and accommodating and helped to arrange the trip for us at the last minute via email.Said collected us from our Riad and we were driven in his 4x4 to Agafay. We then went on a camel ride across what are like sand dunes and the view is amazing! There is nothing for miles and it's so peaceful and serene. I was a bit worried that the camels would be tired (carrying us for a whole hour) and at one point mine starting to veer off in the wrong direction when he saw the hill he was going to have to climb! But the man who owns them and guided them across the sand dunes with us was kind to them and I think they are well cared for, so it put my mind at rest.We then arrived at a spot at the top of a 'sand dune', where Said and his colleague had set up an area for us to watch the sunset with Saffron Tea and Dates. It was beautiful!We relaxed for a while and then drove back. I had asked Said if we could see the stars and he did try and stop at a spot for us to view them, but unfortunately the moon was too bright at the time. We then asked if he could drive us past the New Town (newer part of Marrakesh) and he drove us there on the way back to our Riad so we could see the shops and Casino etc. Very helpful and accommodating!We are now considering going on a tour with Said to the Sahara in the future.The trip is a little expensive compared to some offers but it is worth it as the experience is private and a lot of effort is put in by Said to make sure you are comfortable and happy."

We spent the first night of the new year huddled around a fire staring at the most incredible expanse of stars we have ever seen in our city-dwelling lives -- an absolutely unforgettable moment. The Berbers we met were so friendly, funny, and charming -- as were the other tourists staying at the camp with us. We made genuine new friends for life. For all of this, we are incredibly grateful to Said. We booked an overnight tour of the Zagora with Said after our previous booking fell through -- and I couldn't be more pleased that we ended up with Said. Our tour with Said was cheaper and included more than the previous tour had. Said was extremely quick in responding to my inquiries.

We had a wonderful trip with Said and his crew, with two lovely camels through the Agafay \u2018desert\u2019 after which we enjoyed tea and dessert and watched the sun set. Although this place is not actually a desert, I really felt like one at this time of the year and made us more eager to one day explore Morocco\u2019s real desert, when we have more time. The communication with Said is so easy and clear and we experienced everything we expected during our afternoon / evening trip! Highly recommended!"

            "review": "Wonderful excursion, world class customer service!. From the very beginning when booking this tour, Said went out of his way to ensure we got the trip we wanted and the best value for our time. We wanted to do 2 day desert trip and our time in Morocco was limited, and Said was very honest about how far into the desert we would get within 2 days, leading us to decide perhaps a mountain day trip would work better for our schedule. His honesty and dedication to giving us the best tailor made experience for our time was very impressive and the reason I chose to tour with them. The day trip was seamlessly organised and tailored to us, Said arrived perfectly on time as promised, despite our riad being new and difficult to find. His knowledge of marrakech and Morocco is vast and his english incredible. e learnt so much from this philosophy graduate about his country that he is so passionate about, it was incredible to learn from him, one of the highlights of our tour. We drove to three different valleys in the Atlas mountains during the tour, visiting a berber house, argan oil producer (at my request), a small farmers market and the Ourika valley waterfall. We stopped off for photos whenever we liked, despite being grey and overcast with a forecast of rain and storms, the views were spectacular and the smell of pine and fresh apples will stay with me forever. Though sometimes I am nervous passenger in steep mountain roads, Said is an excellent driver and his car so comfortable and well maintained that I never felt anxious once. Even though it was a long drive with lots of ground to cover in one day, the stops were frequent enough that it never felt too much, and we had a great walk up the waterfall in the middle of the day, perfect to build an appetite for lunch. Said has gotten these tours down to a fine art and was always charming, patient and ready to answer any question we had. I would not hesitate to book another tour when I return ext time and look forward to learning more from this well educated, passionate tour guide. Many thanks again Said!"

He was extremely friendly, flexible, relaxed, informative and interested in our backgrounds and lives too. Nothing was too much trouble. The camel trek and subsequent Berber desert camp was amazing. We saw the moonrise and next morning our cameleer had arranged our breakfast table atop a small dune with camels parked in front to see the sunrise = the most magical breakfast ever. My girfriend said this has been the best day of her life ! Then we had a very special surprise on the drive back."

He met us at our hotel prior to starting the tour and talked about what we wanted to see/do and he adjusted his arrangements to suit us. A very enjoyable trip with Said and his brother Abdo - visited out of the way (we would have never found) restaurants, gained lots of local knowledge and found some fabulous dates (yummy) so many highlights on the trip to mention. A wonderful trip. Thank you Said"

Morocco Desert Tours is well-run and a great value. Based on tripadvisor reviews we booked a three day private desert tour from Morocco not really knowing what to expect. From the start Said was quick to respond and lay out our options. He met with us at our riad in Marrekech prior to our tour to go through the agenda, to answer any last minute questions and to collect payment for the tour. He has a number of drivers that he uses. Our tour guide was Larbi. Larbi is a nice, friendly, chill, professional man who speaks great English (as well as many other languages). He picked us up at our riad and drove us over the Atlas Mountains to Ait Ben Haddou and then on to Skoura - stopping at various places along the way for pictures and lunch and other interesting places and kasbahs. The valley on the southern side of the High Atlas is a magical desert dotted with beautiful oases. Skoura is the best thing ever. The next day we headed to Erg Chebbi, stopping at the Todra Gorge and other interesting sights along the way. In Erg Chebbi we road camels for an hour across the dunes of the Sahara and then camped under the stars in a comfortable tent with a mattress. On the final day we trekked back to town and then drove through a savannah landscape back to our riad in Marrekech. Larbi was a great guide. He was very flexible and happy to make any stops that we liked. All of our accommodations were arranged by the company, including breakfasts and dinner and were included in our fee. Fees for admission to points of interest and lunch during the day were additional (though not expensive) so bring some cash (Larbi pulled over for us to get some more cash from an ATM at one point). All in all I give MDT 5 stars and recommend then without any reservation. They are flexible and can customize the tours to fit your preferences/schedule. Thank you Said and Larbi!"

He was so personable, kind and definitely genuine in his interest not only in what we wanted to do but he took an interest in myself, my husband and our teenage daughter. Said was so responsive and flexible. I must admit we had been expecting he would be our actual tour guide for our three days and were a bit disappointed only because that had been our expectation, however, it turned out fine and we did get to have Said for a further 1/2 day tour of Marrakech after we returned that we booked on the spur of the moment. He went out of his way to make that happen for my daughter and I. Said's customer service is outstanding. The actual desert trek we did was three days; we were met right on time on the first day of the tour at our Riad by Larabi - he was very professional, quiet, but helpful whenever we needed it. He answered all our questions and was very good at making sure we knew what the plan was for each day, and where and when we would be stopping etc. The Riad they chose for us to stay at the night before we headed into the desert was lovely and very welcoming. Our guide, Omar, who took us on camels, into the Desert for the night was fantastic - he made that part of the trip really enjoyable. Riding camels was definitely an interesting experience as was sleeping in the desert - a definite must do once in one's lifetime. We highly recommend it! This is a really reliable company to work with and one you can trust thanks to Said's personality.We chose Morocco Desert Trips because of all the fantastic reviews we had read on Trip Advisor and it was definitely the right choice! You will not be disappointed once you connect with Said. Thank you Said from your new Canadian friends :-)"

            "review": "Excellent tours, guides and organisation from the outset - Desert Tour could have been better!. Said runs Morocco Desert Trips and he was fantastic from the outset! I had lots of email communication with Said and he offered us some great advice which helped us decide which tours to take in the time we had available. As well as airport transfers, which were fantastic, we did two tours with Morocco Desert Trips. The first trip was the 3 day 2 night tour to Merzouga (the Sahara). We really enjoyed the two day drive to the desert which included driving through the Atlas Mountains, Berber Villages and visiting the Ait Bed Hadou Kaspah amongst other sites. Our driver Mohamed was great and stopped for photo opportunities and was able to tell us lots about Berber life in the villages. The B&B we stayed in on the first night was a real treat, it was very traditional and the hosts were extremely welcoming - highly recommend it! I became quite ill with a dodgy stomach and after several emergency stops in less than an hour Mohamed was very good and brought me to a pharmacy, translated for me and seen to it that I remained hydrated. He insisted I ate only rice for my meals that day and this was just what i needed, I could not thank Mohamed enough for the amazing care he showed me. The camel ride to the desert was a real experience and a must; prepare yourself for a sore bum! The desert is something that everyone should see and experience. We saw the stars before it got too cloudy but unfortunately we could not watch the sunset as it was still cloudy in the morning; this did not stop us climbing a massive sand dune and running around in the dunes at 6.30am in the morning. The nomad camp we stayed in was a little disappointing as we were the only people at the camp and it was really lacking in atmosphere. The trip is sold with dinner, traditional music and dancing which was not what we got at our camp. We had dinner which was wonderful and then we were walked over to a neighbouring camp for 20 minutes for the music and dancing. This was nice but we did feel very left out as this camp was full to bursting everyone had gotten to know each other there so we felt very much like we were tagging on. This definitely had a negative impact on our desert trip and I would recommend you ask Said to book you into a bust camp if you are going. There is not much to do in the desert without the music and dancing! The final day travelling back to Marrakech is a long days driving (around 10 hours) but these are the sacrifices you have to make.Do also note that there are charges for tours/entry at all the stops along the way to the desert. This came as a shock to us as there was not prior mention of it. be careful not to overpay as some tour guides certainly took advantage of us.We also went on a one day trip to Essaouira with this company. Our driver Larbi was EXCELLENT! His English was fantastic and he taught us lots about the various places we passed on the way to the coast! Essaouira has a beautiful fishing port, beach and medina and is definitely worth a day trip. While there you must go to the fish market and have your fish grilled for you while you wait....I have never tasted fish with such flavour!!These tours are fantastic, they are really well organised and the drivers always come on time. Morocco Desert Trips is a professionally run company and goes over and above for it's clients. I highly recommend them."

We booked an all day tour to the Atlas Mountain as well as the Half-Day tour in Marrakech. In short, touring with this company was a wonderful experience! I communicated with Said via email prior to the trip (about 3 months in advance) to arrange the tour and iron out any details. Said was very responsive and helpful through email and described what we should expect, where we would visit, as well as any pricing for the tours. No monetary transactions were done online and everything was taken care of in person when meeting with our guide. Upon our arrival we communicated with Said and met with our great guide, Larbi! Larbi's English is great, my family and I felt very safe with his driving, and he was extremely attentive throughout the tours. When visiting the Atlas mountains it was clear that he knew the area well and was able to show us beautiful locations for photo opportunities! For lunch he took us atop a mountain with the help of a local guide onto the home of a Berber family who welcomed us with a delicious home-made meal, which we enjoyed with an amazing view. It was truly an unforgettable experience for the 5 of us!The next day, during our Marrakech day tour, Larbi met with us at our Riad once again to begin our private-vehicle (similar to Atlas mountains) tour of the city. It was another fun-filled day with Larbi as he showed us the Bahia and Badii Palaces, Medina wall, short tour of the new city, and Majorel Garden (breathtaking!). We also visited the Palmerie, and had the opportunity of dressing up in traditional clothing to have a half an hour camel ride around the Palmerie. Larbi clearly had great relationships with all the local guides who helped us, and we received excellent service wherever we visited. Both nights for dinner, Larbi made reservations to excellent, prestigious restaurants, where the food was absolutely fresh and delectable. We truly got a taste of the traditional Moroccan cuisine, thanks to this tour! Our 2nd day of the tour, we asked Larbi if he would recommend a restaurant where we'd experience a belly-dancing show, and not surprisingly, he did not disappoint! The tours with the help of Said and Larbi, was by far one of the best experiences we had during our 10 day trip around Morocco. Said and Larbi, thank you for making us feel welcome from the very beginning. We truly appreciate all your attentiveness, friendliness, and knowledge during our tours. It wouldn't have been the same without your help--you made this trip very worthwhile and if given the chance, we would definitely choose your company again! Forever grateful!! Cheers from New York!"

Larbi had very good English, was very interactive with our boys (and especially helpful when our youngest fell after lunch one day and had glass stuck in his arm), was responsive to all of our questions and seemed to enjoy his job.Probably the best part of the trip was the locations they picked for us to stay\u2026.some very out of the way, interesting places with excellent views and to a person the places they chose were staffed by happy, friendly people. They clearly have very strong relationships that they have built up over time with the local vendors. Some of the roads Larbi took to get us where we wanted to go would never be found by a tourist driving on his own (but absolutely safe). His local knowledge and rapport with everyone provided us with an \u201cin\u201d everywhere we went.Our time overnight in the desert is one our family will remember forever; this is a must do. These four days showed us more of Morocco than we could ever see on our own. The enjoyment, sights and value for money were excellent. I highly recommend them."

We stopped off on the journey for some of the party to climb this rather step hill where breathtaking views were to be had.. A couple of men came by on their donkeys, on the way to their very remote hamlet in the middle of the Agafay Desert. We then arrived at a flat plateau where carpets were laid out, a fire built and moroccan tea brewed, lovely morrocan nibbles and cakes were served while we watched the most magical sunset in the peaceful silent desert.

We later arrived at hotel that is right outside the Dunes where we would be camping for the night with local Berber residents. We rode camels to the campsite. We spent the night eating traditional Berber and listen to Berber music. We woke up early the next day to catch the sunrise and headed back to the hotel. Kamal was there to great us and got us on our way. We thought this was the end of the trip but Kamal took us to a local village to listen to Gnawa music.

His professionalism, his wealth of knowledge, his amazingly down-to-earth and friendly attitude and his willingness to make our tour as comfortable and enjoyable as possible all made for an unforgettable trip! Said was a gentleman in every way and even accommodated a last-minute request to change a minor portion of our tour. We went to the Agafay desert (definitely FUN times in his 4x4 up steep sand dunes!) where we also saw a movie being filmed, we had lunch at the stunningly beautiful Lake Lalla Takerkoust, drove through the lush and breathtaking scenery of the Atlas mountains and Plateau du Kik, drank tea at the home of a charming local Berber family, visited Argan oil cooperative, and Said was even kind enough to squeeze in a bit of the Medina for us to view because we would have left the following day without seeing it. And all this at a price of 40 euros per person was unbeatable! We definitely recommend Morocco Desert Trips to anyone wanting an EXCELLENT experience - whether short or long stay - in Morocco! Don't forget to ask for Said! :))"

We did a lot of planning last minute, and Said was very quick in responding to our request. We had a few responses about a two day tour, but decided to go with Morocco Desert Trips as they were humble and very accommodating. As we only had two days, Said informed us before our booking that two days from Marrakech, we would only get to experience the smaller dunes.Muhammad was a great tour guide - always willing to stop when we wanted to take photos - he drove a lot over the two days!the camel ride, and tent sleeping was an experience! Said and Muhammad were helpful along the whole way of our two day trip - they even helped us buy our train tickets and also took us to a local hammam at the end of the tour! we got to see the local side of marrakech and this was invaluable!"

We were offered an airport pickup and transportation to our Riad, which was great as we arrived late in the evening and Marrakech was a little overwhelming at first. From the very beginning our guide was very welcoming and informative as we drove towards the medina. Not to mention his great sense of humour automatically putting us at ease!Although there were weather issues that caused complications with our plans Said did his up most to tailor our tour in order to give us the best possible experience. Each and every place we stayed in was friendly, beautiful and provided amazing homemade Moroccan dishes. Our favourite Raid was in Skora, the food was amazing, the view was breath taking and the hospitality of the owners made us feel right at home. Another obvious highlight was the overnight stay in the desert. The sunset and sunrise camel trek was a unique and beautiful experience, as well as sandboarding under the stars! All in all our Moroccan experience was absolutely amazing and this wouldn't have been possible without the help our of guide. Always friendly, striving to better our trip and giving a great insight not only into the way people live, but also the history and politics of Morocco."

Fun, relaxing trip that gave us a chance to get outside Marrakech and see some of Morocco\u2019s beautiful countryside.Said was a great guide, communication before the trip was very good, he took time to answer all the questions we had (including questions about whether their would be vegetarian food available) and gave us a detailed itinerary of what the day would include.On the day itself, Said met us at our hotel and drove us out to Ourika valley, stopping off along the way to visit an Aegean Oil producer and to cross a rope bridge. He stopped the car for photos of the Atlas Mountains whenever we asked him to and we both enjoyed the drive, he gave us lots of information about Moroccan life and made sure we were happy throughout trip. Once we reached the valley we were introduced to the local Berber guide (the cost of which was included in the fee) and he took us hiking up a waterfall. On the way we were able to stop and look at all the beautiful things created by local artisans.After the hike we had a Moroccan lunch, which wasn't the best meal we had in Marrakech but was fine, it's worth asking Said beforehand if you have particular special dietary requirements. We were then being driven back to Marrakech with a short stop off at a traditional Berber house overlooking the valley. The day lasted 8 hours and was an truly unforgettable experience.A few tips if you're taking the tour, wear comfortable shoes with good grip for the walk up the waterfall and bring a big bottle of water as it can be difficult to pick some up along the way, all costs are included in the tour fee but we did feel a bit of pressure to spend money from the local merchants - if you want to avoid that then maybe mention it to him before you set off."

These were great added extras that I know we will remember for a long time.The highlight of our day was a trip up the waterfall. Whilst it was very cold, we enjoyed the walk very much. Remember to wear suitable shoes!! It was very steep in places. There were several souvenir shops along the way but there was no pressure to buy anything. Our guide took plenty of photos of us along the route. In total, it took around 1.5hrs to go up to the top and then back down. Afterwards, were were again greeted by Said and we had lunch in the traditional restaurant, which was included in the tour fee.Overall a great day and we will definitely book a desert tour if we return to Morocco!"

My wife and I were on our honeymoon in Marrakesh in April this year and were keen to get the balance of a chilled holiday following the excitement and stresses of a wedding. We opted for a day trip to the Atlas mountains as one of our excursions - and were extremely glad that we did! Our guide Said was absolutely superb. As well as being extremely knowledgable about the area and the people, he was exceptionally engaging and personable. He was also very much on his guests' side when it came to visiting tourist attractions - he has a policy that if he finds out a shop or attraction has charged his guests too much, he will not take guests there in the future. When a passing tradesman stopped on his moped to sell us fossils - Said spoke with him and told him that he 'does not bring tourists up to the mountains - only friends' and that he would only accept a fair price from him. Trained in philosophy, Said is a real gentleman and his top priority on an excursion (and it seems in life) is that his guests enjoy themselves and take away a positive experience of his beautiful country. I can categorically say that both my wife and I did - thanks to him. The day trip itself is ideal for those who are not staying in Marrakesh for too long (we were only 7 days). It was only a couple of hours drive to get up into the mountains. It is not a strenous day and you are in the vehicle taking in the sites for much of it (and they are stunning sites!) but there are plenty of opportunities to get out and the trip takes you through authentic, old settlements - with time to peruse around. The day culminates in a late lunch at a great cafe with stunning views over the river - followed by a small excursion up to a couple of waterfalls (about an hour and a half trek up and down). We found that it gave us a real flavour for the area and a desire to go back for more (hopefully in the future we will go back to do some proper trekking in the mountains). We booked Said in person - as he was driving us into Marrakesh from our hotel (the highly recommended Sirayane Boutique Hotel) as part of their free shuttle bus service - but you can book him directly through http://www.moroccodeserttrips.com/ One things for sure - when we do make it back, we will be in touch with him to go on one of his longer trips!!"

He even stopped off a few times on the way for us to look in some local side stalls. When we arrived an hour later firstly at the place where they make the famous argan oil we had a small tour around and had the opportunity to buy some oils and spices. We then carried on making our way up the mountains. We arrived and started our walk up the mountains with a separate tour guide. It was beautiful! I would say take some comfy shoes as the rocks are a bit big to climb and it's uphill but the views are beautiful. Once we got to the top there was an amazing waterfall, a good opportunity to take some pics. We made our way down and stopped to have lunch on a roof top terrace over looking the river and mountains. Then made our way to a local Berbers house to see how they live. Defiantly an eye opener. We then made our way to Marrakech while Said told us more about the local people and the beautiful country of Morocco. I would recommend this tour if your staying in Marrakech for a short while as it's not too long and defiantly a tour to remember. Don't forget to ask for Said! He was very professional and friendly."

Nothing was overlooked and questions asked to ensure our other guides were meeting this wonderful companies high level of service and attention to detail and to ensure the next tour would be as top notch. We never felt rushed, it was all about 'our' adventure. Could not fault Said and he is the first person I will be calling when I visit again (especially for the desert trip, which just sounds amazing!!!). Said, my friend, we thank you for a fantastic and memorable day in your amazing country. Good luck with your venture. You truly deserve to succeed."

I I am travelling with my wife, two children aged 5 and 9, elderly parents in law and my wife's siblings and their respective partners.We were collected from our hotel reception by a well dressed, punctual (can be a problem in Morocco) and extremely polite and well spoken man - Said. We travelled in comfort towards the Atlas Mountains and en-route stopped for a tour (booked by Said) of an oil, herbs and ointments production place where we were shown manufacture of cosmetic oils and were able to purchase spices, soaps and cosmetics and a fraction of the UK retail price.As we arrived at Atlas we were introduced to a local guide of Said who travelled with us to see a waterfall in the Ourika valley.At the end of our climb and descent, Said seated us in a restaurant arranged a very reasonably priced meal and even assisted with the ordering.Unfortunately, as we had young children everything was delayed on our part - but Said was an Oasis of calm, did not rush us, and instead built up a rapport with the kids who were delighted by the breadth of knowledge Said possesses and were addressing him as Uncle Said by the time we returned.I now have one point of confusion: whether I was impressed more by the breath taking waterfall or the immensely talented Said! Over the past decade my family and I have travelled through Europe, Turkey, UAE and Arabia. I have met plenty of tour guides but have never met anyone as warm, kind and professional as Said. This chap makes the excursion a memorable experience and allows tourists like me to have peace of mind as he takes all the headache, pressures and pit falls of being a foreign country on his shoulders. Anyone travelling to this part of Africa should contact Said as he is not only a gem of a host but a very respectful young man who gives peace of mind, value for money and is an asset not only to SPH Tours but Morocco itself.In terms of rating the Atlas Mountain excursion is 5* - Said is 6* if there is such a rating!Thank you Said."

First we stayed 4 days in the heart of Marrekech in the Medina in a wonderfull and peacefull Riad DixNeuf la Ksour. Afterwards we stayed 3 days in a resort Sirayana outside Marrakech. The very best day though was our daytrip to Imlil and Ouriga Valley with Said. Said is a very friendly, helpful, professional and trustworthy tour guide. He has a lot of knowledge of Morocco, the berber villages and the valleys. Furthermore Said is very patient and we could take our time to explore Ourika Valley and Setti Fatma village. We enjoyed the drive through the valleys from Imlil to Setti Fatma a lot. It seemed less touristy than Ourika Valley. We hope to go back to Morocco someday and we would not hesitate to book Said as our tour guide again."

It took us an hour and half to see all the waterfalls, Berber villages and views of atlas mountains. We came back down and had lunch. It was a lovely day out. Saeed was extremely helpful.

He is a warm, engaging person and we found him excellent company. Our trip covered three valleys and took us above the snow-line in this extraordinary landscape with a huge lake, rivers and cascades, castles and mud brick villages. We especially enjoyed the insights we were given into the lives of country folk and loved visiting the Saturday market for local people at Asti, and a traditional Berber house and mill in the Ourika Valley equipped, furnished and inhabited as it has been for generations. We were also introduced to Abdelmajid at the Arom Mantagne Herb Garden who gave us an entertaining and instructive tour showing how Argan oil was produced and the many cosmetic and medicinal uses of herbs and plants grown there. It was fascinating to learn just how ancient and resourceful Berber people are and to see how they adapt to modern life while retaining their distinctive culture and identity. They and Othman with his own Berber roots earned our respect and gratitude for their warm welcome, courteous hospitality and willingness to share whatever they could with us. We very much look forward to a return visit so that Othman can take us on a 4-day safari into the desert. He has given us a unique experience we shall always value and never forget."

Over the course of the tour, he impressed us with his knowledge, intelligence, humor and great warmth. During our 8 days in Morocco we interacted with 5 different tour guides, and Khalid was by far the best.Khalid picked us up at our riad and surprised us with a lovely small gift. During the tour, he showed us \"secrets of the medina\" that we truly could not have uncovered on our own, and filled every moment with facts and stories that helped us better understand the city. He never seemed to get tired of my endless questions, and was more than happy to discuss not just the history and monuments, but also the faith, politics and culture that make Marrakech a vibrant and fascinating place.And unlike many city guides, Khalid did not once attempt to introduce us to any shopkeepers or entice us to go shopping. He is running a cultural tour, not a guided shopping tour, and is clearly very principled in sticking to that, which made me very happy.It's very difficult to find independent guides like Khalid in Morocco. The tourist economy seems to be composed of a vast pool of guides who bounce around between an equally vast network of tour agencies, offering a ramshackle array of tours without ever developing expertise in one particular location. It's actually quite hard to rely on reviews because it's so rare that the guide you've read about in one review will be the guide you have when you sign up for a tour with an agency. Khalid's tours stand apart because he operates independently, he is from Marrakech, and he clearly knows and loves his city. The combination makes for an exceptional guided tour. You won't regret taking a tour with Khalid!"

Khalid is very knowledgeable and flexible, catering the walking tour to our interests as we explore the medina. Highly recommended to use a guide to explore the medina and especially Khalid."

The man is the one you are looking for. You will feel safe and taken- care of. Khalid is very patient, warm and kind. He has this special ability to make you feel secure and pampered at the same time. He will show you everything that you should see and when you want to change the schedule that is fine. Everything to please you. Khalid is the best what you can get in Marrakech. Don't think about anyone else!"

We had wandered around earlier in the day but were looking forward to learning more about the city we had already begun to fall in love with. Khalid was very knowledgeable and guided us through the souks detailing the nook and crannies of the streets that otherwise would have gone unnoticed. This really brought our experience to life. He is kind, polite and a pleasure to be around. That being said we had asked him if he had more availability later in the week and we met him again to be guided through the Bahia Palace. Again, another wonderful tour! He is also a very good photographer! He captured many of our favorite photos. I cant wait to go back and visit Marrakesh and Khalid next year!"

After reading Khalid's glowing reviews on Trip Advisor, we booked a half-day tour of the Medina, Souks and Marrakech's wonderful hidden treasures. Khalid knew so many of the locals, which made this tour even more eye opening. He took us in to see a local baker, who has mastered his trade over 60 years, and a friend who fills the furnace of a local Hammamm with sawdust. I would highly recommend taking this tour on your first day, as it gave us a great insight into the city and navigating the many walkways of the souks and old city. Having Khalid explain the dos and don'ts of the Medina was also a great help, as it can be a daunting place. I couldn't recommend this tour more.. It's a must! Thank you Khalid for a memorable day and teaching us so much about Marrakech."

Our family of 16 adults and a baby rented the Riad Nakhil for a week and the first day ten of us took the morning walking tour with Khalid organized by the excellent staff of the Riad.Both in English and French, Khalid led us through his city showing us the more hidden sides of the old city with knowledgable and passionate insights into the old and the present life of this fascinating place. Khalid was warmly greeted by the locals everywhere we went and we were able to see activities and places we would never have seen by just wandering around. I would rate this tour as the no. 1 activity in Marrakech and would happily return to see more with Khalid as guide. (not in the summer months though..too hot!!). Thank you Khalid and hope to return soon."

Now that the tour-guide services referenced in this review have a website, I can happily describe our experience with a walking-tour guide during a visit to Marrakech several years ago. Our stay in that ancient city was greatly enhanced thanks to one Khalid Amor, a National Official Tour Guide (\u201cAccompagnateur National de Tourisme\u201d) who was lined up for us at our hotel, Riad Utopia Spa and Suites. Mr. Amor accompanied my wife and me on a several-hour walk through the nooks and crannies of the old walled city (or medina) and was a fountain of information and insight along the way. We saw close-up more of the old city than we possibly could have on our own. He graciously answered our many questions, including any we had about cultural issues that concerned us. In short, he helped us feel comfortable in this totally unfamiliar cultural and religious environment. In the end, we were just visitors exploring this UNESCO World Heritage Site happily finding that common courtesy along with the kind of respect a guest shows while visiting someone\u2019s home goes a long way towards helping you \u201cfit in.\u201d Mr. Amor never made us feel rushed either. On a more practical level, he quickly alerted us to the fact that bicyclists and motorcyclists frequently shoot though the narrow alleyways where all the foot traffic goes as well, so keep your eyes peeled and be ready to step aside in a flash! Our guide escorted us through a vast labyrinthine, semi-covered, small-market district apparently grouped by trade, such as meat-processing and leather-working (closely linked!), metal-working, wood-working, textiles, and produce. He familiarized us with some of the buildings associated with daily Islamic religious practices and rituals. We were fortunate to visit the Ben Youssef Madrasa, a former Islamic religious college, now a museum. There we saw the intricate beauty of Islamic art found in all the tile-work and wood tracery. We saw examples of cells where students would have resided and the more spacious rooms where visiting scholars would have lodged. Mr. Amor took us to a communal bakery and explained (and we actually saw) how folks come in throughout the day to leave their unbaked bread with the baker who baked the loaves in his ancient brick oven and had them ready for pick-up in a few hours time. The smell of finished loaves was divine! We stopped in a few \u201chigher-end\u201d shops, such as a carpet dealer, an herbal pharmacy, and an artisan lamp shop\u2014intricately worked metal lamps are a specialty in Morocco. We were tourists after all. As the afternoon merged into early evening, our guide got us back to our hotel after having spent a very long time with just the two of us. We were most grateful to him for his generous, patient, and kind spirit. His English, by the way, was excellent. He showed us and taught us more about his city than we could have possibly managed on our own. He helped bridge the gap for us and made us feel more at home than we otherwise would have. Thank you, Khalid Amor, and thanks to Riad Utopia for setting us up with him."

For the past 13 years our family has been taking summer vacations around the World and in planning this trips I was use TripAdvisor to find great guides, tours, things to do and everything else. This summer (2016) one of the countries we visited was Morocco and particularly Marrakech. I found Khalid like so many others because of all the great reviews. Khalid was very responsive in replying to my emails and I quickly realized he was the real deal. Khalid picked us up from the airport and was there right when we arrived. He's such a happy and loving guy I immediately thought how lucky I am to have him as our guide for 2 days. As it turned out the airline lost our luggage and Khalid helped us to get it by taking me back to the airport late at night 9 hours after we had arrived. Like so many others have written here in reviews Khalid is indeed passionate about his job and taught us so much about the history and traditions of Marrakech. He's like having your favorite college professor showing you around with a depth of knowledge only a professor would have. Our kids really loved Khalid and enjoyed learning from him. And, like many others who've written reviews Khalid recommend great places to eat, people watch and shop and also what to look out for. I've used guides in cities all over the World and Khalid is one of the best and I highly recommend him. Seriously, he's like having a good friend show you around. Thanks Khalid!"

            "review": "Best Tour of Marrakech Indeed!. Having read the many reviews on TripAdvisor whilst looking for a local tour guide to show us the local sights of Marrakech, we contacted Khalid. Luckily, despite the fact it was only a week before we arrived, he had some dates still available and promptly replied with a wealth of information, whereupon we quickly booked him up for a half day walking tour of the city. As scheduled, he met us at our Riad - along with a kind gift of some marmalade and Argon oil.As we\u2019d already explored a few of the more well-known sights on our own the day before, Khalid was happy to tailor the itinerary - taking us for an engrossing trip through the winding Marrakech streets to markets and souks, showing us leather, shoe and iron craftsmen at work, along with the local baker and hammam furnace man - many of which we\u2019d never have discovered on our own - as well as to more well known sights such as El Bahia Palace and El Fna square. He gave great insight into all the places we saw, whilst allowing us plenty of time for photos - regaling us with interesting historical facts as well as tips on places we might enjoy during the rest of our trip.All the locals seem to know him and greet him with a smile, and i\u2019m sure his company gained us entry to places we wouldn\u2019t normally have seen. The only thing to perhaps consider when booking is going for the morning or all day tour. We booked an afternoon tour, and as it was also Ramadan a few of the more well known sights were closing shortly after, or in the case of Ben Youssef Madrasa, as we arrived - though Khalid actually managed to get us inside for a look around even after the doors had been closed to everyone else! We\u2019d highly recommend his services to others, and hanks again for your company Khalid!"

Luckily for us, the company we had originally booked our transfers and excursions with had let us down and we then found Khalid with less than 2 weeks until we flew. We had been reading up on Marrakech and it all sounded very intimidating, so decided to book a guide for a full day - one of the best decisions we made. Khalid met us at our hotel on our first morning at 10.00, kindly bringing gifts with him. He is a lovely guy, his enthusiasm for his religion and country are contagious. We learnt so much from him and saw parts of Marrakech that we would not had seen had we been alone. Amongst places visited was Medrassa Ben Youssef, Koutoubia Mosque, Bahia Palace, Jemaa El Fna Square and of course the souks.My husband loves his photography so the places Khalid took us were perfect (I have no interest in shopping!). The Bahia Palace looks nothing from outside....then when you walk in \u2013 wow! Khalid was so patient whilst my husband took photographs. It was fascinating to get a true insight into Marrakech and the lives of the locals. The visit to the baker was so interesting, and what a lovely happy man he is, happily posing for a photograph.When we were hungry Khalid took us to a restaurant where we had our first Moroccan meal. My husband has the lamb with prunes and I had a couscous dish which we both thoroughly enjoyed....then it was back to the tour. We walked so many steps that day (my \u201cfit bit\u201d was certainly on overtime, with over 20,000 steps!). Khalid was extremely thoughtful \u2013 checking that we had enough water in the 40 degree heat, whilst he was unable to drink due to it being Ramadan \u2013 don\u2019t know how these guys do it.We told Khalid that we now had the confidence to come back into Marrakech unaccompanied so at the end of the tour he wrote down recommended restaurants, which food stalls were good in the square (they each have a number), which restaurants had good terraces so you could \u201cpeople watch\u201d without being hassled and recommended books on Morocco.Am so happy we found this lovely man when searching for a guide \u2013 don\u2019t hesitate in booking him for your tour, you will not regret it."

We loved walking around the souks with him and highly recommend him. I've already given his number to a few of our Intrepid travel companions who want a less commercial tour.

Khalid was informative, interesting and spoke excellent English, he was polite and courteous and me and my husband felt very comfortable with him from the very start of our tour. He seemed to know everyone in the souks, we seen and appreciated the work of a lot of humble artisans going about their every work,and Khalid can put you on the right track for purchasing an item the Moroccan way, we also appreciated greatly the lovely thought of being left at our riad some marmalade and olive oil from Khalid.

My girlfriend and I booked a half-day medina tour with Khalid, and from my initial outreach to his dropping us off at a restaurant for lunch, he was great to work with.He was waiting for us in the lobby of our riad for our 10a pick-up and first took us to the Koutoubia mosque where he patiently answered our many questions about Islam. From there, we walked through the medina where he introduced us to a fascinating group of characters -- the community baker, the guy who heats the public hammam and cooks tajina on the side. In addition to his warm personality and deep knowledge of all things Marrakech, he was constantly on the lookout to protect us from speeding motorbikes and lumbering donkeys.My girlfriend was wanting a bag and some baboushes -- Khalid took us to two souks with high-quality products, and helped us negotiate favorable prices.We had an excellent time discovering Marrakech's hidden treasures with Khalid and fully recommend him."

Me and my friend just returned from Marrakech where we went on two tours with Khalid, the full day Marrakech tour as well as the High Atlas Mountain tour. Khalid picked us up at our riad for both trips which was highly appreciated! During our trip around the city, Khalid seemed to know everyone and allowed us to experience parts of the local culture we would have never been able to see on our own. He was extremely knowledgeable and gave wonderful insight into all we were seeing. The trip to the Atlas Mountains was incredibly well organized and enjoyable as well! Khalid made sure we had plenty to eat drink along the way. We had several stops including a traditional Berber house for tea which were all wonderful. What really stood out however was Khalid's kindness. Khalid brought us homemade olive oil and jam, and even came back the day after our to drop off diffusers and cookbooks for our tajines. He also gave us restaurant and other activity recommendations. We had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend Khalid to anyone!"

These guys are real professionals; we were happily surprised by the quality of the service, reliable and comfortable vehicle that took us up there, and meticulous organization around it. Most of all, a special thank you to our guide Khalid, his impressive knowledge of the area and culture, his incredible energy, warmth, and patience (stopped off each time for great photo spots- well\u2026 you know how girls are :), and his very helpful tips and tricks by email before even arriving.

Answered all emails quickly, met us on time and showed us a side to the city only a competent guide could. He has the trust of some of the 'real' people, so we could see bakers, fire stokers (for the Hammam) and market traders with no hassle. The tour was of interest to us, and our 15 and 17 year old daughters, who enjoyed feeding the kittens! We were able to ask questions about all bits of life in Marrakech, and we were given valuable tips on how to get the best out of our stay.

We cannot thank Khalid enough for making our trip memorable and one of the best we've ever taken. Travel is our passion. We've had a lot of great private tours and guides all over the world, but Khalid is in a class of his own. His knowledge and love of his country and culture shines through. Khalid has a Ph.D. in French literature, and has a wealth of cultural information that he is happy to share with his guests. If you hire Khalid, you will get to experience a genuine and soul-touching reality of Morocco. Not the touristy, overpriced shops but the souks and the neighborhoods where everyone knows Khalid, with sites and sounds of the people going to the market to buy freshly-baked bread or rushing to the mosque led by the calls the prayer that permeate the air. After a very thorough one day tour of Marrakech, we did a few day trips: the Atlas Mountains, Ourzazate, Essaouira, and a private transfer to Casablanca. The schedule was packed with sites to see, people to meet and amazing food to enjoy. The cars used are new and luxurious (Toyota Landcruiser and Mercedes minivans) and our drivers were outstanding - professional and very safety oriented. Despite the winding roads in the Atlas Mountains, we always felt safe. Khalid is a passionate guide, and a great guy. His hospitality was remarkable, and we felt like we were touring the country with an old friend, not a person we just met. He went out of his way to indulge all our whims, from taking way too many pictures of us to finding specific Moroccan cookbooks that my wife was interested in. Not a day went by without him bringing us some thoughtful gift, from fresh pastries, dates, figs, olives and orange jam to small souvenirs.  We'll never forget this trip and can\u2019t wait to go back. Thank you, Khalid, for making us fall in love with Morocco and its people."

Khalid is highly educated and a real fountain of interesting facts (this made us realise how big are our gaps of knowledge of North African colourful history). We will do some reading on Morocco next, he gave us book recommendations as well. Khalid also showed genuine interest in our questions and recommended eating places frequented by locals, and also a posher place for our Christmas dinner (Dar Moha).

He showcased his city articulately with an artful mix of information, engaging personality and humour, showing respect for us and his fellow countrymen alike. During the course of the day, he was greeted warmly by the locals as we made our way through the labyrinthine passages of the inner Medina, observing everyday life as demonstrated in the open workshops, bakeries and markets. In these backstreet quarters, we felt comfortable with Khalid and didn't have to worry about trespassing in the confined areas and nor were we taken on unwanted shop visits. We were made to feel welcome, secure and looked after from start to finish and then some .... Following our requests for more general information, Khalid emailed me at our hotel with all manner of information, not to mention a final gift of home grown olive oil and marmalade delivered to our hotel. Our regret is that we ran out of time to visit the Atlas mountains with him but it is top of the list for our next visit. Our host was a gentleman and fine ambassador for Marrakech, We loved our day with him and take back some fabulous memories. Thank you Khalid!"

Our day was filled with a very informative guide to the history of Marrakech and its main attractions, but also, lunch with the locals, (an amazing experience), visits to many hidden gems within the Souks and the opportunity to really get a feel for this wonderful city. I cannot recommend Khalid highly enough. He is a fountain of information, truly professional but also a very kind and understanding person too. We had a fabulous day. Do not hesitate to book with Khalid, you will not be disappointed."

HE brought us to see things that were off the beaten path. The day was amazing and he truly loves showing off his city.

And it went better all the way.Appointments were made quickly and Kahlid confirmed everything by mail.He is very flexible and we changed the meeting point to my specific situation.On the very busy Djeema el Fna square we found eachother quick though we never met before.Khalid let us thru the souks and Medina and showed us places you would never find by yourself. He knows a lot about history and could answer any question.His English is very well and above all; Khalid is an overall nice person in hart and mind.So, if you want an interesting tour without being brought to a \"cousin\" with a shop or any other commercial benefits.. Book your tour with Khalid.He made our visit in Marrakech unforgettable."

We did a 1/2 day tour of the hidden sides of the souks and Marrakech. Khalid met us at our riad, spoke very good English, and was very professional and knowledgeable. He took us to places that we would never have found on our own and helped us gain a good lay-of-the-land to use as a foundation for our time in Marrakech. Along the way he would point out restaurants we should try and other places we might want to visit (he even wrote them out in a list for us at the end of the tour). During the tour we visited the Palais de Bahia, Koutoubia Mosque, Complexe Ben Youssef, and Complexe Moussine (baths). We walked around streets off the beaten path and visited souks. The best part of the tour was seeing the \"back\" side of the souks where the artisans were actually making shoes from leather in front of your eyes and hand-punching holes into lanterns in intricate patterns. It was truly amazing to see the craftsmanship firsthand. Khalid knew all the shop owners, so we didn't feel like intruders walking through their turf. Keep in mind, the temperature was 104 F (40 C) and this was a walking tour. Our visit was smack-dab in the middle of Ramadan meaning that Khalid could not eat or drink from sun up to sun down. Yet, despite any discomfort he may have been feeling, he didn't let it show to us and remained 100% professional and friendly the entire tour. We had a great time and were glad that we picked Khalid and Best Tours for our tour around Marrakech."

Khalid made me feel at ease about the city and provided wonderful suggestions for restaurants, cafes and shopping. He even gifted me a bottle of olive oil pressed from his olive grove!

When you first enter the Medina the sights, sounds, smells, and people can be overwhelming. Starting off our time here with a guided tour gave us the confidence we needed to keep exploring on our own.Khalid was great, he was super knowledgable and answered every question we had. He gave us a great introduction to the country, the city, the history, culture, and religion. He took us around the Medina, visiting a palace, the Mosque, the craft area, and finally the Souks. We really felt like we got an insider's view of the city, as he took us to see how they heat the Hamams, back into some of the communal artisan areas, and to see some of the craftsmen at work (metal & leather). At every stop he had a great story and a ton of knowledge to give us on the history or significance of the place. It was Ramadan so we had extra questions about Islam and he was eager and happy to share. We were interested in seeing the evening prayers and he suggested dinner at a restaurant overlooking the Mosque. It was probably one of the more movings things I have seen and his suggestion for the restaurant, and what time to go, was absolutely perfect. He gave us a few other tips too and every one of them helped to make our visit exceed our expectations. Finally, he really helped us understand how to best to navigate through Marrakech. How to deal with aggressive salesmen and self-appointed 'guides' that you will encounter on your stay, the Snake charmers and pictures with monkeys. I would recommend him for anyone who is coming to visit!"

It was absolutely excellent, enriching, and gives a perspective on the souk and the history of the city beyond what meets the eye.First, Khalid is extremely knowledgeable, not only about the city but history as a whole providing perspective to how Marrakech became such an important trade center. Second, he takes you via little alleys, the public bakery, the public hammam, the blacksmith area, showing you the people behind the crafts. Its a complete different perspective. Third, and something so important, he did not take us to stores --on the contrary-- he ensured that people in the souk respected our space as we learned about Marrakech. However, if you felt intrigued about some craft or product, he ll definitely accommodate some of these small detours. For instance, I wanted to try the almond seed from which argan oil is made. We went to one of the herbal stores where they very kindly let us try it (no need to bargain, no need to feel obligated to give money). Since we were so intrigued about the olives and oranges in the area, he left the next day in the hotel a gift with an olive oil from his grove and an orange marmalade. I recommend 100% taking a tour with Khalid."

It could not have turned out any better. Khalid is a very genuine, humble, knowledgeable and humorous person. We obtained a wonderful insight into the city. As well as taking us to some sites of historical and religious significance the unexpected pleasure was the introduction to craftsmen working in wood and metal with the friendliness that all these people conveyed to us. Khalid is really a catalyst who makes you feel part of the real culture of the city rather than a confused tourist wandering around aimlessly! We even visited the man who stokes the furnace of the hammam next door and at the same time cooks the Tanjia for anyone who pays a small fee to collect later in the day. A fascinating insight into the everyday life of the ordinary Marrakshi. Khalid spoke excellent English, was extremely knowledgeable about the history of his city and of Islamic art, but most of all a genuinely friendly man who you would look forward to meeting again. My wife slipped on water in the Medina and sprained her wrist so the tour was immediately adjusted to take in an apothecary [traditional pharmacy] where she was given a massage with soothing essential oils! What a memorable day it turned out to be. Please do not hesitate to book Khalid, you will not regret it."

What really impressed us was his ability to read his clients and their likes and dislikes and arranging to whole day around them and their needs and wishes. To cap this he really could not do enough. He went as far as booking us our transport (large and comfortable Mercedes) to and from the Atlas Mountains (I hasten to add at a fraction of cost of what hotels were charging).

Khalid is so very knowledgeable and tailored the tour to whatever I wanted.This is augmented by his sense of observation to whatever is happening in the moment... pointing out the two young men transporting a full grown sheep on a gas bike for Eid or the woman conducting a devination on a side street. The stories, the food, the sights, the advice on how to benefit to the fullest with the time I had made my stay as a lone traveler a rich experience.When friends came last summer, and the group broke into two at the last minute, Khalid managed to juggle it all with grace. I will surely recommend him whenever friends make the trek to Marrakesh."

To be honest, I wasn't expecting it to be that great. Normally I would expect basic run of the mill activities that involved sitting on a tour bus but thank goodness this trip was different. For this have Khalid and his team to thank. We rode camels up to the Atlas Mountains, went to a Morroccan cookery school, ate amazing traditional dinners and had Khalid take us around the souks where he knew everyone and always helped us get amazing deals. Even when I got back to London, Khalid helped me buy more gifts from the souks for my wife's birthday and sent them to London. Fun, trustworthy and wants to make his customers happy!"

We decided on the first day that we needed a tour guide, and managed to find the best possible tour guide we could have hoped for in Khalid. We only intended to engage him to show us around the souks and Medina, but he did more than this. he also engaged US in the local culture, cuisine and history. He is an exceptionally learned, respectful, patient and good man. We had such a great time with him, that we engaged him for a whole DAY tour of the Atlas mountains. The day of the tour was also my 47th birthday. We met such lovely people, experienced regional markets and cooperative producers, and ate food from heaven. When I return to Marrakesh, I will be seeking Khalid's help once again. When you discover someone this good, stay with them."

He showed us the hidden and fascinating Marrakesh and his explanations transmitted his love for this city and country in such a beautiful way that we immediately felt in love with Marrakesch. It was a perfect combination of cultural and lifestyle sightseeing. He gave us the chance to feel like a local, like an old friend. Considering that we were two ladies alone in this country, we felt abolutely secure. His english was perfect which ist not self-evident in Morocco.I just can tell you: do not miss to see Marrakesh with his eyes! Be sure that we will come back!"

It involved a half day tour around the Medina with the sights, sounds and history at the courtesy of Khalid our guide.We met local artisans, tradesmen and weaved our way around the narrow streets and souks. We had a fascinating insight into daily living in Marrakech which gave us a true appreciation into the culture and the people. We felt relaxed and at ease with Khalid and his knowledge and ability to answer our questions with no hesitation. Marrakech is a beautiful city full of life, charm and energy.

Short informations to us: consultant 34 and online editor 30 (both live in HH), business traveling a lot (most time in germany), only 4 resp. 5 stars hotels;.I decided in June to propose to my girlfriend in Marrakech. Therefore I started to search the internet / forums for a guide who offer a trip to the desert. I had contact with a lot of guides and I decided to made the trip with Adil (reasons: friendly, good english, made suggestions, reacts quickly). We booked the 3-day-private-tour with Adil from Marrakech to the Sahara and it was the best we ever made. Despite the warning of our government (e.g. kidnapping) we never felt uncomfortable / unwell anywhere. (Before we started the trip we met him three days before, because my gilrdfriend felt a little bit unsafe and thereafter everything was fine : - ) )Adil organized the tour perfectly, taking care of small special request, and is an absolutely safe driver and speaks perfect English. Please note that the trip to the desert take more than 6 hours, so if you read something about a trip to the desert/sahare less than 6 hours - it\u00b4s not true! Our higlight of the trip was the night in a Berber tent and the delicious dinner in the open air with a single table on a dune (perfect time for the propose : - ) ). Necessarily spend the time in the berber tent even if you can choose the option of a standard hotel but don\u00b4t expect too much luxury. Everything is clean and simple... People there are always orderly, honestly and friendly. Adil is very careful with whom he collaborates. Last but not least, the sunset in the desert, the stars as well as the incredible silence - it was just wonderful.We would recommend this tour to 100 percent especially because of the nature and sympthatic person Adil and his willingness to help poor childrens (he lways carried eg. crayons as well as warm clothings for childrens with him) and his professionalism.@ Adil: Thank you for your friendship and that you showed us your country. Hopefully we\u00b4ll meet again. in sch\u0101'a ll\u0101h : - )"

We booked a half day tour with Khalid and were not disappointed. Khalid is a true Marrakechi - warm, good-hearted and knowledgeable. He came to pick us up from our hotel and gave us the freedom to choose whether we wanted a walking tour or go around by taxi. We chose a walking tour, with a mixture of historical sites (like the Medressa Ben Youssef) and wandering the souks and Djemaa el Fna. Best of all was the unique insight Khalid gave us into how the traditional communities of the Medina work with trips to local bakers, craftsmen and workers to see the \"hidden side\" of the Medina. Of course, in half a day it's not possible to see a place as vibrant and diverse as Marrakech so we will definitely be returning, and will definitely ask Khalid to show us around again."

We felt that we had only skimmed the surface on our first visit and were keen to get to know more about Marrakesh with a guided tour. What a brilliant choice it was to firstly choose Khalid to guide us around Marrakech, but also to actually book a guided tour. Every aspect of this tour was enthralling and really fantastic: we learnt so much and saw aspects of the city that had totally passed us by on our first visit! As our tour guide, Khalid was very charming, patient and so kind, really taking time to find out what we were interested in for maximum enjoyment. By the end of our half day with him he felt like an old friend. His English is perfect. He was very informative about all aspects of Marrakech - it's history, it's culture, spirit and, more importantly for us on our tour - it's cuisine! We particularly enjoyed visiting the local hamman fire, seeing where the tanginas were cooked in the fire, and also seeing the local bakery and visiting food stalls. Khalid was so helpful with tips about where to eat in the street markets and what foods to try - it gave us more confidence to explore in the days ahead too. We are keen to try other tours when we return to Marrakesh and Khalid is definitely our man! He comes highly recommended and this city tour was nothing short of 'excellent'. Booking a guided tour when you first arrive in Marrakesh will not only help you get your bearings but help you make the most of this magical city. Thank you Khalid and we hope to see you again very soon."

Jamal was excellent with any questions and info regarding an enfant car seat for our son, everything fine.Humza was waiting at the airport for us and helped escort us and our luggage to the car, nice, clean, air-conditioned. He spoke excellent English and French and was very kind and chatty. I have already recommended them to my aunt for her holiday In August (and again, after price comparisons, they also work out cheaper for day tours too, looks like we've found a gem ;-) ) and I will certainly contact them again in the future. Thank you Jamal and Humza for making our transfer go smoothly and your more than honest prices."

After being let down by another company to pick us up from the airport, I looked on Trip Advisor and chose to use Easy Take Transport because of the good reviews and we were not disappointed at all and in fact whilst on holiday I recommended the company to other guests staying at the hotel who were going to try their luck and haggle with local taxes but instead they got a good deal used Easy Take Transport. When we arrived at the airport Jamal was waiting with the card with our name so he was easy to find. He took us straight to the mini bus where we had arranged two baby seats which we had requested. On our return Jamal was waiting outside the hotel as arranged the night before. When we were dropped off at the airport my life accidently left her bag and we were already inside the airport. I rushed back out to see if I could find Jamal and luckily Jamal had noticed the bag left in the car and returned back to where he dropped us. He was very prompt with answering to emails even late in the evening and I would highly recommend using his service."

After that, it was nothing but an easy and pleasant experience. I had decided to get picked up in Casablanca instead of taking the connecting flight. The driver, Hakim was waiting for me with a sign that was clearly visible. Taking the 2 1/2 hour drive was a way better move than sitting in the airport. The drive to Marrakech was wonderful as i got to see more of the country,  I used Easy Take Transport everyday of my trip. I had the most friendly and knowledgeable driver. His name was Samir and I highly recommend you request him. He was with me from 9am -2am. Always made sure I was taken care of everywhere we went. He knew all the great spots to see and the ones that were too touristy and not worth it. I never felt unsafe or concerned about anything while traveling with East Take. The owner emailed or called through out my trip to make sure i was ok and if I needed anything. They really know wheat they are doing and I wouldn't travel any other way in Morocco.  I look forward to returning and using the service again. Thank you Samir, Hakim and Jamal. You guys rock!!! Spencer"

Riads are all in the medina and so you can't take a vehicle in later in the day. The driver had arranged for a man with a cart to take our luggage to the Riad. That was quite an experience as the area was full of people, donkey carts and motorcycles. The man with the cart got us right to the door through the crowds, twists and turns safe and sound (tip him well). For our return to the airport, I emailed Easy Take the day before and made arrangements for an early morning pick up. In this case because there are very few people on the narrow streets, they can come right to the Riad. They arrived on time and were responsive to some last minute changes. I highly recommend Easy Take."

Guide of Epic Zagora Ali showed us the real Marrakech explaining local traditions and showing us parts of Marrakech we would never have found on our own. We also went to the palace and souks as well as visiting a local baker that baked other people's dough. His English is excellent and he patiently explained everything and answered all our questions. Our trip to the Atlas Mountains was superb. Khalid arranged for a very comfortable 4x4 with a experienced driver enabling us to go off road. Ali pointed out places of interest on the way and the driver stopped in order for us to take photos of the locations and fantastic views. We had refreshments with a local Berber family who were most hospitable in showing us their home, plus stopping at other places on route to the Atlas Mountains Idir is an excellent guide who goes the extra mile. We were not rushed at any time enabling us to go at our own pace. When we come to Marrakech again we will have no hesitation in booking Idir for our tours."

I really don't know if they make us some special price (maybe off season?) but we traveled on our own van for same price other companies ask for 4 places in 16-passenger buses. Hakim is very kind guy and if You need someone speaking also Italian he will be your choice. Thanks a lot Hakim!"

We researched things to do and see, and decided on a day trip. It was difficult to choose a tour company as so many reviews were excellent on trip adviser, but having contacted a few I was very pleased to receive an immediate reply from Easy Take Transport who offered a choice of day trips. Reading that a couple of the trips were quite a distance, over 3 hours driving in each direction we opted for a shorter visit to the Ourika Valley. Our driver/guide arrived at our hotel a little before the arranged time. The car was large, clean and comfortable and while our driver didn't speak brilliant english we enjoyed the challenge of using our little French and managed to communicate well. His enthusiasm and pride in his country of his country were infectious. Breakfast at a Berber house was the highlight of our holiday. Sharing freshly cooked bread with such wonderful, welcoming people was a joy.Our local guide, (Omar) up to the waterfall was knowledgeable about the area both historically and geographically. Clambering over the rocks up the mountain is not for the faint hearted but well worth the effort and Omar ensured our safety through out.Overall a brilliant day out. thank you to all"

Maybe we should have more prior research before taking the trip but the way it was billed was as though it's a tour guide/driver to the location.As a driver this trip was 100% but as a tour this was a poor choice of company.

Jamal picked us up at the ryad right in time with a comfortable car, then we went off to Zagora (desert) with several stops for interesting sites & views.It was never a problem for Jamal to make a stop for a drink or a toilet break.We arrived in Zagora in the evening, took the camel to go to our tents in the desert. It was a magical evening. The next day, Jamal picked us up again and dropped us next to our ryad in Marrakech. The last day of our trip, my friends and I spent the day at Rhoul Palace, which was quite far from our ryad so we had to take our luggage (three women, no further explanation needed). So Jamal suggested he would pick us up at the Palace and drop us at the airport. That was really helpful to avoid the stress to be at the airport in time etc. Since we were hungry, he stopped at a great pastry shop. At the airport, he helped us with our luggage and accompanied us to the check-in.Conclusion: we never felt unsafe, Jamal provided an excellent service (always in time) and could answer all our questions. Also strongly recommended for women travelling alone.Thanks Jamal for this great experience!"

The driver/guide (Khalid) showed up promptly (early in fact) ready for our days tour just before 09:00.The car was parked around the corner, as it would have been impossible to get to our Riad down the narrow streets, but he came to the Riad to meet us, and walked us back to the car. We were the only two people on the trip, and the car was a very new Korean 4x4 style vehicle, and very comfortable.Khalid made it clear at the start of the day that the trip was our day, and he would stop where he knew the good places were to stop, but if we wanted to stop for any reason we just needed to request and he would stop for us. We saw many other tours whilst in the mountains, but these seemed more organized - and not in a good way! - there did not seem to be the flexibility on stopping where they wanted.The mountains are beautiful, and the scenery very pretty and we got some great photo opportunities. We headed down the Ourika valley - note this was December, and was supposed to be a quiet time. You could tell from the number of restaurants there, and how empty they were that this was the quiet time. In the height of season when people are escaping the heat of Marrakech for the coolness of the mountains - I can imagine it is bedlam in the mountains. We did the walk with a walking guide up the waterfalls. It was approx an hour to the halfway point, and our guide was not keen to take us for the further hour - and i'll be honest we were not that keen to go any further anyway - so we walked back to have our lunch. (Our choice - we could have eaten first if we had wished, but the walk was quite strenuous so am glad we did this way around).The lunch itself was very good, the food was superb. I was not sure if the cost of food and drink was included in the trip or not (as I could not remember) - but it was not. The restaurant was not expensive either, but it was obviously part of the tour, as it was the busiest restaurant in the area.On the way back we stopped at this herbal place. It did nothing for me, but my wife enjoyed it, and again the guy that showed us around was very knowledgeable.Khalid's English was very good, but we did between us (with my non-existent French/Arabic or Berber language!) sometimes have moments of conversation that were lost in translation. This unfortunately included when it came to making the payment at the end of the day. No cross words - and I do not believe it was intentional - we were all tired, but it meant heading back to the Riad at the end of the day to confirm the price with the guy from Riad that had booked it, and when we wrote it down on a piece of paper we were all in agreement on the price.I would recommend to the owner to perhaps supply some water to the customers in the back of the car gratis as we only took a small bottle, and we did not stop again until before lunch to get more refreshments. To be fair we did not ask to stop - but gratis water in the car would have been a nice touch.This did not detract from the day though - was definitely our favourite day in Marrakesh, and I would recommend this company to all."

The tours covered the varied landscapes of the Atlas mountains as well as cultural items like A\u00eft Benhaddou and breakfast at a Berber home. I would be very happy to book another tour with Easy Take in the future."

We hired several drivers in our 12 day trip to Morocco and Easy Take and the driver we received were by far the most professional operator we encountered.

Khaled the driver was on time and collected us from our Riad. The drive was very comfortable in his new 4x4. Khaled was very knowledgeable about Marrakesh as well as the valleys and villages and gave us an interesting insight of Marrakesh. He stopped wherever we wanted to take pictures and had organised his own stops at a Berber family house where we drank nice Moroccan tea and tried pure honey and home-made butter. Other stops were at places with nice panoramic views and an argon oil cooperative where we bought pure argon oil and honey. And of course we stopped for a nice lunch at one of the restaurants in ourika valley where we also linked up with Khaled's guide for the waterfall which was an amazing trek all the way up to the waterfall which took us 1 hour in total (Tip: wear good trainers/trekking shoes). Overall Khalid was a very cool, trustworthy and friendly guy who made the trip very enjoyable for us, he took many pictures for us!!! We totally recommend him especially if you are here as a couple/family and want to organize a private trip. The price was very reasonable, you are getting what you pay for, so you can't go wrong!!!"

I had initially requested Jamal\u2019s services for an excursion to Ourika Valley, which was fantastic. Jamal picked me up from my Riad in Marrakech right on time and drove me to the Atlas Mountains in his nice SUV. He showed me all the sights, including a visit to a Berber family home. Once we reached the mountains, he even hooked me up with a guide leading a group hike to the waterfalls, which was really enjoyable and cost effective. Having had such a great time, I availed of Jamal\u2019s services the next day too, which was my last day in Marrakech. I left my bags in his car and he showed me all around Marrakech, including the Bahia Palace, Saadian Tombs, Koutobia, Hammam etc. and dropped me off to the airport later. I had forgotten one of my packages in his car and he even arranged for it to be delivered to me at the airport, which speaks to his honesty and customer service. All I can say is that my trip to Morocco wouldn\u2019t have been half as enjoyable had it not been for Jamal. So thank you Jamal, and I hope you can be available whenever I am next in Morocco."

I found Jamal to be a great choice and would recommend him to everyone.I looked up a few on TA and came across EasyTake tours - I emailed Jamal and he was very responsive and gave me a very good price for our first excursion, which was a trip to Casablanca to visit the Hassan II mosque. Jamal arrived early to pick us up in his mini-van which was perfect for us, very clean and with plenty of space. We are a family of six which meant having to tumble the seats in his vehicle whenever we got in or out, which Jamal was immdeiately on hand to do.He was very polite and attentive to our needs and even suggested a few extra things to do, like having our picture taken outisde the famaous Ricks Cafe and also advising on a great place to eat along the corniche.I was so impressed with the service and value that I decied to use him for the remaining excursions, the second trip being a tour to the Atlas mountains. Again Jamal arrived ahead of time with his car cleaned from the previous day, he arranged the whole day for us with his various great contacts. We headed out early and stopped at a berber village where we met with a berber family who Jamal knew very well. We had a tour of their house and were then served a fantastic breakfast, with the best mint tea we'd ever had. We were served fresh bread, honey, olive oil and nuts - all of which were local produce and tasted fantastic. We were then taken to the next stop which was a berber village at the base of the Atlas mountains, here we met another friend of Jamal - whose name was also Jamal. He was a young berber guide who took us through the Ourika valley to the first waterfall and then upwards again and finally back to his village. The younger Jamal was also very good and really took care of us through our climb which was challenging in places.We used Jamal a third time to arrange a couple of activities around Marrakech - the girls wanted a spa treatment and the boys wanted to go quad biking. Again Jamal looked after us arranging everything without fuss and at a very reasonable price.Our final excursion was to Essouria, again Jamal arrived well ahead of time and we headed out to Essouria. We stopped along the way at a cafe and also at an Argan oil co-operative, where we had a tour of a small factory producing argan oil products. We then went to Essouria, where we stayed the whole day with Jamal waiting for us.On our last day in Marrakech Jamal also arranged one of his drivers to provide a taxi service for us around a couple of places in Marrakech, since he was busy with another tour. However, he did finally pick us up from our hotel to take us to the airport for our return flight in the evening.Overall, I was very impressed with Jamal, great manners, much more than just a transport service and never did I feel that I was under any pressure to buy additional services - as was often the case with other situations in Marrakesh. Great value for money, reliable, genuine and honest."

(marrakesh >sahara>marrakesh)Our guide Hassan is a well organized person, he managed to show us a lot of special sites that you will not find anywhere else, because sometimes we dont drive on the highways, we drive off roads. You wont feel bumpy as his car is so comfortable.We also visited a few kasbahs and local markets, its really local, not like marrakech at all. It is a big PLUS, if u are looking to see the real moroccan life. For each site, Hassan has found local guide to show us around, who also live in the same town, that makes u feel very local as well.For accomodation, very good selection of hotels that we stayed in, each has a swimming pool, best to cool down in a 43 degree weather. Make sure you do not miss Chez Pierre, ths food there is stunning! In the desert, camel ride on sand dunes, sleeping in tradition tents and watching sunrise were all unforgetable experiences, really worth the long travel time.During this trip, we get to know more about the climate, geography, agriculture and architecture of Morocco from Hassan, his knowledge is board, like a dictionary of Morocco. And each location, market, hotel, cafe, street that we stopped, he seems to know people there, which makes u feel extra safe all the time.In all, I have no hesitation recommending Berber Space to anyone!

            "review": "Morocco experience. Take a large canvas. Paint the top third a perfect blue sky. Now take a cotton ball and dab along the lower edge to make it a hazy sky. Take some gauze or panty hose. Stretch it above the rest of the canvas. Take some green and bleach it until it is a pale yellow green. Paint the gauze held over the canvas. Now, imagine you have a can of spray paint. It is a milk chocolate colour. Stand away from the canvas and spray lightly over the earth so only the finest drops hits the canvas.Next take jaffa orange and burn it. Take a broad brush. Dip it in the burnt orange and starting at the lower left corner drag the brush across the canvas about half way or until the paint stretches out. Dip again and now higher up near the middle drag it across the canvas again. Now you need a finer brush and paint the colour of cooked terra cotta. Starting just above and next to the jaffa do a smaller stroke across the canvas. Do one from the other side and drag towards the middle. Get a fine brush or dark blue coloured pencil and draw the top of a mountain range just below the top of the earth so it meets just below the hazy sky. Scratch some green below the mountain tops to lift them from the earth. Take a short chunky brush dip it in the terra cotta and dab some small square blocks below the mountain on the far right side to make your village.Take a clean piece of cotton wool and dip in it green paint. Dab lightly, twice, where the earth and sky meet on the left hand side. Dab once where your burned field ends and once at the edge of the village.Meet southern Morocco.Marrakesh was a huge market covering hundreds of acres. A large square was fed by countless covered alleyways with thousands of little shops selling almost everything imaginable. Hawkers begged you for a minute of your time before welcoming you into their shop. The alleys were too narrow for cars. People walked or rode bicycles to get around. Motor scooters beeped at you as they whisked by. Alleys led of alleys and then turned off again. Many led to Riads or hotels. To get to my Riad I went down the street beside the police station which lead to the hospital. Just before the hospital turn right and follow the alley. Turn left, then right and go past another 5 alleys before turning left again. At the end turn left and go through the tunnel to number 121. Ring the bell to get inside. Once inside it was like stepping into another time, maybe Aladdin\u2019s cave. The mosaic tiles and curved arches were painted traditional Moroccan style.Outside the medina was the new city. It was built to accommodate various groups that could not find space in the medina and has expanded to meet a different tourist market. The Jews were allowed to build a synagogue and the catholics have 2 churches. I am not sure if the christain churches were catholic but all non muslims or non jews were called catholic, no other flavours mentioned.Ouzoud, in the High Atlas Mountains, was a welcome change from the smells and hustle of Marrakesh. It was still hot but in the middle of nowhere was this amazing waterfall falling 120m from a river, with a small weir 20m from the edge, to a series of pools at the bottom. Locals were cooling off in the water, top and bottom. Down the very bottom many kids were laughing as they jumped from rocks high on either side of the pools below the waterfall. For the older people, you could enjoy a boat ride to the bottom of the falls where you would get wet from the spray. The boat, or rather raft, was logs lashed together and table chairs lashed to the top of the raft, lined up in two columns. Two young boys rowed the boat with oversized wooden paddles. It was impressive to see how close they could get to the bottom of the falls.Early the next morning we left Ouzoud and headed straight for Casablanca. I wished I had longer than a few hours in Casablanca. The beaches and coastline were a surprise to me. Along the coast south of the city were esplanades full of people wandering along. Below the esplanades I discovered rows of swimming pools, side by side, and full of people enjoying the water. Further on was a rock wall that provided a sheltered ocean area for swimming. I thought I was in heaven.Other sights, Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and an enormous mosque on the water\u2019s edge and a quick visit to the medina. I was warned not to wander too far into this medina and make sure I stayed where there were lots of people. We drove out of Casablanca north east towards Fes. I was really happy to have seen Casablanca.Were we on the road for nearly 10hours so I elected to skip driving through Rabat and Meknes. The Riad, or actually a Dar, in Fes is beautiful. Riad means house with a garden but most of the guest houses are actually Dars \u2013 which means house with an inside courtyard. The courtyards are quite elaborate with coloured tiles and traditional decorations. This is where you eat breakfast and socialise with other guests. Most Dars or Riads also have a roof top terrace where you can enjoy the sunsets and the cool winds that start to blow around sunset.Fes is a large city and has the most convoluted medina. I am lucky I had a guide. I would have been lost trying to find my way around. Its\u2019 huge and has what was a university in it\u2019s walls. The uni was found in the late 890\u2019s by a woman, Fatimah (not the daughter of Mohamed). Late last century it became a full time mosque. Morocco was conquered originally buy the Romans and later by the Arabs. During the Roman rule most of the original Berbers converted to Christianity. The Romans originally named the local tribes of North Africa Barbars (Barbarians) which later mutated to Berbers. Berbers still make up 80-85% of the population. Last stop Chefchouen, the blue city. Nearly all the buildings are a shade of blue. It is high in the Rif Mountains. Neither the High Atlas, Middle Atlas or Rif Mountains are heavily wooded. Mostly they are bare hills with villages built on one side of the hill. Chefchouen was very safe and hilly and full of little market stalls. Last morning in Morocco was a mad dash to Tanger Med to catch the ferry to Algericas in Spain. Only 20E of FRS ferry line and 1\u00bd hours on the boat. It was interesting because you could see across the Mediterranean to the other continent. Seemed so close and of course would have tempted the ancients to find their way across it knowing they wouldn\u2019t fall of the edge.I often travel solo and this was a great experience with Hassan as my driver and guide, even if he did love to talk and text while driving! :-) I highly recommend Berber Space to everyone who wants a personal tour in Morocco."

            "review": "A Friend in Morocco. Short VersionBerber Space and Hassan is the best possible company and guide to arrange for your trip in Morocco. I have travelled the world and this company ranks at the top of my list. I cannot imagine anyone doing a better job in planning and executing my Moroccan vacation. Be it a short trip, budget vacation, or luxury experience, Berber Space is the best you will find. Long VersionWhy I Selected Berber - Honest, high quality service that focuses first and foremost on your satisfaction is the best way to describe this company. I am very picky about my tour companies and do lots of research. Berber Space was one of 5 companies I interviewed (via email) and came out on top every time. While they offer pre-packaged tours, I wanted a highly customized experience with luxury options. After an initial response from various companies, I sent back lists of specific hotels, cities, sites, etc. I wanted included. Most companies quickly pushed me to their preferred canned packages. Not Berber Space, They customized every detail. The changes I wanted were obviously more expensive, but they did not gouge me. They merely passed along the costs and went so far as to get the exact hotels and exact rooms I wanted, as well as put each in my name. This showed tremendous trust, as I could have dumped them after doing the work. They even fronted money to hold rooms, until I could arrange wires. Other than out of pocket costs, they required no deposit. Plus, they were as responsive as I could have dreamed.  Expert Driver / Guide \u2013 The number one reason our trip was a success was because of our driver / guide, Hassan. I could not imagine touring Morocco without him. I plan to write a personal review of him and post is in the forum for people searching for private guides. Search \u201cPrivate Guides.\u201d For this company review, let me say he did everything you could dream of to give you the experience of a lifetime. He is the embodiment of customer service. Tour Changes - We did the clockwise tour (Meknes, Fez, Merzouga Desert, Dades Valley, Ouarzazate, Marrakech, Casablanca). On the way to the desert we changed our mind and decided to do s luxury desert camp. Change made and all went smooth. After the night in the desert, which included private dinner, drum party, camel riding, ATVs, bed under the stars, private bath and shower, we decided to skip a night near Merzouga and push our agenda forward one night. Again, Berber Space made the change with no sweat and we were on to our next destination. We again made a change and decided to spend an extra night in Marrakech. Again, no problem. They made the change and we did not miss a step. Union Guides \u2013 There is a very \u201corganized\u201d guide union in the big cites, if you know what I mean. All companies must use the official guides when touring the medinas of Meknes, Fez, & Marrakech. They steer you towards tourist traps, carpet salesmen, overpriced restaurants, etc. We were adamant about avoiding this and Berber was mostly successful in doing so. Hassan did is best to arrange for guides that would not do this. But, he said, they are hard to control. Instead, he gave us great tips on what to watch out for and what to say / act to get out quickly. In both Meknes and Fez, his advice was perfect and we got out of bad sales situations. The guide in Fez was clearly upset that we followed Hassan\u2019s advice and got out of sales situations. Marrakech was the best. Hassan was able to get a personal Berber friend, who is in the \u201cunion,\u201d and he gave us the best medina tour possible with ZERO salesmen experiences. Our guided tours were wonderful because Hassan made it happen. Price \u2013 Send me a PM if you want exact details. For now, I will say that Berber Space came in near the least expensive for the first round of bids. When I sent back an updated list of required hotels, their price was much closer to others, but still lower. Ultimately, they were the only company willing to include the exact hotels I wanted and offered a reasonable price. They even made the reservations in my name. This made me question the honesty of the other companies, since they continued to push me elsewhere. Berber Space was honest and fair in all their prices. Personal Attention \u2013 Besides taking care of all the details, Hassan and Berber Space gave us incredible personal service. Hassan realizes people have safety concerns (I now know those concerns are not justified). Thus, he goes out of his way to ensure you know he is personally responsible for every detail of your trip. We enjoy having our guides join us for meals. He was happy to oblige or simply stay in the care and wait for our call. He was there if we simply wanted an interpreter or assistance negotiation with a vendor. Regardless of the situation, Hassan and Berber Space made our entire vacation relaxed and comfortable. Our comfort was their most important concern. We are extremely grateful for Berber Space and Hassan. They provided a once in a lifetime adventure."

Now and then we would pull over to take pics and survey the terrain with my naval binoculars. Hoards of children would appear within seconds havin observed us a long time before. Sweets were like gold dust to these kids ,there are no corner shops at 10,000meters. We were invited by a young mum to go into her house for a drink. We were treated like royalty and genuine affection by her 6 children. Mum made a great ceremony of making us a drink of real Berber mint tea. Always served from a great hieght from a solid silver pot that has been in the family for centuries. It was delicious. One thing I noticed in the house was a trench which cut across the floor and under the walls. It carried fresh moutain water to the house from miles away . To Be Continued."

The country is stunningly beautiful and we loved the south in particular. Our driver, Hassan, had very good English and looked after us very well - he was also very good with the children (it was important for them to have a bit of fun as some of the drives were long). The highlight was the camel trek into the Sahara desert for sunset and sunrise! Hassan ensured that we hurried to the desert and took the trek on our first night as the weather was so good. Hassan also gave the girls a quick 4x4 ride on the dunes which was much appreciated and a lot of fun! The accommodation and food was good throughout. Hassan drove us safely up and over the Atlas Mountains - no mean feat - and accompanied us all the way to our Riad in Marrakesh, pointing out landmarks along the way to help us navigate the medina! Hassan was also very knowledgeable about Moroccan history which was very interested. Highly recommended!"

Especially it is familiar with the Sahara desert and the tour price is reasonable.We're lucky to meet Hassan. He is a nice and enthusiastic person and always patient to answer lots of questions before we visit Morocco through APPS. You can discuss with him and make a perfect itinerary. Hassan grows up in desert so he is very familiar with desert. We very enjoyed the tour cross the Atlas Mountain to the desert.We like to stay overnight at beautiful Hotel so we changed the Hotel on itinerary in Marrakesh and Fe s. But it\u2019s a mock. The Hotels we meticulous pick up are very disappointed. Otherwise, the hotels originally arranged are higher than our expected, even stay overnight in the camp of desert. Thanks god, originally we want to change it but Hassan told us we should try it! I traveled a lot. Indeed, it\u2019s an unforgettable memory. Can you imagine standing in the Sahara desert and star cover the sky at night? It\u2019s surreal, just like in the film studio.Hassan is a good tour organizer and careful person. He is sweet and cares about our feeling. You know even when we left Morocco and took ferry to Spain. We worried about can\u2019t take train to Madrid on time. He still gives us an oversea phone call to make sure if we\u2019re safe arrived.Hope we can back to Morocco and see you again.Thank you Hassan & Berber Space."

My partner and I chose Berber Space private tours as we had read positive reviews on trip advisor when we were researching our jaunt from London to Marrakesh for a few days during our 'European World Tour' coming from Sydney, Australia. We booked a hotel for 5 nights in Marrakesh and planned to make a view day trips out to nearby villages and sites once we arrived. Whilst we really loved the frenetic pace of Marrakesh souks and the ancient medina, we were overwhelmed by the touts publicising their day tours and offering all types of excursions at all types of prices. We weren't sure what to do? Rather than risk sitting in the back of a truck with 100 people we went back to trip advisor and contacted Hassan at Berber Space. Hassan was professional and spoke English with both 'collaquialisms' and educated conversation. We drove with Hassan in our own private 4 wheel drive with air-conditioning to the breathtaking ATLAS MOUNTAINS looking at inland lakes, mud houses built into the mountains, ancients mosques and burial grounds and we had a delicious bbq in a green 'oasis' in one of the valleys. Hassan was well informed and answered all our questions. He clearly loves what he does and we enjoyed having a break from the pace of Marrakesh. We would highly recommend Hassan for his professionalism but also because he made the tour lots of fun! He picked us up and dropped us off at our hotel and even recommended some of his favourite restaurants and bars in Marrakesh for us to visit at our leisure - we were happy to have some authentic local advice. Thankyou Hassan!"

My husband and I booked two tours with Berber Space: \"Valley of 'Ourika\" and, because we did not have time for a longer trip, a customized \"Taste of the Desert\" tour. I am so glad we booked with Berber Space. Hassan is a knowledgeable and passionate tour guide. He is very proud of his Berber heritage, and he not only revealed, but shared, a new world with us. Berber Space is a family business. Youssef and Hassan take customer service and satisfaction very seriously, and Hassan regularly inquired about to our comfort and happiness. Hassan even took us to his brother's home where his mother and sister-in-law served us a delicious Moroccan lunch. Hassan told his mother that I liked her hot sauce and she sent me home with a jar of this delicious condiment. On the Valley of 'Ourika tour we visited with a Berber family and experienced the warmest hospitality and mint tea ritual. The vistas on the tour are unbelievably gorgeous. We had no idea Morocco was so breathtakingly beautiful.The Taste of the Desert tour also included beautiful scenery, but the highlights were the camel ride and desert camp. The desert camp is clean and comfortable. Berber rugs cover the sand and a large fire warms the chilly night. I asked if I could have an extra blanket, and Hassan brought me four! Our camel driver, Mohammed, was very nice and a talented musician who showed great concern over the satisfaction of his guests. Riding the camel was an experience not to be missed!We had a spot of confusion over tipping etiquette as we left the desert, and Hassan solved the problem immediately and with the highest level of concern for all involved. I also appreciated that Hassan did not run us through a gauntlet of friends and associates with something to sell. He recommended one merchant, and it was glaringly obvious that his inventory was, for the most part, genuine and high quality work.Upon returning us to our hotel, Hassan insisted that we let him take us to the airport in two days. He refused to drop us at Departures, and left us only when he was sure we had cleared security.Traveling to Marrakech has been a dream for many years. Forget Marrakech. Go with Berber Space."

Morocco is a wonderful country but without a trustworthy guide it can be super intimidating.Hassan took us through the desert, departing from Marrakech. His car was always very clean and comfortable and Hassan himself, was great. He was also super concerned about us, he was always checking in to make sure we were happy with the experience.One of the highlights for our whole time in Morocco was getting to talk to Hassan about everything from Morocco's landscape, politics, history, music, culture and language. Without Hassan I would have felt like I had a very 'touristy' view of Morocco. Through our many conversations I left the country feeling like I actually understood Morocco and the people that live there. It also seemed like Hassan knew everyone wherever we went! I think we got special treatment because of it too - everyone seemed so happy to see him!My highlight from our entire trip (5 weeks total around many different countries) was a picnic in the desert that Hassan put together - it was something that no guide book could suggest you do... just something that a local could put together for you.On our last day of the tour, Hassan went above and beyond to make sure we made our connection to the next stop.The accommodation on our trip was great. Two of the nights we spent in nice hotels (with pools and good food) and the other night we spent in a camp after our camel ride. Any of the other people who we dealt with through Hassan were all friendly and trustworthy.Overall, our experience was wonderful and we're still telling stories to our friends and family about the adventures we had. I would definitely recommend Berber Space!"

I wrote to many many guides, and Hassan stood out far and above the rest. I am a part time travel agent, and I had booked accommodations. Hassan was able to get us much better prices and every place we stayed we had the best rooms in the hotels, the largest with the best views. Our itinerary also \"made sense\" versus other guides that had us backtracking to places.In the end, Hassan had to take his grandma to the hospital, so he made sure he got us another top guide that had high ratings on trip advisor. I will review the other guide in another post, but I want you to understand how much Hassan did for us. Besides all the bookings, not making us give a deposit, sending someone to meet us and take full care of us from Marrakech to Merzouga on a three night tour, he came to Marrakech to personally meet us and spend time with us on our last night and then drive us to the airport the next day to make sure that we had a great time, and get any feedback to improve.I have to say, his 4 x 4 was immaculate, and he was full of \"hugs\" for us and REALLY REALLY cares about his business and takes it very seriously.We have traveled all over the world, China, Thailand, Cambodia and Europe, and never ventured to Africa, as we were very concerned about cultural differences. Let me assure that you will feel totally, safe, secure and very very well taken care of in the hands of Hassan. He will call you on your cell or email you day or night, or Facebook Chat you...he is truly a very special person and if to make it totally clear, has our HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. I hope to go back with our extended family one day with Hassan."

First, it was planned so well that every need we had was answered from time to rest to time to see sights. Next, the places we stayed, the riads, were not just the usual wonderful riads, but had excellent services and food. Third, Hassan provided all the background we needed in order to understand what we were seeing. The extra guides he had for Meknes, Fez and other stops were wonderful, too, careful, patient and helped us to understand. Finally, when we did stop at shops to see or buy, not once did I feel hassled, hustled or cheated. Berberspace only takes you to places you can trust. As for the trip itself, it was perfect. We got to see Meknez, Fez, the drive to the desert. The highlight, of course, was sleeping outside in the desert. Loved the camel ride, too. Chez Pierre in the mountains was wonderful. Make sure Hassan gets you room 2, as he did for us. It had the best view, out a selection of fantastic sights. If I ever go back to Morocco or have any friends going to Morocco, I would definitely strongly recommend BerberSpace, so they can really enjoy and understand Morocco. I cannot tell you how many silly ideas I had about Morocco and Islam before I went there, but now I feel like I know more about this country and I have someone there I can count on if I ever return.

The food was wholesome and my son and i loved every minute of our trip there especially the hotel pool which was very clean. The staff were friendly and trustworthy. I even met some backpackers from a town a few miles from me who came to stay at the hotel.I got to learn about customs more than I can write down one of which was getting to be a guest at a tradition moroccan wedding. the hosts did not seem to phased in the slightes that we attended and treated us with extremely warm hospitality. l I found the local Berban people extremely kind and approachable. The tour agents are amazing fun to be around and they will tailor the vacation around your needs and what packages you choose. If you are looking for holiday with lots of fun and flavour Berber Space tours are the people to contact.I know this isn't my last trip to Morocco and would recommend friends and family to use them if they ever decide to visit.

The Taourirt Kasbah is also a wonderful place to visit, as well as the Atlas Studios where they filmed movies such as The Mummy, The Passion of Christ, and Prince of Persia, to name a few. On the way back, we stopped for some refreshments overlooking the mountains and Abdul taught me how the Moroccans drink their mint tea and he introduced me to eating cactus or prickly pears as they call it.

However, our guide Abdul was very considerate and stopped the van frequently for fresh air and breaks even without my asking. I feel that we spent a touch too long at Atlas Studios on a tour that did not provide very much information and was given in two languages as only half the group spoke English. Ait Ben Haddou is gorgeous but it was very hot and the climb to the top of the city was worth straining ourselves a bit. One thing I did not love our lunch stop at Ait Ben Haddou which was a rather touristy place to be expected and we the waiter did not allow us to order a la carte even though a table next to us was able to. As such, it was our most expensive lunch in Morocco and was our worst meal in Morocco. Luckily, the scenery, tours, and conversations with Abdul made up for this mediocre lunch experience.

I highly recommend Morocco Inspiring Tours, and Abdul, the organiser, for knowing Marrakech area. He speaks a very good english and french, knows a lot about Morocco and is pleased to provide all informations one need. besides he is a pleasant and gentle person, always worried about his group, always ready to attend all needs, from pictures to restrooms or tea.In spite of Morocco culture he doesn't try to make you buy staff, what is a true relief!"

Besides seeing wonderful and very impressive places of Ouarzazate City, Movies Studios and especially Taourirt Kasbah (highly recommended, do not miss it!), during the whole day we enjoyed chatting with Abdul about Morocco history, social life, politics and all other aspects of life. Abdul has perfect social skills, deep knowledge of history, and he is fluent in Arabic, French and English as well. Comfortable, air conditioned car was like an oasis for us between jumping out and in for sightseeing and Abdul was a perfect driver as well.

            "review": "Day Trip to Ouarzazate City, Taourirt Kasbah, Movies Studios, Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah Through High Atlas Mountains. Have you met Abdul, yet? There is a reason why everyone is raving about this guy: he's good at his job. But, without getting into too much of an Abdul-hype, here's what you can expect from the tour. You'll be picked up early in the morning from either your hotel or from an arranged check-point, which is usually nearest road. We stayed in a Riad in the Medina Souks, so we had a short walk out to the Dar el Bacha (Royal Palace) and high street (the backstreets are well lit, even in the early morning, so the walk was pleasant). Abdul's car is air-conditioned; I already miss his (music) playlist; and the man, himself, is very knowledgeable with ready answers, lots of information, a keen eye for good photo-opportunities and a GSOH. By the end of the day, if not by the end of the long drive across the Atlas Mountains (approx. 4 hours, one way), you'll have learned so much that you'll find yourself smiling if anyone else tries to teach you the same things afterwards - because 'Abdul already told you that'. At Taourirt Kasbah in Morocco's Hollywood, Ouarzazate City, you'll hopefully meet Mohammed as your guide. He not only knows the history and culture behind the Kasbah and its restoration, he has worked on the special effects of some major films - some you may even know. At the movie studios, you'll walk through some of the sets used for films such as Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Body of Lies (2008), Kundun (1997), Asterix and Obelix (1992-), Gladiator (2000), The Mummy (1999), and - way in the distance - you'll see the city of Marine from Game of Thrones, Season Three (2011-). After that, is the beautiful fortress of Ait Ben Haddou. You'll get to walk up to its uppermost beacon tower for a panoramic view of the city, desert-land and the Atlas mountains. This trip is a great addition to any holiday, long or short, as you'll get to see Morocco from a side you won't see by simply staying in the city centre. All our entry fees for the Kasbahs and the Movie Studio were sorted by Abdul in advance of the trip. It is, however, rude not to tip anywhere in Marrakech/Morocco, so practise your Gentleman's Handshake for handing this over. The food-stops Abdul will take you to are pretty decent and, unlike some other tour guides, he doesn't expect you to buy things from market stalls, so he will walk straight past these - but if you want something, just say so, he'll be happy to wait for you. Same goes with pictures; he'll happily wait for you to take all the photos you want. Do keep an eye on the time, however, because you are doing a lot in a small period of time and there's so much to see, you'll find yourself so lost in looking at something you'll have to drag yourself away in order to have the time to see the next thing. But you never feel rushed.If you are the kind of person who'll worry about not buying things, don't be, because the tour gets you back by about 8pm and Medina's Jemaa el-Fnaa (market) is open until late - and they have EVERYTHING there, including the occasional snake charmer.This tour is great for anyone who is interested in things, and for anyone with a camera. If you have any special lenses, bring them. You won't regret it."

He is very informed and charming and we felt safe and well looked after. The guides were there waiting for us (a small tip is expected) and Abdul looked after other tips and charges.

The driver, Abdul, picked us up on time at our hotel in a clean, air conditioned van. He gave us cold bottles of water which was nice since it was hot that day. The palm grove is only about 15 minutes from the \"New town\" part of Marrakech. When we arrived there was another guide, Said, who took us on our camel tour. One thing I was really happy about is that the camels looked happy and healthy, well taken care of. Even the guide, Said, told us how much he loves his camels and how to him they are like more than animals. So about halfway through the camel walk, we stopped at a house where a lady brought us mint tea and Berber style crepes with honey and olive oil. Overall, the camel walk and tea stop lasted about two hours. We got some GREAT photos... Both Said and Abdul made sure of that!! Highlight of our vacation by far!!"

The Ait Ben Haddouh Kasbah was best because of the view and very beautiful landscape. Abdul picked us up promptly from our hotel, then drove us to the mountains. He was a safe and trustworthy driver and also very knowledgable about Morocco and open to talk about any topic we had questions about.

We stopped off in a village outside of Marrakech where we were invited to drink tea with one of the locals inside her family home.

We then went on to climb up one of the mountains in the first valley where we stopped off by a waterfall to relax for a while. The second valley saw Abdul take myself and my fianc\u00e9 to a Berber village where a nice family prepared a local 3 course meal. The setting was absolutely picturesque as we ate on a hillside overlooking the small village. They were very welcoming and were genuinely happy to receive us. During the 3rd valley we drove through it stopping off in multiple locations to take pictures.

I wanted to say how truly wonderful our tour with Abdul was for my wife & I. We chose the tour to the Sahara for camel rides and an over night stay with the Bedouins but we also customized our trip and added other stops along the way. Abdul was extremely accommodating and took such great care of us. The camel rides and overnight in the Sahara was definitely unique and fun but I think the best part was spending time with Abdul; visiting unique towns and shops along the way, learning about the various cultures and customs, and making a new life-long friend. I can't remember the cost but it was very reasonable for a planned 2 night/3 day trip. Transportation was in a comfortable new mid-size van and we never felt unsafe at any time; even on the mountain roads and passes. He's an excellent driver and as a guide he has a very easy-going relaxed manner that puts you at ease right away. I couldn't recommend a better guide or traveling companion. He's the absolute best guide and companion we've had in any country. If you need space, you've got it. If you want him to be more actively involved with you; he's right there for you. Our trip was in the first week of December 2014 and happened to coincide (after we'd crossed the Atlas) with what turned out to be a 100 + year massive destructive flood. On the day we needed to return to Marrakesh we discovered that landslides and massive flooding had closed both passes we could choose from to get back to Marrakesh. Flooding of riverbeds that hadn't seen water in years were wiping out roads, homes and businesses, and closing roads. Thank God for Abdul and his experience, knowledge, and professionalism! What could've been a nightmare scenario was handled very very well. We 're laid-back seasoned travelers & although bus loads of other travelers were freaking out, we remained calm with the hand we'd been dealt, as did Abdul. He seemed to know people and places to stay and eat at every little town we got stuck in. We never felt unsafe and were soooo glad we had Abdul taking care of things. We ended up spending 2 extra nights before the water receded and the landslides were cleaned up. But the Moroccan government was well organized, responsive, and was quick to get repairs done and open the passes. With Abdul as our guide, we had an incredible trip despite the difficulties and viewed the whole affair as more of an adventure than a headache. We can't wait to go back to see more of Morocco and spend more time with Abdul. He was FANTASTIC!!"

The excursion took us out of the bustle of the city in air conditioned comfort, and showed us the beauty and culture of the mountain areas. The waterfall walk was particularly stunning, the descent coinciding with a call to prayer from a local minaret. Lunch in the Berber village was well off the tourist track and an enlightening insight to the Berber way of life, besides a fabulous meal. Our guide, Abdul, spoke brilliant English and supplied comprehensive commentary as well as many photo stops. We plan to return to Marrakech, and will certainly look up Abdul and his company to see what other trips he is offering."

The entire trip we had to ourselves (just by chance) and Ismail was so much fun as well being knowledgeable about the local people and their way of life. After first visiting a Berber house (and drinking tea) we continued up into the valley where we were introduced to Abdul, our other guide for taking us further up on foot. Abdul again was a real pleasure to talk to and a wealth of knowledge, being Berber himself. We then got to the waterfalls which were beautiful and later took a stunning root down, back to Ismail who was waiting patiently for our arrival. We then visited some women making Argan Oil were we got to try and smell many of things they had to offer. Heading on we travelled higher and through some incredible scenery that can be found throughout these three valleys. Later we stopped for some home cooked food which was delicious, and carried on back down towards the market. This was very different to the markets found in Marrakech and was a real insight to the local way of life. The tour was absolutely fantastic and we would recommend it to anyone, definitely worth the time."

Abdul is interested in 'solidarity tourism' in which tourism income can be used to support Moroccans in many regions - and I was very happy to be able to support this family, who made the most elaborate picnic overlooking the atlas mountain villages. Incredible view, extraordinary food, wonderful hosts, unique village. I absolutely recommend this trip if you have an extra day in Marrakech!

Abdul was a very knowledgable guide, his vehicle was clean and comfortable and his English was excellent. Early in the morning we went to a traditional Berber market where Abdul was happy to explain to us all the intricacies of the area. After that we had breakfast at a local Berber house followed by a trip up into the mountains and a hike up to a series of waterfalls. For lunch we drove much further up into the mountains to a small village in a beautiful valley. We had an excellent picnic lunch served by a very gracious local host. This really set the trip apart from others as Abdul had personally found the family and the location to host his guests. The remainder of the day was spent driving the mountain roads and stopping to explore unique areas and take photos. This was one of the most unique and authentic excursions we have ever done. I highly recommend this trip and Abdul was the perfect guide to lead us through it. It was the highlight of our time in Marrakech"

My friend and I chose the day trip to Ourrzazate, Taourirt Kasbah then to Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah through the Atlas Mountains & Berber Villages.Summary: What made this trip so good was our tour guide/driver Abdul. He always made sure we were comfortable and stopped en route to let us take photos as well as have a short mint tea break! The drive to our first proper stop was just over 3 hours and a half but with the rest stops and photo opportunities, as well as the information Abdul was providing, the time went by very quickly.Itinerary:Abdul picked us up at 7 at our hotel and then we started our drive through the mountains, which was a very pleasant drive! We then arrived in Ourrzazate for our first proper stop and had a tour of Taourirt Kasbah in Ourrzazate which was very interesting and well worth doing. After this we had a choice of a smaller film museum or the film studios - we chose the latter. Although the film studios were not hugely cultural, it was still quite interesting. We then had lunch near Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah which was quite nice. After this, we spent the rest of the day in the Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah which was truly spectacular - it is no wonder it is a world heritage site! After this we drove back to Marrakech and arrived at our hotel around 8pmThe benefits of doing this trip is a very comfortable car (almost like a ford Galaxy), an excellent driver, free entry to the museums which means no hassle whatsoever, and also a good variety of things to do. I would highly recommend this day trip, even if you are only in Marrakech for a few days. Also, I left my earphones in Abdul's car and he dropped them off the next morning at our hotel and called us to make sure I had received them - great service!"

            "review": "renewing our connection ... Abdul makes it happen. Many only dream of returning to the motherland, so when planning for our recent trip to Morocco Africa aka Marghrib, I wanted to be sure to select the perfect Tour Guide. When I first came across Morocco Inspiring Tours, I was a bit skeptical due to the very few reviews they have on Trip Advisor. As a Muslimah convert, it was important that I have an authentic experience, that included Halal foods, time for prayer, and visits to historically Islamic landmarks. Additionally, i wanted to learn about the Indigenous and Saharan tribes. Inspiring Tours was not only affordable but they were also immediately responsive, attentive and accommodating of all of my requests. From the moment we arrived at the airport to our final goodbyes, the guides were extremely professional. Abdul, Ismael, Muhummad, and Mouhssin were always courteous, patient and ready to share their abundance of knowledge! We often had long drives, but the good conversation helped the time pass quickly. We traded stories, riddles, songs, pictures. We discussed Hip Hop, faith, language, culture, history and even had a Moroccan Mint Tea pouring competition before dinner one evening!For three large families traveling together out of the country for the first time, the guides made our trip very special by joining us for meals and always ensuring that everyone was \"good\"! They were so thoughtful, inclusive and encouraging of all the children both Muslim and non. They met them where they were as first time travelers yet challenging them to discover and try new things constantly. Ishmael raced along the beach, took selfies, carried tired little ones, answered a million questions, conversed in both Spanish, Arabic and English and watched out for them as if he were their big brother. All three of our families ( 15 in total) have even been inspired to continue language studies and have a newfound appreciation for so many cultural identities including tea and herbal remedies indigenous to the area! All thanks to this team of committed guys!They really seem as if they were born to do this kind of work! They have numerous relationships with people and places across the country! From modern to traditional, if you are one who likes more trendy/ tourist places or if you are open to off the grid spots, they know all the good spots! We got to experience the very trendy tourist belly dancing at Comptoir, stayed in both a contemporary hotel, and a riad, and got to taste the local tagin, and rarely found Medfounna typically only found in the Risani area. The Dramadeer rides in the Sahara and the exhausting road trip through the mountains was all worth it! The experience has been life changing and these guys come highly recommended!"

While this was my fourth visit to this beautiful country, there is always something magical and enchanting to newly discover. Moroccans are wonderful hosts, extremely welcoming and have a genuine desire to ensure that your visit to their country is fulfilling and satisfying. One of the best ways to enhance your experience is to hire a professional guide/driver to see the country and Morocco Inspiring Tours is just the ticket. The staff include Abdoul, Ismael, Mouhsin and Mohammed, all of whom were very friendly and engaging. This visit included overnight and day trips to Rabat, Casablanca, Essouria, Atlas, Ourzazate and the Sahara in Merzouga, all from our base in Marrkech. I worked directly with Abdoul to plan our 9 day visit for a group of 16 people and then a smaller group of 3 people. The vehicles were very comfortable and we always felt safe with their driving. Based on our wishes, Abdoul was able to create an itinerary that was filled with adventure, beautiful vistas, historical sites, camel rides on the beach for children, evening entertainment, amazing food and most importantly an opportunity to authentically engage with people. We also requested a spur of the moment major itinerary change and even with such a large group, they were patient, calm and accommodating. All you have to do is be present in the moment and open your mind and heart to exploration and discovery! We shared and exchanged stories with them about our families, work, politics, religion, laughed out loud, and most of all the experience of human connections. With Moroccan Inspiring Tours, there is no problem that can't be solved, including airport transfers, booking hammam appointments, hotel stays, cell phone charging and wifi access while on the road, interpretation and shopping. Everything is \"as you like!\""

Abdul was very knowledgeable about the area and part of the fun for us was getting to know him.

We took the Full-Day Atlas Mountains, 3 Valleys and Berber Villages tour with Abdul through Viator and it was the highlight of our trip to Morocco. Abdul was pro-active and worked with our Riad to get us to the meeting point on time for an early start to our day. Our first stop was a bustling Berber market. It was fascinating to see the early morning market being setup. You could buy anything from a 20 year old cassette player, to a donkey! After the market we started toward the Mountains and surrounding valleys. Once we arrived at the first valley, we were handed off to our Berber trekking guide who took us on a breathtaking climb up to some waterfalls. We stopped along the way for a refreshment and breather, then continued to see some incredible vistas of waterfalls and snow capped mountains. After our climb we journeyed to a Berber village where we had once of the best meals of our trip. The view from the terrace was amazing. After lunch, the rest of the day was spent driving through the different valleys, stopping along the way for photo op after photo op. I'm glad we are in the age of digital because I probably would have gone through about 10 rolls of film on this tour. On our drive back to Marrakech, Abdul gave some unique perspective on life in Marrakech. We really enjoyed learning about life growing up in Morocco. Thank you Abdul for a wonderful experience. We wish you well and will always remember our Atlas Mountains adventure."

We used the Morocco Inspiring Tours excursions as offered by our Riad and we can highly recommend the tours with Ismail and Abdul especially if you travel with young kids. Both drivers spoke excellent English, were very friendly, attentive and committed to giving us a good time. The cars were very clean, spacious people carriers. When people say, you can get the tours cheaper \u2013 yes, you can but it depends on your travel preferences. If you travel alone and don\u2019t mind sharing the bus with 20+ others to get straight from A to B, you will get it half the price down the road. In our case, we felt we got great value for money. The Marrakech Sightseeing Tour for example, cost us in total \u20ac45 and it was a personalised experience i.e. just the four of us in the car with the driver (Ismail) who was funny, knew lots about Marrakech, took our kids into consideration and stopped whenever we wanted to jump out for photos or have a look at places and he showed us so many beautiful places like the Bahia Palace or Majorelle Garden. His brother Abdul who drove the other two tours did the same. We enjoyed both days with him and had a great experience. Abdul was also the one who picked us up from the airport, organised through the Riad, even with a flight delay \u2013 he waited for us and welcomed us to Morocco in the middle of the night with a smile. I travelled to many places in the world, experienced various excursions and the ones offered here were very good. We did three in total and we highly recommend the Marrakech Sightseeing Tour and the Ourika Valley Tour (a day Trip to the Atlas Mountains through Berber villages and waterfalls). You get a combination of guided and independent touring which allows for many photo opportunities, getting to know the area and meeting locals as well as knowing you\u2019re being looked after. We were each time picked up in the Medina near where we stayed which was an added bonus and made us feel very safe. Overall we had an amazing trip. We saw so much and learned even more."

            "review": "Full day up to the High Atlas Mountains. The day begins very early, with a personal pick-up at your hotel. We were staying across from the train station at the Opera Plaza, (fantastic place with indoor Olympic-sized oasis pool!) which I have described in detail in another post. Abdul arrived promptly at seven in a clean minivan, perfectly-sized for our small party. Driving in Marrakech can be an adventure unto itself - with donkey carts, two lanes that inexplicably mushroom into six, and the ever-present motorcycles weaving in and out, but Abdul handled the traffic like a pro. We made our way through Marrakech itself, via the palace area that skirts the Old Medina walls. Once we were clear of the city, we begin to climb into the desert, winding through dramatic switchbacks as we made the ascent toward the High Atlas Mountains, passing village sites where the Berber people have lived for millennia. The scenery here is part of the experience, changing from palm trees to scrub to desert in just a few miles. Ultimately our morning destination was the Atlas movie studio location where numerous films have been made - Quarzazate - but on the way we made several interesting pit-stops. We stopped briefly to see Argon Oil being made at a Women's Cooperative (extremely labor intensive process! Cooperatives like this are an important source of income for local women - think micro-finance - and well worth seeking out when traveling. I will not mindlessly slather on the oil again in future without thinking of the ladies who harvest the nut, break it open with a hammer, grind in into pieces and then mash it to remove the precious oil that is so good for hair and skin!) Then it was off to a quick stop at a local event honoring Special Olympics participants and their families. A side note here: it is very encouraging that the people of Morocco support some of the weakest members of their society in this way! Midmorning, we stopped at a Kasbah, home to one of the Berber families tasked with governing during the French occupation (from the late 1800s to late 1950s). Touring this particular Kasbah, we began to understand the link between architectural design and the arid climate: wide, covered porches, thatched and mudded roofing systems, interior air-drafts, enclosed courtyards, complete with original tile-work featuring inscriptions from the Koran, as well as the geometric designs prevalent in the Berber culture - similar to a Riad but on a grander scale. Here, everyone from the local population to visiting dignitaries were ushered into the upstairs inner sanctum to meet with the Berber equivalent of a local Sultan. Don't miss the local artists busily painting desert scenes in one of the upstairs balcony areas!Then it was onward - and upward - past the highest point in Africa - 'Tizi N'Tichka (over 2200 meters high) toward Quarzazate. This is a surprisingly large city, given how incredibly difficult it must be to get people and supplies up there. I can only imagine that most of the people have lived there for generations and have no need to go elsewhere, and there IS a steady stream of traffic up that two-laned curvy road, but still! Apparently the movie people fly into the small airport and skip the switchbacks. Over the years, the studios have been the set for numerous films: Cleopatra, Gladiator, Mission Impossible, The Bible series with Roma Downey, The Jewel of the Nile with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner and a French film that involved Spinx-like creatures with Crocodile heads (the set is still there!) Although expensive to film epic movies of this sort, given the 10:1 economy of Morocco to the US/Canada/Europe, it must be cost-effective and provides a needed boost to the economy locally.The final stop of the day, after lunch, of course, was to the UNESCO world heritage site at Ait Ben Haddou, which served as a backdrop to the city of Yunkai in The Game of Thrones. Originally built over 400 years ago as a fortified city along a major trading route with Sudan (think African Silk Road), the complex has held up remarkably well. Families still live in some parts, and if you close your eyes for a moment you can \"see\" life the way it would have been in the 1600s. Amazing!After a full day of touring, Abdul now had the unenviable job of getting us safely back down the mountains. Past construction projects designed to widen the road in places, through miles of the morning's switchbacks in reverse, back down from 2200 meters we went, to arrive, ultimately, back at our hotel, safe and sound.I have to commend our driver Abdul for his patience with our many questions, his willingness to make unscheduled stops (I did really need a postcard stamp from Quarzazate!) and his professionalism in conducting the tour, but most of all for his driving skills!"

We were picked up close to our riad, in a comfortable and spacious people carrier. Abdul our guide introduced himself and spoke very good English. It took an hour or so to reach the Atlas mountains. We stopped at a argan oil cooperative where we has the chance to see how the oil was made and have a little go ourselves. We then moved further into the mountains where we met out 'local' guide for the walk to the waterfall. Our guide was very friendly and helpful. He did a fantastic job a making sure my Mum felt comfortable and safe while scrambling up the rocks and over the shallow streams. We had a break half way through the walk at a little 'cafe' where we could enjoy some beautiful views of the waterfall, the valley and the snow topped mountains.From there we went onto the second valley where we had a lovely meal on the terrace of a berber house. We then moved onto the third and final valley and the berber market. If you are looking for crafts and souvenirs to take home then you'll be disappointed (unless you want to bring a goats head home...), but if you are wanting you experience the sights, sounds and smells of a traditional berber market then you'll not be disappointed. Not once did we feel rushed by Abdul or our local guide. Abdul was very accommodating to my snap happy fingers, providing plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos or stopping especially if there was something we wanted to see. We had lots of questions and Abdul was always pleased to answer them. We felt safe in Abdul's care, he was a very safe and cautious drive. The sights and views on this tour were beautiful and the day was broken up by a mix of activities. Oooh. My Mum left her hat in the vehicle. Abdul made contact with our riad and he went out if his way to return the hat to my Mum at our riad the very next day.Fab trip and excellent tour guide :-) Thanks Abdul"

Abdul was attentive, nice and very informative. We tend to ask a lot of questions and he was better than google! He drove us to Ouarzazate and Ait Benhaddou which were both amazing. We also stopped for a night in the desert with camels and nomads. At first, I was a little reserved about spending that much time traveling since our vacation was short but it was an excellent way to see the country. We were able to meet the locals, see beautiful scenery and experience Morocco for the wonderful country it is. Abdul is a great driver and the car is very comfortable. We were all able to lay down and sleep off the jet lag :) I would strongly recommend Abdul. He knows his stuff!"

My girlfriend, a mutual friend and I decided to take a two day one night trip out of Marrakech to go camel riding and sleep in the desert during out trip to Marrakech. Our riad recommended Abdul to be our guide during the trip and since we hadnt met him we werent sure what to expect but they assured us Abdul would be wonderful. Since it was our first trip to Morocco we opted to pay a bit more to be the only three riding with him. We got up early in the morning and Abdul walked into the Souk to meet us at our Riad dour. He arrived promptly, well dressed and was very friendly. We proceeded to spend the next 10 hours driving with him the first day, stopping at about a dozen places headed south to the meeting point with the camels, and about 12 hours with him the next headed back North to Marrakech. He was amazing. His knowledge of his country was incredible and he joined us for most of our excursions, explaining everything he could to us during our first (of many) trips to Marrakech. We ended up having such a trusting experience we hired him to drive us from Marrakech to Casablanca for an early morning flight out. It may have cost a few dollars more but we knew we were in good hands.He was amazing and all three of us kept his info for our next trip to Morocco. Highly recommended."

Getting out for a day gave us a breather from the intensity of the place and the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the Atlas Mountains. You can soon see why people become attached to them. The scenery is stunning. Our Riad fixed the trip up with Morocco Inspiring Tours. We spent the day in the easy, cheery company of Abdul who drove and guided us around to a fixed, itinerary but with the aim to please. We were happy going along with the Berber cultural tour on the way to what we considered the main event which was to get out and walk in the mountains. Once we'd agree the level of challenge we wanted to take on (As sissy as possible), he fixed us up with a very charming and reassuring local guide who you could've equally trusted to take your kids up the north face of the Eiger. Back in the motor, Abdul was as chatty as we wanted him to be, no more, which is nice. He was informative, helpful and accommodating. By the time we got back to Marrakech, we understood the place better and enjoyed it the all the more."

Whilst staying at the Riad Misria we were given the opportunity to take a day trip towards the Atlas Mountains, along with another visitor who expressed interest in seeing the Ourika Valley.

He immediately engaged in conversation speaking good English and informing us about our forthcoming trip and more! He encouraged us to take photos at any opportunity and was very easy to be with and accommodating.

Abdul rahman s driving is very very safe - matter of fact we crossed the Atlas mountain at around 11 pm ( atlas mountain is a single lane road and known as notorious in morocco) again we did not feel any discomfort during his driving. I must admit at times he drives on 60km/h (about 50mp/h on a clear motorway . Morrocon speed limit is 60km/h) but this is to maintain the fuel economy and to avoid police fines- which is understandable. In summary I would use Abdul for my next trip and strongly recommend his services to all especially to families with children"

The drive was lovely through the Atlas mountains and we even made a stop on the road where they'd just shot the motorcycle scenes from Mission Impossible 5. Abdul was very happy to take pictures of me in front of various landmarks. We talked about music and he very much enjoyed listening to some of my favorite American songs. We had a blast singing and sharing stories about our respective cultures. I learned so much about the Muslim culture and the holiday of Ramadan. And although he wasn't able to join me while I ate lunch, he took me to a great kasbah near Ait Bennhadou. I told him how much time I needed to explore the area and he took pictures and gave me great tips on how to explore the area. We drove back to Marrakech and continued to share stories. Before he took me back to my hotel, he took me to a great place to ride a camel. I had told him that I'd like to ride a camel before leaving and it was certainly a highlight of the day. I had such a fun day with Abdul... don't miss your chance to have a wonderful guided tour and learn so much more about Morocco!"

I have read an overwhelming number of excellent reviews on Tripadvisor about different private tour operators in Marrakech, I simply am not happy with my own experience. I contacted Marrakech Tour Guide for a half-day trip in the afternoon with Youssef. Early in the morning of the trip I got an email from Youssef saying he had to cancel due to back pain. He would send his friend instead. I was suspicious but with such short notice I didn't have many choices and so I agreed to hire his friend. We got to the hotel around 3 pm and on the way from the airport to the hotel I noticed it wasn't very happening in the medina probably due to the heat. So when I saw our guide, I asked if it was a good time to visit the medina in the afternoon. He said we had booked the trip already and even if we canceled, we would have to pay and that's the way it worked. I wasn't going to cancel the trip but would like to see if there were other alternative activities he would recommend. So showing us his only concern was just about money didn't leave a good impression. We started our medina and the souk tour at 3:30. We went to a university, walked around the medina and the souk. I wish we came in the morning instead as many shops were closed. For example when we went to the communal bakery, it was almost closed and was empty, so we couldn't experience the local crowd coming to have their bread made. We didn't get to see the sheep auction in the morning either. I asked to see the tanneries but the guide told me that they were closed. I, however, found out later that the tanneries were open in the afternoon too. We could have gone and I was disappointed. I would strongly recommend a tour in the morning if you have a choice. I did ask before I booked if afternoon was happening in the medina but didn't have any reply. The guide took us to a silversmith in the medina. He made good locks. However I wasn't ready to pay 50-60 euros for some heavy super-size lock as a home decoration. The guide tried to sell them to me and said these were the people that I wanted to HELP. They were over-priced. Then the guide took us to a wood shop. The shop owner wanted to sell me a small wooden toy box in which a snake popped out when one opened it. It was cute but I wasn't interested. He started first at \u20ac15 each, then \u20ac20 for two and I wasn't interested and walked out of the shop. Then the guide called me back and asked how much I wanted to pay. I told them I was not interested and the owner offers them at two for \u20ac 15. I was firm and told them I simply didn't want any. Then the guide let go and grabbed a couple of small toy horse figures for my children to make up for his pushiness. I traveled with my 7 and 5 years old boys. The guide didn't engage them. Unlike what I read on Trip Advisor about how guides are great at interacting with children. There was hardly any interactions between this guide and my children. They were bored and wanted to go back to the hotel. I asked to take them for ice cream then. Overall, this guide is just below average. (1) show more concern about money than how to tailor-made a good tour for this customers. (2) pushing us hard to buy in his friends' shops. (3) not good at interacting with young children. (4) Not good at reading people. When we wanted to spend more time at the snake charmers, he was rushing us to go. He just failed to deliver although he repeated a couple of times \" You see, I am trying very hard.\"Youssef did call before and after the tour to check how things went. It unfortunately didn't my experience."

Youssef was very responsive in pacing the tour with what we wanted to do; we could ask to take photos and \"chill,\" at any time during the tour. What makes this the ideal tour is the attention to details; Youssef Kharroubi and his driver treat you as if you are their family, which creates a very welcoming atmosphere.We can t wait to return to Morocco for another trip.Highly recomended"

Our day started with Youssef meeting us at our Riad to escort us to the car for the first half of the tour, \"palaces and monuments.\" At each stop, Youssef accompanied us and provided a wealth of information site, as well as vast amounts of information of Moroccan and Muslim culture that we would have never learned elsewhere. He gave generous time for pictures, especially at the Jardin Majorelle, my favorite stop. The next three stops, Bahia Palace, Koutoibia Mosque, and Saadiens Tombs, took us through centuries of Moroccan history, politics, culture, and architecture. After a few hours of the tour, Youssef led us to a luncheon at a place with quite possibly the most scenic panorama of the city. Per Youssef's suggestion, we ate the chicken and lemon tangine which filled us up for our dive into the souks! The first half of the tour would have been difficult with Youssef's help, but the remainder would have been impossible. He navigates his way through the twisting and curving medieval medina as though he's walking through an open filed. What's even more amazing is that he does not meet a stranger. Following Youssef, we began to truly appreciate the \"organized chaos\" of Marrakech! We commenced our souk tour buy visiting a Moroccan pharmacy of sorts where we were given a short demonstration about Argan oils and other healing herbs and spices. With Youssef, you do not have to bargain, and he ensures you are getting the best quality and service. We also visited a lantern store, shoe store, and a store for tea sets with similar experiences. In fact, after leaving one store, I realized I'd made an accidental purchase. Not to worry with Youssef! He calmly returned to the store and everything was worked out! Finally, we visited the rug cooperation. There, we had an intriguing demonstration of the various regions of Morocco and the types of rugs made there. Again, Youssef ensures that you are getting the best price and quality. After the rug shop, our day with Youssef was nearing its end. He escorted us back to the Riad and even showed us a few surprises along the way only a true Marrakecki could spot. We hated to say goodbye to our new Marrakechi friend, Youssef. My brother and I both agreed we would have enjoyed his company and knowledge for our entire journey. I've done many similar tours across the world, and this one was one of the very best! Youssef's knowledge of the city, great personality, and savvy shopping skills in the souks make him an indispensable guide. If you want an unforgettable time in Morocco, contact Youssef! You will not regret it! I look forward to his help in my future visits to his lovely country! "

To be shown around by a local resident is the perfect way to see locations which visitors may not discover on their own or wouldn't have access to. Our 3 day visit o Marrakech was tightly packed and a guide was needed.Youssef is mentioned often on Tripadvisor as THE guide to book. We e mailed Youssef for availability and he responded within 24 hours. He was clear about his fee and time booked , and answered a couple of questions. We were confident about all arrangements made.Youssef collected us in a car from the Pullman Resort at the time agreed. He gave us the benefit of his wide knowledge of Marrakech places, people, politics, Monarchy and more and our questions were answered in perfect English. We were taken to a rooftop restaurant at midday. It was a place we would never have found left to our own devices. Unfortunately Youssef did not join us as it was Ramadam. His driver with an air conditioned 4x4 confidently negotiated the narrow streets in the Medina Old Town, without a problem and was waiting for us after we had seen each attraction. This was very welcome as the temperature was 34deg C plus. I also find walking distances exhausting and Youssef regularly asked was I ok.We would recommend this likeable man as an excellent tour guide. Don't delay to contact him as he is a very busy man. See my photos for his details."

We were on vacation and Marrakech does not have wifi in that many places, how were we supposed respond in such a short time frame? Youssef had the name of the riad we were staying, if he was so concerned, why didn't he call? Of course, he was more than happy to reschedule with us a couple days later.Terribly irresponsible behavior. Wasting much of our time before and after the trip. There are plenty of tour guides in the area. You can find a good one for less money through your riad or hotel."

He speaks several languages fluently and helped provide a lot of colorful background to our trip. He and his driver were always on-time for pick ups. All around, a great trip...we will plan a longer stay next time.One thing to note is before you leave for your guided tour, make sure to ask for an estimate of how much to bring to pay entrance fees as many of the sites don't accept credit cards and I found myself hunting an ATM."

I am so glad we did as not only did he provide excellent tours of the many sites and Medina, but he was incredibly helpful in making other arrangements for us as well. More on that in a minute. On the day of our tour Youseff met us on time at our Riad and took us through the Medina explaining the history of the city as well as educating us on larger cultural dynamics of Morocco. His historic and contemporary knowledge of Marrakech and Morocco was thorough and enlightening. He is well known throughout the Medina and you will not be bothered by anyone while in his company. He had his own driver who would whisk us to our next location with great efficiency. When our tour was over he would leave us at a restaurant I had chosen and made sure to give us very good directions back to our Riad. Having spent the morning together he had learned of some of our other plans for our visit and offered to help arrange transportation for us to the restaurants and bars we were planning on visiting. This relieved us of the need to engage in the horrible haggling and rip-off schemes of the local taxi drivers. Sure we paid a bit more to get around ($10 each way vs. $5) but our drivers had nice cars and would call ahead to our Riad so we were met and never go lost. So worth it. Youseff is a great tour guide and a good person to know during your visit to Marrakech and I recommend him thoroughly."

He was very patient with us (we take a ton of photos) and made sure to take us to the best places for the particular items we wanted to buy. I told him walking with him in the souks is like walking with the godfather because you can walk in peace, none of the shop owners hassle you with him around. It was worth the money just for that, but the tour was better than I could have hoped for and he is a very smart and friendly delight. We were so pleased, we couldn't say no when he asked if he could help arrange a trip to the Atlas Mountains for today, and that was great too!"

They came to our hotel to arrange the tour, not telling us it was private until the last minute. He wouldn't stop for us to take photos, he wouldn't stop for me to buy anything unless it was at very expensive 'shops' in the medina that 'he' chose and where I didn't want to be. The idea of 'tours', is not pressure to buy, take note please..... Seeing the rug being hand made was nice, but the next half hour being shown rugs and totally ignored that we 'didn't want' to buy one was annoying! This was a main theme! Reminiscent of the tuk tuk tours from hell in Thailand where they take you where THEY want you to go and refuse to go where YOU wish.... Being told to tip everyone and having to pay for the Jardin Majorelle, when we'd paid 75 euros for the tour, each! Was on the nose... The fish in the muddy damn, ho hum, not a tourist Mecca. Trying to convince me to buy expensive argan oil, when you find a local food shop and buy it very reasonablely priced .... Too much time where we didn't want to be, waiting at the exits for him for far too long, then rushed through the areas we found of interest. I wouldn't recommend this. We also noted other guides doing the exact same thing, other people being led to where they didn't wish to be and their guides refusing to stop when asked. We shouldn't have to risk getting lost when stopping to take a photo because the tour guide won't stop for you! We saw the palace, but far too much detail. Waiting for the car in the heat when finished wasn't pleasant at some sites either... It didn't wait most times. The lunch was the one standout, FANTASTIC, total luxury, but it was tinged by the deep sadness I felt on seeing the way the poor and the animals are mistreated while being walked through. Beggars selling discarded shoes, skeletal humans, almost right outside this amazing Persian restaurant, like being inside a palace itself.... The musicians inside exotic, mountain people in traditional costume, the music eerie and the type of foreign we're here to see.... the food fantastic the atmosphere so plush, then starving people outside, I wanted to invite them in.... This tour was total frustration...."

It was overpriced and clearly catered to tourists; that being said, it was a lovely location and view, and I had the best kefta and harira of my entire trip here, so I had no regrets. Our afternoon consisted of exploring the souks and the Ben Youssef school. Youssef even bought us fresh-squeezed juice and lima beans to snack on. He helped us barter for items. I told him I wanted to buy saffron, and he bought be to a trusted shop (on request). He was incredibly knowledgeable, well-educated, and organized, yet flexible. Our trip would not have been the same without Youssef. Although his tour may be a little more expensive than some others out there, I can't be clear enough that spending a little extra is priceless.

Walking around the souks was so enjoyable as he guided us around, I could really see the welcoming nature of Islam. I thoroughly enjoyed the carpet demonstration and the confidence he gave me in not needing to feel pressure to buy. It was sincerely demonstrations of the products and the shopkeeper lifestyle.

But before he left us that evening at the hotel, we made plans for the next whole day of our private tour.We saw the Jayden Garden first to avoid the crowd. He walked us around and gave us the history - Absolutely beautiful, must-see place. He filled our minds with the culture and history of every place he took us. Plus he was careful to slow the pace for my mother, who was pooping out. We lunched at a wonderful restaurant before taking my mother back to the hotel to rest.After that my sister and I hit the shopping area of the medina with Yousseff carrying our bags. We told him what we where looking for and he guided us there, thwarted off any unwelcome salesmen, and taught us how to haggle. Loads of fun. He was always concerned with our comfort and satisfaction.When our day was done, he arranged for his driver to take us to dinner that last evening, and the next day to the airport.He is a wonderful guide and host.

There ended up being another couple that joined the tour but it didn't bother us as we split the cost between 5 instead of 3.Youssef was very accommodating, patient and forthcoming with information. He highlighted plenty of things that we would've walked past otherwise. There was a good mix of history, religion, architecture, food and culture. I would definitely recommend this tour."

We did a full day private tour and he had a driver that took us from place to place. He and the driver had everything timed perfectly and we were picked up as soon as we finished at one site and dropped off right at the entrance to the next one. He patiently answered our many questions about Marrakech, Islam and Moroccan history and culture. We saw gardens, palaces, mosques and souks and were given a historical and current day perspective. The tour of the souks included a behind the scenes look at the many artisans at work and there was never any pressure to buy anything. He was a wonderful ambassador for his city and we enjoyed spending the day with him."

I described what I was interested in seeing and he recommended an itinerary that was different and better than what I had suggested. I was going to be in Marrakech for a week with my husband and was worried that a guide would try to bring me to stores and restaurants which I had no interest in going to see. Much to my surprise Youssef turned out to be the perfect guide. He brought his terrific driver Ismail and a comfortable 4x4 and he took us on a wonderful tour of Marrakesh. he was extremely knowledgeable personable interesting and his English was excellent. He did not once suggest a restaurant or gift shop knowing that I was not interested. He really made my trip very special."

We are so glad we did as Yossef was such an excellent and knowledgeable guide for this city. The first morning we saw some of the major sights in the medina area where we are fortunate enough to be staying. The second morning we looked at more of the social aspects of the city, like a local bakery, furnace for a Hammam, and a Koranic school. Yossef was always friendly with the residents of the area and well liked by passers by. I would strongly recommend starting with Yossef to get yourself oriented to this amazing city"

In Marrakech, he picked us up at 9AM at our hotel. He had a car and driver.

I've traveled quite extensively, usually alone and have never done a tour. With Youssef I quickly understood the value of a good guide as I saw and learned so much I would have otherwise missed. Youssef tailored the time to my requests, which seems obvious for a private tour but after another experience with a guide in Fes and talking to other travelers- this doesn't always happen. Youssef was excellent with answering my questions and providing information to help me orientate in Morocco, which is exactly what I wanted. Had I tried waking around by myself I would have missed seeing and learning so much. Youssef helped me appreciate Marrakesh and I thoroughly enjoyed the half day we spent together. I would use Youssef again and have already recommended him to friends. He is an excellent choice for a guide in Marrakesh!"

We booked with Youssef very last minute, and he was the only guide out of 6 that was available to take us around for a half day in the souks/medina, which I was very thankful for. He was very responsive to emails and got back to me right away. Unfortunately, he had some family problems the morning we were supposed to meet, and we waited at our hostel 30 minutes before we could finally get ahold of him. Thankfully, he sent another guide to meet us and take us around for the day. We later spoke and he was very apologetic. (Emergencies do come up.) The guide was very helpful and showed us around, while giving us lots of historical and cultural information about the area. I wish he would've taught us a bit more, but maybe we should've asked some more questions, as well. Be prepared for extra entrance fees at Ben Youseff, another museum, and the music playing place, which are not included. We saw a little bit of everything (architecture, traditional music, hamman heating area, spices/argan oil place, dyes and coloring of fabrics, wood carving), but in the souks, it seemed like he just brought us to the places he had friends and tried to get us to shop there--- whom were disappointed when we didn't buy. My husband felt that we could\u2019ve used the 55 euro a much better way, but I thought it was a nice activity for our first day in Marrakech and a good introduction to the city."

We covered many of the districts in the medina with Yousseff making stops to tell us facts and teaching us the ways of the city.He took us behind the scenes that we and every other tourist would have just walked by such as Community ovens, hammam workers quarters and where the leather is dyed, metal work is crafted and former Muslim schools.Youssef was always ensuring that we were kept interested and he knew EVERYONE which was because he was a very likeable guy.He finished the Tour at Jemma El Fna squaew and told us the directions to our riad which were spot on.I assure you he is veru much needed."

We've all travelled a lot and felt confident going to a new place, but still decided to take the advice, which is how we spent a day with Youssef in Marrakech, and it was a great choice! We had wandered a bit by ourselves the afternoon before, which is definitely doable, but a bit overwhelming. When Youssef came, we had a general idea of what we wanted to see, but nothing terribly specific, so he took us on a great all-day tour. We made lots of stops at small museums (probably spent about $20 in admission per person to go to 7 \"museums\" in total throughout the day- including palaces, old Koranic schools, royal cemetery, Yves St. Laurent Garden, etc.- a great deal and definitely worth doing) which was great. Youssef knew about everywhere we went, came in with us, and gave really interesting information everywhere we went. Without him, we would have gone in (though on our own, it is unlikely we would have ever found these places) and gone out, without a good idea of what we had seen. Youssef gave great insight into the history of all the places we went, including how that relates to the cultural and religious fabric of today's Morocco. We had a few specific requests of things we wanted to do or buy and he helped us with those as well. He brought us to a lot of everyday places that describe Marrakech life (the communal bakeries where people bake their bread, where the local hamam (bath) is heated). And he really seems to know everyone in Marrakech. Wherever we went, everyone knew Youssef. Youssef knew his way around the city and easily brought us all around the city and back to our hotel that night. Youssef was incredibly nice, and interesting to talk and listen to. He made a fantastic day in Marrakech- not to be missed!!"

I asked Youseff if he can arrange airport transfers, camel ride, and Marrakech tour. He quoted me a very reasonable price(which made me more impressed). It was hassle free right from the airport. He arranged a transfer which was already waiting for us at the airport. The driver was very professional and such a nice guy. Then we met Youseff. He is very informative, professional, and has a good sense of humor. We went straight to Palmeira for the camel ride. This was a once in a lifetime experience! Abdul, the camel tour guide was great as well. Very happy man to show us around and introduce us to his camels. After the camel ride, we had lunch. Then started the Marrakech tour of the palace, then souks. I wish we had more time to do and see other places in the country. We were very impressed with the city. People are very happy and its a clean city. I am definitely going back to Morocco sooner or later and stay longer and go to other cities, and hopefully Sahara desert. P.S. Youseff arranged transfers and camel rides therefore we only paid one fee to him but please please please do TIP the driver and the camel ride guides as well. 50dirham is less then 5gbp/5usd. They are very nice people. You can skip 1 starbucks coffee and give that money to them. They are very hardworking and very pleased to show their beautiful country. Another thing I liked about Youseff is that he would give money to beggars. Just showed me how personable he is."

We had a great half day tour whereby he took me to some great shops and also a beautiful old school in the heart of the Medina. Youssef also took a taxi with me to my hotel at the end of the tour. He was informative and interesting."

We had a fantastic day learning lots of things about Marakesh and Morocco, everything is presented with such enthusiasm and passion that you never get that feeling where you just don't want to hear anymore! We visited the Saadian Tombs and Bahia Palace. At the end of our tour we were shown a really nice place to eat lunch and had a reserved table organized for us on the rooftop!Ps Youssef speaks perfect English!"

Not only did it provide us with an orientation tour but showed us sights we would not have found on our own (e.g. the man stoking the boiler for the public hammam!) AND gave us an overview of Morrocan history, culture and life in the 21st century! Youssef is a great companion - charming, courteous, with a sense of humour and ever willing to answer all and any questions. We can thoroughly recommend taking a half days tour of the Medina and Youssef is an outstanding guide!"

Although Youssef was completely booked, he went out of his way to make sure we could still have a guide to tour Marrakech. Our guide, Simo, was very engaging and a very honest tour guide. In fact, when I paid him, I gave him 2000 dirhams, and rather than just keeping it, he told me that his price was only 1000 and gave me back the extra! I tipped him for his great work. I definitely recommend Youssef and especially his colleague, Simo."

            "review": "Marrakech day tour by Kharroubi Youssef. You may be thinking about trying the rest of the tour guides in morocco, but do yourself a favor and go with the BEST. I do mean Youssef. I had about Youssef on trip advisor and after reading many glowing reviews I emailed him directly and he confirmed with us a desired date and time for our tour. Granted our booking was about 2mo in advance. one week before our trip I refreshed my tour with Youssef and he was prompt to reply and confirm. The night before our tour Youssef called our Riad and confirmed that we would meet in the lobby at 9AM. This was great to know he took the initiative to call the night before and not have us wondering if he would show up the morning of without contact the day prior. Way to go Youssef. After he picked us up at our Riad lobby he went through the day's itinerary. In the itinerary he did not mention the tanneries and so I asked if we could go there as part of the trip. He hesitated a bit stating that there were many many pushy locals there, but now in retrospect there are pushy locals everywhere. He was able to take us to the tanneries for a brief moment. Overall Youssef was friendly, polite, knowledgeable, and had the timing right. he knew where to go first and avoid the line of other tourists that would inevitable show up right after us. If you are looking for a guide through your Morocco experience do not hesitate and contact Youssef. I must say his fame is growing and there may be a time when it may be hard to book with Youssef. Get your dates in as soon as possible, sit back and relax. Sincerely,DanielOH, price, about $100 US for a full day trip. This did not include tickets to local attractions or lunch. Youssef does not join you for lunch, I have had guides in other countries that will sit with you during lunch and you would end up paying for their meal. I like that Youssef gives you space with your family during lunch so you can speak freely and relax."

I did a little research and Youssef Kharroub came up trumps, not one bad review. We booked the Souks and Medina Tour in Marrakech - (1/2 Day Tour). Youssef was very punctual at meeting at us at our Riad and he greeted us with a big warm smile ;0) Bahia Palace was our first port of call (entry fee 10Dh each) Old Boarding School (again small fee for entry) Youssef has boundless information on the history of these places and his love and passion flows out so you find yourself feeding off his energy. You can tell he is a well respected man and is greeted by many folk along the tour, but this does not detract from his attention to detail. Youssef literally opens doors to places that you would never have the opportunity to visit. It's a world that at times can be very humbling. It is a good idea to take a little small change with you, so you can show your appreciation to certain folk when needed. I can't fault this Tour at all, it was perfect and Youssef is such a great guy too. I promise you wont be disappointed."

We booked a 1 day private tour with him and he took us to all the important sites in the city center and made the Medina so much more manageable for us tourists. The tour can be done on foot, but we highly recommend paying the extra 300 moroccan dirhram for the private car that Youssef arranges. We couldn't imagine having to figure out everything to do and see in the Medina without him."

He will give you an insight into the culture, daily life and history of the Moroccan people and Marrakech without once being boring. A day spent with Youssef is the best value you will find in Marrakech - better than any deal in the souks. We had an air conditioned mini van at our service so getting to the various sites was easy. Youssef will answer all and any of your questions with detail and candour. He left us for lunch at a very nice restaurant which wasn't expensive - much appreciated. After lunch we visited a carpet cooperative which was educational, but be wary, the education also came with a ver savvy sales pitch. We said we would return to look at the carpets again the next day, and did intend to, but time did not permit. At the end of our tour I relished I had left a bag in the minivan, but Youssef called the driver and patiently waited with us until he returned. Such a humble and warm hearted man. Many thanks Youssef!"

We had an excellent tour around the inner areas of the souks and saw many things we would never have seen under our own steam. He was very informative and never gave the hard sell on any shop, restaurant or anything whatsoever. Good fun and interesting. He speaks many languages and his English was perfect. We recommended him to a group of Americans and Brits who also took his tour and were very complimentary. It really helps to do this early because it provides some confidence moving around Marrakech and how to handle certain situations. Youssef is happy to provide any advise he can to make your stay more enjoyable. We also took a tour to the waterfalls, Youssef sorted that with a phone call and at a price much better than others we had been quoted. His tour was good value. Top marks."

Nevertheless our guide took us to places we would probably never have found and gave us a feel for how Moroccans live in the medina (the communal bakery for instance where people take their bread to bake and then sell it on the street). Youssef was not able to do our tour but his friend hassan met us at our riad and was more like a kindly uncle as he led us through the souks, waiting patiently outside as one or other of us dived into shops in the souk. He spoke good English so communication was not a problem.It was lovely having a personal tour for just the four of us (mum and daughters in their twenties) and it was well worth the money.

He should be first! Speaks great English and knows so much about the city and the history.

First we met at the square then he took us round the town showing us everything from where they bake bread underground to the old schools and mosques. Everyone seems to know him and hustlers leave you alone. He even gave beggers money as we were going round and not to even show off, one was a very quick backhanded gesture to an old lady. If you are looking for a tour we recommend youssef for sure!! Great value for money and we are even booking a trip through him to go to the waterfalls as it was half the cost we found it for and has a camel ride too!I wish you all the best in the future Youssef and thank you for showing us round"

He is polite, easy to talk to and very knowledgeable. We thoroughly enjoyed our day and would recommend hiring Youssef as a guide."

He had a van arranged at distant points to move us around and save our energy. He brought us to all of the major attractions and moved us efficiently to avoid crowds. He was full of insight and observations on the Moroccan culture. Best of all was the pride he clearly held for his country and people. He also coordinated another driver and guide to take us on an excursion out of the city which was also of high quality.We highly recommend his services."

Like many of the other reviewers, we selected Youssef based on the high ratings and effusive praise he consistently received. We were not disappointed.Youssef was overall the most professional (in all the positive connotations of the word) of the several tour guides we hired throughout our 8-day vacation in Morocco. His flawless English combined with his professor-like knowledge of Morocco's history/culture/society/day-to-day life resulted in the most comprehensive, informative and enjoyable tour we experienced. Additionally, he was always very responsive via email leading up to our tour and was exactly punctual for our tour (both at the beginning and the end). We highly recommend Youssef!"

We met him in the medina just outside Cafe de France. We had booked a full day tour with him to see all the major sights. From the very beginning, Youssef was keen to inform us about the history, culture and traditions of Marrakech. He was full of local knowledge, enthusiasm and humour and customised the tour keeping our interests in mind. You felt like you were sightseeing with a friend rather than with a tour guide. He made us feel completely at ease and gave us lots of information including trivia, which was fabulous for our inquisitive minds. We saw all the main sights as listed in his website including a few more, which was a real bonus. We were keen to buy a lamp for a souvenir, and he recommended a lovely little place which had some really lovely unique artisan lamps. Youssef also went out of the way and gave us his taxi contact (Ismail) should we need cab. Thanks Youssef!"

We booked Youssef due to the TA reviews and everything worked out perfectly except Youssef had to cancel at the last minute for personal reasons but he magically produced Mohamed out of the blue and we had a great day all round.Mohamed's knowledge of the medina (he seemed to know everyone on the street!), history, culture and general knowledge meant he answered all of our questions and opened up a new world to us.He did start by asking if we liked walking (3 times) as it was a long day and we did traverse a lot of streets and places but at the end we ended up at Kozybar near the Jewish quarter for a very relaxing finish.We recommend doing this tour, we did it after we got lost in the souks, but before or after it gives you a great all round experience and also develops a sense of the Medina and its mysteries.Great trip."

With Youssef you don't have to worry about searching for places that are hidden behind souks or navigating in a city with practically no street signs. We booked a full day tour (10:00-16:00) in late February.PROS:- You'll see places you wouldn't know to look for: how a traditional hammam is heated, \"the cheapest accommodation in Marrakech\", public oven, etc.- Youssef knows so much about local life, culture, politics, etc. You can ask anything and I bet Youssef is able to give you a thorough answer. - Within few hours you'll see most important sights there are to be seen. It will take much, much longer to visit (and find) them by yourself. TIPS:- Bring along some money for the entrance fees. We visited 4 places with tickets, in total ~150 dhs per person. - Also take some small change (5/10/20 dhs coins/bills) to give as a thank you to people Youssef introduces you to at more hidden \"attractions\". - Book a full day tour and don't worry about going through places that you wouldn't see during a half day tour. It is so much easier and more interesting with Youssef."

One thing that became clear very quickly was... this guy knows everyone! It was great to see so many locals exchanging pleasantries with him, and this led to a feeling that we were seeing a side of Marrakech that might not be seen on the tours with larger companies.As a bit of a side note, I had a small accident on the trip (my own fault) in which I cut my arm on some questionable metal. Youssef rushed me straight into a stall in the souks where one of his many friends cleaned and dressed the cut instantly, all free of charge.Honestly can't recommend Youssef's tour highly enough and, if you're reading this, thanks again!"

It was an amazing experience, friends had told us that it was a dangerous city but not at all, in the contrary it was quite save, very friendly people and helpful. Of course they need to make a living so they will try to sell everything to you but that is part of the experience. I had contacted a guided tours company form the states before going there and after many questions I asked, they offered to go to my hotel upon my arrival to explain their services. The next morning Radouane (from the tour company) showed up at our hotel and from there on everything was just amazing. He took us to tour to the Medina, the falls, the dessert and I can not say one thing that we did not enjoy. They included some of the meals too. Radouane was just great, very knowledgeable, entertaining, professional, polite and always on time. He has the best spots to go, very quite and not like those group tours that you lways feel in a rush. Let's just say that I left adding him to my facebook and whatsapp and I don't do that at all. He became our friend.  We have been to Cancun, Virgin Islands, New York, Chicago, LA and I can say that Marrakech is among the top visits I have been to. Mainly thanks to Radouane and his team. You can find them at visitasguiadasdemarrakech.com. You will not regret paying every penny or euro or pound when you go out with them. JUST AMAZING. Thank you Radouane! Pasamos Navidad en Marrakech-Marruecos. Fue una experiencia espectacular. Muchos amigos dijeron que era una ciudad un poco peligrosa pero no lo es en lo absoluto. Es muy trankilo y la gente es muy educada y tranquila, solo quieren venderte sus productos pero eso es parte del encanto que tiene la ciudad. Los paisajes son espectaculares y gracias a Radouane y su compania de visitas guiadas pudimops conocer y disfrutar sitios espectaculares. Raduane (el guia de la compania) fue exelente, tiene mucho conocimiento, es divertido, muy amable y sobre todo puntual. Puedo decir que nos fuimos de Marrakech dejando un amigo que espero visitemos de nuevo muy pronto. Los lugares donde nos yevo vale cada centavo y cada minuto. Los recomiendo 100%.

My mother and I took a one day tour around Marrakech with Youssef- I had read the wonderful reviews on TripAdvisor, and we were not disappointed.Youssef is a wonderful guide- knowledgeable, well spoken, able to judge what his guests are looking for, and careful in where he takes you. We had arranged everything before we arrived in Marrakech, and I was certainly pleased that we had.Youssef seems to know everybody around town- at times it felt like we were accompanying a city-celebrity. It was quite fun, watching Youssef greet everyone- truly 'where everybody knows your name'Youssef didn't take us to any shops, didn't push us to buy anything, showed us the hidden parts of Marrakech and made sure that at no point did we feel tired or rushed or as if he was just ticking a box. He took us to the Majorelle gardens, the Bahia palace, the Medressa and also into the inner souks of Marrakech, as well as showing us where Tanjia were being made as wellAt the sites, he gave us a good explanation, then allowed us time to explore on our own- we didn't feel rushed and certainly saw everything we wanted to (and more)Youssef is a true gentleman, and a knowledgeable and trustworthy guide. His English is more than fluent, and I am sure his Japanese is of a similar quality. I can certainly recommend him as a guide round Marrakech(just a note, make sure you have small change as well as Youssef's fee- to pay for the taxis and all the site entrance fees)"

He showed us a good spot to catch a taxi away from the main square to avoid being ripped off and we throughly followed that advice in the next 2 days we were in Marrakesh. Youssef showed us the YSL garden, the Bahia palace and the souks. He did not try to take us to shops and do hard sells like many guides do and this is what makes him the better guide. He helped us with directions around the Medina and was keen to show us hidden sides of the Medina such as the place where the public hammam is heated but it was a Friday afternoon and the place was already closed for the day but anyways we really appreciated his efforts. He was very kind to buy us a moroccan crepe which was delicious and we enjoyed a friendly conversation at the end of the day sipping mint tea. We enjoyed learning about his religion and culture.We would def use him again and highly reccommend him."

He met us outside our hotel and showed us around in the Old Medina. He took us to the small hidden places we would not have found ourselves and told us everything about the life and culture of Marrakech. It was very interesting and he was a great storyteller! He also gave us a lot of tips about everything from things to see and the best places to eat. The second day we wanted to see some more of Marrakech outside the Old Medina, and because Youssef was busy that day, he arrange a car with his college. This we decided the day before, so they were very flexible. The car picked us up at hotel in the morning and the driver took us to Majorelle Garden, the view from H\u00f4tel La Renaissance, a public park and we got to see and take pictures of camels. A lot of fun!We highly recommend Youssef as a guide the first day. It gives you the great overview of Marrakech and knowledge about the culture. The tips you get are also a bonus! A 100 % worth the money!"

After an initial misunderstanding of where to meet, Youssef came to our Riad and met me and my daughter to take us on a wonderful walk through the medina. We were staying at a Riad by one of the gates in the wall so were a good 20 minute walk from Jamaa el Fna. However, this provided a good opportunity for us to wander through many of the less tourist-trodden areas of the medina to give us a taste of traditional, authentic Marrakech. Youssef is, as others have said, a knowledgable guide who maintains a commentary for pretty much the whole three hours or so. He provides you with just enough historical context of the people who inhabit both Marrakech and the surrounding Atlas Mountains, offering some insight into Berber culture and traditions. What was particularly good about this tour is that Youssef took us to places like the back of a hammam to show us how they heat it, and into the local bakers, where people take their bread to be baked. In many respects, it seems like life has changed little for hundreds of years - apart form the odd TV set of course!Youssef is clearly very proud of his city and culture and this comes across delightfully. He also appears to know a lot of people so there are brief waves, smiles and chats with locals along the way. He took us to Madrasa Ben Youssef, which is well worth dipping into for a quiet half hour, and told us about the role of the former Koranic school, and then on to the souks. Here, Youssef was especially good, as he helped us to orientate ourselves (which proved very useful on later visits) and showed us what was sold and where. Youssef will not encourage you to buy and does not take you to his friend's/brother's/uncle's shop, so there is never any pressure, which is a relief. This is a well worthwhile activity. Youssef is a gracious and interesting guide and I thoroughly recommend his tour."

After reading the reviews on Trip Adviser we picked Youssef as our personal tour guide for 2 half day trips to show us the real Marrakech Yossef didn't disappoint!! Both the guide of the Madina and Souks and the tour of the Palaces and Monuments were fantastic. We felt like we had really got to see the real Marrakech, something you simply couldn't achieve on your own. Youseef was so knowledgable and his love for Marrakech was really lovely to experience! It has made us want to visit and explore Marrakech again. If you are looking for a tour guide I would trust the reviews here and book Youssef as you won't be disappointed."

He met us at the riad and gave us such a wonderful tour of the old medina and Gueliz. Youssef hit on most of the highlights of the city and made our tour a memorable one . During the visit , Kharroubi not only pointed out information about the monuments, and other history related items, but provided comments about shopping and restaurants. We should have taken better notes or pictures of those places so we could have found them easier the next day.The city , the souq and the maze are so overwhelming that I don't think that we would have had any idea of what to see in Marrakech without taking this private tour . our short visit to Marrakech was both rewarding and satisfying. The fee charged was very reasonable for the outstanding value we received.. In sum--Kharroubi tours well exceeded all our expectations."

He asked us what our interests were and gave a tour accordingly.He is courteous, talkative (speaks excellent English!!) . He was also very accommodating and responsive in terms of recommending different sights to see during our tour .Youssef was so knowledgable and we learned so many interesting facts and history about Marrakech. We appreciated having him take us around and enable us to see so much in one day.In addition to the tour, we did 2days excursion to OURIKA and ESSAOUIRA. He helped find us transportation to-from and we really like it .The whole trip was awesome and enjoyable! Most importantly, he was super interesting guide I ever seen.If Youssef is not available to meet your schedule contact him anyway as he will know someone who he can recommend to make your time memorable."

Lunch arranged by Youssef on the rooftop in the City was great - authentic Morrocan spread and reasonably-priced!We also took the tour of Ourika Valley and Youssef arranged for a competent English - speaking guide and driver, Ismail, who brought us to see the native Berber way of life.

I started emailing with one guide, and it was a pain in the neck - he wanted all 18 of us in one group (had been advised this would be nearly impossible in the souks), prices kept fluctuating etc. So I then emailed Youssef and everything went smoothly from then on.He arranged for himself and two other guides to be available for a fixed price for 1 1/2 days. I had said that we would be at our riad at 2pm, but passport control at the airport took over 2 hours, so we didn't get there until after 3. I was worried that Youssef would have left, but he hadn't. He waited for us all to get ourselves sorted, and then we had a pleasant afternoon walking to the main square and a bit around the markets. Beware of being short changed (not by Youssef), but we went to a terrace caf\u00e9 for mint tea and I gave a 200 Dirham note and got only about 35 back - so my drink cost nearly \u00a315! But my fault for being tired and distracted.The next day we again had our three guides, and rather than just doing a walking tour Youssef gave us the option of driving to the various destinations (extra cost of 60Euro for the day for the vehicle for 6 people), which we took. Again he was very good with his descriptions of places, pointing things out that we might otherwise have missed.All in all, very pleased with him."

I had some misgivings as I was booking based on Youssef's reviews, but I needn't have worried. Abdullah arrived promptly at 9.30am at our hotel, and took us on the experience of a lifetime. He showed us all the normal tourist attractions including a few things off the beaten track. His obvious passion for history and his culture, his eloquence, and clear guidance every step of the way turned this from a box ticking exercise (\"Yup, that's Marrakech done!\") to an amazing heartfelt experience. He was invaluable when it came to bargaining in the souks, and he advised us on where we needed to steer clear of. We did later meet Youssef at a cafe later, and his desire to ensure that we'd had a nice time was an extra touch that rounded off the day nicely. Please do not hesitate or look further: see Marrakech through the eyes of people who obviously love their city. You'll be glad you did."

He was very knowledgeable, super friendly, and professional. The private tour meant our experience was intimate and we had all his attention. We asked him plenty of questions, and he was definitely well-informed and able to answer with great detail. I would recommend skipping the apothecary though."

He is a thoughtful, deeply committed professional who is passionate about Moroccan culture, tradition, history, and food. I recently spent a day with Youssef in the medina of Marrakech and was immediately struck by his passion for the beauty of Islamic tradition, Arab art, architecture and history. He took me to the Bahia Palace, the Saaidian Tombs, the Jewish Quarter, among other sites during my visit to medina. He gave such a wonderful, almost poetic explanation of every piece of culture we viewed together. I found him engaging, very pleasant and almost like a long lost brother! I can't imagine there are better guides than Youssef and I wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone who would like to spend the day with an intelligent, passionate guide. That's Yousseful Kharroubi! Excellent guide, professional and aboveall, a great human being!"

Googling brought us to Tripadvisor, where reviews suggested Youssef was excellent. We Emailed Youssef on the Monday evening and received an immediate response. We agreed to meet outside the Police station the following afternoon. Youssef was both terrifically friendly and professional about his role. His narration whilst walking was rich in history and at the same time humourous. Youssef introduced us to areas which we would never have found, let alone walked through e.g the rear workings of the Souk. A thoroughly entertaining and enlightening afternoon. Many many thanks Youssef."

He had no problems adding places I was interested in visiting to his already full itinerary. Then we met at the hotel for the first time , he organised a minibus for the 6 of us so we weren't crammed into a car like some tour people tend to do to save money. All the costs were discussed upfront and he was very professional.Yousef was born in Marrakesh he is very knowledgeable about the city and all its sites. He is very passionate when he talks about Marrakesh and he speaks good English. He also told us he speaks fluent Arabic, Japanese and french. He was even happy to organize another day trip and excursions outside the city and has many contacts with tours and transport services. He answered all our questions and we never felt rushed.He showed us the back streets of Marrakesh and the alleyways that lead to back of ham-mams and the sites that you don't see as a tourist. He navigated the busy streets with ease and got us to all the sites in time. Overall I recommend Yousef without any reservations , He is possibly one of the best guides in Marrakech..."

During the afternoon we saw parts of the souks we would never have found without Youssef and really opened our eyes to what was available and how it is all really made locally. While in the Souks we also visited Ben Youssef Medersa, again something we just never would of seen without Youssef.His knowledge of Marrakech, and the history surrounding Morocco was amazing.If your in Marrakech, contact him and arrange something, we only organised it a couple of days before, well worth the money, far better value than the holiday company tours."

He is very flexible and will adjust the tour to your needs. Actually we only called him 1 day in advance but he responded quickly and picked us up in our Riad the morning after. Youssef knows the history of Marrakech and his country very well and will take his time to explain anything about it or about the culture that comes along with it. His beliefs differed in some respects to ours (he supports a strong monarchy and an islamic education for example) but that wasn't necessarily a problem. In the end we obviously just wanted to understand the country better and that worked out fine. Actually Youssef was a great guide since we could openly share different ideas (he was also interested in our ideas and habits) without necessarily having to decide which one is better than the other.Last but not least, this guide will not take you to all kind of different shops where you will feel obliged to buy something (for a price which will be to high)."

Within 3 hours of arriving at Marrakesh airport Youssef was taking us around the medina and souks. He gave us a perfect introduction to the history, customs, diversity of Marrakesh and its context within the wider culture of Morocco - with good grace, charm and humour. Most importantly he gave us the confidence to explore Marrakesh by giving us several very relevant tips for newcomers. We had read that some guides lead clients into situations where they were expected to buy goods. At no time were we exposed to this in any way - It was not what Youssef was about. We met Youssef again later in our stay and he happily adjusted the program he had planned to accommodate our requirements. During both tours we felt very safe, that we had seen things we would not have found for ourselves, and learnt an incredible amount."

His rates, by the way, are a lot more reasonable than some of his competitors. He collected us from our hotel the first morning, with a plan to visit the main sights in a sequence to avoid the crowds. We used a taxi several times, Youssef negotiated the rate, (and we thus learnt the going rate for a journey, very useful as in our entire week there we never saw a taxi with a meter).Anyway, he really smoothed the path for us, stopping traffic so we could cross the road safely. Marrakech can be a trying experience for first timers, but no such worries for us, as we glided along serenely in Youssef' wake, pitying other tourists struggling with their maps, having to ask directions etc. However, when the experience was just there to enjoy, i.e. Jardins Majorelle, and later lunch we had some time to ourselves. He took us around the souks in the afternoon, explaining their evolution and historical significance. There was no shopping involved or any attempt to introduce us to shopowners.Youssef proved a first rate guide, very knowledgeable about the history, architecture and cultural background of his city, but also a very warm and engaging character with a great sense of English. His English is fluent, and I believe he speaks other European languages too.We have taken a number of private/small group tours over the years and this is way up among the best."

As it was our first time and as we were only in Marrakech for 4 days, we wanted to make the most of our time and thought getting a guide would be the best thing to do. He emailed back daily in regards to all my questions and turned up promptly on the Friday morning for our \u2018Souks and Medina half day tour\u2019. Youssef greeted us and asked what we wanted to do that day. We decided on Le Jardin Marjorelle and he suggested we go to the Bahia palace, before delving into the treasure troves of the medinas! He was full of knowledge and I could tell he clearly loved his country and his job! He spent more time with us than just half a day, as well as organising a driver to pick us up to take us to Le La Palmeraie for camel riding in the evening. Have to say it was incredibly camel riding while the sun was setting! The following day, Youssef had another driver come pick us up for our trip to the Ourika Valley (this was only suggested the day before by Youssef). The driver was late; however Youssef himself came to our hotel to apologise and took us for traditional mint tea. He was unable to accompany us, but his knowledgeable friend/driver took us to the valley and even stopped on the way for a photo opportunity and lunch courtesy of Youssef! A guide was called and took us up the mountains to get to the waterfalls (make sure you bring trainers!). It was beautiful up there and would have to say the highlight of the trip!If you want a tailor made holiday, choose Youssef, he will fill you with knowledge and you will leave wanting to come back again!Thank you so much for making our holiday so memorable Youssef!"

After a few emails we had set a date, time, and place - it was very easy and he is very efficient with communication. We had scheduled to take our half-day tour the day that we arrived. However, our flight was a little late, and it took ages to go through immigration so we contacted him a few hours before our scheduled meet to see if we could change the day because our son (11 months) was very tired. Once again, he replied promptly and said it would be no problem and we arranged for the next morning.We had our tour today and it was wonderful. Youssef is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about Marrakech and it's people. The tour seemed to fly by as we were shown things that we never would have seen if we had just walked around by ourselves.He was very patient with our son and was extremely understanding when we had to stop our tour momentarily to feed him in the middle of the souk - he even managed to get a stool for me to sit on from a lady who was selling bread! One of the many things that made Youssef a first-class guide is that he did not once take us into a shop/s. His tour is purely based on the history and culture of the Medina (and Morocco/Marrakech). Once our tour had finished he showed us to a restaurant that locals use (our request), and arranged a driver from the Medina to our hotel in the Palmarie with a pit-stop at the Majorelle Gardens.What more can I say except that if you want a guide within Marrakech then go with Youssef! You wont be disappointed and you will end up learning a lot more than you think while avoiding being taking from shop to shop just for commission!!"

He proposed the two days visit in marrakech and one day to casablanca, which customized with our schedule and so we gladly accepted it and ultimately we were really happy that we had him as our guide. He spoke english very well and was very patient with us (eleven fussy, chatty, and hard to please ladies!!) . He came on time and accompanied us almost full two days and eventhough he could not accompany us to casablanca, but he organized a mini bus with english speaking driver and made sure that we were taken care of. Our short holiday to marrakech and casablanca were memorable and wonderful thanks to him."

Youssef was booked at very short notice,whilst we were there we called him the evening before. Having realised that with limited time we were going to miss out on getting a good feel for the place and miss some of the things to see. Having read the reviews on this website we called,he was very helpful and luckily could fit us in. Very professional, articulate, courteous and knowledgeable about all aspects of the history, religion and sites. A very pleasant and informative day spent with him. I had a bad foot at the time and it was hard to walk- but this was accommodated for."

He gave us a few available time slots but nothing that fitted with us, so he offered one of his associatates as an alternative.So we booked a morning tour with Jamal. The tour and Jamal were amazing! Nothing will bring the city to life like a tour with either Jamal or Youssef. The understanding of the location, the way they can alter the tour to cover your own personal interests and show you places that you could never find on your own was wonderful. We met Youssef as we were wandering through the streets of Marrakech, he was with another group but stopped to say hello and ensure we were enjoying the tour.I would highly recommend anyone visiting Marrakech to book these guys, if you have never been to the city before it will be unforgettable..."

He is a very pleasant, polite, knowledgeable person and a great tour guide. I planned my Marrakech trip very last minute and contacted Youssef only the day before I landed in Morocco. Since the beginner he has been more than helpful. His driver was on time on the airport and he was very good too. I met Youssef in the main square and from there we started my tour. He was explaining historical, cultural and religious aspects of Moroccan society and it helped me to understand much better such a beautiful country. He also answered any single questions I asked him and gave me some good suggestions of how handle the rest of my days in Marrakech. One thing that I really appreciated in Youssef is that he didn't push me in any of the shops and he gave me the total freedom of looking in the Souk without feeling the pressure of buying from the local stands. I highly recommend him to anyone stepping in Marrakech soil, including solo lady travelers like me."

I personally would skip the herbalist (part of the tour i booked), it is a waste of time - I rather would prefer to spend this time touring with Youssef.

As we are senior citizens, pushing 70 & 80, wishing to make the most of our visit we arranged half a day with Youssef. He is an articulate young family man with a good command of English and who was born in the Medina. We said that we wished to see certain sights & cover the Medina & the Souks, but equally importantly we wished to spend half an hour with him discussing the day to day lives of the people. This we did & it was most informative.We intend to make a further visit to Marrakech taking in the Atlas Mountains & on that visit we will certainly engage Youssef to cover the ground that we missed on our first visit.As also mentioned in a comment by another traveller, Youssef at no time pressurised us to buy anything or to visit a business where he might be entitled to a commission on a sale.We would highly recommend Youssef given his intimate knowledge of Marrakech & his ability to meet the particular & varying demands of any visitor.Jersey, Oct. 2013."

We traveled over 2600 kms and saw some amazing sights that I'm sure not every tourist gets a chance to see. Ali has a vast knowledge of Moroccan customs, culture and history and he never disappointed us! Along the way he saw to all of our individual needs and adapted the tour as we went along. His English is excellent and we all soon became the best of friends. We would all highly recommend this man and his services. We are sure there is no one better!

We arranged a half-day tour with him through our Riad for the first full day of our visit, and I'm so glad we did. Marrakech is likely an unfamiliar environment for many Westerners, but Youssef made us extremely comfortable when showing us around his city. He grew up in Marrakech (yet speaks excellent English), so he knows everyone and everything (my wife and I joked that it was almost like he was the Mayor of the city - as we walked around, everyone seemed to know him). He gave us great tips on how to walk around by ourselves and provided a very good history lesson at the palaces and tombs we visited.One enormous plus about Youssef is that he did NOT try to take us to any shops, as I've heard some guides do (and then you end up the back of a rug shop under a lot of pressure to buy something). We were more than capable of doing shopping on our own, but we wanted a cultural experience from our walking tour, which is exactly what Youssef provided.(Finally, Youssef is a very kind man. One thing I noticed is that he gave money to every poor/blind/homeless person on the street. I think that just goes to show that he has a good heart.)"

My husband and I wanted a private guide and our hotel (Sofitel) wasn't helpful at all. In desperation I read all the reviews on here and found Youssef.we emailed him and got a response the same day, we were so lucky to get some time with him and he was a champ for squeezing us in at short notice. We booked a half day tour with him the following afternoon and as we wernt quite sure of what to see, he planned it all for us which we were happy about. He took us around the souks, the riads, Jemaa al Fna, the old Quranic school and told us little facts about the many temples and attractions. Having grown up in the medina, Youssef knows the labyrinth-like souks like the back of his hand. We could really tell he was liked and respected by all the people there.The next day he booked us a tour to the Ourika Valley and the Atlas Mountains with his driver Ismail who spoke good enough English and was a very nice guy. He knew alot about the Berbers and their way of life and told us alot of facts, we learnt so much. We went to see the famous waterfall and went to a real Berber house and a spice shop where we were shown how the spices are made...there are several tourist traps around here but don't be obliged to buy , just say no. We had lunch in a stream made by Berbers..a delicious chicken tagine and played music by some Berber folk musicians...an experience to remember! Youssef checked up on us various times by phoning the driver which again shows how much he cares about his clients.The following day we went on another half day tour with Youssef...through La Palmeraie, the Saa'dian tombs, Palais de la Bahia and Maison Tiskiwin. Then we had a drink on a restaurant rooftop and watched the bustle of Jemaa El Fna. It was thoroughly enjoyable and Youssef really looked after us. I was sorry for our time with him to end.Youssef is a gentleman, a kind, well educated and genuinely nice guy to be around. He will really look after you and his prices are so reasonable! Don't bother looking anywhere else, Youssef is your man! he taught us so much about his city- he is so proud of Marrakech and the city loves him in return. Thanks Youssef for a great time...dont forget we will return the favour when you make it to London!Regards from Ross and Natasha, UK x"

We went to Agadir for a week and had decided before we went that we would not go to Marrakech as we knew it was a good distance and we wanted to rest. When we arrived, our tour operator was offering a 2 day trip with Sahara Tours and we couldn't resist as we knew that the thing not to miss in Marrakech was night time in Jemaa el Fna square which the overnight would allow.Make no mistake, this is a long trip - but we were thrilled we did it. We set off at 7 a.m. on the coast road to Essouira - a rough windy road over the Atlas mountains and along wonderful surfing beaches - arriving in Essouira around 11. 30 a.m. It was very windy (almost cold!) which is the norm here (hence the surfing). It is a wonderful town and it feels like it is unchanged for hundreds of years - thankfully globalisation has not yet reached here! As we wandered around the town - basically a large souk - local rushed past with their carts full of their business wares and we felt like intruders in a life that has been going on quite well without us for aeons. After lunching on fresh fish, we continued the remaining 170kms to Marrakech, arriving as the sun set. We went by horse drawn carriage to our dinner venue - an amazingly ornate interior where we had delicious tagines and couscous - as much as we wanted and served by friendly staff - after which there was traditional entertainment. We went on from here to Jemaa el Fna where the entertainment was amazing - sights, sounds, smells, colours - and crowds of people. Every form of entertainment was there from snake charmers to the barbary apes, dancers, berber water carriers etc. You need a stern constitution to ensure that you are not taken for a ride and you need to be very firm as you will be plagued if you give in just a little!!The next morning we visited the Majorelle Gardens which were restored by Yves St. Laurent and which are small but beautiful. After that, we returned to the souk - a maze in which it is a delight to get lost - where we were first given a tour and then were left to our own devices for adventures! It was 43C when we were there so the fresh squeezed orange juice in the square was welcome at 40 cent for a large glass.Our overnight hotel was fine - nothing special but perfectly adequate - and had a nice pool where we had a quick swim after a buffet lunch before our trip back to Agadir - this time on the new motorway, arriving at 6.30 p.m. very tired but very happy."

From there we walked to the main square where we stopped for some lunch. Next we where taken through the Souk before heading to the historical Islam school beside the Ben Youssef Mosque and then taken back to our Riad. He made us feel very welcome and comfortable throughout the trip with small stops at different points to highlight things that we would have been clueless about. He has a very pleasant manner and is very knowledgeable which created a great experience and I would recommend using his services. We didn't find out about him until we arrived and I searched for tours on my phone.

He met us at our riad and we explored a garden, school, palace, marketplace, and many other places. Everyone seems to know him. He helped me negotiate a great price on a caftan, and accompanied by him it did not feel intimidating to meet carpet sellers and herbalists...no pressure!

Yousself's command of English is impressive and he easily employs his intelligence to not only inform and guide, but educate as well. He had a mischievous grin when patiently asking us to repeat Arabic names and a firm grasp of how to use humor in his explanations which made the day enjoyable and helped us to learn from him. His knowledge of subject matter is outstanding and he smoothly guided us around many interesting points of interest.The most telling aspect of his character is the respectful manner in which he interacted with other guides, shop-keepers, docents and even waiters. Yousself will always be our man in Marrakesh."

However upon arriving and being taken out with Youssef we felt 100% comfortable and safe.Youssef was a brilliant tour-guide. He was open to whatever we wanted to do during the day, the day is planned around you and what you want to do! Don't hesitate to let Youssef what you wish to do and he will accommodate you very well. I plan on travelling back this summer and will definitely be using Youssef's services again. Beautiful lively city and brilliant tour-guide. Thank you Youssef."

Although I can assure you that Youssef would take you through with absolute order and pleasure and all you will have to do is to ENJOY! Youssef is a professional knowledgeable enthusiastic and inspired but whats more important he takes a big pride in what he does. Needless to say that Youssef has 8 years of experience 5 languages knowledge he works with people all over the world. You wont be thrown in the tour just for a count \"I've been there\" Youssef will design or \"taylor\" the program personally for you !One day tour is definitely not enough but to dive in Marrakesh craziness every day for half a day is absolutely perfect shot to get it all in the best way possible. And dont forget to ask Youssef for a traditional lunch place where you can try a real Moroccan cus cus !My (business) trip to Marrakesh was absolutely amazing and unforgettable !"

He explained so much to us about the history, politics, customs and religion of Morocco. We traversed parts of the Medina that I felt very few people had been to. He helped us bargain with the sellers and kept a very close eye on us. He made sure our purses were close to us and guided us across treacherous streets. He helped me with purchasing rugs, made sure we were fed, made sure we went everywhere we wanted to go and after all this we dubbed him our \"Moroccan husband\" as he made us feel safe and secure. I credit him with giving me the most fun, exotic trip Ive ever had. Thank-you Youssef...you are the best and only guide to have. Your Moroccan wife!"

Being a guide, the driver should have known the closing times and should have informed us accordingly. The Menara Gardens was a big out off...Don't waste your time visiting it. Overall, it was a mixed tour for us on the day, as the dam was a real highlight, but we didnt really visit anything interesting in Marrakech itself.I would like to give 3.5 stars if possible, especially for Youssef, who made arrangements at such a short notice."

During our half day tour with him he was welcomed by everyone we seemed to pass, which made us very relaxed during our tour.We opted for the half day tour and was taken on a trip around the back streets of the Souks, through to the tanneries, as well as the Quranic school. He has a vast knowledge of the city as well as the history of Morocco in general and was able to answer all the questions we had. He also let us into the secret that for great food seek out a 'Tanjia' rather than a 'Tajine' as it is a much slower cooked dish and so more tender and tasty. And he was right!I've never booked a guided tour before as I've often felt you should discover a city yourself. But the half day we spent with Youssef set us up for the rest of our stay in Marrakech and gave us a great grounding in what is often a bewildering and chaotic city."

He took us to a place that sells carpets and to a \"pharmacy\" where they sell spices, oils, etc. Both places definitely catered to tourists; however, to Youssef's credit, he did ask us before he brought us there and we never felt pressure to buy anything. So, if that's not your thing, just tell him you don't want to go and I'm sure he'll happily move on to the next place!

We did exactly that on 2 other occasions right on the square with excellent views of the square and the mountains if you dine up top. You should only be paying \u00a34 to \u00a35 each in total.

The tour was followed by stroll to Koutoubia Mosque and Minaret. Then we got into the souk, on which we needed a tour guide most, had a browse through the shops before reaching Ali Ben Youssef Medersa. Mr. Kharroubi was friendly and informative of the Marrakech culture, and seemed to know almost everyone we came across in the old town. I was initially worried about the difficulty of roaming the souq, which is a twisted labyrinth of alleys filled with shops and food stalls. However it was a great experience overall with great knowledgeable local guide, who truly helped us to make the most of our short stay. I would actually recommend him a local guide. The half day tour (3.5h) cost us EUR45 (excluding tip) for two of us."

The Tour gives you an overview of Moroccan politics and economics in both historical and contemporary settings. It heightens your appreciation for its cultural and social aspects and it takes you on an adventure of the most exotic sights, sounds and aromas and fragrances. Morocco is a melting pot of both indigenous people and tourists of various origins. At times I likened it to an airport lounge. On a personal level you can seek lots of advise about your stay which is grate when you don't have family you can refer to . Yusuf is hugely patriotic and is always looking to promote many aspects about a country he feels very passionately about. If you want the Moroccan experience this is the Tour to help you get it. On a final note I am intrinsically linked with the UK, Pakistan and the Philippines and have traveled a bit, but Moroccans are some of the most affectionate people I have come across. We will always look back with lots of affection."

Rather than following the plan he had made to show us the sights in a walking tour, because my son had a hurt ankle, we requested a car and driver, which he quickly arranged (for an extra fee). We visited a rug center (at our request) and a palace (at his suggestion). In the afternoon, we asked Youssef to find an orthopedic doctor for our son, whose ankle was getting worse. Youssef was great: he found a clinic, helped us arrange the x-rays and see a doctor, all within an hour or so! He even lent us Dirhams to pay the bill at the clinic, drove us to a pharmacy, and then found an ATM machine so we could pay him back. We couldnt have asked for someone more helpful!"

Youssef speaks perfect English and is obviously very intelligent. He gave us lots of information and it was very interesting. He checked with us exactly what we wanted from the tour and would have done anything we wanted. Being our first proper day in the city we had no real idea and so let Youssef choose.We went deep into the souks which was fascinating but did feel a little rushed as it got towards midday. I understand he has a time scale and other commitments so I can't complain about this but in hindsight I would have done a little less palace and a little more souks.Youssef does take you to a couple of places where the shop owners do a bit of a show and sales pitch. The herbalist was interesting and we were happy to spend a few dirams. Having Youssef there, I didn't find this oppressive.We then did a tour of the Ourkia valley. Youssef did not come on that but we had the same driver we'd had on the first day. We had a wonderful day. It is a really interesting place. The drivers English wasn't great but he tried his best to tell us about the various places. My only slight issue was that we weren't really told what this day entailed and so we had no idea how long the trip was or how long we had the driver for. It turns out (I think) that we had him all day but not really knowing this we may have hurried ourselves a bit.Finally, and the reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 was the price. It was agreed beforehand and we were happy with it however when we got to Marrakech we found lots of deals and much cheaper options to do similar tours.(I think it is the off season so there are lots of offers) Of course you do get what you pay for and I have no problem with the first tour tour with Youssef which was worth every penny but we could have got the trip to the Ourika Valley for a third of the price we paid, for what was basically a taxi ride.That said, if you are visiting Marrakech, and I wholly recommend you do, Youssef is an excellent guide and a very nice man!"

Me, my wife and son (8 year old) were very happy that we met Youssef and could spend couple of very exciting days in Marrakesh and High Atlas Mountains - thanks to Youssef mainly. Youssef is highly recommended, licensed toursit guide which knows everything not only about Marrakesh history but whole country Morroco as well. We spent dwo days in Marrakesh and visited and found out things which we certainly couldn't imagine if we visited Marrakesh on our own and which you don't find in any tourist book guides. Also we had two trips (in two next days) outside Marrakesh including visiting beautiful landscapes of Middle and High Atlas Mountain during which we were climbing to amazing waterfalls at 2.000 m over see level and driving via Tiz'n Tischka pass (over 2.100m - amazing and beautiful views really worth to see) and visiting famous Kazba used in \"Gladiator\" movie and many many other interesting things/places. Marrakesh is very exceptional city and if anybody is going there and wants to learn a lot about of its spirit, culture and wants to see how in old Medina street traffic looks like do not to hestitate to contact with Youssef. Yo won't regret !!!"

On the morning of our tour, Youssef Kharroubi met us in the lobby of our guest house with a warm greeting and an offer to begin our day at one of the area's beautiful gardens. After the garden we navigated the city on foot, enjoying the small streets and alleys that offered the true flavor of the city. Youssef grew up in the area and was greeted everywhere we went. He was knowledgeable about the history of the city as well as the culture and politics of modern day Marrakech. He arranged for a wonderful rooftop lunch, and gave us an opportunity to shop at a high quality establishment where we could shop without being pushed into buying. Youssef was kind, fun, informative and simply delightful! Susan, Kent, Sue and David"

Our expectations were very high for this trip and that can be very dangerous because when your expectations are high you can end up disappointed more often than not. However, due to the excellent guide services and assistance of Youssef Kharroubi it turned out to be a trip that was more than we could ever hope to duplicate on our own or with any other guide. Youssef's knowledge of the culture, city, food and everything Moroccan ensured that we were able to enjoy Morocco much more than you would expect from a simple guide service. Youssef made certain that we were cared for in every way and whenever we had a request he ensured that all our needs were met. To say that he was our guide would fall far short of the mark as he became a friend who was eager to share his country with you as only a friend can. I could not recommend him higher as I know that if you are to chose him to arrange your time in Morocco and especially Marrakesh, his home town, it too will be an experience of a lifetime for you as it was for my wife and I."

I am so glad I found Youssef-he was responsive to my emails and I was so fortunate he was available. Youssef asked about our interests and what we wanted to see and made some suggestions for us based on this. I had read that the guides are unreliable and only interested in taking you to a friends store for a commission but this was not the case with Youssef. He showed up right on time to our riad in the medina and never once did he take us into a store! He is smart, intuitive and alot of fun. We learned so much from spending the day with him. We got off the beaten path to see the real local life as well as saw the major tourist sights such as the Madrassa, gardens, palace, etc. He was flexible as we changed our mind in the afternoon about seeing the tombs and he was fine with it and we discussed other options. It was a great day learning from Youssef. His english is fine and no problems at all. He is gracious and a gentlemen-making sure he looked out for us when walking the busy streets in the souks or in the traffic. He was also gracious with his fellow Moroccans and while I don't speak Arabic or French to understand what he was saying, you could tell he treated them with respect and they treated him the same way in return. On several occasions, he gave discreetly gave change to some disabled people which shows he is kind and has a big heart.

Our decision to contact Kharrouby Tour Guide was our best decision.Youssef Kharroubi speaks English perfectly (as well as Japanese, French and Arabic). He was born in Marrakech, knows all about it and loves it! We were taken to special places as well as to common places, where life flows independently of tourists' visits. We managed to see people, shops and streets that we would have never managed to see on our own. While we walked around, Youssef would tell about history, politics, art, culture and practical advice. It was a great experience.Also, everything is CHEAPER with him. We hired a taxi, bought fruit, sunglasses and other items much cheaper than at any other time. And the shops were chosen by us, not by him (one could tell he did not know the shopkeepers). Youssef bargained on our behalf and got it much cheaper. He did not avoid arguments to protect our interests and make sure that we are not charged a sort of \"tourist charge\"; instead, he wanted us to pay the amount he would have paid. It is his vision that one can only help Marrakech by playing straight with visitors. We will be visiting Marrakech again with our 3 children and we are definitely going to contact Youssef Kharroubi. I plan - and would advise the reader - to save all the relevant shopping to the touring day and have his help in buying it with or for us.I have no hesitations in recommending Youssef Kharroubi: honest, knowledgeable and polite.Jorge Menezes"

The two highlights of his tour guide for me were visiting the Berber pharmacy where I made purchases of their argan oil creams and different Moroccan spices [which you are able to bring into NZ]. But the biggest and most awesome buy for me was from the carpet shop. Again, Youssef had the patience of a saint whilst I was trying to decide over an hour or two on my purchase. So many gorgeous and different varieties of carpets, it was difficult to choose! The carpets chosen were couriered to my home in New Zealand within the time frame given.

He is a warm, friendly and genuine person who was generous with his time and knows every inch of the city. He could explain much of the history and how old traditions were still surviving in modern-day Marrakesh. Watching him interact with other local people showed me a lot about how this culture is about warmth, connection and helping each other - so that I felt closer to the real Marrakesh - not just the tourist's. His good connections also meant he could put me on to an excellent Arabic teacher.

Without a truly local guide like Reda it is easy to miss many aspects of the culture and how intertwined religion, community, heritage and craft are. Reda is smart and very laid back - in a good way. We never felt rushed or pushed around at all. He never pressured us to buy anything but he did introduce us to friendly vendors who were happy to explain their work and let us take photo.

We visited the spice area, a shop selling beautiful wooden pieces and, my favourite, enjoyed some street food at one of the myriad of tiny urban caves selling their goods and eats. Couldn't possibly find my way back there now if you offered me a million pounds, but that's why you get a guide!Reda was charming, friendly and a font of knowledge. He told us about the markets, the history and shared some insight into his own family too. We were very comfortable with him. It's fair to say that there is plenty of pressure to buy things anywhere in the souks but that is part of the experience and we got no pressure at all from Reda himself. He does have selected places to take you but, again, that is part and parcel of having a tour. There was never a problem if we decided to stop off somewhere on the way, having spotted some trinket. Reda waited patiently while we pottered around!I definitely recommend having an idea of what you want to see as Reda is very flexible and will take your lead. If you are looking to be led on a regimented march from place to place with a monotonous dirge about all the typical stuff you could have read in a book on the way over, find something else (or probably somewhere else!) If you want a relaxed, interesting trail among the endlessly sprawling alleyways, Reda will take care of you."

He was happy to keep showing us around the Medina until we were happy to finish.Only reason I didn't give him five stars is that he brought us to expensive places and what seemed to be his friends rather than cheap shops. We purchased three teapot sets in one of the shops he advised us to go to for \u20ac200 and then when we arrived back at our hotel, the hotel shop had similar ones (weight, size, silver plated) for \u20ac40 a set! Very disappointing.So all in all, I'd strongly recommend this tour guide it just be aware that there are cheaper shops out there!"

It was our first time to Marrakech and to Africa so were a little unsure of what to expect, especially as we'd heard getting lost in the souks was inevitable. A friend had recommended a Mustapha as a guide but unfortunately he wasn't available during our week of stay but he put us in touch with his fellow tour guide Reda. We spent a day exploring the souks with Reda and his knowledge, advice and friendliness instantly put us at ease. He was great at finding good photo opportunities (I'm a keen photographer) and taking photos of my boyfriend and I in pretty spots and took us to some really interesting sites and areas that would have proven difficult to find on our own! What's more, it was great being able to speak to a local and Reda was brilliant at answering any questions we had. We were so pleased to have met him and the introduction he gave us to Marrakech was just what we needed for us to find our feet. We'd definitely recommend using Marrakech Guide Tours to anyone wanting to explore Marrakech, particularly if they feel a little overwhelmed by the busyness of the souks and main square!"

Reda took us to a lot of different shops so make sure to tell him upfront what you are interested in so then he can tailor the tour to your shopping preferences. I really enjoyed this tour I never felt pressured to buy from any of the stores he took us to which was a plus!! Don't travel the souks without Reda has your guide!!!"

He was knowledgable and personable. We saw artisans in the foundouk that were making items the same way for thousands of years. It was awesome. His enthusiasm for his community was evident.

I would definitely recommend a trip with Reda so you can get acquainted with the city and then plan other trips. For instance, we told Reda we wanted to go to the mountains and he arranged for a driver to pick us up a few days later and take us on a day trip to Asni.

Where do I start with my glowing review of my tour guide, Reda...For a start, for anyone deciding whether to use a guide: my experience in Morocco was so great because I had the benefit of a guide in Marrakech. I really don't think you could fully appreciate Marrakech without a guide, even for just the first day, because it is incredibly hard to find the places you are looking for and there is just so much to do, that you don't want to miss out. Because of a last minute change of events, Reda became my tour guide in Marrakech over the course of several days and I couldn't be happier that we got to meet. Reda's knowledge of Marrakech is unreal and no matter what the request - whether it be spending hours wandering through all the different areas of the Souks, or looking for something very specific, Reda has it covered. Reda was also able to independently recommend other activities to us, including a day trip to the Atlas Mountains and a local cooking school. Reda's English is exceptional and he is a friendly and happy person to spend time with. Over the course of the few days in Marrakech, Reda responded quickly to my emails when I wanted to change the plans and I found him to be flexible. Reda also became my personal shopper one day and it was a pleasure to be able to support him and his tour guide profession.I am also including some photos so you can see just how special Marrakech is - especially when you see it with Reda.

He did an amazing job of balancing our group's interests, showing me sites and teaching me history of the city, and guiding the ladies to find the high quality items they were looking for at good prices. He was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, fun, and accommodating. I would definitely recommend having Reda as your guide, he did a great job of showing us Marrakech on our first visit and I would like to see him again next time."

He was friendly, relaxed and knew the city very well. One of the excursions was an afternoon of shopping in the souk, Ach brought us to many wonderful vendors who had exactly what we were searching for and the best quality. If we had attempted to do this on our own we would have not been successful. Ach also added value as he is a personal shopper as well. Ach kept in touch with us upon our return home to ensure that various carpets we ordered while with him at the souk were delivered to us safely at home. I have recommended Ach to others and highly recommend him as a guide."

We had booked Reda before we left home as both my wife and myself have trouble walking long distances and did not want to be lost in the souks. It turned out to be the best booking we have made on any holiday. Reda made us both feel comfortable from the first moment we met him. We had decided where we wanted to shop and what we want to see before we met Reda and also left choices for him to make. The shops he took us too were all very good no tourist rubbish. Reda stood back to allow is to shop but was always there if we needed help or to get us the best price eg local price not tourist price. we had a good mixture of shopping sightseeing and eating. Reda took us to a place where the locals eat for lunch, which was one of the best meals we had and cost under \u00a35 for 3 people.I also noticed that while we were shopping Reda was keeping all the people who would normally be hassling us away which was wonderful. His English is very good and his knowledge of the souks is second to none. the souks are split into different areas and without Reda I am sure we could have still been lost in there now. As we want jewelry, a rug and shoes (which we wear all the time) Reda knowledge of the area meant he could led us through short cuts, therefore saving our legs. Because he knew about are walking problems he made sure we knew about every step or rough ground and there was always a helping hand if needed.My daughter and partner are off to Marrakesh next week and have already booked Reda,so if its shopping, sightseeing or good food you are after Book REDA you will not be disappointed."

He gave us a two day walking tour of Marrakesh and tailored our days to what we wanted to see. He met us at the hotel the day of arrival and took us on a whirlwind tour of the city. The most memorable meals I had in Marrakesh were by virtue of being on a tour with Reda. On a cool and rainy February morning, he took us to an authentic place for breakfast, only visited by locals. I had two types of tagine, 2 kinds of hearty lentils, fresh fried fish, mint tea, and fresh bread, all for a grand total of about 12 USD (total, for 4 people). This meal is something I will not forget. I also had flat bread (super thin) freshly made with honey and cheese in a small stall inside the Souks. For dinner one night, I had tagia, meat slow cooked underground in a pot. It was so tender and flavorful, makes my mouth water when I think about it. Sightseeing and Shopping: Reda took us to the Souks, led us through the alleys with skill and a perfect sense of direction despite the bustling shops and crowds. I purchased rugs, spices, argan oil, jewelry, leather goods and beautiful flowing gowns during the day as Reda guided us to the shops. He took us to a peaceful shrine with water flowing and birds chirping as the sunlight came out. We went to Jardin Majorelle where we stopped for pictures every few feet as we took in the beautiful colors and flowers. At the end of the trip, he took us to the Jmaa el Fnaa (the famous square), where my senses were overwhelmed with the music, smells, sights and sounds. My friend was scared of snakes, so he tailored our trip to see the square after sunset, when he knew the snakes would not be out.Reda was a great guide. Contact him before your next trip! You will not regret it. He's down to earth, well-spoken, kind and knowledegable."

We got to visit Chefchaouen, Ifran, Meknes-Tafilalet, Merzouga desert, and Ait Ben Haddou and few other places in between. I would have to say that the desert was my favorite. It is probably one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen! The camel trekking was in itself an experience, just to say it takes a while to get used to but it's fun. The night was spectacular!! It ended with a home cooked meal and ethnic live music. In the morning, we awoke to the beautiful sunrise. Which in itself was worth the trip. But... All credit goes to our tour guide Said who truly made the trip with my family unforgettable. He explained to us the history of morocco and it's people. The religion and work that beholds Morocco's culture. With Said, we felt as if he wasn't our tour guide but rather a close friend of ours who always was professional yet so much fun. The car rides were hilarious and filled with endless dancing from all various types of genres of music. I truly miss morocco, and I want to visit again. I would highly recommend this tour to all those that are deciding on visiting morocco. You will not be disappointed. If I could rate this tour a 6 I would instead of a 5 star.

We sourced Soul Adventure 4X4 Tours via Trip Advisor and decided this was the way to see Morocco \u2013 and we were not disappointed. From the start Said worked with us to develop an itinerary that suited us, with accommodation that met our requirements of a pool (it was going to be hot) and reasonable standard/cost. All our needs were met and the accommodation used was exactly what we had requested, usually being family run Riads offering very tidy and clean rooms with great hospitality. We loved each and every one and each one was just right for our family. Said also worked with us to ensure we either received a family room or 2 rooms close together, and being low season we could usually make the choice.The vehicle used was also perfect, and being a large Toyota Prado 4x4 we felt completely safe and ready to take on any roads. It allowed us to see some of the off-the-road parts of Morocco that other tours may miss. Plenty of room for bags and the family of 4 so we didn\u2019t need to use the roof-rack.We undertook a 12 day odyssey of Northern Morocco and probably covered a little too much ground, but we did see a lot this wonderful country has to offer. We travelled to Marrakesh, Essaouira, Taroudante, Quarzazate, Dades Gorge, Merzourga, Fez, Chefchaouen and Tangiers (only to depart) and there were some long days of driving in there. But also many highlights and great experiences so hard to decide what we may have amended. Definitely the night in the Berber camp at Merzourga was a highlight, amidst the spectacular red dunes of the Sahara, stunning clear sky and lots of fun for the kids. But the other places each had something to offer the tourist. My most nervous part of booking the tour was sending the deposit! Always a bit worrying sending money to an organization you don\u2019t know, and we elected to use a bank transfer over Western Union (the latter which is easier for Soul Adventure I think). We paid a 10% deposit and the balance on arrival, and I am pleased to report my caution was not required as everyone and everything was as arranged prior. I can also report Said is also utterly and completely honest \u2013 twice we amended or changed hotel arrangements and twice he ensured we received the refund of any difference quickly (aside from loaning me cash when we ran out of ATMs one day!).So I would completely recommend Soul Adventures for your Morocco Tour and would happily respond to any queries or questions. The tour was easily arranged, priced very competitively and performed professionally throughout. As a family we loved it and had a wonderful trip with Said.Finally \u2013 we travelled completely during Ramadan which did have some impact but much smaller than we had expected. No trouble eating food and drinking in public at all, and most restaurants are open for tourists. We had one day in a more remote village where one place was closed, but Said found a second restaurant which was able to serve lunch. That was the only time over 2 weeks. Of course we also had to be a little flexible with Said, given he was fasting all day, allowing a later start time and a rest during the heat of the day. But there are far less tourists than usual and most Riads were not busy at all (choice of rooms). So overall there are no issues travelling during this time if you have to (for us it was dictated by school break).Go ahead and book with faith in these guys!"

Our driver, Mohamed, was very friendly and knowledgeable of the area (and cognizant in English), ranging from the history of Morocco to the geographical elements in the desert to where good local food can be found. We got to see various desert ruins, black sand, mirages and sand dunes. We rode on camels to desert camps, and we also spent a night stargazing in the desert after feasting on a Moroccan dinner and listening to the locals' music. I also found the desert tour particularly enjoyable because of the lack of tourists (so no one spoils your photographs). This is one of the most authentic travel experiences I have ever had, and I would strongly recommend this to anyone visiting the beautiful country of Morocco."

Thoughtful Said even got us a cake to celebrate our honeymoon and we had much fun enjoying the Moroccan performances together into the night.

It was one of the best guided tours we've experienced. The highlights:- Said clearly cares about the comfort of his guests. He inspected the hotel rooms we stayed at before we entered and checked in with us frequently to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. Without us asking, he even requested a private Berber tent camp and small toilet for us for the one night we spent in the desert. The camp can sleep up to 40 or 50, so to have it all to ourselves was a huge luxury.- Said never rushed us or appeared bored. He seemed content to wait for us and work on a flexible schedule.- Excellent selection of activities and views. Our favorites were the ksar of Ait Ben Haddou, desert camping, and eating traditional tagine at his family's home. Other cool activities were searching for wild Barbary apes in the cedar forests of Azrou, having mint tea in the tent of a Berber nomad, and taking in all the amazing gorge views.- Excellent hotel and restaurant suggestions. We were very happy with Chez Pierre and Riad Madu (see my reviews) and every meal we ate.We have hired several tour guides in different countries and this is by far one of the best and most comprehensive. I would highly recommend Said and Soul Adventure 4x4!"

It was my wife & I on our honeymoon, we went to Spain then by ship to Morocco, the driver picked us up on time from the port, drove us to all the places we asked him for, we even needed to try things outside of our agreed upon trip (a Moroccan bath which I recommend anyone to ask for that in their trip) and he spent the extra time & effort to find us one of the quality hammams (tourists baths as they call them), we were even a bit picky on the food, and the driver accommodated all of our requests and took us to the right places (restaurants) to try the types of food we were craving. The hotels were so unique and awesome. He even helped us with bargaining with the locals at the market for the shopping we did. The other tour guides (because in the old parts of the cities we visited (Fes & Meknes), the company hired a dedicated tour guide and they were very friendly and knowledgable. Also the driver has the advantage of speaking the 2 main languages spoken in Morocco which is Arabic & Amazighi and his English was really good. I highly recommend this Soul Adventures and their private tours. And just to be fair the owner/manager of the company used to call the driver a few times a day to follow up on us and spoke with me a couple of times to check on us and make sure everything is ok and all is according to the plan.Now as for Morocco, it is a beautiful country, we only had 5 days to spend in Morocco but I wish we had more time to see more, the hotels we stayed at the majority of times were called (Riyad) and the manegers/owners of these Riyads were very friendly people, I remember there was a wedding in Meknes after midnight and I really wanted to see it, so the owner of that Riyad opened the door for me and let me record the wedding and watch the locals dancing in colourful clothing, was beautiful. I even wanted to try McDonald's while we were there and they sent their driver to get us a meal (we paid extra obviously but they were very accommodating).Just a general tip if you are going to Morocco:1. If you agree on paying by euros, make sure you bring euros with you. Same if you agree on US dollars then bring US dollars with you. I am from Canada and I did not bring Euros with me (which was a mistake) because the local exchange rates are different from the international rates. And on that note, Morocco is a very safe country, the people are not wealthy yet very friendly. And the driver is super trustworthy, he helped me many times in finding local currency exchanges to pay for things, I even made a mistake and paid him extra one time, and he corrected me and paid me back and that was very honest and kind of you, he really deserved every euro of tip I gave him.2. Cellular internet is not the best in Morocco (I mean the data on mobile phones) but at all the hotels they was wifi connections and it worked so that was good.That's it really, again, thank you Said from Soul Adventures and I look forward to coming to Morocco again for another trip (hopefully soon)."

He toured us around his amazing country and on the way we discovered fantastic scenarios, Kasbahs, delicious food, wonderful expeditions though the dessert and other really exciting places that we could not have got there without him. It is a perfect balance between having fun and discovering a country. We\u2019ll definitely be back as soon as we can!"

Youssef was our tour guide, and Said would always call to check up on us. The guide worked around our schedule and tailored the day to our demands. Besides taking us all around morocco, he would stop us at the locations with the most amazing scenery and take pictures of us. He would also drive us to the cleanest places to dine in. Very professional company and tour guide: very punctual and went above and beyond our expectations. I highly recommend Soul Adventure, and I would definitely book with them again!"

He showed us so many different and exotic places which we could have never reached on our own, he was patient and stopped wherever we wanted, and he was so much fun, we sang, danced and had an overall great experience with him. The places were we stayed overnight were beautiful, clean, comfortable, perfectly situated and with great food and staff. He went overboard helping us with every need and was interesting to talk to and laugh with. We met his beautiful family as he invited us for a meal at his home, and he took us all the way to our last destination which was not originally contemplated on the tour, but they can arrange a tour how ever you like. His brother Said, who is also a tour guide was extremely nice as well and helpful arranging the trip before getting there. We chose this agency because some friends had already traveled with them in the past and highly recommended them and we were really happy that we followed their advice. Follow mine and you won\u00b4t regret it, you\u00b4ll have the best time ever in Morocco with Soul adventure. Thank you Mohammed, we will come back for sure! :)"

During the planning stage of our tour, Said was polite, patient and flexible to accomodate our requests in the itinerary as much as possible. The price of the tour was reasonable too. And once the tour got started, we were filled with so many lovely and unforgettable moments!Mohammed, our driver and guide, always drove carefully and skillfully, and we felt completely safe. We passed through a diverse landscape full of wonder, including mountains, gorges, valleys, oases and sand dunes. He was willing to stop from time to time for us to take photos, and he showed us interesting things around the area. He also brought us to restaurants which served good local food. Having a native Berber guide who knows this area well is a great advantage. Mohammed and his family lives near the Sahara desert, and we could feel his genuine love and care for his fellow people. He took us to a nomad tent on the edge of the desert, and we had a glimpse of the hard life this nomadic family was living. We also visited a poor family who lived in a traditional Berber house in the mountains. These visits were invaluable chances for us to encounter Berber culture and lifestyle.Mohammed was a great travel companion too. He was cheerful, playful, and always weared a smile. His natural warmth and care impressed us a lot!"

This is my first tripadvisor review and I have to admit that our Morocco trip with Soul Adventure 4x4 was such a brilliant one that i just HAD to write about them. We were a group of 4 people and Said and Mohammed were our guides but they soon became friends! Their 4x4 Toyota was like home for us and we thoroughly enjoyed the drives through the Atlas Mountains, gorges and the desert. Said and Mohammed are the best guides we could have asked for - friendly, unbelievably helpful and sweet, full of life and information about Morocco. We got a great feel of the place. The most important thing is that this tour is not very expensive and is well worth every penny you pay. The fact that we missed Said and Mohammed after our trip is enough to say how amazing our time with Soul Adventure was. Our Morocco trip would never have been the same if we hadn't chosen Soul Adventure and I'M SO GLAD WE DID! I would highly recommend this tour to anyone who wants to see Morocco. Cheers!"

From the beginning they were extremely responsive and helpful, starting with the planning of the trip and continuing all the way to the end. With e-mails flying back and forth, Said took our rather vague preferences (we want to stay in riads and auberges and do a lot of walking\u2026 Oh, and also, not too many day in cities\u2026and we are interested in local food) and constructed a wonderful personalized 10 day tour of (mostly) Berber Morocco that was perfect for us. Their choices of \"riads and auberges\" for us to stay in were outstanding, truly Moroccan places of various kinds that pleased us immensely. Many were so out-of-the-way that we would never have found them on our own. They ranged from rather simple kasbahs to former palaces (one was even in a beautiful building parts of which dated to 1378!) but all were very clean and comfortable and every single one had friendly and welcoming management. Most were locally owned and operated, which I appreciate, both because I like to meet local people and because I prefer to spend my tourist dollars where they will benefit the local economy. Mohamed was a truly excellent driver--the best I've had in this kind of tour. I always felt completely safe whether we were moving at high speed on the highway, threading our way through chaotic city streets, or bumping down a rocky 4-wheel drive track leading to a nomad family camp. Said was with us too, and together the two of them took perfect care of us. They were friendly and good company, and showed us many facets of Morocco we would not have found on our own. They arranged local food (wonderful) for us and sought out local markets to show us. I was especially grateful for Said's help with bargaining; I always felt he was on our side in all transactions. Finally, the local guides they found and recommended for the cities and historical sites were always excellent. Overall, I can't think of a thing I would complain about.  I highly recommend SoulAdventure4x4 for your trip to Morocco -- Their prices were far lower than comparable tours arranged by USA or European travel companies and you will get a much better, more personalized experience."

It was such a warm gesture and it speaks to the kind of people they are.As far as tours are concerned, this was excellent. We went everywhere we wanted and stayed only as long as we wanted. It was highly individualized and we were always well fed (even though, again, it was during Ramadan).

Another exceptional journey thanks to their knowledge of the region, their easy contact with all the locals (Berbers like themselves), their constant good humour \u2013 and sense of humour \u2013 and superb organisation. It was life made easy without ever losing the feeling of adventure. However, of course they can\u2019t do the impossible and it was on occasion very cold in the little local auberges (whch one would never find on one\u2019s own) and on occasion there was no hot water .... but if you choose to travel into the interior, on little routes not even marked on the map, to areas of extraordinary beauty which the majority of travellers will never see, you accept in advance that there will be moments of questionable comfort. If you don\u2019t have a spirit of adventure and a very open mind you will not have embarked on this sort of journey. The scenery is breathtaking, ever-changing, fabulous .... I run out of adjectives! We each took over 500 photos. Mohamed speaks excellent Spanish and his English gets ever better, especially after being with us for ten days! They both know some words of Dutch and German as well as Swedish now. Brahim speaks very good French, and of course both speak Arabic and Berber.I find them both very attentive and caring, whether you are the youngest in the group (-40) or the oldest (myself \u2013 80).

We were travelling with our two children aged six and eight and our guide Said could not have been more hospitable and accommodating. Most importantly from our perspective was how safe we felt. Our driver was extremely skilled, which matters a lot when driving through the hairpin turns of the High Atlas, and we always felt like Said was looking out for our best interests. Perhaps the best illustration of this was after we had eaten an overpriced lunch at a restaurant that did not deliver what it had promised, Said went in and negotiated a refund on our behalf. We didnt ask him to do this, but he noticed my husband's annoyance with the restaurant and just quietly solved the problem for us. This is just one example of the very high level of customer service we continually received. The hotels, restaurants and camel trek that Soul Adventures arranged for us were great, and we really felt like we got great value for our money with this trip. We highly recommend Soul Adventures."

Soul Adventuress 4x4 filled the itinerary with many delightful and unexpected authentic experiences along the way that there is no way we would have done with a group tour or if we were traveling on our own. Our guide (Mohammed) took us deep into the remote villages and valleys in the heart of Morrocco, shared with us his passion and knowledge of the people and their traditions. Because of his extremely personable personality, we were able to see first-hand how many of the nomads and other native Moroccans live. Where other guides and their clients would just walk or drive by a nomad camp, Mohammed would manage to get us invited in for tea. He was great with the kids and quickly felt like part of the family. He was very attentive to ensuring we were satisfied with the hotels and restaurants and went above and beyond in providing us a relaxing and adventure-filled vacation. Whenever the drive got a little long, Mohammed would pull over, crank up the tunes and get us all dancing and laughing.

We had three days during which we wanted to start in Fez, drive all the way out to Merzouga and spend a night in the desert in the Erg Chebbi dunes, and then make our way back to Marrakech. Said was impressively responsive on email, and understood our needs and was accommodating in arranging the trip, and also made very helpful suggestions. Lahcen (who speaks five languages, including perfect English and French, among other things) was there waiting for us in Fez to start our trip, exactly as we had arranged, and ended up being a fantastic guide. They even welcomed us into their home on the drive out into the desert, where we had tea with their family, getting a true genuine experience.They arranged for a great night out in the desert (was just the two of us and our guide) and then we had a very easy drive back, spending the night in Ouarzazate, and then ending in Marrakech. To top it all off, Lahcen, who also happened to still be in Marrakech, even insisted on meeting us a day after our tour had ended to drive us to the airport from our riad in Marrakech.All in all, we can\u2019t speak highly enough of the team \u2013 we highly recommend Soul Adventure 4x4!"

My husband and I recently visited Morocco and experienced the best vacation ever! i want to share my favorite part of our trip with anyone who is looking forward at visiting Morocco. my favorite destination was the desert of Merzouga, so here is what we experienced :After a peaceful night of sleep we departed with Said in his 4x4 to visit the local villages. In the village of Khamlia we watched the traditional dances and music of Gnawa. We visited bazaars and bought ourselves turbans to prepare for our afternoon camel trek into the dunes. For lunch Said took us to his family\u2019s home where we enjoyed a delicious homemade traditional dish of Kalia and tea made by his grandmother. After two hours of camel trekking into the highest dunes in the world we arrived at the oasis which is located bellow one of the highest dunes of the desert. We enjoyed a cup of tea while meeting other tourists from around the world. Dinner is prepared by the camel men that led us to the oasis. After dinner we enjoyed the dances and the music of the drums played the same men who cooked our meal. These camel men are truly amazing, they speak many languages, trek us through the dunes, cook our meals, entertain us with dancing and music, tell jokes and fix your turban! Very hospitable. Before we retired in our Berber tent for the evening we walked through dunes, enjoyed the stars and listened to the camels chewing. We awoke early the next morning to enjoy the sunrise over the dunes. It is amazing how the sand dunes changes color from beige to a yellow orange color during this time. After this we camel trekked back to the Kasbah for showers and breakfast. It was now time to say goodbye to Merzouga. If you ever plan on visiting Morocco, Merzouga is a must see. Our tour guide, Said, was one of the best guides I have ever had the privilege of dealing with, he was knowledgeable about all the destinations we visited, humorous and very gracious. Soul Adventure 4x4 made this trip absolutely enjoyable by making it completely carefree. My husband and I will definitely return to this beautiful country to experience more of what it has to offer and we will definitely use the same excursion company."

We arranged for a five day trip of our own itinerary and from the time they picked us up from the ferry in Tangiers to the time they dropped us off, we didn't have to worry about anything but having fun. Ibra arranged for all our accommodations and did all the driving. Ali was our translator and could answer any question we had about history, agriculture, etc. They took us to markets, showed us around different towns, arranged guides for Meknes and Volubilis, always took us right to our accommodations overnight and got us settled. They took us to the Sahara for a camel trek to a Berber camp. Ibra had us to his home for an excellent home-cooked meal, henna, and had even made us a gift of a photo of our family mounted on a fossil rock frame. They made us feel welcome and best of all were incredibly kind to my young son. They always played with him, held his hand through the markets, and even arranged an impromptu donkey ride for him. They were such gracious hosts and friends to us and gave us the trip of a lifetime showing us their beautiful country, letting us meet the people and teaching us it's incredible history. Cannot recommend enough!"

Prior to arriving to Marrakech, Rachid was very communicative about pricing and what would be included in the trip. He provided responses to my email within a day usually, making it easy to plan ahead. On the first day, I was greeted by a cab driver at my riad and driven up to Imlil, where I met my guide Rachid (not the owner and organizer) and started the trek up. I found the first day to be quite arduous: having not acclimated at all and having the travel catch up to me, I had to take it pretty slow. Rachid was great and allowed for many breaks and even cooked me lunch! The hike up the second day from the refuge was similarly difficult but absolutely stunning and worth all of the sweat and achy legs.My guide Rachid was the highlight of my trip-- he spoke English well and we switched between Spanish occasionally for the fun of it. The way up Toubkal is fairly straight forward, but I wouldn't have made it up without him. I highly recommend doing the trek in the winter when there is snow-- the mountain is stunning."

Our amazing trek to the top of Mt Toubkal would never had been the same without Rachid, our extremely professional, friendly and considerate guide. He not only led us on the right path and set the right pace so all of us (a group of 11 men in their 50's) made it to the peak. But he also provided the perfect and authentic moroccan experience with great local food and hospitality. Rachid is also very observant and helpful and immediately came to assistance if some of us needed help with a difficult passage or a loose steigeisen. With the extremely professional guide Rachid, you can rest assured that you are in good hands: just leave all the difficult decisions to him and enjoy the breathtaking views in the Atlas mountains!Before the trip we wondered if the full package with guide, mules, cook etc would make the trip too easy and less challenging for us, who are relatively experienced trekkers. But it turned out to be a very good decision instead of going on our own. First, we saved a lot of time not getting lost since the the path could sometimes be difficult to follow and was not marked correctly on the map. Second, even though we might have made it carrying our own backpacks, it made the trip much more enjoyable to load them on the mules - and it was still a challenge to make the ascend in thin air and keep control of our steps during the descend. Third, the local and freshly made food we were served was much better and more authentic than anything we could have prepared ourselves. And forth, it was a great relief to know that if anything went wrong, Rachid would know how to handle the situation and bring everybody home safely.So we strongly recommend that you choose Rachid and Atlas Mountains Guide for your trek in the Atlas Mountains!"

He speaks very good English and was an extremely good driver (very important, going up the mountain). We drove for about an hour and a half and then he picked up our guide Hassam and then dropped us all off after 5 mins to start our walk. We walked for about 2 hours. Hassam is a lovely chap. Speaks very good English. We had fun and joked with him. We walked to the waterfall and then carried on. Hassam is very good at assessing how well you walk and will adjust the walk to suit the person. Don't be worried if you can't walk for 2 hours and miss out on this trip as it can suit everyone. We had lunch at Hassam's house. It was a fantastic lunch with so much food and his mother cooked it. She even made a birthday cake for my husband as it was his birthday (the Riad must have told Hassam). The little children from the village came in and had some cake. They were very sweet and it was great to see them. We walked for about 10 mins after lunch and Jawad brought us back. We arrived back at 4.30pm.

Our riad told us just to go to eureka valley only instead of all three valleys which would of taken up more of the day.You do the usual stopping at places so they can sell you goods but we had a private guide so we asked him after the first to just go to the mountains which he was happy to do. Once we got there he advised us to use a guide, so we did (200 dirams) your then taken up a tough route up the mountain that is physically tough especially if you don't have suitable footwear. We only went as far as the first three waterfalls but that in itself was really high. The views are amazing and the trip all in all was good fun. Throughout the mountain there are Berber people with their shops and it's always nice to have a good haggle.It's a must do for Marrakech"

Our guide was excellent and enabled us to complete a climb that I would never normally have been able to achieve. Basically, it was a hair-raising climb up slippery rocks that would probably be closed to the public in the UK. Our guide asked us before we set off if anyone had asthma, but didn't ask if we were generally fit. One of our party had to step out a third of the way up due to the steepness and scariness of the climb. At one stage we were faced with a vertical mossy rock with water trickling down it and given a rusty ladder to get up with. Our guide was there to hold our hand every step of the way and we all accomplished it fine. The final views were spectacular and the sense of achievement well worth it. We took an easier way down and were then taken to the guide's home for a traditional berber meal (we had arranged this in advance via our hotel the day before). All in all a fantastic day out. You just need to be fit enough to enjoy it."

We had 6 days (departing from and arriving back in Marrakech). Rachid made it happen (as it appeared later on that this is an ambitious schedule, with long days of walking (longest day: 32km, including the top) and one day walking through the river :-) )! Rachid was very helpful in answering questions through e-mail. He picked us up at the airport. We had the choice of booking a Riad ourselves, or on his services. Rachid is also very flexible in terms of changing the program, as the flight of some of my friends was cancelled, so we were only able to leave Marrakech 6 hours later than planned.Rachid arranged another guide for us because of his own agenda (I think). Guide Oulaid is very friendly, learned us about local culture (he originates from the Ait Bouguemez Valley or 'Happy Valley'), and set the right pace for the whole group (7 people), what really created a good team spirit.The guide, the cook (who was very attentive to my vegetarianism), and 4 others (with each of them a mule), created a fantastic experience! Although we only shared a similar language with Oulaid, the whole group was very friendly, and we had a good time in the evening, eating together, we once played the cards, and we sang songs and played music together for several times!They can support their village in the valley (schools, ..) because of our support."

It you are interested in a trek anything from 1-21 days you wont get better than Rachid the Atlas Mountains Guide. Book directly with him through his own email and you will get great value too.Rachid also organised a night in the Atlas Prelitege in Imlil after the trek I would also recommend this as a great finish to our time in the Atlas Mountain region.Thanks again Rachid for such a great trip."

He also sent us a email confirming the itinerary for the day and prices.Azaz arrived and picked us up in a 4x4, this was a one on one tour with me, my friend and Azaz the tour guide. From the start of the tour Azaz explained about the mountains and the Berber Villages. We stopped of at a museum about the Berber Villages and their history. Next we took a drive to an Argan Oil factory to been shown how it is made. The last stop was lunch at a Berber Village in someone's house, we were welcomed and felt humbled to be in their home. We were given lunch which was freshly cooked which included chicken tagine, couscous, salad, bread and water plus mint tea.Before we had left we had read that the villages are poor and that if possible to take sweets and pencils for the children. We took some sweets and and pencils and gave them out to the children. Our tour guide Azaz was very knowledgable and was willing to stop if we wanted to take a photo and didn't rush us at all. We spent the whole day out and got dropped back to our hotel.This tour might be slightly expensive however it was 100% worth it we had a one on one tour of the mountains, history of the mountains and lunch.I recommend speaking to Adil of 4x4camel."

Trekking to Mount Toubkal - We began our trip by being collected at our hotel in Marrakech by taxi. We were brought to just outside Imlil were we met Rachid (our guide) and Ibrahim (our cook). We had forgotten to order sleeping bags for hire but this was not a problem, Rachid contacted someone in Imlil and they dropped the sleeping bags off to us before we left. The sleeping bags were really good quality and very clean.... it saved us bringing them on our flight.....On the first day we trekked for about 5 hours with lunch in between.... Rachid answered any questions we had about the culture and location we were at .... the food was absolutlety fabulous.... very Moroccan and very wholesome food. We trekked through some Berber villiages and ended up at a refuge in one of them.The accomodation was basic (which is to be expected) but very clean with a toilet and hot shower and you could charge all your electronic stuff.... the food again was really good. Rachid brought us for a walk before dinner and answered any questions we had. The next day we had planned to trek up to 2700M but as I wasnt feeling well we went up to 2200 and trekked for about 5 hours again through some lovely villages and ended up at 2250m at the Tamsolt refuge. And as I wasnt feeling well Rachid called Ibrahim, the cook and told him so he made some rice for me and gave me a local remedy to drink. This was extemely thoughful of them to think of me. Again the refuge at Tamsolt was fantastic, toilet, hot water, electricity etc and very clean. On the third day we headed off at 7.30am as this was going to be a strenuous day.... it was the hardest day as we went from 2250m up to 3600m, but the views and scenary were amazing, we passed a fab waterfall that day too... also it was so quiet and not like other treks were you meet alot of trekkers... there was a little snow at 3600m. We got a packed lunch that day, which was lovely and very sufficient and then headed to base camp which was at approx 3207m. This was another lovely refuge. It was very busy so we had to share a dorm. There was 16 people in it but as it was only for one night it was fine. Food again was fab, we got homemade chips, which was such a treat........ The last day we headed off at 6am to the summit ... it was a hard enough trek but very enjoyable, met loads of lovely people. We made it to 4167m. The last day was very long, 9 hours walking. We walked all the way down to Imlil via a different route. This is another way people trek to Mount Toubkal but I would recommend the trek we did as the scenary is much nicer. If you come from Imlil you walk through a valley the whole time which makes it a very boring trek .... Rachid then arranged for a taxi back to Marrakech for us ... we arrived back to Marrakech by 5.30pm.The guide we had and the cook made our trip.... they were so helpful with everything, even when I wasnt well they looked after me and on the last day Rachid gave me a lend of his walking poles as there was some snow.....You need to have a level of fitness for this trek if you want to enjoy it, there are parts that a physically tough enough and a good pair of hiking boots are definately required..... I would highly recommend Atlas Mountains Guide, Rachid and Ibrahim to take you on this stunning Trek through the Atlas Mountains :-)"

As I am not as fit as my younger companions I had a large mule while they walked. It was amazingly comfortable and the animal wet through rivers and along tiny pathways with ease. The guides were great, showing us plants an points of interest all the way. We had a lovely lunch prepared by the family of one of the guides - good meat, lots of vegetables and fresh oranges. They were wonderful."

We went with Rachid for 4 days in the Atlas, we did two days trekking by the Azzeden Valey passing through the Berebe villages, absolutely amazing! We spend the nights at different refuges and Gites, which were really nice and comfortable! Before doing the Toubkal summit we did the Aguelzim pass, passing from Azzeden Valey to the Toubkal Valey! There was a lot of snow (starting from 2.500m altitude) and we did it as a team!! Opening he route through the snow! We are experienced Pyrinees Mountaineers and we definitively recommend Rachid to Mountaineers who want to go hard and tough in the Atlas ;-)Above all, Rachid always knew how and when to maintain our privacy but also when to come by to join the group! :-)We don't know what more to say, just that we definitively recommend Rachid as an Atlas guide, for every kind of visit, either family tourism or hard mountaineering!I hope the photos say the rest :-)Thank you Rachid!p.s. - the food was absolutely amazing!!! We eat so much and so goood!!!!"

I want to thank him for such an excellent job. From the moment he picked us up at Marrakech Airport until the time he returned us to the Medina we were in his safe hands.We are a pretty mixed group and Rachid, along with his colleague Abdull, seemed to be everywhere, all the time, offering a helping hand, a smile, some local knowledge or just a chat. The organisation of the trek was highly professional, and Rachid's time estimates were very accurate. His patience in answering our endless questions does him credit. The cooked lunches were tasty and portions were large.I would highly recommend Rachid to anyone considering a trip to the Atlas Mountains. I look forward to the day that I return there myself.And \u2026 the view from the top is something else!!"

He stopped off at certain set points and explained about the Berbers and how they live. We then stopped off at a farmers house he welcomed all of us into his home gave is home made bread and drank mint green tea which was really lovely. The tour is very educational and makes you realise just how lucky we are within the uk. At the foot of the mountain we stopped for lunch within the next village. You often see hikers taking advantage of the facilities here before the trek to the top of the mountain peak. The food was lovely and we felt welcomed at all times, you can also see Richard bransons hotel up here where I'm sure is expensive to stay within the tranquil surroundings. The 4x4 jeeps where very comfortable and time went quickly on this enjoyable day. Take bottled water for journey and be click happy."

Our route took us through several Berber villages before continuing to the summit of Mt Toubkal (4167m) on the fourth day. Our guide Rachid was really friendly and was happy to chat to us throughout the trek, answering any questions we had related to the landscape, Berber life and culture. I really got to learn more about the local way of life as well as take in the stunning views! Rachid and his team provided us with tasty food and all the accommodation we had was excellent! We were lucky enough to stay in a room in a Berber home in one of the villages on the first night and then the second two nights were spent in local refuges which were perfect for us! I couldn't fault the experience we got on our trip as we were so well looked after. It was an experience I will never forget! I would highly recommend Rachid and his tour company for any treks in the atlas mountain area!"

We went via various Berber villages, and concluded with summitting Mt Toubkal (4167m). Rachid and his team were 100% genuine, friendly and experienced. They were willing to answer many questions, from hiking and landscape to culture and history based. They also had a great sense of humour which we really enjoyed. We really didn't see any other tourists until the third day when we arrived at the Toubkal refuges. All accommodation was excellent for hiking standards, in my opinion! Food was delicious! If you are climbing Toubkal I would suggest doing a few extra days, instead of doing the direct up and down the same route which most people seem to do. However, Rachid would also be excellent to take on day hikes or other routes! Prices are definitely reasonable too - as there is no outside companies getting commission. We definitely had a trip full of memorable experiences all thanks to Rachid and his team."

Our family of four (two girls 9 and 6) spent 3 days on a circular walk from Imlil with Rachid Azdat.He is a great guide: genuine, knowledgable, proud of his Berber roots, always concerned for our safety, good at composing photographs (always handy for those family holiday snaps!) and best of all he was a huge hit with our kids - working tirelessly to humour them and motivate them to walk just that little bit further. I've no hesitation in recommending him to other families who also want a Moroccan adventure! Also, the walk we did with two mules, Rachid and two muleteers (who were funny, helpful and hardworking) from Imlil to Tizi Oussem, then Tinzert and back, was excellent! Pretty hard work even for two relatively fit adults, and the kids rode the mules for more than half the time, but the scenery is stunning, the remote villages are eye-opening, and the sense of achievement each day is well worth the effort."

The country is beautiful, with stunning colours and completely different to everything I know! What made it extra special was Marrakech Tours Trips - Moha and Sayd. They will add to your adventure should you choose to travel with them. They have an infectious sense of fun and devilment that you can't ignore. Their attention to detail is second to none. On our return from the dessert we had to get a jeep from the base where the camels stayed to the main road to catch the bus to Marrakech. Enjoying the experience of 4 wheel driving through the dunes my phone fell out of my pocket without me realising. A half hour on the road it dawned on me. One quick phone call from Moha to Sayd had the whole thing sorted. My phone was on the next tour to Marrakech and was handed to me at a location that was most convenient for me and my boyfriend. Not stopping the amazing service there, my boyfriend and I had bought a 5 day / 4 night package and an extra 2 days, outside of the package, to visit Essouirra, another town by the beach. Sayd gave us amazing tips and tricks on how to get there, things to do, place to see etc. On the day we were flying home to Dublin, Sayd organised a private driver to take us from Marrakech to the airport. When we got in the car Sayd called to make sure we were well looked after and had enough time to get to the airport for our flight...I'm sure the other packages out there are great but from my boyfriend's and my experience we can't recommend Marrakech Tours Trips highly enough. 5 Star service from 5 Star people. Much love, best wishes and success to Marrakech Tours Trips for the future xxx"

We definitely made the right choice! Our day at the waterfalls was incredible only to be equalled by our trip to the coast. Then came the 2 day Sahara experience and BOOM what an EPIC adventure. Our driver, Husain, might be one of my favourite people in the world, the most awesome/entertaining driver I've ever met. Despite only being able to communicate in our shared broken italian we spent 8 hours bonding!  The desert experience itself was incredible, nothing too taxing and although it felt a bit organised at time that wasn't a problem. The guides were incredible, the main man Mohammed and Sayd were great fun and once you speak to them on the level they'll show you a great time!

After meeting lots of people in Morocco, Sayd was the coolest and now consider him a great friend. I was sick for a couple of days and every day he would go to the market to get me fresh herbs and make me this milky mint concoction that surprisingly (literally) took my awful cough and fever away. Everyone will try sell you something in Marrakech but the tour Sayd does is truly amazing and authentic and he won't just take you here and there like every one tour guide is Morocco but will actually stay with you and have a good time with you all as well and be apart of the experience which makes things so much more fun. He is also from the Sahara, not Marrakech, thus his knowledge of the surroundings you will encounter throughout the tour are a lot more in depth and interesting to listen to."

I did a trip through the desert of Merzouga and also went to A\u00eft Ben Haddou and Ouarzazate. In Merzouga we stayed a couple of days sleeping in haimas, eating and playing traditional music, all these accompained with very hospitable and kind people. I would recommend anyone to do that and also to see other villages and places in this wonderful country which is Morocco."

We got to see to see so much more of Morocco than I anticipated, and all of it was so beautiful. Even though some of the car rides were long, the scenery was so gorgeous, you don't even mind. Every meal that you are given is AMAZING!!! Especially the night that you are out in the desert. It is seriously like you are staying in a five star hotel, desert style. Incredible. The night in the desert was let alone worth the money. I've never enjoyed something so much in my life. We rode camels into the sunset (which was absolutely spectacular), then played bongo drums, ate amazing food, and looked at the amazing stars in the desert. It was absolutely incredible. I would definitely recommend this tour group to anybody looking to see Morocco and have some fun. Iddir was amazing, and made the experience that much more awesome! He was was funny, informational, and made the trip one to remember!! I'll definitely be back at some point in my life! Thank you for a great memory that I will cherish forever Marvelous Morocco Tours!!"

We got to go to meet some of the local nomadic peolple for a little bit and get a taste of real Morrocan life.Iddir is a real local and brings a lot of his knowledge to the trip. It feels like being brought around by a distant cousin or relative. He spoke great english ( as well as many other languages) and answered any questions we had. He brough us to a lot of little off the road spots that you wouldnt get the chance to see otherwise as well as joining in on the fun. When we booked the tour, we were expecting to be sleeping in hostels or self-cooking accommodation but instead, Iddir booked us into great hotels. All weith mod cons, excellent service, food and music. We felt very welcomed and looked after in each place we stayed. Then in the evening he would check in to make sure we had everything we needed as well as teaching me how to read the stars in the desert. That he himself had learned from his grandfather. He is an excellent tour guide. He looked after us very well. We felt very well cared for and brought around. What makes me write such a positive review is that he made us feel very welcome as friends rather than just a tourist visiting. I strongly recommend him for any family visiting."

Not only did we have an amazing time touring the Dades Valley, the Sahara Desert, the High-Atlas and Mid-Atlas Mountains, but we also learned a tremendous amount about the history of the country, the people, and made some new friends along the way. The goal of the trip for me was to wake up in the Sahara Desert on my birthday and what I got was so much more. In planning this part of the trip, we read so many great reviews for Marvelous-Morocco Tours and about Iddir specifically as a guide. Iddir was extremely responsive from the very first email, and in expressing our wishes for the trip \u2013 he came through and tailored everything. He was fun and easy going, and the hotels he arranged were like something out of a dream! Some of the highlights of the tour included camping in the Sahara desert and traveling out on camels. We saw unbelievable landscapes all along the way, and we also had the pleasure of meeting his sister and family who prepared a home cooked meal that was absolutely delicious!There are so many wonderful things to say about the trip but not enough space to write it all.

So it was the 2 of us in an very comfortable 4x4, and Iddir was our driver & guide. We asked for medium priced accommodation & were pleasantly surprised how delux the small hotels were. Breakfast and dinner were included and delicious. We could even order wine, which we found difficult in Tangier. We did an overnight camel ride into the desert which was magical. The day was 107F so Iddir made sure we were properly clothed and onto our camels in the early evening. He then showed up at dinner to make sure all was well.Our \"tent\" had a huge bed, flush toilet, sink & shower. We were lucky and able to have a private campsite, dinner, music & stargazing with story telling with Hassan our camel whisperer. We highly recommend this company for senior citizens or any age who are looking for a trip with a guide who will go out of their way to make sure you are having an enjoyable trip.Iddir owns the company and personally makes sure his guides (I think their are 5 total) fit the needs, language and interests of each client."

On the first day we did an excellent tour of Kasbah de bin haddou and would highly recommend it.The camel excursion and camping in the Sahara desert is one of those bucket list adventures.

He always was able to answer our questions, and was full of fun facts about the areas we drove through. The desert was amazing, and Iddir made sure to arrive at the perfect times with the best lighting, taking us around to various viewpoints to take our photos. A friend of Iddir gave us a tour around a local market in Rissani, which was so much different than the souks in Marrakesh! We were given a wealth of information in a spice shop, and were able to see the market from a local perspective - something that is still very memorable! We also had the chance to visit a local nomad store, where we were shown various authentic local craftsmanship, including beautiful rugs.All of the accommodation exceeded our expectations - absolutely beautiful! We never felt unsafe when we were with Iddir. We did not want to take the cinema tour in Ouarzazate, so he was even was able to take us (with our request) again to Ait Ben Haddou, where a guide led us on a hike through nearby meadows and rivers, giving us a view of the city many other tourists don't get.On the way home, we were suggested to a different restaurant than the usual place. This place was so off the beaten path that we had to have our order placed for us. There, we had some of the best tagine in all of Morocco, and a beautiful view, too!

He is very knowledgeable about the places you'll visit and is very fun to be with. He booked us in reasonably-priced and very beautiful hotels during our tour. This man has class and is extremely gracious and respectful towards his clients, especially to women. We were four girls traveling and we felt safe and at ease with Iddir. We are very thankful for his Marvelous Morocco Tours! :)"

I emailed him to find out what Marvelous Morocco Tours offers and got a response within a couple of hours. From that moment on I knew I got the right people. Iddir was extremely professional, accommodating and flexible in planning our trip. It took my friend and I a while to figure out what exactly we wanted to do during the trip, but Iddir made it easy for us. We travelled 4 days and three nights with Mohammed from Fes to Marrakesh through the desert and all those incredible places. We got to see a lot, ask thousands of questions about the culture and life in Morocco and eat great fresh food. Mohammed made the trip very special for us and we even asked him to spend one more extra day to take us to Essaouira on our last day in Morocco. I expected a lot from this trip, but got so much more thanks to Mohammed and Iddir.You guys ROCK!"

I was skeptical of all the five star reviews on here and reading through the reviews there was a common theme - Iddir. Iddir runs marvelous Morocco tours and was also our guide for the 3day/2night trip from Marrakesh to Fes. He is knowledgable, personable, funny, and a joy to be around. You can tell Iddir has developed close relationships with the community as they all seem to know him and greet him warmly. What sets this tour apart from the rest is that it is an independent operator and they truly want you to have an authentic experience. We spoke with other travelers where their tour guides ended up taking them to visit an uncles shop or a workshop trying to sell souvenirs. Not once did Iddir take us anywhere commercial. Instead we visited a local market in Rissani to see how the villagers traded livestock, we visited caves where the nomads lived and would have had tea with if they hadn't moved on just a few days before, we pulled over to the side of a road to view fossils, we even had lunch with Iddir's sister and her family. Our time with Iddir was one of the highlights of this trip. He definitely deserves all those 5 star reviews. Shukraan Iddir! From Coffee and Tea!"

We had the pleasure of spending 5 days with our guide and owner of the company, Iddir, on a trip through the Atlas Mountains and Sahara desert from Marrakech to Fes. We stayed in 4 different places along the way and each and every hotel was perfect and more than anything we had expected. Iddir took care of everything; from picking us up at our Raid in Marrakech, keeping the days on schedule, planning for meals, relaxation, photo points, handling luggage, and to sharing a wealth of information on the places we were visiting and the cultures in Morocco. We especially loved the 2 days we got to spend in Merzouga and the Erg Chebbi Dunes. The camel trek was a blast and the accommodations both in the dunes and in Merzouga were fantastic! Spending the day with Iddir cruising around Merzouga was a highlight of our tour, as it is his hometown and readily shared what he loved about the desert with us. I could go on and on about how much fun we had and about the details of our trip, but to sum it up - it was a trip of a lifetime, book a trip with Marvelous Morocco Tours - and you won\u2019t regret it. Of our 3 weeks in Morocco, these 5 days were most definitely THE HIGHLIGHT of our trip. From the knowledge we gained, the stories we all shared, the good music while road tripping, and our new found friend and desert brother, Iddir, we felt absolutely lucky to have booked this trip and we are sure it won\u2019t be our last!"

The tour offers so much for a very reasonable price (we are students and it was perfectly affordable). The booking was uncomplicated and Iddir met all our requests. We did a private 4 days/3 nights Marrakesh to Marrakesh tour with a camel ride and one night in the desert. Our tour guide Youssef was a great guy and even spoke German very well. Our driver Ibrahim really made use of the 4x4 jeep and showed us spots we wouldn\u00b4t have seen on our own. We chose the cheaper price option that included middle-range hotels and all the hotels exceeded our expectations (pretty, clean, pool, etc.). Our personal highlight was the night in the sahara. There was a bonfire, berber music, shisha smoking and a beautiful night sky with countless starts. Iddir was not our guide but we met him along the way and he is a very nice, funny and relaxed guy. One day we were invited for lunch at his sisters house, she made couscous and berber pizza for us - another highlight for us!We loved Morocco and we will be back for another trip!"

I honestly cannot put into words how surreal this trip was. My girlfriends (5 in total) travelled with Iddir, our guide, on a 4 day trip through the Sahara (Marrakech to Fes). We travelled around in a beautiful Jeep which accomodated all five of us well. Although, I was a bit reluctant to travel to Morocco with a group of young girls, I cannot stress enough how safe and protected we felt throughout the entirety of the trip. Iddir, our guide, was one of the most welcoming, knowledgeable and fun tour guides I have ever experienced. He always made sure we were well looked after and experienced authentic Morocco. If you are thinking of doing a big trip... I would strongly recommend that you look into Marvelous Morocco Tours which is much more personal. Iddir and his colleagues will no doubt be able to show you a much more authentic, wholesome and inspiring Morocco. Iddir picked us up from our hostel in Marrakech and had everything carried through the busy streets to his Jeep which sat outside of the Medina. This is where we started our amazing trip. Some of the trips highlights included:- Atlas Mountain tours (snowball fights included)-Jeep rides through the Sahara (sitting on the outside of the jeep)-Ksar of Ait-Ben Haddou Day Trip-Gorges of Dades Day Trip-Authentic lunch with Iddir's family (The most amazing and welcoming family you could ever imagine)-Merzouga camel trek/camping overnight (bonfire under the stars)-Sandboarding in the Sahara -Constant food stops in the most authentic Moroccan areas-Beautiful, clean and unique hotels I don't even think this review does this trip enough justice. This will be a trip I remember for the rest of my life. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need further information."

I don't think we could have picked a kinder more helpful tourguide! Iddir went above and beyond multiple times to ensure we felt comfortable and at home during the entire tour. Unfortunately, our luggage was lost on the airplane on our way over to Morocco, Iddir took it upon himself to call the airport relentlessly for four days until we got our luggage back! During those four days he still provided us with incredible tours while he would continuously work at getting our luggage back. During some of the long car ride Iddir would entertain us with clever riddles and funny jokes, which made the time pass quickly! He would also pull off on the side of the road to show us a magic trick or even just to have a snowball fight in the mountains. He took us to see many amazing sites and also booked us to stay in some pretty awesome hotels. There is not one bad thing to say about this guy! When we were booking our trip we were a little surprised and skeptical to see that he only had perfect reviews on here, but after touring with him, I can say without a doubt he deserves every one of them! I would highly recommend anyone to go on a tour with him or his company!"

As 5 girls, we were nervous about travelling to Morocco but instantly felt safe once we met Iddir. He told us about his life growing up and we met some of his friends and family. He was very much a celebrity in every town we stopped in which gave us extra opportunities to meet interesting people such as having lunch at his sister's home and having tea with a nomad family. We traveled in style, checking out attractions and enjoying local experiences. The accomodation each night was beautiful and authentic. The food at the hotels and camp was delicious and for lunch Iddir recommendation great local restaurants.The best part of the trip was talking to Iddir and hearing about his life and Moroccan culture.

Iddir picked us up exactly on time at our riad in Marrakech and in the very comfortable 4x4 we drove through the Tizi n'Tichka pass, down to Ait Ben Haddou and through to the desert where we got to ride camels and spend the night in a traditional Berber tent. He was an incredibly safe driver and very courteous. He guided us through the excursion and was able to answer every question that we asked. The night in the desert was beyond compare! The tent was spacious, the food served was excellent and we even got some live entertainment in the form of drums and singing! Not to mention then night sky which to our delight they called \"Berber tv\"! The next day the pass was closed due to snow and without a word of complaint our lovely Iddir drove 350km out of the way to get us back to the riad in Marrakech.

            "review": "I wouldn't visit Morocco any other way. This was the trip of a lifetime! Iddir was an awesome guide: enthusiastic, funny, knowledgeable, and fluent in multiple languages (including English, French, Spanish, Berber, and Arabic). He took care of everything during our trip, including finding places to stay, making reservations at restaurants, securing transportation between different points, showing us around each stop on our itinerary, and hiring local guides as needed (e.g. for Fes and the Sahara). I don't normally book guides when traveling, but this was such a great experience that I wouldn't consider visiting Morocco without Iddir.OUR TRIP* 9 people* We visited Marrakech, Ait Benhaddou, Ouarzazate, Dades Valley, Merzouga/Sahara, Fes, and Essaouira over the course of a week.SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS* We booked our first night's riad (in Marrakech) without Iddir's guidance and had a relatively negative experience (no hot water in the showers, rude service, no breakfast). * By comparison, the riads that Iddir reserved for us were excellent (very good service, fantastic rooms, phenomenal food). * We found that many riads in Morocco have unanimous 5-star reviews on TripAdvisor whether they're good or not, so having Iddir's help finding the best places to stay was essential. The places that Iddir booked for us were also generally cheaper than the first riad we booked on our own, so we didn't pay a premium for the peace of mind.GETTING AROUND MOROCCO* Because of our group's size, Iddir secured a large van and a driver for our trip. The van was spacious and comfortable, and we didn't have any problems getting around easily.* There are random police checkpoints throughout Morocco, so having a guide who speaks Berber/Arabic and has the proper paperwork is a must. These checkpoints were not a problem at all with Iddir, but if our group had tried to rent a car and drive around Morocco ourselves, it would have been very stressful and maybe impossible.* Iddir was mindful of regularly stopping for bathroom breaks, making sure we had enough water, and ensuring we stopped at photogenic spots so we could take lots of photos :)* Along the way, Iddir also taught us about Morocco's history and culture, and was a generally cheerful and enthusiastic guide for the entire week, despite being stuck with the nine of us!* The drive between some points (e.g. Merzouga to Fes) can be quite long. This is unavoidable given how large Morocco is, but something to be aware of as you plan your itinerary. We actually didn't mind the long drives as it gave our group time to talk between points.HIGHLIGHTS* Morocco is so large and diverse that after 1 week we felt like we'd had a month's worth of experiences. From the gorges of the Dades Valley to the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara to the beaches of Essaouira, it's hard to believe we did so much in such a short period of time. * The overnight tour into the Sahara was truly astounding. I don't want to ruin it for anyone by divulging too many details, but suffice to say that this was the best part of our trip, which is saying a lot--if you come to Morocco, you MUST do this.* The riads Iddir booked were awesome--especially the riad in Dades and the Dar in Fes.* Iddir will make sure you get to fully experience the food and music of Morocco. Again, I don't want to ruin any surprises :)* The Medina in Fes has some fascinating history, and the local guide Iddir found for us was very friendly and informative.* At the end of our trip, we decided that we wanted to add Essaouira to our itinerary, and asked Iddir and the driver if they would be willing to extend the trip. They were very flexible and made this happen on virtually no notice, including finding us a place to stay and taking care of all logistics.* Morocco may be the most Instagrammable place on the planet. You're going to leave with a trove of unbelievable photos.GROUP SIZE* Iddir mentioned that he has had groups large and small (from solo travelers to groups with 50+ people). For our group of 9 people, we used a large van to drive around Morocco, but with a smaller group Iddir said he uses a 4x4."

Iddir was very informative and fun he gave us the history of the towns and cities we passed through in the Atlas Mountains, and stopping were we wished for some photos. We even got the chance to meet some of his family which was really lovely. We also met a nomad family who were also very kind and gave us some Berber whisky ( tea!). The only downside to our trip was that we were sorry we didn't book a longer trip with Iddir to show us more of Morroco. So if you can I would recommend Marvelous Morocco tours to see as much of Morroco as you can - it's a great place Even when we finished our trip in Fes, Iddir dropped us an email to see how we were getting on and if we needed any guidance or recommendations. P.s don't play UNO with him... He cheats! Only messing it was great fun. Book it and enjoy :-)"

As a rule I have traveled independently and was at first not sure about the need for a tour. It was quickly apparent that this was the way to see the Morocco beyond the sites of the cities. We (a group of 4 friends) signed up for the 4 day 3 night tour beginning in Marrakech and ending in Fez. We had great opportunities to take (hundreds of) photos, visit extraordinary attractions, ride camels, hike dunes at sunset and sunrise. And just to talk and learn about this beautiful country.Iddir's enthusiasm, particularly for the desert area and nomad life was apparent from the beginning. And it was impossible to not be caught up in his passion for his land. He gave us time to enjoy our visit, while making sure we didn't miss anything along the way. The tour with Iddir felt more like a trip of discovery with a new Moroccan friend. I would enthusiastically recommend this tour to anyone thinking to visit Morocco."

Iddir picked us up from our Riad in Marrakech and basically kept us entertained by sights and stories til he dropped us of in Fes 4 days later. We got some lovely photos, climbed some dunes, saw some kasbahs, met some camels, heard some bad jokes and lost a few card games along the way. it was a great experience and I would highly recommend Marvelous Morocco tours to people looking for a really authentic experience travelling around Morocco and some great memories"

Never thought I'd say it- but listen to your mother. I do have faith that we could have navigated Morocco sufficiently, however Iddir's tour optimised our time, and gave us the breathing space to truly enjoy the magnificent country that is Morocco.For any of you researching companies, I can vouch that I did too and by far this is the best I found. And not only has it lived up to my expectations, but it has also exceeded them. Iddir's passion for the country is so evident when speaking to him, and is was the quiet moments spent with him discussing nomadic customs in the desert that really felt authentic. Every company you will find can tick the sights off your list, but Iddir's authenticity and passion makes his company something truly special. Also, the flexibility is great! You want to go somewhere? No problem! You have a mother who wants to stop for photos every kilometre...sure thing! (Of course you still have to make it to the destination as I continually reminded my mum)Thankyou Iddir for a magical trip."

My aunt, friend, and I took the 4 days and 3 night tour and were exposed to the Atlas mountain, beautiful landscape, and delicious food.

I went expecting to fall in love with the scenery and views. I left having fallen in love with the Berber people and culture. Prior to arriving in Morocco, I had emailed Iddir several times to plan the trip. His responses were always prompt, thorough, and friendly. It was a pleasure to finally meet him after so much communication leading up to the trip. Iddir had taken care of every detail of our tour. We felt incredibly welcome and did not have to worry about anything. In addition to his vast knowledge of Moroccan history and culture, Iddir kept us entertained with funny stories and riddles along the way. This was by far the most memorable trip I have taken - and I could not have planned it on my own. Iddir's expertise, relationships with other people along our journey, and welcoming presence are what made this trip so special. We truly felt like family by the end of our tour, and leaving Morocco was like saying goodbye to a dear friend. I will definitely be back again and will always trust Iddir to help me get the most out of my visits. I cannot recommend his services highly enough!"

            "review": "Truly, a trip of a lifetime.. My boyfriend and I finished our 11 day tour earlier this month with Ibrahim followed by Iddir, and it was absolutely the most memorable and wonderful experience. If you are looking for an authentic and truly welcoming tour of the insanely beautiful country that is Morocco, this is the team to guide you. The exceptional private tour is completely catered to you, and you are guided by a marvellous guide (who drives you in their spacious, comfortable vehicles) and they welcome you like family.It is the furthest thing away from the grossly overpacked buses of 30-40 people who are herded around like cattle from tourist trap to tourist trap (during our trip we even had others who were having an awful experience ask for the name of our driver and tour company).I could go on and on about how absolutely great this team is, so I'll try to keep it brief by providing some details and tips in point form:Planning- I started with a simple email, just letting them know we were looking for an 11 day tour on specific dates- I was provided 3 levels of accommodations to chose from, and we opted for the luxury accommodations as it was a special occasion (and if it is within your budget, do chose this option - it was like living like kings and queens, including staying at a riad that Bono stayed in at Fes)- After my obsessive combing of trip advisor forums and lonely planet guide books, I was ready to ask for some fairly specific stops - none of which I needed to say, because Iddir really truly has thought of everything, and is immensely experienced. He has planned more private tours than I ever hope for the rest of my entire life. (Basically, just trust in Iddir - he really knows what he is talking about, he has gone through his beautiful country upside down and sideways - trust his recommendations)- Before the trip, we had sent Iddir a nominal deposit via Western Union and paid the remainder when we met up with him.Logistics & Tips- Airport pick up and drop off - though our guided trip did not technically start until the day after we arrived, we booked the hotel through this team and it included airport pick up and drop off, which was immensely appreciated. It meant that we landed and did not have to stress out about haggling over taxi prices or struggling to find riads or anything of that sort. Very thoughtful detail.- Our trip was a one-way direction as, we arrived in Casablanca and departed in Marrakesh. If possible, try to do the same as to avoid losing precious time going back over the same sites you have already seen.- Our absolute favourite night was the night in the desert after our camel trek - if possible, do the two nights, you won't regret it. (Also, have a small bag/backpack as taking your gigantic airplane-sized luggage isn't really convenient on camels - you can leave your luggage safe and sound at the riad at the edge of the desert)- Best bit of advice? Try the BBQ! After a few days of eating couscous and tagine (though amazing and delicious) you will crave a little something else, and the BBQ places are to die for, amazing meat grilled to perfection. The guides will know which ones are best and worth going to.- If like me, you also intend to support the womens co-ops for the hand made goods from Morocco, trust your guides to recommend you to the right places. Some of the shops in especially the big city medinas are not so reliable - our one shopping tip we received was to buy the goods where you can see them being made, which was great advice.Regardless of if you have just a handful of days or a couple of weeks, you will be in great hands with Marvelous Morocco Tours.They will welcome you like an old friend, take you to the places off the beaten path that big tour buses cannot ever go to, and share with you more about their culture and country than you could ever learn from even a million online reviews.To Iddir and his team, a million thanks! Shukran & Sa-haa!"

Iddir, the passionate, knowledgeable and inspirational owner of this bespoke touring company, lead us on a fantastic trip though his diverse and interesting country. From the cities to mountains, from small villages to the beautiful desert country of his heart, Iddir was a font of knowledge and information who never tired of our questions or photo stops. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy, taking us to a mix of well-known sights and the less-worn paths, along the way educating us about Moroccan and Berber history and culture and keeping us entertained with his wry humour (and terrible jokes!) Iddir clearly greatly enjoys and cares deeply about what he does, and has great interest in and understanding of people, all of which mean his tours are unforgettable. In the words of my daughter \"Morocco wouldn't have been quite as awesome without Iddir\" I really did not want to leave and hope I will be able to come back again to spend more time in the desert with Iddir.

It was one of the best decisions we could have made. Iddir was very quick to respond with a customized itinerary and the price seemed very fair. We sent Iddir a deposit through Western Union before leaving to Morocco, and spent a few days in Marrakesh on our own before starting the tour. On the assigned day our tour guide Mohammed Maazouz showed up on time at our riad with a clean and comfortable SUV. I can't say enough nice things about Mohammed. Polite, kind, respectful, a good and safe driver, and so knowledgeable about Morocco. Mohammed is Berber and grew up in the Sahara desert. He entertained us with stories of his childhood as well as giving us historical information about the cities and sites we visited. Because it was just me and my partner and Mohammed traveling together, Mohammed was able to personalize our trip every day, asking us what types of sites we wanted to see, where and what we preferred to eat, and how much time we wanted to spend at each place. For example, one morning he asked us, \"What are you in the mood for today? There is a wonderful market we could stop at on the way to Merzouga if you are in the mood to shop, or if you prefer we could visit a salt mine or an abandoned casbah I know of that is off the track of most tours.\" When we wanted to buy souvenirs he was very helpful in advising us if things were a good price, or telling us to wait until the next city or market. He never pushed us to buy from any sellers.He took us a few times deep into the desert off the road to meet local berber families. This was probably the highlight of our trip as we were able to spend time with actual families in there homes, sharing tea and learning about their life in the desert. It was fascinating! We met other tourists in Fez that had been on similar group tours and they were surprised when we told them how wonderful and personal our tour had been. They described their tour as being a large group that was shuffled and hurried along from site to site and mediocre group meals. Our experience couldn't have been more different than that, and it seemed like they had paid a much higher price for their tour.Mohammed was always cheerful and pleasant to spend time with. I feel as if we not only had a wonderful guide, but also made a new friend."

You will not be disappointed with Iddir and Marvelous Morocco tours!

We started our trip in Marrakech, where we beforehand booked a 3-day trip by email with Marvelous Morocco Tours and arranged all the detailes prior to our departure. The trip was excellent, Iddir is a great driver and tourist guide and always in a good mood. He was explaining us all the way and was trying to bring us Africa closer. We started our trip in Marrakech and passing Atlas to come to the other side, closer to the Sahara. We saw lots of very interesting places - everything as posted on their website. We spent the first night in a very nice hotel with great food. The next day we continued exploring the other side of Atlas. Iddir prepared one very nice surprise - a lunch at his sister's house which made the trip even more familiar. and the whole experience more authentic. We finally arrived to the trekking point. Probably one of the best parts of the trip, riding kamels in beautiful Sahara. The berber camp is also fantastic: very well equiped (water, showers, european toilets and one or two bedroom tents). We had dinner there and then the berber party. The third day we were trying to get to Fes. However due to some bad weather (snow in Atlas) we spent the night in a hotel in the middle of Atlas (all arranged by Iddir) and the next day we arrived to Fes. I can definitely recommend this trip - it is worth the price. You get what you pay."

My friend and I had a tour with Iddir through Marrakesh and beyond and it was one of the most enjoyable holiday experiences I have ever had. Iddir and the rest of his team were extremely well organized at every turn and my friend and I both felt safe and at ease for the entire trip. Everything was planned perfectly and went off without a hitch.I can't recommend Marvellous Morocco tours enough. This is hands down the best way to experience all of Morocco has to offer! The time I spent in Morocco will stay with me for the rest of my life. :)"

I found Iddir through Trip Advisor and our time with him was well worth it. We didn't have an agenda and hadn't done much research and just let Iddir lead the way. The SUV was very comfortable and Iddir told us about the towns as we passed through each of them. One major highlight for me is that he took us to his sister's house for lunch. It was a great way to really get a glimpse of local life and the meal we had there was an AMAZING Berber pizza. Seriously, I wish I could get that in the states. In hindsight, something I would recommend ,and will keep in mind for next time, would be to do a little more research so I could tailor my trip to the types of things I like to do. For example, we were driving through a town on a day when they happen to have their local outdoor market so I asked if we could visit it. Iddir was happy to oblige and I'm glad I got to see it.Marvelous Morocco Tours was really a great way to be introduced to the desert!"

The vehicle was air conditioned and in great condition. Mohommad and Brahim went ouf of their way in offering to escort us to dinner and walking with us anywhere (we didn't need it as everyone in Morocco was so friendly).We saw things that we never would have seen without them. The camel trek they set up was awesome as well. They even took us to a local fish market and helped us order firsh, have it prepared, and eat like the locals!Overal, it was a great trip! I would highly recommend Marvelous Morocco for all of your travelling needs. They made our trip a breeze and everything they booked and organized was great (guides, hotels, etc.). This is by far THE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL in Morocco!"

As a seasoned traveler, I have experienced some truly wonderful guides and some insanely terrible guides - Our tour guide, Iddir, was the best guide anyone could even possibly imagine.My friend and I, both females in our mid-20's, decided to go to Morocco for a last minute holiday tour. From the get-go, Iddir was extremely responsive to our emails never letting our questions go unanswered. This was a clear sign of the great experience we were to have.Upon arrival, Iddir was prompt and on time to pick us up from the airport so that we did not have to wait. He then communicated to us our plans for the day. He moved efficiently through our day so that we could maximize the amount we saw. Iddir knew exactly the best places to stop to take pictures without us having to even ask. As we were settling into our lodging accommodations, Iddir was always there to ensure that we were happy with our room and would go out of his way to find us a new room if there was something we would have preferred. He kept our preference in mind as the tour proceeded.There is a clear passion Iddir shows for his work as he deeply cares for the enjoyment of the tourists. He was extremely attentive and never let a request go unanswered.Prior to enlisting with the tour, my friend and I worried that if we were joining a tour, we would not have enough time to explore the cities by ourselves. Need not worry! Iddir's tours are completely customize-able and allows time for tourists to go and discover the city on their own if they please.Traveling with Iddir was a magnificent experience as it almost seemed like we were on a road trip with a lifetime friend - who happened to be extremely knowledgeable. Iddir is perfect for all ages as he is timely, professional, and communicates well. My friend and I never had to ask Iddir for our plans as Iddir made the initiative to inform us what we would be doing and what we may need.Marvelous Morocco Tours (MMT) made our trip go extremely smoothly. Never once were my friend and I stressed, worried, or unhappy with any of the accommodations, plans, or communications. We had originally thought we could plan a trip around Morocco, but after experiencing the tour with MMT, we realized that we could never have planned a trip like the tour. Nor would the trip have been the same without Iddir.I only wish I had more friends to refer to MMT.Also, Iddir knows where the best couscous is."

Comfortably sitting in the back of his 4wd vehicle we were up, up, up into the Atlas mountains. Iddir shared his vast knowledge of his country with us. Since he was born in these mountains it was extensive. As a Berber who grew up in the area we were traveling in he knew it all and shared his knowledge with us. We definitely got the insiders view. Being alone we could ask to stop when we wanted and ask to see places not on the itinerary, too. The highlights of the trip for me were visiting a nomad dwelling in a cave really far removed from everything and everyone then another nomad family in a tent in the desert, having a lovely couscous lunch in the home of Iddir's sister, and the icing on the cake was camping in the sand dunes after riding in by camel. If you are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to do this trip, do it. You will not regret having gone."

The trip was well coordinated. The Toyota (or Japanese camel) was new and our driver, Abraham was very skilled. Our lodgings were clean and comfortable, especially the lavish desert tents complete with traditional rugs and real beds! For dinner we lounged on silk pillows and ate delicious foods. ****SUGGESTIONS FOR TRAVELERS:START and END IN DIFFERENT CITIES- The tours offered in Morocco involve quite a bit of driving, I would suggest starting in one city and ending in another to avoid repetition.BRING STOMACH MEDICINE FROM HOME- The chances of getting food poisoning in Morocco are higher than in other countries. Bring pepto bismol, Imodium etc. Also meds for motion sickness as the roads can be quite curvy. Unfortunately my friends and I did get sick from some food we ate in Marrakesh\u2019s main plaza and we were unprepared.BRING- Sunscreen, small flashlight, wetwipes, good walking shoes and comfortable pants for the camel trek.Once again we thank Iddir and Abraham for a wonderful experience. We are lucky to have met such nice people who are eager to share their traditions, culture, and history with travelers."

It turned out to be very good decision! We started our 10 days tour in Casablanca. Our driver Mohammed picked us up on the airport and our good time in a clean SUV started immediately. Our driver was also our guide who told us many things about his country, way of life and habits. His knowlege of many languages was surprising so comunication was not a problem at all.On our tour we visited many different cities. After visiting a mosque, crowdy streets and fabulous market in Casablanca, we visited colorful Marrakech. We couldn't stop admire happening on Jemma el Fna and all crazy things of the main square. After visiting Jardin Majorelle, we continued our trip in to astonish Atlas mountain. Uau! The road was very winding but the view was really amazing. Our guide stoped every time we wanted, so we could admire the view and get reall high mountain feeling. On the other site of high mountains we meet palm tree oasis, dates and good food. After visiting fosile workshop and pottery stores we continued our tour to meet, for us most amazing landscape, the desert. This part of the trip we will never forget! The camel ride from Merzouga into the Sahara desert was really interesting and also staying overnight in tents was interesting and hot. There were also other people in a desert camp, so we spend good time together with turists, local guides, playing music and eating excellent tagine. But must incredible was night sky full of stars. Unfortunatly we needed to continue our trip back on the other side of Atlas again. On our way we meet Barbary apes and high pine trees, vineyards and dogs. City feeling occur again on the streets of Fez and in incredible medina with tannery. More than this, we admired streets of Chefchaouen with unexpected collors. You shouldn't miss this! But most of all I recommend whole holiday package: kind people, good food, nice music on our way, colorful cities, amazing desert and safe feeling with our guide and driver Mohhamed. On the end of our tour, he took us on the Casablanca airport, and wished us Bon vojage, you should come again. I hope, we will."

If I have to be honest, the only thing that didnt like of the tour was the welcoming in the desert when we got to the tents. There was almost nobody expecting us, no one to tell us what to do, and it would have been awesome to have people there wellcoming us by singing, dancing, etc. We just had to wait a couple of hours for dinner without having nothing to do. After dinner they started making a show with drums but anyone wanted to atend because we just wanted to sleep. Next day we woke up early to see the sunrise and go back to the hotel by riding a camel. Just as amazing as before.The tour continued with Moha in his 4x4 and it was excellent! He drives really well in the dangerous cliffs. The hotels were so beautiful and the landscape is absolutely unbelievable.He drove us back to the riad in Marrakech and didnt leave us until we were inside of it.

We were taken to just the right amount of stops on our way to the desert to help make the long drive not seem so long. We have spoken to other families who have taken similar trips and we discovered they didn't see and do nearly the same amount of things we did--we were given the royal treatment. We travel quite a bit as a family and we would rate this experience amongst the top 3 things we have ever done--truly exceptional. Ahmed feels more like family to us than a guide.

It was wonderful experience. Our guides Hassan and Mohammed was really great. They organised everything, so we didn't have to worry about anything and we just enjoy our holiday. Riding camels, drinkink tea in oasis, having berber diner, listening to authentic music and sleeping in nomad tent, was really something, we can't forget. We hope, that opportunity to go back in beautiful desert, will come soon."

We were picked up promptly from a nearby cafe on the main square (our Riad wasn't accessible by car) and taken to the Palmeraie for our camel ride. We were given traditional Moroccan kaftas for our camel ride which ensured we were cool and safe from the sun (as a very pale Scottish person, I was particularly thankful). The man who took us round (Oodis I think?) was fantastic. He knew a lot about the camels, was happy to answer our questions and even made us our own small camel souvenirs to take home! We enjoyed some mint tea and traditional Moroccan biscuits at a nearby home halfway through the camel ride before setting back off again. I would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking of doing this while in Marrakech - it doesn't take too much time out of your day and if you're prone to sunburn (like I am) then you aren't out in the sun for too long either. Great experience from start to finish!"

First Visit...The day started of very well, we were picked up at the stated time and the journey to the quad biking experience was very good. On arrival we were politely greeted by the staff and kitted out with the appropriate gear. The bikes themselves were well maintained and cleaned ready to go. The day was split up so that we had a good 1 hour or so session on the bikes, a stop for a cup of local tea and biscuits in a locals abode and to finish up another hour or so session on the bikes. The level of quading was perfect for the group I felt a little restricted by the group itself.Second Visit...Myself and another member of the family decided to go back for a second day but this time we asked for it to be tailored a little different. We wanted a more advanced session and that is EXACTLY what we got! I have never had so much fun on a quad bike!!!!! Speed, climbs, drops, jumps, drifting lol, rivers etc Thank you VERY much Mohamed. I would love to go back and do a longer session if my body allowed it (very achy the next day). Worth every penny.*****"

We didnt think much of it at first, but when we went out it was amazing. 15 minutes practicing on 300cc engine bikes, and then the rest of the time was spent on driving through the desert, towns, ruins and roads (mainly desert- steep dunes, sharp drops and rocky surfaces) it felt really safe however as the bikes seemed to grip onto virtually anything. Midway through we stopped off for mint tea and buscuit before heading back out again. It was the highlight of our holiday and we managed to do it once again before flying out. The only issue is that we wished we could have done it after sunset in the dark. On a side note, If your going in the afternoon just before midday itl be cold (december time) so be prepared dont take your sunglasses (lost my raybans) and be prepared to get really dusty and ashy and if your taking any valubes such as phone, keys, wallet, make sure its secure and tight."

We noted down the contact details of the driver who picked us up from the airport to the hotel and he did quote us a cheaper price for the camel ride and quad biking trip. The camel ride was amazing - one of the highlights of the trip; unfortunately, can't say the same for the quad biking. Personally I didn't want to do quad biking anyways but to do this on the Atlas mountain that was crazy! I would have rather us ride the bikes on a flat surface where we had the camel ride and in hindsight we should have spoken up.We mainly used the company as a minicab service to drive us around and the cars were clean and spacious but my number one issue was the lack of communication - majority of the time we had a different driver than our main contact and we would have appreciated being told beforehand and in other cases we were constantly changing cars in between journeys (we only asked during or after so that was not good). That was very reckless on our side and luckily nothing bad happened but I would advise people to always ask questions and know what you are getting yourself into just for your own peace of mind.Having said that they were nice and we had free rides to the souks and supermarket but if there was better communication and understanding on both sides it would have lessen the anxiety."

We were collected on time from our riad by a very friendly driver and brought off to our starting point! We got a brief overview of how to use the quads as we haven't been on them before and then had a quick 5 minute practice before setting off! The ride through the desert was amazing and our great guide let us push ourselves a bit by bringing us on a few challenging (ish) hills and bits and hitting a few flat stretches of land so we could really give it some gas (got up to 80km/h at one point!)! We were also allowed a couple brief stops to get the feeling back in our hands (typically sun was a no show on the day we went so was a bit chilly) and got a chance to take some great pictures! After 2.5 hours we stopped in a lovely lakeside restaurant for lunch and it was unbelievable - so much food! We got a salad and bread and thought that was the lot but quickly followed was chicken and chips and even fruit for desert, much more than we expected or could fit in :). Then a short ride after back to the starting point which was nice and chilled! We got back and they brought us back to the riad as promised! Overall a great day, great price for what was provided and would definitely come back and recommend to anyone!

We booked the full day quad trip, which includes 4 hours of quad riding in the wastelands and hills outside of Marrakech and a great lunch (salad, tajin, fruits, tea/water/soda) at a berber village.The track was very varied and nothing hard even for a beginner. Some parts were more for thrill-seekers and if you're more skilled, you can go more off-road instead of following the guide. Our tour was after a full night of rain, so they provided us with wetproof clothing. However, our shoes were completely wet and muddy by the end (don't get me wrong, it only added to the adventure!), so be prepared.Our guide was not very talkative (or his English wasn't very good), so we mostly talked to each other. However, it's not like there's time to talk during the ride. We also had the lunch on our own, the guide did not join - that's maybe a bit sad but it depends on the people, maybe you enjoy privacy. However - as it says in the advertisement - lunch with traditional berber family - it just means they cook for you and you eat alone.All in all great value, great service and experience."

We were picked up on time and whisked away to an area outside of town past the Jardin Marjorelle. we were kitted out in helmets and goggles with hair nets to protect from greasy helmet linings! Pennie actually had brought some perfume to squirt inside the helmets which was not a bad idea as they do get a bit smelly. Set off cautiously at first as everyone needed to get to grips with their machines and how they handled on the sand and scrub land. After a short while we headed off across the wasteland....and to be fair it was a waste land in parts as the whole area seems to be a dumping ground for city waste. went over hills and down ravines into a river basin and crossed a river bed which was fun then headed off in to softer sand areas towards the next part of the trip which was the camel ride.Had a giggle doing the ride around a large compound area in amongst palm trees. Even dressed up which made it more silly and fun. I looked like a complete fool but at least Pennie laughed her socks off!After that bit, back on the bikes for a trip back to base but stopping off for lunch at a village on the way. Nothing too special and the village was basic and nothing old about it, food was nice.Finishing with last trek back to the base.all in all a fun morning, could have done more quad biking but the various stops restrict how much time is spent on the bikes. Still good fun though.Good fun, and well organised for a mornings outing. Views are nothing to write home about as mostly scrub land dispersed with rubbish dumps. I imagine a full day out would take you further into more scenic land.Thanks Simon"

You drive past berber villages and stop for tea at a local tea house. Went with two teenage girls (14 and 19) who loved this. Limit for driving is 16 (but with a helpful guide in the back the 14-yo drove perfectly). Can certainly be done with kids from 5-6 as passengers - you decide the speed and the adventurous ups- and downs. Company trustful, cared about safety and overall provided a pleasant experience.

Riding on these quads was absolutely amazing and we could definitely recommend you to go on the morning tour, because then it's a lot more cooler than in the afternoon. After one hour on the quads, we changed our rides for a more bumpy one.. the camels, which was absolutely wonderful.

Firstly at 1900dh this was an expensive day out by Moroccan rates so we expected it to be great.Sadly the lift we were to get was 30mins late. When we got to the quad biking location there was little introduction or welcome. The ride was fun and the area very interesting but we weren't able to stop, take photos etc.We then stopped for food at a little village. The food was brilliant and the person serving us was very friendly, such a contrast to our trip thus far. Once we'd eaten two very large and tasty courses and had some coke we rode onto the camel area.Our guide for the camels was very friendly and polite, between our broken French and his broken English we had a great time for an hour or so, though he would have gone longer I think. We gladly tipped him for a great experience.We then rode back on the quads to the pick up and we're driven back to our riad. Most of the journey back however was filled with the driver trying to convince us to go on one of their company's other trips. Not very pleasant and definitely my what we intend to do. Overall poor customer service and overpriced but we did enjoy many aspects of the trip."

This trip was booked online (1 hour camel ride and 2 hours Quad Biking) from reading other good reviews on TripAdvisor.I communicated with Fatima via email and she was very quick in responding to my queries, which is why I decided to book with RAK Adventures.No monies were paid upfront, just an agreed date and time - 14 September at 2.00pm.I was slightly apprehensive about this trip, as I have never ridden a camel or a quad bike before.When the RAK representatives. arrived punctually at the hotel, I was still apprehensive, as the vehicle did not look in the best of conditions, but once you were on the road to the destination, you could understand why! We had a half hour journey to the quad bike depot, where there was a toilet and lockers available to store any belongings.Helmets, goggles and a bottle of water were provided and a demonstration - brakes, accelerator and then we were off!Would recommend wearing dark clothing (long combat shorts/trousers) with deep, fastening pockets, so that you can put your camera/phone/money safe. Wear a pair of shoes that can be easily cleaned, as you will get filthy - covered in brown sand. Also you may wish to wear some fingerless bike/gym gloves, as your hands can ache after a while, gripping the bars.The quad ride was varied and bumpy at times, but the bikes were easy to use.After a hour on the bike, we were taken to the camels for our second part off the trip.The camels were surprisingly calm and well behaved. We were given traditional dress outfits to wear and then boarded our camels.This experience lasted an hour and although I was told by people that I would feel sea-sick, I didn't.After the camel ride, it was back in the quads again with a stop-off at local's house for lunch and refreshments. The host was very kind and hospitable and there was no pressure to tip, even though we wanted to, but did not have change.After lunch, we again biked back to the depot and were then transferred back to our hotel. We arrived back at approximately 6.45pmOnly one suggestion, it may be a good idea to offer the traditional mint tea at the local's house, instead of the lunch, as we would have been happy with this. It would be a nice opportunity to try something traditional and authentic for tourists.You do feel you want to tip everyone involved in the trip, as they all put the effort in to make your experience memorable. Photos were taken without obligation. We tipped at the end, when we were dropped off at he hotel. We gave 100dh (\u00a37). I would recommend that you take smaller note amounts to tip along the way, if you feel you would like to.The team were friendly, some spoke English/French. It was well organised and value for money.I would recommend this tour. It really did add to our holiday experience and one to remember!"

Said, who came to collect us was very friendly and so was his friend Mohammed, who dropped us back.The whole experience was great, everyone was warm and friendly. The quad biking was so fun, we returned to do it again before we went home. The camel ride was surreal and quite amusing. The lunch we had, was an experience in itself too, great food and luckily we got paired up with a British Moroccan family, making understanding the conversation that much easier.Would definitely recommend these guys. We booked straight through their website, got a confirmation and they turned up on the day at our Riad. Remember to wear clothes you don't mind ruining and bring a small rucksack!"

            "review": "quad biking in the desert. My husband and I booked the half day quad biking excursion in the desert yesterday and luckily there was room for us to do it this morning. We were promptly picked up from our hotel this morning and were taken to the site of the quad biking (about a half hr away). It was just us and another couple which was lovely, making the experience far more fun and intimate. The quad biking itself was great, it was fun and there was a lovely stop for some Moroccan tea in a very small old village. he quad biking was 2 hours and then we were taken straight back to our riad. The excursion was perfect, no need to organise anything or haggle for a taxi etc etc it was easy and well organised. There was a mix up with our payment, we realised at home after the excursion that we had slightly over paid. we thought that it would be unlikely for anyone to be able to help us at this point but decided to email the company anyway just to let them know. We straight away got an apologetic email saying that someone will come to our hotel and drop off the money that we are owed, and within an hour someone came. We were so pleasantly surprised by this experience, by the honesty of the company and their sincere apologies. we really thank them for this honesty and feel that it even further enhanced our experience today and proved that this company can be trusted. thank you! Alex and Sophie"

            "review": "Worth every penny. My girlfriend and I booked this on the spur of the moment. We chose for the two of us to go on 1 quad (2 hours) and also a camel ride (1 hour).We were picked up from our riad some distance from central marrakech at no extra charge and taken out into the rock desert after picking up some other passengers. Upon arriving, we were given a quick safety briefing, paid the fee and were taken on the quads along some flat land outside of the building to help us get used to turning and handling the quads.After this we were on our way across varying terrain along desert track for about 45 mins into the palm groves where we disembarked and went for a ride on the camels. The camel guide was very friendly and took photos for us on our own phones and cameras. Then it was back onto the quads and on to our next stop - a berber house where we were given water/coke and were cooked a fantastic meal.On the way we went across some more difficult terrain - through dips which may have been rivers at some point in time, over jumps (if you went quick enough), and through deep soft sand. All the time the guide (a young lad) was very attentive and kept looking back to ensure everything was fine. We went through some small villages and just before we got to the house the guide took us through some twists and turns in the sand where we got a chance to throw the quad around a bit more.After lunch we went back to our original starting point along a different route and had the chance to slalom through some steep dunes which was great fun (keep the throttle open though as if you lose speed the quad tends to turn in early).All in all a great experience.Take some Dirhams for tips as the guide (for the camels) will politely ask. We gave MAD100 (about \u00a37) but i think he would have been happy with MAD20. I also tipped the lad for the quads although he did not ask or expect it.Wear clothes which you don't mind getting sandy, and put phones and cameras in deep tight pockets as they will also get sandy no matter how much you try.We also had a bonus 'off-road' experience as the guy who took us back to the hotel in a 4x4 appeared to take a short cut back to the main road. This was great fun and in the UK people would pay \u00a330 for this alone!Thanks to all involved for making a great holiday even better with this fantastic and seamless experience.Ben & Jade"

A very humble, respectful man and an extremely responsible driver. We felt at great ease with him driving around Morocco. He would go the extra mile to make every minute of our trip memorable and always with a smile even after some very long days of driving. We would highly recommend him.Morocco is a mystical country and Camel Safaries did an excellent job in making it a magical experience for us."

My husband and I did a week-long tour around a large portion of Morocco. Ali was very responsive and willing to create a customized itinerary for us, including picking us up at the airport. The price was very reasonable and the experience exceeded our expectations in all aspects. Mohammed was a terrific driver and guide. He gave us great recommendations for food and took us to interesting locations. He made sure to stop if we wanted to take photos, go to the restroom, or get something to eat. He is friendly and very knowledgeable. We learned so much about culture, religion, and history in Morocco and Mohammed was happy to participate in an exchange of perspectives. The overnight trip in the desert was one that had been on my bucket list, and the experience was truly incredible (although camels aren't very comfy to ride and I wouldn't recommend going any longer than a couple of hours on a camel). I especially loved meeting Mohammed's family and sharing food and tea with them. My husband and I have traveled a lot, usually by ourselves, but this tour was by far one of our favorite travel experiences. My husband had been a little nervous about visiting Morocco because he didn't really know what to expect, and he ended up loving it largely due to Mohammed making us feel so comfortable and well-informed."

My boyfriend and I did the 3 day 2 night Sahara desert tour which was a good amount of time to see everything we wanted to see.

We booked 6 nights (3 in Marrakech and 3 going to and returning to desert)The desert portion we did firstOur guide for the desert portion was Mustapha he was amazing!!! The teenagers thought so highly of him- us adults thought he looked after us and every need he anticipated. The camel trek into the Sahara was undeniably surreal - again Mustapha personally made sure everything was looked after other people on our Sahara trek did not have a personal guide solely anticipating our needs and making sure we were happy. These three nights unbelievable book this tour FOR SUREThe hiccups came upon our return to Marrakech - this may be the loss of Mustapha as he is a desert tour guide and a let down after the camel highlightBut the accommodations in Marrakech which were suppose to be luxurious had problems - yes they moved us in rooms on 3 occasions in 1 night ( no air con, toilet broken etc) not camel safaris fault and they even offered to move to a different hotel but overall the next nights in Marrakech drastically paled in comparison to the first 3. The city tour quite frankly boring, we needed recommendations or help for dinner and basically relied on trip advisor....Overall the company was very good but the riad Bahia Salam (think boutique hotel) in Marrakech notHowever Mustapha and the first 3 nights AMAZING!!!!Do this trip do this company and definitely request Mustapha"

Short version of our trip...book it, request Mustapha, enjoy and make many memories. The long version follows:My first point of contact was Ali through the company email. He always responded quickly and answered all of my questions. Since we (married couple in our 50\u2019s) had never visited Morocco or used a private guide, we had lots of questions. I\u2019m sure Ali was sitting back thinking \u201cmake this stop\u201d, but he was great. \uf04a At first I thought the price was a little on the high side, but once we finished our trip, we felt like it was more than worth it! We did the two nights, three day private trip Marrakech to Marrakech. We were met right on time at our riad in Marrakech by Mustapha. He has a great personality and speaks English very well. Throughout the trip he gave us information regarding the area, the customs and lifestyle of the various regions and even shared information about himself and his family. There are designated stops, but you are also welcome to ask to stop to see something that interest you along the way. At every stop, both Mustapha and the driver were there to open and close our car doors...gentlemen!Each time there was a view or site that took our breath way, we didn\u2019t think it could be topped...until the next stop. Our trip through the Atlas Mountains was unbelievable. We made many stops along the way to the Sahara. We paid a little more to have a couple of extras with no regrets. Our stop for the night at Dades was at the Kasbah Xhaloca. We usually stay at mom and pop type of places, but wow, this was amazing. Once we arrived at the Sahara dunes, we were able to relax before our trip into the desert for the night. The camels were an adventure of their own traveling the dunes! I don\u2019t know that I have ever experienced a more serene trip, it was so quiet and beautiful. Two guides led us and a few others to our bivouac where Berber tents were already set up. The food, music and company were excellent. It was a really hot night and we pulled out mattress out into the sand for the night. The next morning we rode the camels back to meet Mustapha and our driver for the long trip back to Marrakech. Although it was a long ride, we still made a few stops and Mustapha was a true guide to the end."

We did a 6 day tour tailored to our timetable and learnt so much of the history and culture of Morocco. Mohammed took great care whilst driving and certainly went \"the extra mile \" on every aspect of the tour. We came home with a new friend in Mohammed such a warm and lovely man.The local riads that we were accommodated in very delightful and the food and warm welcome at each one was excellent. If you are planning a trip to Morocco do yourself a favor and travel with Camel Safaries."

Making the deposit was easy through PayPal which helps.We were picked up by Hassan our driver and Mustapha our guide on time at he start of our trip. They were brilliant. Very knowledgeable and they had a great rapport together, bouncing off each other's knowledge which made them extremely entertaining and believe me you need this as you spend a great deal of time on the road and in a vehicle together.Hassan was a brilliant driver, which was comforting on some of he twisting roads you travel. Mustapha spoke excellent English and nothing was too much trouble.We did a four day trip, with hindsight, if you're only in Morocco for a week, the 3 day trip would be long enough.The whole trip was fantastic, the valleys, the scenery, the Kasbah's and the desert were all amazing. Morocco has a little bit of something for everyone. My favourite was definitely the desert, it was beautiful with sand so soft, I was in raptures which coming from someone who says they hate sand is something! What made the desert was the sunrise. Hats off to Mustapha who was the only guide to get us up early enough to climb the dunes to watch the sunrise, it was special, up there alone in the beauty of the sunrise. Thank you Mustapha for adding that special moment to our trip.Thank you Ali at Camel Safaris for arranging our trip and an even bigger thanks for Mustapha and Hassan, our fabulous guide and driver. They made our trip fabulous and we can't wait to return to Morocco again in the future."

Our tour guide Khalid was very professional and knowledgeable. I arrived in Marrakesh the night before the tour but unfortunately my luggage did not arrive. I was worried and thought my only option was to stay in Marrakesh and miss the desert tour. Camel Safari tours was so kind to offer me the option to head out with a separate driver later on in the day after my luggage had arrived. I was so thrilled because I really did not want to miss the desert tour. Book with Camel Safari, they are simply the best!!!"

I reached out to him once arriving in Marrakech to book our trip leaving in a couple days. Ali was quick in responding and customizing our travel as we were not coming back to Marrakech after the desert safari. Our guide, Anas, arrived at our riad on time for our 3 day, 2 night trip. He was very knowledegable and also answered many of our questions along the way:) Given that we were going from Marrakech to Fes over the course of our trip, the drive during the days was long, however, the time went by quickly as we had great laughs and did mini excursions along the way. Our first night, we stayed at Chez Pierre in the Dades Valley. Definitely one of the highlights of the trip due to their attention to customer service and ensuring a great experience for their guests. (I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in the area!). The following day, we made our way to Erg Chebbi for our camel safari. We made it to the camp just in time to watch the sunset on the sand dunes, followed by dinner under the stars. By far the best experience on the trip...next to waking up the following morning watching the sunrise over the Sahara! The entire trip couldn't have gone any better and was well organized by Camel Safaries. Anas, our guide, was also very accommodating. We were to end our trip in Fes and then make our way to Casablanca the following day. Anas looked into it and was able to drive us there himself. He took great care of us and we had such a great experience as a result. He felt like a part of our group and the trip would not have been the same without him.I would highly recommend Anas and Camel Safaries team. They definitely made our trip a memorable one!"

We felt like we took at chance booking this tour as it was cheaper than most we had looked at for camping/mountains/camels but it was a good decision.A lot of time is spent in the car travelling to different places but not really an issue as you get to see a lot. You stop at many different places along the way so you can get a good look at the land. Our guide was very knowledgeable of Morocco and answered all of my (many) questions regarding the history, the people and the landscape.First night you slept at an absolutely amazing Riad on a hillside. The second night you the ride the camel to the large canvas tents within the dunes but we ended up just sleeping outside on the dune under the stars (after watching desert foxes by torch light - beautiful experience).Our guide was Mustapha who was absolutely brilliant! Our driver was Hasan who was also great fun. Both genuinely nice men.This tour would be great to do solo, as a couple or with family or friends. But would not recommend with young children as the driving stints can be long (all day) and I'd imagine they'd be really bored/tired."

We made a few stops along the way, visited unique sites and had lots of mint tea (yum!). He and our driver took great care of us. We loved talking with Mustapha about life in Morocco and the culture. We left the trip feeling like we made a new friend. He took good care to ensure we were comfortable at all times and that we got the most out of the tour.The experience once we got to dessert was something that we will remember forever. We rode camels out to our camp (mine coincidentally had the same name as my dog!). We ended up being the only visitors in the camp so we were very spoiled. The camp had comfortable tents with beds and even a bathroom with showers and toilets. I never felt like we were \"roughing it.\" Even the food was delicious! Mustapha gave us the option to get up early to catch the sunrise, which we did. Stunning! It's a once in a lifetime experience to watch the sunrise over the dunes of the dessert with camels in the background.I would recommend this tour for anyone. It's definitely an experience that shouldn't be missed!"

Normally I am sceptic when I book something online without a reference from someone I know, but I must say this tour was beyond our expectations: price, flexibility, punctuality, organization, hospitlity...all you could have asked for!We traveled 8 days from Fez down to Marrakesh, going through the Sahara Desert (wich for me was the best part of the trip for) and including the beach part, Essaouira, where we were lucky to enjoy the Gnoua Music Festival. These guys really do an awesome job. Everything was perfectly organized, the accomodation were veryyyy nice, clean and autenthic, the tours in the cities gave us an insight about the relegion, the history and the culture, the food was delicious and our driver, Anas, was the most friendly and nice person ever! He became part of our group!!! We saw many things in these 8 days and got a real taste of the hospitality and wonders of Morocco. We even had some cooking and traditional dancing classever I will definetely come back to Morocco and I can only recommend cammel safaries. You don't have to worry about ANYTHING and they really make your trip according to your interests, budget and time. "

Over all, the trip is well organised. All the stops we have made, they all have clean toilet and clean food. Before we have booked, we didn't realise how long it takes to go to Zagora. It is about 7 hours drive with 1 hour rest. The slight is amazing on the way tho! The atlas mountain is so beautiful, and full of colours. Our driver/guide is lovely, but he speaks only a bit English. I won't have minded, if when I first contact, they have promised to send a English speaking guide. The guide is also a bit ill (cold, I think) on the way there, and got worse (coughing) on the way back. We both have felt ill on the 2nd day back from the trip. It is just not very nice to be ill on holiday. It would be better if they didn't send someone who is unwell on the job. It's just that you spend 16 hours in the same car, it is difficult to avoid to it."

First of all Ali was extremely helpful and timely in his answers to our inquiry mails. Our guide came picking us up at our hotel in Marrakech, and the journey begun through different landscapes (the atlas, canyons, rocky desert and dunes desert). The stops were well placed and the hotels chosen very good (even in the cheapest version of the tour). Our guide was young but very Nice and I want to thank him (Mubarak) for all the explications, the help and the stories he told us. The experience to spend the night in the desert it's amazing. Don't worry the \"tent\" are very good with a real bed inside so you don't need to bring enything to feel confortable. Only thing the last day of the tour is a lot of driving so if you have the possibility I advice to make the 4 days tour that makes the going back easier.All in all an incredible experience (even if a little bit expensive) but worth to do at least once in a lifetime."

We paid 310 euros per person for a mid level accommodations. There was an option for budget accommodations for 280 euros per person as well. 1st day: Mohammed, our driver and guide, picked us up at our Riad at 8am. We went to the Atlas Mountains, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of A\u00eft Benhaddou (site of movies) , and Rose valley. Most of the stops were just a 3-5 min stop where we would take some pictures of the background. It would've been nicer if Mohammed would explain a little bit of the significance of each stop so we can appreciate the scenery a little more. Overnight, we stayed at a very nice hotel with dinner included. 2nd day: We went to the Todra Gorge and we were able to trek along the Gorge for around half an hour. It was a very nice hike with wonderful views of the gorge. Afterwards, we went to some fossil museum and other little shops. Around 3pm, we arrived at the hotel where we would take the camel trek. The highlight of the whole trip was taking the camel trek to the dessert and sleeping in the tent overnight. 3rd day: The last day is pretty much a car drive all the way back to Marrakech. It was a 10-11 hour drive straight with pit stops for washroom stops/lunch break. Pro: The whole trip was worth it for just for the camel trek, sand dunes and sleeping in the dessert. Everything else was just bonus.Con: A LOT of driving. 3rd day was pretty much all driving. Be prepared for that. Wish the guide/driver Mohammed would've came out of the car at the stops and explained the sites a little more."

As a solo female traveler, I felt more than comfortable, and I would recommend this tour to anyone who is travelling to Morocco (whether you are alone or with friends). I learned a ton about local Moroccan cultures and customs as well as fun facts, jokes and proverbs. The trip was evenly paced in that driving periods were not too long and breaks were just the right amount of time to stretch and see some sights. The first day involved going through the High Atlas mountains, visiting the Ait Benhaddou kasbah, learning history and posting up at a guest house in the Dades Valley. The guest house was fantastic. Great food, awesome views, friendly staff. The second day involved visiting the Todra Gorges and driving through some of the most remarkable mountain and desert settings on our way to the Erg Chebbi dunes. The camel ride was so fun, and the sunset and sunrise from the dunes were gorgeous. The camp was more like \"glamping\", which was a pleasant surprise. We had dinner in the camp, but breakfast was at the Kasbah Mohayut (where we launched the camel trek from). The staff is very friendly there, and the food was delicious. The third day was all about driving back to Marrakech and stopping along the way to see beautiful oasis scenes.  This tour was life-changing, and it made me want to stay in Morocco for a longer trip. I can't thank Mohammed enough for being the best guide and friend. I will be back, and I'm happy to call Morocco one of my favorite places in the world.

Fantastic landscapes, people, regardless of the circumstances in which perhaps the majority of them live in - are open, positive and pleasant.Picnic in the Sahara desert, camel safari and night in the Sahara desert under the stars, off-road trip in the Atlas mountains, meeting with nomads and so much else. Each city, which we has seen its path with its charm, all of them are well worth seeing and unforgettable. Each accommodation where we stayed during our trip is noteworthy. My advice is to use these small Riads, rather than look for classic hotels. If you want to feel flavors of Morocco you have to try night at small and nice riad (for example in Marrakech we spent the night at riad de I\u2019Orientale - a charming place).And of course, if we are talking about Morocco, we have to talk about Moroccan cuisine - tagines, taktouka, fruits, olives, dates, fantastic sweets, ooo, I enjoyed every of them!Our trip was so opulent impressions and emotions that I still live in these emotions although I\u2019m already away from Morocco.

I did a lot of research for this trip and Camel Safaries had the best communication. Ali was very thoughtful and answered all of my questions in details. Before the trip I paid a deposit via PayPal and on the scheduled date Mohammed (Moha Topi) picked us up at 8 am. Mohammed was the best guide we could have asked for, the trip was even better because of him (extra points for the Justin Bieber songs he played over and over in the car hahaha!). The hotel we stayed on the first night was really good. On the next day we took our quadricycles to get to the camp, which, in my opinion, was a much better choice (I think they might have bugees as well, but, either way, you have to ask for it in advance). Lastly, the price is fair: the car, the hotel and the camp were perfect and a lot of the meals are included. I highly recommend Camel Safaries."

It was the most amazing activity we have ever done on any trip. From the pick up at our riad to the drop off three day later, we were in complete awe of every stop we made on the day and of the knowledge of our guides and drivers. Abdoul and Hassan taught us so much of the Moroccan and Berber history and were the most accommodating and awesome guides. The long drive was broken up into perfectly pre-planned stops for photos and food. On the way back the drivers and guides did everything they could to successfully get us to Marrakesh so we could catch the last bus to Essaouira without missing anything on the way. If anything, we wish we could have spend another night or two to learn more and enjoy the landscape and history of these phenomenal people. I HIGHLY recommend choosing this company when looking for excursions to do in Morocco."

We aren't \"guided tour\" type of people but due to the little time we had in Morocco and the distance it took to get to the Sahara, we decided it would be best. I did a LOT of research for this trip and based on reviews, we went with Camel Safaris. It was one of the best choices we made in planning our trip to Morocco. Fair prices and excellent communication with Ali. Mohammad, our guide, was nothing short of perfect! He was very friendly, kind, helpful, fun, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to. On Day 1 he picked us up @8am from our riad and spent the day driving and sightseeing along the way. He would stop anytime we asked for photos or otherwise. We toured Ben Ait Haddou (amazing!) - Mohammad gave us an introduction and then let us explore on our own. It was very interesting to drive through many small towns and stop to observe a few Berber villages, all while Mohammad gave us information and answered all of our questions. We stayed at Riad Itran that night, and wow!! was it fantastic! It was our favorite accommodation during our entire trip around Morocco. Beautiful location, charming riad, warm and friendly staff and delicious food. Day 2 we continued our drive through oases and palmeries and a second kasbah that is setup as a museum.We arrived to our camels where we met our guides and camels. We trekked in before sunset. Yes, it was about as cool as you could imagine. The kids played on the dunes until dark when we were served a delicious tagine dinner and mint tea. The camp in a permanent site with individual pods with actual beds and electricity in them. We were not expecting that! It was very cold that night but with 5 blankets, we were very warm. We played drums around the fire that night and watched what little stars we could since it was cloudy :( The next morning we climbed up the dunes to watch the sunrise before packing up and heading back out. The camel ride was only about 1 hour each way. I would have liked it to be a little longer. The camp itself is on the edge of the Sahara really - you could see the town in the distance when looking west. On our return drive we had to pass through the snowy Atlas Mts - the Berber villages we saw on Day 1 were covered in snow! Luckily the roads had been cleared enough to let us through. We returned to Marrakesh about 8pm that evening. Amazing and well organized trip. I highly recommend this company to anyone!!!"

            "review": "Unforgettable, incredible tour. This was an amazing trip - and one I'll not soon forget. I was traveling alone, and Mohammed was my guide. He met me at the riad I had stayed at in Marrakech, and we set off on our journey from there. Mohammed made me feel comfortable immediately. We became fast friends as the first day was about 4 hours in the car, driving along the winding roads that climb through the beautiful Atlas Mountains and through a number of small towns. The sights along the way were amazing - gorgeous mountains, the kasbah at Ait-Ben-Haddou, the dwellings made of mud and clay, grazing goats and more. I could have taken thousands of pictures and felt it wasn't enough! Mohammed is a knowledgeable guide, and I fear I didn't ask enough questions of him, as we were having too much fun swapping stories about our lives. A highlight of this first day was when we stopped so I could take pictures of a herd of goats, and the goat herder invited us to have tea with him. We sat with him on the ground while he made a small fire and then made the tea. He had one small glass, and we all drank from it. It was a pretty special moment for me! That evening, we stayed at the hotel Kasbah Itran. The hotel overlooks the Rose Valley. We had dinner here, and then the staff and Mohammed played the drums and sang. We all ended up dancing in a circle together while singing, clapping and/or playing the drums. What a fun night! Here, I had an amazing room with stained glass windows and a view over the Valley. This was facing east, and the sunrise was stunning. After our breakfast, we started off for our journey into the desert. We stopped to look at the town Boumalne Dades at the edge of the Dades Valley - such an amazing view. This town looks like an elaborate sand castle against a backdrop of palm trees and the Atlas Mountains. We also stopped in the spectacular Todgha Gorge which was carved by the Todgha and Dades Rivers. After an authentic lunch of cous cous (it was Friday) in the town of Rissani, we continued on to the edge of the Sahara Desert, where we got on our camels for our ride (just over an hour) into Erg Chebbi - one of Morocco's two Saharan ergs - sand dunes. The camel ride was fun and easy(for me) and the camel was very well-behaved. This part of the desert is amazing - vast and with high dunes - just what I wanted to see! Mohammed and I climbed a dune near our camp; this may have been easy for my new friend, but not for me!!! But I was happy to do it for the great view! The tent camp is very comfortable - with rugs on the sand, a bathroom with running water, even a dining tent. I had my own tent of course, and the bed was comfortable and had plenty of blankets! That night we had a great dinner and then sat around a campfire until very late playing the drums and singing. The next morning, I climbed that dune again in order to watch the sunrise over the desert. This was another special moment! After that, we got back on the camels and went back to the edge of the desert where we had a hearty breakfast before heading on our long trek (8-9 hours) back to Marrakech. We had stops along the way, including lunch in an interesting town that was having its weekly market, and an area that was filled with fossils embedded into the rocks. This trip was amazing, filled with special experiences. As we neared the end, I was very sad as it meant saying goodbye to my great new friend, Mohammed. He made this trip the best it could be for me! it is clear Mohammed enjoys his job! He is personable, friendly, informative and thoughtful. He also takes great photos - hand him your camera or your smart phone and let him take some great pictures of you on this trip. I would highly recommend Camel Safaries to anyone - the experience was beyond my expectations. I want to do this again!!!"

The camp itself had comfortable beds, plenty of blankets, and warm running water. We sat by the camp fire in the evening singing and playing music with the staff. We also got to see a great variety of Moroccan scenery and sites. I highly recommend Mohammed and Hasan to anyone considering a tour."

From the moment that our guide Abdoul and our driver Hassan picked us up in Marrakech, we knew we were in good hands. The 4x4 car was clean and comfortable and the journey, while long, never felt arduous. Hassan was an excellent driver and we felt safe the whole time. Abdoul is simply the best guide. He is knowledgable, friendly, professional and clearly loves his job. I fell ill during the trip and we were really impressed with the care taken to ensure I got medication I needed (despite many of the pharmacies being closed).Abdoul was incredibly flexible and allowed for customization along the route. Once we indicated that we enjoyed eating the local food, we got to experience a real Moroccan treat of grilled lamb in a local cafe! We thoroughly enjoyed the itinerary set out by Camel Safaries and felt that the stops were well thought out and well timed. The hotels that we were booked on were perfect. Small and intimate with lovely staff and delicious food. We ate extremely well on this trip!Ali was also extremely responsive and flexible during the planning stage. All in all, we cannot recommend this company or our guides Abdoul and Hassan enough... simply amazing!"

This trip completely exceeded our expectations and has been by far the highlight of our Morocco trip.Mohammed, our guide was an absolute star- he's one of the most genuine, friendly, kind people you will ever meet. He makes the journey interesting as he provides knowledge along the way to break up the long drives. He's so upbeat which is infectious, and we loved his camel dancing. He went above and beyond as he really cares that you enjoy your trip, and he really does become like a good friend.We felt in very safe hands with our driver Hassan, as he is a great driver- very safe and we didn't even flinch driving up the mountain roads with high drops (in other countries with similar roads I've resorted to closing my eyes in fear but this time I could enjoy the view!) Hassan is also a really friendly, helpful person and he and Mohammed make a great team.Booking our trip was easy, as Ali responded to all of my emails quickly and clearly, which assured me that I'd picked the right company for this trip as there seems to be a lot of choice! The hotel we stayed at for the first night was lovely, way nicer than we expected for the price! And the Berber camp on the second night was also beyond our expectations- we expected (and would have been happy with) basic facilities, but this was practically glamping- we had a real bed, real flushing toilets, amazing food and a magical evening under the stars! Thank you so much Camel Safaries! We will definitely be recommending this trip to all of our friends."

By advance planning through examination of their website and also e-mail correspondence with owner Ali, all arrangements were made and executed beautifully. Since our group consisted of just my wife and I, we were assigned a Toyota Land Cruiser 4x4 with Guide Mostapha and driver Hassan for this 3 day, 2 night desert tour. Both were excellent and friendly, and there was no language issues as Mostapha spoke good English and Driver Hassan understood and could communicate directly or thru Mosptapha. The details of the itinerary are given on the website, so will not repeat here. The first day highlight was a visit to the world famous Kasbah Ben Houdou where over 25 Hollywood films were filmed. These include the iconic Lawrence of Arabia, The Gladiator, Pearls of Persia, Game of Thrones, etc. Just a word of caution: lunch at the supposedly \"best\" restaurant in this village was a disaster! Better to bring a packed lunch with you. Not the fault of Camelsafaries as all tour buses/cars stop at this place. Food here is really bad. The kasbah trek made up for the bad food, and the information given by our guide Mostapha was invaluable. The hotel Xaluca dades on the first night had excellent buffet dinner and equally good breakfast. Wi-fi works only in the hotel lobby and not in the rooms. But the loacation of the hotel and the food were both excellent! The second day highlight was a trip to the gorge, lunch at our guide Mostapha's home near the desert. His sister Zahara cooked us an excellent covered Pizza, with salad and starter almonds and other nuts. The next day, our driver Hassan's sister cooked for us a really spicy similar pizza to take away and eat while we were driving. Both these acts of kindness more than made up for the bad lunch on the first day. Such acts of friendliness endeared us to both Mostapha and Hassan, and were not part of the package. the highlight was the camel ride from the Camp Mohayut to the sand dunes desert berber tent! What an adventure for us two senior citizens aged 70! The sand dunes of Erg Chebbi are not to be missed! Well worth the long 550kms drive from Marrakech! The dinner was very good as was the company of international travellers in our group fro this segment for the trip. On the way to the desert, while drivi g, our driver Hassan took full advantage of the 4x4 car and took us off road for long periods. We were able to visit and desert camp made by Berber nomads and see their basic, rustic life-style and how they make their living rearing goats, etc. back at the sand dunes camp, sunset and sunrise were sights to behold! After dinner entertainment was provided by our three camelguides/cook through playing drums around a bonfire on the sand dunes. Lying on our back viewing the bright stars on a cold winter night was an experience of a lifetime!Thanks, Camelsafaries, and Mostapha and safe driving Hassan, for giving us such a wonderful experience! Would highly recommend this company for guided tours in Morocco."

During our recent trip (25th Nov to 6th Dec), we had our expectations met and had many surprises throughout our time in magical Maroc. Our trip started from Asilah, a town on the northwest tip of the Atlantic coast of Morocco where we stayed at Riad Tabia, hosted by the very hospitable Adil and his wife, Juri. The next day, we took a day trip to Tanger where we visited Hercules Cave, one of the most popular tourist attractions which is set along the Atlantic ocean. Mohammed then introduced us to our down-to-earth guide, Mr Murad who, by the way is a fit and charming 71 year old man! We explored the bustling medina including the fish market where the friendly fishmongers were more than happy to have their photos taken. Subsequently, we proceeded to Midelt, a town in central Morocco, in the high plains between the Middle Atlas and High Atlas mountain ranges so you can imagine how cold it was then. The journey was about 5 to 6 hours drive but with a cool driver like Mohammed, you can expect a smooth and safe ride. We stopped by many scenic spots recommended by Mohammed where we took countless photos of the welcoming locals, beautiful scenery and cute flocks of sheep during our drives throughout our stay in Morocco. We also made a quick stop in Meknes before reaching the endless sand dunes in Merzouga, which was our second visit to this calm, terracotta plains. Mohammed also brought us to the busy market in Rissani, a small town nearby where you can shop for cheap souvenirs like scarves and local wares and be awed by the everyday scenes you will probably not experience back home. Dades was our next stop where you can expect many kasbahs peppered along both sides of the long and winding road. There are many small hotels or what they call auberge where you can spend the night and, they serve the most excellent dinners like the one we put up in called Hotel Babylon Dades. The staff there were awesome and they teamed up with Mohammed that night to put up an upbeat performance with their local drums. The next morning, Mohammed drove us up to the highest point in Dades where we saw the most stunning view of the picturesque valley. It would be unthinkable to stare down the steep terrains for long but I assure you it is worth the trip up there. On our way to Ourzazate, we stopped by Boutghrar Dades, a rough and rocky patch where we were greeted with excited children who were pleased with the sweets we brought them. Mohammed brought us to yet another delightful place called Kasbah Itrane for lunch where we enjoyed a breathtaking view of the surrounding greenery. In Ourzazate, we stayed at the comfortable Dar Chamma, which had a cosy courtyard for you to laze the afternoon away as you indulge in your favourite book. The next city, Taroudant was simply magnificent as the place we stayed at, Riad El Aissi, was one huge place with a sprawling yard for you to take many beautiful photos and enjoy the outdoors in the lush garden. Here, we managed to explore the medina where we came across the varied local stuff from fruits to clothing to jewellery before we found ourselves in Agadir the following day while we were on our way to Essaouria. Essaouria, also known as Wind City has a pristine beach ideal for surfers and beach-goers. You can get delectable seafood and many colourful trinkets for family and friends as the medina in this town is very easy to walk around in and I'm sure you won't mind getting lost there! After two days, we headed to Marrakech for the night where you should visit the energetic Jamaa el Fna in Marrakesh's medina quarter. We ended the memorable trip when Mohammed dropped us off at Casablanca. I would highly recommend Camel Safaries to anyone who would like to visit Morocco as they are reliable and more importantly that they try their best to suit your travel plans to ensure that you experience the best of Maroc."

We could not have picked a better company to take us there. They were extremely responsive and flexible with our travel dates and request to be picked up in Marrakech and dropped of in Fes. Our driver, Iddir, made the long car ride out to Cherg Ebbi a blast with his warm and funny personality and he provided interesting education about the regions we went through. The accommodations and pit stops were fantastic and the camel ride was exactly what we were looking for. We left just before sunset and so had incredible views during our ride which was the perfect length. The tent we stayed in was cold (dress warm!) but we had a great time eating tagine and couscous, sandboarding, and singing and drumming by a campfire. I can't recommend this experience with this company enough!"

We had a great road trip taking in the spectacular view of the Atlas mountains along the way from Marrakesh to Merzouga. The hotels along the way were comfortable and clean and the food was sumptuous. We also enjoyed the camel trek and the night out in the desert with Mohamed. Our driver and guide, Said, also took really good care of us. He's a safe and responsible driver who is also very humorous and knowledgeable in Berber and Moroccan culture. We had a great time on the trip, thanks to him. Ali, who had been liaising with me on the details for the trip is also responsive and really helpful pre and post trip. My friends and I strongly recommend Camel Safaries and will definitely be back to explore Morocco with them. Shukran!"

I can safely say hands down that my girlfriend and I enjoyed the desert trip the most despite having visited many cities in Morocco. Our guide Iddir was the most wonderful and experienced tour guide that one can have. He was a wealth of information and a tremendously witty person as well. I fondly recall all the funny sayings he mentioned throughout the trip. Additionally, he also went out of his way to bring us to shop for certain items at the weekly market in Rissani that we mentioned we were looking for. Overall, I would say that Camel Safaries is a top notch organization that has plenty of experience running desert tours. I would strongly recommend my friends or family going to Morocco to contact them and in particular contact Iddir as he is a wonderful person and guide!"

Mohammed is a local Berber man who is very charismatic, informative and funny. He treated us like family and showed us all this sights with pride of his home country. He is a very good driver and guide. We couldn't have asked for a better person to show us around. The camel safari was by far the best part of our trip to Morocco, without seeing the desert and the drive to and from you don't truly see what Morocco has to offer. The culture and landscape is very different from the big cities of Marakesh or Casablanca. It is a must do!! We did the 4 night trip and enjoyed every minute of it. Thank you Ali and Mohammed for giving us excellent service!"

Ibrahim was our driver and he was AWESOME, extremely friendly, funny and knowledgeable. The scenery was spectacular and our lunch with a Berber family was delicious.

We highly recommend this tour or any other tour that this company offers. We covered a lot of miles but Mohammed, our guide was not just very informative and entertaining as we drove but also was very skillful in arranging appropriate stops for magical sites and great food. We visited markets and kasbahs seemingly off the tourist track. We were even fortunate to shake hands with Mohammed's father, a stately old soldier and sister, a lovely young woman. If we had a chance we would return without hesitation to Morocco and would want to see other aspects of this wonderful country with Mohammed's guidance.Some of the TripAdvisor questions are not applicable to such an excursion. We recommend you experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed."

Our driver Ali was everything we could have wished for, and more. He welcomed us into his family home for lunch on the first day of Eid ul-Adha, to share their sacrificed sheep, we felt so honoured, thank you!, and not known to us at the time, he was given some very tragic news of his brother, but without a stumble, he made sure he got us to the desert, before returning back home to his family. Amazing person. Together with, his knowledge of Morocco was in depth and very interesting, he also was a very safe driver !!- highly recommend Ali and Camel Safaries."

Me and my girlfriend would like to thank Ali & Hassan for such a wonderful trip which is well worth every penny!Day 1: we got picked up bang on time from our Rihad in Merrakech in the morning around 8am who even waiting for us to sort out the last few things! Drove to towards the atlas stopping of at wonderful kasbah's along the way will Ali kept us informed of interesting infomation of the areas as we drove through!Then we reached our wonderful kasbah hotel for the evening with stunning views and a authentic but luxurious stay with good food and tradition musicDay 2: woke up to a lovely breakfast overlooking a wonderful valley then departed on the road to the sahra desert in our 4x4 we went off-roading which was really fun with Hassan potentially a better driver than my dad! With plenty of intetesting stops and breaks along the way to keep us entertained always taking us to the more authentic than tourist location which was also the ethos for the whole trip.In the afternoon we arrived at the edge of the desert to a even better kasbah hotel to wash, have a drink, use the super good wifi and leave our bags overnight before embarking on our camels for the trek to our camp in the desert, also they sell beer and wine at the kasbah before you leave and bring it for you in a cool box to the dessert camp (nice touch) we got on our camels and were led across the dessert with plenty of photo oppertunites and also watched the sunset as well before we arrived to our camp for tea and dinner, drinks, music and good convosation! We choose to bring out matresses outside and sleep under the best view of the stars I have ever seen!Day 3: back on the camels to the kasbah for a lovely breakfast, shower etc to depart on the drive back to Merrakech, quite a drive to be honest but a nice touch on the way was stopping at a great little italian place becuase to be honest Ali knew we would be bored of tajines! they drove us to the hotel and yeah just have woken up to write him a review!I could highly recommened this tour so worth every penny they we great and you should book!Thanks to Ali, Hassan, Paul & Joy and Ki x"

I did the 2 day tour with my girlfriend, where we had our own Berber guide, Hassan, drive us through beautiful landscapes down to Zagora. It is a very full on day, but it goes quickly. When we finally arrived at the camels, it was a beautiful ride through the desert to the accommodation. Our camel guide, Ibrahim, is a total dude! Super friendly and welcoming as well as patient. I must recommend that when riding a camel, you should wear tight fitting trousers, and ask for more blankets if you are lacking a posterior..... It will rub (maybe even bring a pillow, I'm not kidding) Regardless of this, it was still awesome!! The accommodation in the desert is also brilliant. Our tent had proper beds and electricity, and they also provided soap and clean towels. The site had flushing toilets and showers, so it was much appreciated. The site can accommodate many many tourists, but there was only us two on this tour. They made us feel so welcome and we had such a laugh trying to learn Arabic and Berber. The highlight was all of us having a jam on their drums. I'm a drummer for a living, so it was an absolute joy!! Ali in the office is also very quick in responding to emails and it is run very efficiently. Highly recommended!! :-)"

            "review": "Wonderful Experience with Mohammed Maazouz of Camel Safaries. My friends and I (a group of 5) visited Morocco for the first time in early September 2015. One of my friends booked the tour with Camel Safaries so I had zero expectations, but I was very surprised and satisfied with our tour with Camel Safaries and appreciated experiencing Morocco with an excellent private tour guide.OUR TOUR AND EXPERIENCEWe did the 4 days/3 nights tour from Marrakech through the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara Desert which was customizable according to our interests. Mohammed Maazouz served as both our driver and tour guide, who was exceptional (more on him later in my review). The varied landscape from Marrakech out towards the Sahara desert is extremely beautiful, and made all the better with Mohammed providing background to the landscape features and rural towns. The anti-Atlas mountain range on our drive back to Marrakech were incredibly breathtaking - flat land pocketed by low trees and shrubs juxtaposed with unique rock formations. The camel riding and camping in the desert is a nice experience, but the less \"touristy\" parts of the tour were the most memorable. We did experience a sand storm during our camel ride out to the desert camp, so come prepared with a buff or scarf to cover your face. One of the highlights of our tour was being invited to a day-before-the-wedding celebration lunch. Mohammed knew the family and it was such a fun experience to be \"one of the locals\" by eating a wonderful meal with a large gathering of friends and family members. We were clearly foreigners but were treated like one of the normal guests. My favorite part of our trip was interacting and spending some time with a nomad family. Mohammed seemed to know her and her young children personally and it was a very eye-opening experience learning how a typical nomad family lives. The meals were great - some were pretty touristy, but at the same time, those of us who had weaker stomachs appreciated those places. My favorite meal though, was eating at a local restaurant (packed and not a tourist in sight!) on our last day on the long drive back to Marrakech. I'm a vegetarian but ended up eating the beef meatballs and lamb chops to experience a true Moroccan meal. Other activities we did, that I'd recommend: visiting Mohammed's family's date tree stand in an oasis, walking around Ait Ben Haddou (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), and visiting the local market and eating fresh figs. I could have done without the visit to the Pigeons du Sable and the argan oil co-op visit, which I felt were tourist traps.OUR GUIDE, MOHAMMED MAAZOUZI don't think I can do Mohammed justice in this review. Mohammed has a way of making people feel very comfortable and welcomed. He has a calming personality and is very knowledgeable, as a tour guide should be. I don't know how Mohammed does it, but he drove for hours and hours in the company's Toyota Land Cruiser, and my group and I always felt safe. Despite the fact that he hosts a number of tours throughout the year, he really does treat your group like you're special. I never felt like simply a paycheck for him. Mohammed also seemed to care about our lives and interests and was patient in answering our seemingly endless questions about the Berber culture and people. I truly believe that having Mohammed as our tour guide really made our trip and cannot recommend him enough. LAST THOUGHTSIt ended up being a really great and memorable trip. The takeaway is that the tour can be completely tailored to your interests. You don't have to do anything you don't feel like doing. Mohammed always gave us options and asked us where we wanted to go next. I would recommend selecting the higher level accommodations/hotel stays so you are thoroughly comfortable on the trip. Also, make sure you have enough dirham before you leave the big city; there were only a few ATMs along the way in the rural towns and villages. Camel Safaries is a solid choice for a tour guide company and well priced. I believe having a guide, especially if it is your first visit to Morocco, is essential to not only experiencing but learning about and understanding the rich history, beautiful places, and the varied people of Morocco."

When I first found Ali online in 2006, when I led my first small group to Morocco, I had no idea what I would find when I met him and signed on for a tour. All these years later, I can say from my heart that Ali is simply the best--at every level. Guide, friend, and like family to me--Ali has gently guided my groups on 12 different 16- to 21-day trips through the country he knows so well. Intelligent, kind, knowledgable, and professional, Ali is the best guide imaginable. Although it is difficult for me to be objective after all this time, I can't imagine being in better hands than with Ali and his crew. Funny, unflappable, able to problem solve on the spot, he is able to offer custom designed trips and tours of any length or price point, Ali can create a perfect journey, a perfect way to experience the incredible culture and people of Morocco. I can't offer enough praise or assign enough stars to recommend this amazing young man and his company.As I said...my guide, my friend, my family."

My son and my sister and I booked this trip just knowing that we wanted to say that we had ridden camels in the Moroccan desert - not many people get that opportunity. What we weren't counting on were the awe inspiring vistas as we drove through the Atlas Mountains, the visions of the Berbers as they went along the streets with their happy faces, the beautiful (and not so beautiful) villages along the way. But most of all, the generosity and hospitality of our guide, Ali, during the Eid Al-Adha celebrations, who welcomed us into his home, giving us an experience we could never replicate. His professionalism and warmth at a time of great tragedy in his family is something that will stay with us forever. Thank you, Ali, and thank you Mohammed for delivering us safely back to Marrakech. If it wasn't for this tour, we may have had a very different opinion of Morocco (having only experienced the madness of Marrakech to that point), but now we can't recommend it highly enough."

We particularly appreciated his kind and generous invitation to share in his family's celebration of Aid-al-Adha, a once in a lifetime experience. In addition, the itinerary covered everything we wanted/needed to see, and suited us really well. The Land Rover was very comfortable. We'd highly recommend the Riad Madu tents in the desert.Thanks to Mohammed, we had an unforgettable experience in Morocco.

What we didn't know is that we would be cared for by Mohammed, an intelligent, funny and very likeable guide who made the trip the highlight of our 2 weeks in Morocco. Sure, the overnight camel excursion was once-in-a lifetime, and sure the Gorges were breathtaking, and the apes were fun. But to see this part of the country in only 3 days requires very long days in the car- and with Mohammed it was more than just bearable, it was a rich experience. He was very knowledgable on everything Moroccan, and quickly figured out what we would find interesting. Happily, the 4x4 was comfortable, air conditioned and well- equipped. Each morning Mohammed ensured that the windows were so clean that I could take perfect pictures from inside the car! And our best times were stopping along the way in small towns to have a local meal with the locals, or sharing a 'Berber whiskey' with a nomad family. We can't say enough about the experience- thanks to the professionals at Camel Safaries."

Mohammed took us to lots of places, Casa, Marrakesh, the small village(Moulay Brahim) in Atlas mountains, Merzouga, Erg Chebbi, and then he drove us to Essaouira to attend the Gnawa Festival. Mohammed is not only a guide but also a friend, he took lots beautiful pics for us, and every place we drove to, he told lots of histories and stories about Morocco for us. Although sometimes drove more than 10 hours, but he always made us happy and enjoy every minute. He is a very devout Muslims, is so kind and friendly. He knew so much information about his country. We can feel his love to Morocco. He is so kind, sometimes we went through the poor village, he always stoped the car, and gave some sweets or fruits to the kids. He is so patient to every person. At last, I must to say, he is a very very good driver. Thank u so much, Mohammed, you made these days special! It is the best memories for us.

I went on the three day/two night Marrakesh-Marrakesh tour with my boyfriend in late July, and we both had an absolutely phenomenal time!The tour company was incredibly professional in their communication before we organized the tour. For the tour itself, we were fortunate enough to have Mohammed as our tour guide. He was very experienced, charismatic, and kind, and all-around a great person to see the country with! We left the tour feeling like we had really learned a lot about the country and people of Morocco and always felt safe traveling with him.At the end of the trip, Mohammed was kind enough to drive us back a different route and drop us off at Meknes (we had mentioned we were interested in Volubilis but probably wouldn't have time to see it.) I think that says it all about this company and their guides-- they'll go out of the way to give you the very best experience of Morocco.I pride myself on being an independent traveler, and this is the first time I've ever used a tour guide to see a foreign country. I would recommend taking a tour with Camel Safaries no matter what! You see so much more than you would on your own and having a local guide with you who speaks the language and knows the customs opens up a whole new world of experiences. The price is very reasonable when you consider that it includes accommodation, most meals and attractions, and a 24/7 tour guide."

I wholeheartedly recommend the experience. Led by our wonderful guide, Mohammed, we were able to see so much more of the country than we ever could have on our own. Camel Safaries is extremely professional and goes out of its way to cater to guests. For the very reasonable cost of the tour, we received a priceless experience.We could not have asked for a better tour guide. Mohammed is warm, funny, and knowledgeable. His glowing charisma with the local Moroccans we met along the way allowed us as visitors to engage with the country and the culture outside the normal confines of the tourism industry. From mint tea with local oasis farmers to real Moroccan BBQ and freshly-picked figs, Mohammed went above and beyond to introduce us to the best things Morocco has to offer. It was powerfully clear that Mohammed takes great pride in both his country and in showing it to the travelers of the world. Mohammed is also highly skilled. He speaks excellent English and, as a driver, is a paradigm of cool, calm, and collected. We felt very safe in his hands.Before our tour even ended, my girlfriend and I were talking of a return trip to Morocco in the future, and if we do so, it will certainly be with Camel Safaries."

We had booked a tour with Camel Safaris before we left. Mohammed was our guide. As a single parent I was a little worried when we first drove away from Marrakech. I had no need to worry. Mohammed was an amazing guide. He was kind, helpful and friendly, but above all he was a absolute wealth of knowledge regarding all things to do with Morocco. His knowledge of the history of the country was outstanding and this combined with his geographical knowledge meant that we learnt so much in 3 days. My son even came away saying he had learnt more from Mohammed than he had learnt in the past year in history and geography lessons at school! Mohammed's ease at sharing his knowledge was also a real gift.As to his driving skills, we felt completely safe the whole time. We did experience one difficult situation, when because of an accident in a village that we were supposed to travel through, the only alternative was to cross a fast flowing river. Both Mohammed's judgement skills and his driving skills paid off here as after considering the options carefully, he drove us over the river with no difficulty.Camel Safaris had also arranged a super hotel at the edge of the desert for the first night of the tour. For the second night we camped in the desert after riding the camels for the afternoon.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend both Camel Safaris and especially Mohammed, he is a gem. This trip is talked about regularly in our household as one of our best trips. Thanks Camel Safaris and Mohammed!"

I have no idea how Muhammed Maazouz, still a young man, has acquired so much information about his country - its history, Islam, flora and fauna, back roads, geography, its politics, its regional differences and customs, etc.... for raw information alone the guy is great. But then you add how genuinely friendly he is, how patient with kids, how flexible, how prompt, his great driving (particularly on the crazy back roads of the Atlas Mountains), the relationships he's built up with locals, and how solicitous and helpful he is all the time without fail... well my goodness. Our tour with him was just superb. We had 4 nights and 5 days on the tour - started in Marrakech, then down to the desert, then a drop off in Fez. The amazing thing is that it all took place smack in the middle of Ramadan. I.e., the guy was up at 3:30 am for prayers, then no food or drink all day. I kept waiting for him to show some level of irritability brought on by physical discomfort, but he was unfailingly kind and helpful throughout. One of the things he told us was how right behavior, including how you perform at your job, is an important piece of being a good Muslim. Muhammed walks this talk.PS - one of our daughters forgot her Kindle in his car. They're shipping it back to us, no charge. This company is a class act."

My boyfriend and I were blown away with the incredible experience we were offered by Camel Safaris when we booked to travel with them from Marrakech to Fez over the course of three days in July 2015. Good friends had highly recommended that we travel through Morocco with this particular company as they had also had a unique and memorable experience back in 2012.We we treated with great care and professionalism right from the initial correspondence with Ali which was prompt and hugely informative as he guided us through the many and varied options available. It was clear that the itinerary could be flexible and was absolutely tailored to our spec of dates and interests. We even made a last minute amendment to the start date of our tour which Ali actioned with immediate effect and zero fuss. He was a true pleasure to book through as we felt more and more secure that this was indeed THE company to tour with. The A/C 4x4's are comfortable and spacious and felt like our own space for three days.... and then we met Mohammed - the wonderful, personable, conscientious driver who would be hosting our tour which further fueled our excitement to get going. Ali had arranged for Mohammed to visit us at our Riad a couple of nights before beginning our tour to answer any questions and tell us a little more about his proposed itinerary.Once again, from initial meeting to the big hugs at the end of the trip, Mohammed was kind, consistently careful on the roads, informative and overall incredibly personable, genuinely ensuring that we had a hugely special experience. Our highlight was camel trekking to spend a night out in the desert, and watching the sun rise over the Sahara the following morning which was unforgettable.I work within the service industry, and recognise the importance of both positive feedback and constructive criticism, however I quite honestly could not fault Camel Safaris in any single way. Mohammed is a gem, as I'm sure the rest of Ali's team are, and I would 100% recommend Camel Safaris to any other lucky travellers who have the opportunity to explore Morocco. Ultimate care and comfort is what they offer - you will not be disappointed!"

The drive is long but the stops along the way are breath taking. Driving to the peak of the high Atlas Mountains (second tallest mountain peak in Africa!) was a once in a life time experience. When we stopped for lunch were also able to tour at a beautiful Kasbah in which many movies and tv shows were filmed. We arrived late to our camels but the guides there were very accommodating. Our camel guide was excellent and even shared some of his fruit and local foods when we stopped briefly for a desert picnic so he could break his fast. The camp site was well maintained, safe, and comfortable. Our meals were very nice and following dinner we had a great time playing music and hanging out with the guides and other visitors on different camel treks (ours was the best). Mohammed was available for any thing we needed the entire time, even in the evenings at the camp site, he was honest and thoughtful and the entire adventure was well organized.

As two young American women traveling alone in a foreign country, we were a bit worried about choosing the right tour guides for our time in the desert of Morocco. Lucky for us, we chose wisely... and had the most incredible time!!! Everything was well organized and laid back. Our guides, Anass and Ali, showed us an amazing time. From our pick up in Marrakech, through the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara desert, and then on to Fes. Of our ten days in Morocco, the 4 days we spent with Camel Safaries stand out above the rest of the trip. 100%.We booked a 2 night, 3 day tour (with only one night in the desert). After the first day, we knew we had to extend it! Camel Safaries was super flexible in letting us add on an extra day with no problem... and we were SO glad we did. We spent an extra day with them and our 4x4 driver, Mohammed, who was so much fun!!! By the end of day 2 & 3, we felt like we were exploring the desert with old friends, truly. Our guide Ali, took us to his family's house to have lunch on the way to the desert, which was an unexpected surprise. They were so wonderful about answering our MANY questions about their culture, religion, and way of life in Morocco. The night spent in the desert was wonderful- but I will say we didn't have the best circumstances. It was a full moon, so it was difficult to see many stars (be sure to plan your night in the desert around the moon!). Otherwise, it was wonderful. On our 4x4 day with Mohammed, he drove us to what seemed like the middle of nowhere in the Sahara and we stopped for a game of volleyball, while camels watched us in the distance. We then found the only tree around, where they made us a picnic lunch and impromptu fire (despite the heat of the sun!). Another one of our favorite moments.They also connected us with a nomad family in the Sahara desert, who we spent an afternoon with. Their way of life was fascinating! So fascinating, that we decided to come back later for dinner with them (after they kindly invited us). That dinner was one of the most memorable travel experiences I've ever had. Mohammed drove us through the desert back to their nomad hut, and we brought them the food supplies to cook dinner. We then went to have something to drink and watch the sunset in the desert with the guides while we waited for them to cook our dinner. That time was very special. Once we returned to the nomad's house it was dark... the only light being the full moon. Mohammed brought candles that we placed around the room we would eat in- which made the entire meal feel like a family holiday. We ate by candlelight with the nomads and had the most unique and wonderful experience with them. They even invited us to spend the night in their hut, but we sadly had to leave early the next morning for Fes. I really cannot say enough great things about Camel Safaries. We were so lucky to have found them... and have continued to be in touch, as they became our friends. If you're looking for a unique experience with wonderful guides... these are your guys!"

The whole team were professional and I wish them all the best. Hopefully a few more kiwis head your way."

We had a wonderful time in Morocco and the Camel Safaries company provided us best services. Before we started the trip, I emailed them to consult the tour. They responded quickly and provided detailed information to help us. In Morocco, our guide and driver was Mohammed. He was the best guide I have ever met. He was very friendly and enthusiastic. He made us feel like customize our trip however we wanted. All of our tour was managed well and the price of the tour was suitable for us."

            "review": "Can't-Miss Experience!. We had a fantastic three-day tour with Camel Safaris earlier this month, and everything went perfectly. A quick note: we are frequent international travelers who have never gone on an organized tour before. When we travel, we usually do a bunch of research, rent a car, and go at it on our own. After reading the reviews of Camel Safaris (and not speaking a word of Berber or Arabic, and only a few words of French), booking a tour seemed prudent, and I'm so glad we did!Ali helped arrange everything ahead of time, and his emails were always very prompt and friendly. Mohammed picked us up in Fes, and we liked him from the start. He's super smart, polite, charming, and obviously loves his country. We had such a great time talking to him about the customs, religion, food, politics, favorite soccer teams, etc. The tour itself was fantastic, too - we fed monkeys in a cedar forest, rode camels into the desert and spent the night in a Berber tent, toured an underground well, visited an ancient kasbah, drove through the most beautiful gorges and oases, and ate the best food in roadside cafes with not a tourist in sight. The hotel where we stayed in Ouarzazete was gorgeous, and the desert hotel where we cleaned up after the desert camping was great, too (we had booked the mid-level accommodation level and were blown away that both weren't considered 'luxury'). The whole trip really avoided anything overtly touristy-feeling (camel-riding is inherently touristy, but it was *awesome* and a bucket-list thing for us). I kept thinking how happy I was that we'd chosen this tour to really get a feel of the countryside (and make a new Moroccan friend in Mohammed). Had we just visited the big cities on our trip to Morocco, it would have completely transformed the vacation. We never would have learned so much about the culture and experienced the country's rural beauty without Camel Safaris; skipping the tour would have been a huge mistake! I highly recommend this company and the experience it provides."

Great reviews did not do our experience justice - Superb, enriching, different every day, wonderful guide who is now a friend, and welcomed us into his village and big circle of friends and relatives, exotic hotels, great Toyota Land Cruiser vehicle for off-roading with the Berber nomads, and for about half the per day cost of Rick Steve with our exclusive, wonderful driver!If you want an unforgettable experience, and don't want to be just a tourist, Mohammed, our driver, and Ali at Camel Safaris were a super choice for us."

We had such a wonderful time and wish we could of had more time to explore! Our guide, Mohammed, was awesome! He was so friendly and accommodating, he made us feel like we could customize our trip however we wanted, and ended up being a great photographer! If we wanted to stop by a sight we could or if not head on to the next adventure.It was incredible how much we fit into 3 days! He was so knowledgeable and answered all our questions even if they were silly. The car was very nice and clean and very comfortable especially when we had to travel for several hours at a time. We felt that in three short days we saw more of Morocco then we ever would have on our own and it was such an authentic experience and did not feel very touristy, and a big reason for that was Mohammed. One of our favorite parts of the trip was riding camels into the Sahara desert to stay the night. It was an unforgettable experience and the stars were gorgeous. The next day we got to meet Mohammed's mother and she gave us a berber pizza, it was so delicious! Unfortunately, Mohammed got stung by a bee while we were eating it, but he was in good spirits even with a bee sting! We stayed at a hotel in the Valley of the Roses, it had one of the most incredible views we have ever seen. For the price we paid they over-delivered. By the end of this trip we had such and incredible time, Mohammed and the tour more than exceeded our expectations. We left Morocco with so much knowledge of the culture, great experiences and a new friend, Mohammed. We would recommend this company to anyone and we would definitely return for another tour."

My friends and I enjoyed our visit from the moment we were picked up by our guide in Fes to the end in Marrakech that came way too soon - three days wasn't nearly enough! We were well taken care of by our guide Mohammed who was with us from start to finish. He was wonderful the entire time, always smiling and in the best of spirits, making sure we were enjoying ourselves throughout the trip. He was very patient with the unending list of questions we had about everything we were seeing and had a detailed answer for each one! We were lucky to enjoy delicious Moroccan food, learn so much about the culture, and see beautiful landscapes and touristic sites. We would have never been able to plan the amazing trip that we had on our own. I originally planned to visit only Fes and Marrakech, but after having gone on a tour between the two I am so thankful to have see everything in between - it was the smaller towns and sites along the way that I enjoyed the most! I owe it to Camel Safaries, our awesome guide Mohammed, and the amazing crews at the hotels we stopped at along the way for a truly incredible trip! If you are considering a visit, absolutely book with Camel Safaries, they will make sure you have a great time!"

We don't typically take organized tours but decided the best way to do this was by paying for a guide. After MUCH research, my friend found Mohammed and Camel Safaries. This was ABSOLUTELY worth every penny. Mohammed picked us up for our 3 day tour and drove us out to a beautiful city none of us remember the name to. Along the way, we stopped for scenic photo ops, lunch, casbah ruins, a detour through a palm tree grove, and a little off roading. We would not have had the opportunity to see what we did without our awesome guide Mohammed. He was knowledgeable and friendly and lots of fun. The next two days were just as great! I think the absolute best was the local market he took us to with donkey parking and livestock for sale with a little Berber pizza picnic in the Sahara desert. I can't say enough about Mohammed's hospitality and how respectful he is. Choose Camel Safaries and I promise you won't regret it!"

Many roads were broken and impassable. We had to reschedule and change our itinerary, often at the last minute. Ali and his team were fully accommodating, sending us information and suggesting alternatives, all with our safety in mind. My email chain with Ali reached almost 40 long messages back-&-forth. In the end, by delaying our trip by 4 days so that the roads could be repaired, and doing our trip in reverse (Fes -> Sahara -> Marrakesh), we had a successful trip.Youssef (pronounced yu-su) was our guide. He was an excellent driver, especially given that many of the roads we traversed were covered in pot-holes, partially washed away, or even covered by a surging river (we had to wait for the water to subside for that one.) We never felt unsafe with Youssef at the wheels.Seeing the Sahara sunrise is bucket-list worthy, and is now one of my favorite things ever. Sandboarding down the dunes and riding the camels were also super fun. If you visit Morocco, don't hesitate about making the long trip to the Sahara, and if you do, Camel Safaries is a terrific choice."

            "review": "'wow- What a Trip!'. We travelled to Morocco with our 2 teenage boys to have a bit of an adventure. We had 11 days to fit in an awful lot and travel a long way! Having read the reviews for Camel Safaries we decided to see if Ali could come up with an Itinerary to suit our needs in the time frame allowed. Not only did he come up with everything we asked for but the price was affordable and included everything except our drinks and lunches. We had a Toyota 4x4 driven by Ibrahim our very happy (and safe) driver and Mustapha our guide who was the font of all knowledge (answering our thousands of questions ),who was very courteous, amenable and spoke great English. They both had a great sense of humour which suited our family down to the ground! We stayed in a variety of beautiful old Riads along the way,all slightly different but lovely and the food was always great.We did a camel ride and an overnight stay in Berber tents in the desert..that night we had the best Tagine of the whole trip followed by a drum party and the boys had a go on sandboards down the dunes as the sun went down..what a great night! The guys hired brand new quad bikes the next day and had the time of their lives riding through the dunes and back to our Riad for a candlelit supper under the trees!We saw the most spectacular scenery on our 3 day journey to the coast which was continually changing and quite breathtaking. We stopped whenever we liked to stretch our legs and take photos and always had a nice lunch somewhere en route. Our final few days were spent in Essaouira, surfing,paddleboarding, relaxing and horseriding. Ali sought out a lovely quiet surf beach not too far away as a suggested option and made sure we could hire boards there, the waves were massive and we had a fantastic time. As we had 3 nights in the same hotel Ali had arranged that we only ate at the hotel for one and got to go and experience other fantastic restaurants that served seafood on the other 2 nights..that was brilliant and so thoughtful. Having Mustapha with us gave us the chance to go to places and see things we would't have done had we driven ourselves and we learnt so much about life in Morocco from him. We really got a taste of the local culture,which is just what we had wanted and all learnt to say a few things in Arabic/Berber which the locals seemed to enjoy.. We all give Ali and his team a massive thumbs up and thank you for making our trip everything we hoped for and more."

Everything was very well organized and Hassan our guide was very friendly and upbeat with the kids. We especially liked meeting his friend in his home town who gave us a tour of the market and played a bit of soccer with our girls. The camel trek and staying in the Berber tent exceeded our expectations.This is a pretty straightforward tour so expect to see other tours following the same path as you. The exception is one day where you do go off the beaten path to see the Berbers in the caves which was very interesting and a lot of driving that day, but getting off the beaten path frequently is. The mid range places were nicer than I expected, but also larger (less intimate) than I expected. There is a lot of ground to cover in a short amount of time so there is a lot of driving almost every day (4.5-7hrs a day) which limited our spontaneous exploring. If you can take longer and break it up more, I highly suggest it. The breakfasts and dinners were all very good. Lunch options were limited bc it was Ramadan, but instead of hot sit down lunches of tagine and kebobs at usually more than 10USD per person, picking up fresh foods like bread, cheese, and tomotoes from local markets would have been preferable, but less available bc of the timing. Overall, this is a solid choice, well organized and well priced."

We couldn't say better things about our guide and driver Youssef who was kind, friendly and knowledgeable (and a very safe driver!). It was also great to have a guide from the Erg Chebbi/Merzouga region who knew the area very well. We stayed at great hotels for the duration of our trip and Ali was very accommodating during our trip planning and to last minute itinerary changes we wanted to make (while we were already on day 2 of our trip). We were never rushed and had the flexibility to visit anything we were interested in (or skip anything we weren't). The price that Ali quoted us from the beginning was reasonable and while on arrival guides were eager to offer us a lower price, we found comfort in paying a little extra for safety, reliability and comfort throughout our trip. (Others we met who traveled with other companies/guides varied greatly when it came to their experiences and satisfaction with their trips and accommodations) I would absolutely recommend camel safaries (and our guide Yousef!) to anyone visiting Morocco. PS I would recommend a 4 day vs. a 3 night trip as you will be doing a lot of driving and having the day to rest in Merzouga prior to our overnight desert camping was a wonderful break!"

He was a careful and SAFE driver, had a great sense of humor, was supportive of our photography focus, and like Ali in the head office, he was flexible and worked hard to get us to the places that we wanted to go. He was a fount of information about the desert and about the customs of Berber people. We loved hearing his stories about his family's partial transition from desert nomadism to settled town life, and were amazed at his musical talents as well. We also arranged a transfer from Marrakech to Casablanca Airport with a stop at the Hassan II mosque. Our driver on that day was Ali (not the same as Ali the owner), and he was also very friendly, and we really enjoyed learning from him about the history of Morocco and the Berber people. Our impression is that Camel Safaris is a great company that it is continuing to improve. Director Ali checked in with his drivers every day, and both he and the drivers sincerely asked us for feedback/constructive criticism.

Mohammed was my tour guide and driver and was the best one you can ask for. The tour started in Casablanca, we drove(he drove, I took pictures) along the Atlantic ocean until we reach Laayoune in Western Sahara. Then we circled through Atlas mountain to return to Casablanca. It was a truly unique experience. Whether it was seeing the herds of flamigos flying in Khnifiss National Park(with sand dunes as background); walking along the rocky beach; stopping for camels and goats on the road; listening to children's prayer in Atlas mountain; shopping in the market in Laayoune or attending town's fair to celebrate Islamic New Year, I was able to see Morocco up close and personal. Mohammed was great at planning and organizing the tour and was very knowledgeable and entertaining. He worked very hard to ensure the tour met my expectation. The tour not only met my expectation, it exceeded it."

Our driver and guide Ibrahim was very willing to do the best for us and has done an awesome job. He is fun and warm-hearted. The most impressive part is to have a traditional lunch in Ibrahim\u2019s home and met his 2-month old baby girl! We really enjoyed it! Would I recommend Camel Safaris? Absolutely! The service, the trip, the people all left a very good impression on us. Thank you!"

After a few months of trip planning and research, we decided to hire a local touring company for the section of Atlas and central Morocco. I contacted Camel&Safaries based on the good reviews at the TripAdvisor for their quality services provided. Ali patiently worked with me to customize the itinerary to fulfill my wish list. He was very responsive to all my questions. We booked a 4 day 3 night Atlas, central Morocco, desert and Volubilis tour, started from Marrakech and ended at Meknes. Camel&Safaries provided a nine seat Mercedi-Benz van, a driver (Anazis) and a tour guid (Mohammed) With all the luggages, we could still seated comfortably in the car for 4 days. Both the guide and driver were very knowledgeable and informative. They not only answered all our questions, but also enlightened us with their living cultures by their personal/family stories. We had many laughs and shared stories of cultural differences. It was like a family vacation. At the end of the tour and before dropping us at our hotel in Meknes, Mohammed had gone out of his way to arrange a private car for us taking us to Fez the next day afternoon. It was a comfortable ride at a reasonable price. In a summary, the quality of the inclusive services, accommodations and meals in this tour was beyond our expectations. We had a wonderful time in Morocco; the tour with Camel&Safaries was one of the major tributes to this memorable experience. The lunches were not included in the tour package. The restaurants Mohammed took us for lunches were very touristy; especially the one in Meknes was pricy and not good. Camel&Safaries may check out other restaurants for better selections."

We were collected from our beautiful little Riad in the Fez Medina by Hamid. Hamid's experience, knowledge and command of English meant that the long road trips were constantly fascinating and entertaining. Feeding the monkeys in the cedar forests of the Middle Atlas gave us a welcome break from the road. Hamid always found excellent places to stop and eat and was extremely flexible when it came to what we did and didn't want to see (Argan Oil co-operative - YES! Film sets - Not really!) Our night under the stars and camel ride was truly magical and none of us resented being woken to sit on a dune and watch the sunrise. We loved the Todra Gorges and the stunning Ait Ben Haddad. Crossing the High Atlas and sweeping down the valley to Marrakech was another highlight. I'd do it all again tomorrow..."

The long drive days were interspersed with shorter days and very comfortably 3 stays that were of 2 nights duration.We chose the luxury accommodation and were not disappointed except for one huge hotel which was not what we would have chosen. The camel ride and the over night stay in the desert was magical, sharing our dinner with a small group of people from all over the world.Mohammed our guide was fantastic and we came out our trip a lot wiser about this society than when we started.

Luckily a co-worker had taken a tour with Camel Safaries and had been very pleased. I began to correspond with Mohammed - who I believe does most of the email correspondence - and found him to be very delightful. We decided to do a 4 day/3 night tour from Marrakesh to Fes - via the Sahara.Mohammed and Mohammed (our driver) picked us up right on time at our Riad. He had contacted us the day before to make sure that we had arrived safely and would be ready to go. Over the next four days we learned alot about Morocco. Mohammed was always willing and able to answer any questions and to make suggestions.We stayed at the Kabash Chez Pierre the first night where we had a lovely room and the best dinner of our trip. It was fantastic!Our second night we enjoyed in the desert. Unfortunately it was overcast, it actually rained (!), so we did not get either a great sunset or sunrise or a great view of the stars. However, we had a good time with the other 9 guests telling stories and listening to the Berber music provided by our hosts. Tents were comfortable. We had a hotel room back at the base where we started from and were able to leave most of our belongings there.Mohammed arranged for Berber pizza the next day which my husband has said was the best food he had. We saw so much that it is impossible to go into detail. I would trust Mohammed and his Uncle who owns the company to look into and help with any arrangements you want. At our request Mohammed also made arrangements for a guides in the Medina for both Marrekesh and Fes. Which we highly recommend.We likely won't be back in Morocco soon - as there are other places we want to see - but if I was going I would definitely book through Camel Safaries."

We were driven in a comfortable, capable jeep by the brilliant Barack who showed us his incredible country! We listened to native music, saw the most breathtaking sights and drank many a cup of mint tea. In particular,watching the sunset, star-gazing and the sunrise in the Sahara were just spectacular.

Ali from Camel Safaries arranged everything, from transportation to accommodation to activities and planned everything according to our tastes.

One of our travelers was vegetarian and Ali was very helpful in finding us restaurants we could all enjoy. Through him, we also befriended several locals who I still keep in touch with and whom gave us a local's perspective on life in Morocco. In a country where you might expect some hiccups during travel, this trip was completely worry-free and went so smoothly because Ali and our driver, Youssef, handled everything. The people at Camel Safaries are not just professionals at what they do, but they are good people. By the end of our trip, we all become good friends.

Ali was our primary contact in arranging the custom tour and was always helpful and responsive along the way.Our driver for the entire trip was Brahim. Picked us up upon arrival in Casablanca and headed straight towards Fez with a stop in Meknes. We met a local guide in Meknes for a 2 hour tour of town, then into Fez. We spent 1.5 days in Fez (with a terrific female local guide -- since we were 2 girls travelling, it was fascinating to ask her about life in Morocco). We also enjoyed our stop at a ceramics factory in Fez (may have been a bit touristy, but the ceramics were beautiful and nicer quality than ones we found elsewhere). We then continued on to Marrakesh for 3 days, meeting a local guide there as well. We took a one day excursion to Essaouira for a change of scenery and it was nice to escape the heat and chaos Marrakesh. Flew out of Marrakesh. Camel safaries provided all transportation and transfers. The restaurants they took us to were good (perhaps not outstanding), but the last night in Marrakesh we really enjoyed dinner at a more modern, less touristy restaurant outside of the kasbah walls -- near the post office downtown. It was a nicer place with modern takes on Moroccan flavors. Unfortunately I can't remember the name... but you should ask your driver for alternative options with dining when you start to get tired of the same old tagines and pastillas and cous cous, which we ate for the first 4 days of the trip.We stayed in great riads (see my other reviews) booked through Camel Safaries.Overall, Camel Safaries was great. They required only a deposit upon booking (via Western Union) and we paid the balance in cash in person at the conclusion of our tour (so be prepared to carry a lot of cash throughout the tour).The only downside -- we were focused on meeting Brahim at the Casablanca airport upon arrival and neglected to get local currency from the ATM right away, thinking it would be easy to stop at an ATM along the way. Brahim was concerned about us using a rural ATM on a Sunday in case there were issues with the transaction, so we didn't end up getting cash until day 3 of the trip. In the meantime, he was our personal currency exchange. This wasn't Camel Safaries' problem so much as a suggestion for other travellers to go ahead and get local currency from the ATM at the airport!"

I also wanted to add a note to recommend our guide, Mohamed Mazouz, who was incredible. He was incredibly engaging throughout the trip, and made my wife and I feel like family.

I highly recommend paying the couple extra euros and going with Ali as we met other people along the way that didn't pay much less but were crammed into a van with 6-9 people. We had our own private tour, we stopped and took pictures or are when we wanted, well worth it in my books.Our trip went from Marrakech to the zagora desert. 7 hours of driving each way. A camel trek out to the desert camp and back and 7 hours home. The trip flew by though, lots to see and do along the way. Thank you again Ali and brian for a trip I won't ever forget!Your friends from Canada. Matt and basil."

            "review": "A Fantastic Moroccan Experience!!!!. My friend and I recently returned from Morocco and went on the 4 day/3 night desert tour with Camel Safaries. Our initial research proved most companies in Morocco follow a similar route so we based our decision to go with Camel Safaries on their friendliness and communication through many email exchanges. Ali, the company owner, was exceptional with answering our numerous questions, responding to emails in a timely manner, and providing us with enough information to feel comfortable and excited for our adventure. Our tour was scheduled with Mohammed and Hamid; they were/are a great team. Each of them have their roles, Hamid, the driver was excellent. Never once did I feel unsafe or uncomfortable being a passenger in the car. Mohammed, the guide, is incredibly knowledgeable and thorough in his understanding and explanations about the various sites along the tour. His expertise is not only tour specific but any questions or curiosities asked throughout the journey Mohammed knew the answer. He is so very kind and always a gentleman. Hamid and Mohammed never rushed us and even allowed us to deviate from the scheduled sites to take in other experiences we saw along the way (a local village street market). The team\u2019s kindness never stopped even after our tour ended. We made new friends in Morocco. Anyone who is planning a trip to Morocco must book a tour with Camel Safaries and even, if possible, request Hamid and Mohammed as your guided team."

Ali has someone arranged to get us to airport on time...This is just an example of how wonderful Ali Oussou has been throughout the trip. I shared our itinerary with friends who have been to Morocco and they cant believe how much we have seen and enjoyed in just one day: all the imperial cities, the high Atlas mountains, the beautiful valleys and gorges in the south, camel safari and night in Sahara! But we never felt rushed or exhausted because it was so well organized. The Riads were beautiful and we couldn't have asked for better food at each meal. The price very reasonable but the highlight of the highlight of the trip is definitely the warm, friendly hospitality of Ali. It made a huge difference to no French and Arabic speakers to have someone like him through out the trip and explain the wonderful history and culture of Morocco. I would recommend that you check out Camel Safaries if you are planning to come to Morocco."

He picked us up at the Riad and off we went. We took this trip out to the desert with Ali, a driver and 2 other people we be-friended on the trip. It was a beautiful drive into the desert, stopping along a few towns to explore and eat. The drive deeper into the desert was very hot. At one point we pulled over to chase a huge yellow lizard. It was quite fun. Once we arrived we each got into a camel and Ali put us into the care of a guide who took us into the desert sand dunes to a camp site which was already set up. There we settled in. We played music with our guide, drank wine, and the guide made us an amazing Tagine in the desert sand. The best I've had! We all decided to sleep side by side outside under the stars because the tents felt very dark. At some point in the middle of the night we saw comets and shooting starts.... We watched the sun come up and then we prepared to explore a bit before returning to meet Ali. It was amazing! I did however think, if our guide happens to drop dead, how would we leave this place??? I guess Ai would have come for us. :) It was one of the best experiences ever.... And Ali is great. Very informative, fun and accommodating."

Omar was also very friendly and his driving never gave us any cause for concern.The tour was well thought out, as every day was fun filled with activities. We actually chose a multi-day trip and it was very nice that he chose for us various accommodations so we see what the residences are like. From sleeping in a goat hair tent in the dessert, to a mud/straw hut in the middle of the mountains, to more modern establishments. Our highlight was most definitely the camel ride to see the sunset in the dessert. Also eating freshly caught fish in Essaouria was great. Ali has a great understanding of Moroccan culture and he educated us on every thing we asked! He's like a mini Moroccan encyclopedia :)"

After having a nice breakfast together, we were shown the village and then started our camel ride.I can only say that these 3 days were one of the most intense days of my life!! Mohamed was very knowledgeable and provided us with lots of interesting information on Berber life, the desert and everything. He is also a great storyteller and can speak innumerable languages (even bits and pieces of Chinese)!After the first night at a Nomad family's home (which was more than recommendable), I got a little sick because of the sun and heat, but Mohamed went out of his way to help me feel better!So if I come back to Morocco, I will definately book with Camel Safaries again, as they give you the feeling to discover something REAL, something heartfelt!

His English is impeccable and he answered such candid questions of ours. We really got a good feel for the culture. We did a lot of driving through the Atlas Mountains to Fez, the Sahara Desert and then to Casablanca. Yosef was an excellent driver and also entertaining. We were never at a loss for words and laughed a lot. He also sang for us and answered lots of our questions. My favorite part was the camel ride in the desert and then sleeping overnight in a tent.

My partner Tracy and I met Ali from Camel Safaris in Marrakesh on the recommendation of a Canadian couple we had met in 2009.We both immediately liked and felt comfortable with Ali and signed up for a 5 days trip commencing the next morning.We thoroughly enjoyed the experience, being one of the highlights of a 6 mth vacation through North Africa and Europe.Ali and Yusuf ( his calm and deliberate driver) made the 5 days navigating some difficult terrain and cultural differences a breeze. There was never any moments where we felt 'obligated' to buy from a local vendor ( as had happened previously on tours) and Tracy was treated with the utmost respect and courtesy.Ali has designed his Tours extremely well. Each day is fascinating, with appropriate breaks for meals factored into the schedule. The drive from Marrakesh into the Sahara was breathtaking, my DSLR was working overtime, and meeting the woman who lives in a cave with her family was also a highlight.We are still in contact with Ali, in fact on our return to Australia a glass of Saharan sand was accidently thrown out and upon emailing Ali he sent me another bag of sand!! Now that's service.We can't recommend Camel Safaris highly enough."

We found Ali Oussou through a posting on TripAdvisor, and he subsequently sent me half-a-dozen references, one in my own hometown whom I met for coffee. After speak to Ali by email and phone and then meeting his reference in person, I felt quite comfortable booking him for our trip. He helped me plan our itinerary and booked hotels for us. Our itinerary was: Marrakesh - Ouarzazate - Tinghir - Merzouga - Midelt - Fez - Rabat - Casablanca.Ali picked us up from the airport with his driver Youssef and a 4x4 Toyota Land Cruiser. He stayed with us the whole time as we sped across southern Morocco, stopping in tiny Berber villages along the way. He also arranged a 2-day camel trek into the desert, along with sandboarding - one of the most amazing experiences we have ever had.Ali speaks Berber, Classical Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, French, English and Spanish, and has a degree in Linguistics from the University of Meknes. He was a knowledgeable, friendly and very competent guide.We became good friends with both Ali and Youssef. If we ever took a local guide in one of the big cities (local guides are required by law in each city), Ali personally introduced us to him in advance. Youssef himself owns the Toyota and always made sure it was clean, functioning and safely guarded.Ali even arranged a cell phone for us, and texted us while we were with local guides to make sure everything was OK.Due to Ali's knowledge and hard work, we felt like guests in Morocco, not tourists. He introduced us to numerous locals in a way that you are never able to in groups. We had tea with a Berber woman who lives in a cave and has 11 children. As Ali put it, She has very little money but a very big heart.This trip really put into perspective the diversity of life in our world, and we returned to Morocco amazed in every way; by the rich culture, geography, language, cuisine, and hospitality. We could never have had such an amazing experience had we not had the good fortune of finding Ali Oussou."

Our group are not the sort of people who would generally choose to go on a guided tour of a country and have found our way around countries by ourselves previously. We hummed and harred about whether to go with a guide. My wife convinced us to go with Ali and Yousif as her mother had travelled with them before and had raved about it.We did not regret the decision at all.We would have missed so much if we had not travelled with Ali. His knowledge of the local areas was amazing and we went off the beaten path to see things that we would have drifted past if we had travelled solo.Some of the hotels were a bit of an adventure and they certainly added to the experience. The vehicle was comfortable and we stopped to take in the scenery and meet the locals, cats and camels along the way.Ali proved to be quite the entertainer and gave us a display of his drumming at a restaurant we stopped at along the way. The proprietors all seemed to know and like Ali and Yousif and were always happy to see him and share some jokes with him. We would not have been so well received if we had not been with them I'm sure. Our tour was the middle section of a two week holiday and was easily the highlight of the fortnight. We started in Marakech and were dropped off in Essaouira.It surprised us that Ali received messages and calls from previous travellers on our trip, but since leaving Morocco we have kept in touch and are promising ourselves that we will return and catch up with the eternally youthful Ali in person.If you can't decide whether to travel with Camel Safaries, stop thinking about it and just do it. The only reservations you should have fpr one of these tours should be in the charismatic hotels along the way."

Months before the trip, we corresponded via emails and Ali was always prompt with his replies. I had a thousand questions and Ali was never short of answers. He picked us up from the airport and travelled with us throughout. What I liked about him the most was his positive attitude - anything you ask, he'd say \"It's possible\" - and he'd make it possible also. When my husband fell sick because of the heat in Merzouga, he arranged to keep the room for one whole day without any extra charge, so that my husband could sleep in through the day. The Riads we stayed in were breathtaking, the car that travelled with us was top notch, the places we visited were magical. We are absolute foodies and Ali made sure we ate at the local places and the Tagines and Tanginas we've had there were far more delicious than the ones at renowned but touristic restaurants.Ali is polite, friendly, enthusiastic, honest, flexible and it's very apparent that he takes pride in showing off his country to foreigners. Our driver was Hamid and he is such a sweet guy - a bit shy, but extremely funny. We are usually independent travellers, but decided to go through a pre-arranged tour of Morocco because of shortage of time and the distance we had to travel and I don't regret that I did it. The car was at our disposal and the distances, though very long sometimes, with enough stops in between, through breath taking landscapes, was worth it. I shopped around quite a bit before booking the tour through Camel Safaries and the reviews that I got on TripAdvisor and other travel forums about Camel Safaries was bang on and it was relatively cheaper too, than some of the quotes I got from other recommended guides and travel companies.I would absolutely recommend Ali and Camel Safaries to anyone planning a trip to Morocco. Thanks Ali. You made it a very memorable holiday."

The duration of my trip fell on the period of Ramadan this year and my driver and my guide traveling with me under scorching sun for hours without water and food. However, they never complained and in fact, they were usually the one who tried to keep me awake by talking to me(I usually was tired out from the heat) and telling me stories of Morocco. They definitely show me the famous hospitality of Moroccans as they invited me to break the fast with them most nights and they became like my family members by the end of the trip. In the span of 2 weeks, I got to see Morocco's diverse landscapes, beautiful architecture, amazing artwork and mostly, the hospitality and warmth of Moroccans. People were so wonderful and were not hesitating to open up their doors and their hearts to me. When I left, I was being told that I have 2 new families in Morocco now and I will always be welcomed back. It was definitely an amazing trip and a great eye-opener, I will never forget about it and look forward to my future visit.

The tour we arranged involved departing from Marrakech and going through the High Atlas mountains, stopping by many sights in south-eastern Morocco, the first night in Dades Gorge and day 2 camping out in the desert in a berber tent, and the last day driving through the Middle Atlas mountains onto F\u00e9s. This was by far the best part of my holiday, especially the night in the desert.Ali really took care of us and did all he could to give us the best tour he could give. You could really see this was something he loved to do. Despite the long distance from Marrakech to the desert and then to F\u00e9s, we stopped to see so many things that it didn't feel like a long car ride. Ali talked the whole way tirelessly explaining every little detail, I felt bad at times when I would nod off because he was making so much of an effort and I really appreciated it as opposed to someone just driving you. The things we saw were amazing too. The snow covered High Atlas and Middle Atlas mountains, monkeys in the cedar forest, several Casbahs (the best being A\u00eft Benhaddou) and Oases, and some impressive valleys like Todra Gorge. We couldn't have seen these places in the amount of time on our own, nor would we have dared driving through those scary roads at the High Atlas mountains. When we got to the desert, I couldn't believe my eyes. It looked like a painting! I took a bottle full of sand from the Sahara as a souvenir just to show friends how red the sand is. The night out was also quite amazing. Despite the cold weather I got a rug out next to the fire and lay down with 2 thick blankets on top of me and just stared at the stars for ages. Its just amazing how lit up the sky is when there are no lights. The tents themselves are very traditional except for the beds inside, but i appreciated this since i already lay on the sand next to fire and couldn't imagine doing that for the night. If anyone is ever considering a trip to Morocco don't just hang out in the big cities like Marrakesh or F\u00e9s, make the effort to see the desert it really is worth it! Weeks before this trip when I was in Thailand for xmas, I remember talking to some norwegian tourists in my hotel who told me how unremarkable their desert tour was and how uncomfortable the camel ride was but I have to say the camel ride did not feel uncomfortable at all. It was very well cushioned and I was on such a high during the 2 hr camel ride that by the time it ended i was like .. oh are we there already??6 months on I still remember Morocco and how great it was there. Thanks Ali for an unforgettable 3 days."

Overall, our expectations were exceeded by a lot."

We returned recently from 10 day tour covering the northern part of Morocco (Asilah [coast], Chefchaouen, Fes, Meknes, Volubilis) and mid-region areas Marrakech, Essaouira (coast), and Imlil. Consistency is the key\u2026.once again, Camel Safaries, exceeded our expectations. Our guide was just as detailed oriented, knowledgeable, and professional as our other tours. The vehicle was clearly well maintained and we felt at ease and safe with the driver especially on those winding roads! Camel Safaries employs experienced, local individuals that speak English very well and truly are passionate about their country and their jobs. Each was very personable which was so appreciated as we do enjoy conversations learning about the culture and intricacies of local life. It\u2019s amazing how many lovely areas there are in Morocco. Asilah was suggested through our research on travel sites like TripAdvisor and we were very pleased as it was much less touristy than expected. Essaouira was a lovely coastal town but a touristy. I highly recommend the \u201cfish stalls\u201d. A market of fresh fish, you choose and purchase, and next door is prepared to your liking in an outdoor restaurant area. Chefchaouen, a beautiful hillside village, located in the Rif mountains\u2026artistic blue-washed homes and wonderful place to wander. Fes was definitely a much larger city than Marrakech. We preferred Marrakech. The square of djemaa el Fna is always entertaining and of course, brushing-up on negotiating skills with time to shop amongst the various souks is a great experience and fun!"
