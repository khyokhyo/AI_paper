Its original inhabitants were the Incas, who wove a network of picturesque alleys full of stairs. Cars can barely move in that landscape, that makes it not advisable to carry suitcases.It is remarkable the small church of San Blas, which contains its own treasure: the pulpit, carved in wood, most beautiful in the world."

There are roads and alleys, shops and courtyards full of alpaca, baby alpaca, art, souvenirs, maps and lots more besides. You can wander around and if you want baby alpaca scarfs or throws, then this is the place to get them - do not wait until you get to Lima, as they have very little and it is more expensive. There are also some great restaurants and bars."

I felt safe walking around alone day and night. There were lots of great stores and restaurants. Visiting the markets were fun. I was there on a Sunday when the museums were closed so wasn't able to do that. I visited many of the churches and plazas which were lovely. It was fun just wandering around. I highly recommend staying and spending time here."

Ok, it is seriously one block of steepness, not an issue unless you are ninety with a bum knee... We went to Peru with out two toddlers (a story in itself) and they both marched up that hill no problem. Besides the fact that there are shops all along the way up...so plenty of places to rest if you had to. We loved San Blas and next time I would love to spend more time there just drinking at a local cafe. Beautiful for all. So no taxi, or you will miss all the shops and all the fun."

We never had to take taxis anywhere in Cusco because of the convenient location. There were also a lot of great restaurants in this area (Incanto, Don Tomas, Pachapapa, etc). We were also able to walk to Sacsayhuaman from here (little bit of a hike, but definitely doable). I recommend staying at Orquidea hostel in this area (very cute hostel, clean, wonderful staff, and cheap..it felt more like a bed & breakfast than a hostel). If you're looking for a hotel instead of a hostel, there is a Marriott there too."

Quite a few unique handmade things here, which I haven\u2019t seen at the other markets. It is not a huge plaza but much more laid back than Plaza de Armas, giving it a really authentic Peruvian feel. You can almost imagine yourself sitting here on a Sunday afternoon, sipping on coca tea while the world goes by! I recommend visiting the Coca museum on the plaza. I can\u2019t remember the entry fee but it was really something very insignificant and it was extremely interesting! We just stumbled upon it and I\u2019m glad we stepped inside. The narrow cobbled lane with beautiful original Inkan stone walls, leading up to to San Blas Plaza is very pretty and lined with various little shops selling interesting things and very cheap souvenirs! This is also where you will find the very famous Inka Man who will pose for a photo with you (for a propina, of course)! Also along the way to San Blas, you will come across quite a few traditional old women with baby llamas or little kids in traditional dress who want you to pose for a photo with them (once again, for a propina!) Careful, the women will shove the llama into our hands and then be very upset if you don\u2019t give her money for the privilege. This is a nice experience to have once or twice but it becomes quite a bit annoying after a while \u2013 not so much about having to pay every time as it is only a few cents - but it\u2019s really a nuisance how the old women \u2013 often with an unwilling child in tow - practically step in your way and become quite rude if she\u2019s ignored. I guess tourism created this mentality so we can\u2019t really blame them for wanting to make a living. Careful of those steps and cobblestones \u2013 through years of use, they\u2019re shiny and slippery as hell! My feet just went out from under me and landed me on my backside on top of my camera ($580 damage!...) It was a hot day and I was wearing thongs \u2013 not a good idea! Wear something with grip on the sole if you value your tailbone!The whole San Blas area was very pretty and colorful! Many photo opportunities if that\u2019s your thing! I would allow a whole afternoon for this as rushing through would defeat the object. Really enjoyed the whole experience! Definitely a must do in Cusco!"

San Blas is so pretty with its narrow, cobbled streets and character-laden buildings, which include hotels, restaurants, artist studios, and various shops and businesses. It's quite a hilly area so if you have bad knees or have trouble with the altitude, this can be a tough place to get around in. We had been at altitude for over a week by the time we got to Cusco, and it was always a bit tough walking back to our San Blas hotel at the end of the day. I had to take it slow. It's not far from the central square so it's convenient while being away from the hustle and bustle."

Booking responded that it was at the hotel's discretion and had not approved. I proceeded to call the hotel to explain the situation and they were as unsympathetic as you could imagine.. there was response was that it did not matter because their hotel policy was their hotel policy. I asked to speak with the manager and they said he was unavailable but would return my call - which never happened.Anyway so I tried to dispute the charge through my credit card and the hotel basically said that i never notified them and sent a no show receipt to the credit card company basically to say that I made the reservation and never showed up.Beware of this hotel - as these are clearly shady practices. You would think that the base of their money is made from tourism that they would have a little bit more tact and a higher level of customer service."

Similar narrow alleys that cars cannot go thru, with great vistas of the city. The vista point/Mirador provides a good overview of the city - we were there in the day and had a great view - wanted to come back at night to look at the lights, but the thought of climbing those steps again in high altitude dissuaded us ... but I am sure it would be a great view of the city - not sure about the stars though as there could be light pollution from the city... the Mirador has a couple of displays showing how Cusco was constructed along the lines of a puma.Walking down from the Mirador, one reaches the San Blas Plaza, where the local artisans come and sell their goods - pretty good quality and at reasonable prices (after bargaining of course). The San Blas church is here, entry ticket needed, but same ticket gets you to the main Cathedral. The San Blas church has an elaborate hand crafted pulpit - their claim to fame, and some paintings, etc.The churches in Cusco when compared against the grand churches in Europe pale in comparison but perhaps it is in this stark difference, and in the absorption of local beliefs/traditions into the Catholic imageries & decorations that makes a visit to one of these churches interesting. There are restaurants and shops around the plaza, Pachapapa being one of them where we had a good dinner one evening."

Right above the fountain there is a little shop called Sacred Silver Joyeria that is run by a nice couple. He is the jeweller, and she does the sales. Worth stopping in. Also, there is a little bakery called Pantastico here--take the time to seek them out. Great banana bread, and everything we tried was delicious. The San Blas Market is much quieter than others like San Pedro, but it was a good place to get fruit juice and sandwiches for really low prices. You can hang out with all the backpackers there. They are happy to share tips about what to get."

Very noisy at night with a couple of loud night clubs right near the plaza. Lots of people hanging around there that don't make it real comfortable to walk around later in the evening. Watch out for religious holidays around here. Expect exploding fireworks at all hours, continuously night and day. Impossible to sleep anywhere near the plaza when things are in full swing. Such events are common and also accompanied by VERY loud music on stages that play well into the night. People gather in the plaza early on such days and drink warm beer all day into the night.

We stayed in san blas for two days.very charming part of cusco.up on the hill with stunning views of the city, small shops and restaurants everywhere.very narrow streets due to the fact it was built during the Inca period.(they did not have cars then).All cobblestone roads so wear sturdy shoes.The church was very cool"

It's worth to take a look if you are on souvenir shopping. During day, you can see people reading on the benches or local people singing casually by the side. But you have to check out Limbus a few minutes' walk from the plaza. The view is great. Especially at night, the food is divine, drinks too. Last time I were there, there's live music too. Great place!"

It is flanked by some nice restaurants, one of which, The Meeting Place, really stood out for its tremendous milkshakes. Further afield in the San Blas neighborhood are many shops with native art and crafts. This part of town is uphill from the Plaza de Armas, so the tourist foot traffic is mostly people staying in the San Blas area hotels and hostals. For those not staying the area, it is work a hike up the Cuesta San Blas. If you go far enough up, you can get some good Cusco views. There is a good walk from the area up to Saksaywayman.The only downsides, for me, were the ubiquitous guys trying to sell art prints and a steady stream of cars along Carmen Bajo and turning left on Cuesta San Blas."

Prices can be a bit higher but you are getting the top of the line in most shops. There are also lots of street vendors and artisans from the countryside who have very unique goods. It is a rabbit warren and some of the best places are down the narrowest streets. Lots of places for good food and beverages and look for internal courtyards where there is even more and some of the best are on upper floors with great street views. It is a safe area during the day and early evening but as usual look out for scammers. Take a cab to the San Blas church and square and take your time walking down to the main Plaza de Armas."

This place is no exception. For over $100/night you can probably find better as there is nothing particularly exceptional about this place in my opinion. You will have a dependably decent experience probably.The shower was very dependably good, which is not the case in all of Peru. The rooms were not heated and even with the two space heaters they gave us, it was pretty cold there. The little hot water packs were nice though and helped. The free teas in the lobby and decent breakfast were also nice. They had an issue charging our credit card and our payment ended up not going through after we had already left.

The Machu Picchu sandwich along with the juice I had is one of the most satisfying meals I've had in a while. The sandwich is loaded with chicken, tomatoes, eggs, cheese, herbs, and a huge helping of amazing avocado. (the best avocado I've ever had) The sandwich will set you back 5 soles as will the juice.

San Blas (unless we just didn't get to the right parts - and we were in the courtyard/plaza of the church!) is more artisanal than artistic. And the resulting efforts are rather duplicative and repetitious. If you have seen one store's collection, you've likely seen them all. (In my impression, at least.) So apart from the fact that the climb got us easily within reach of the MAP (Museo de Arte Pre-colombino) - and lunch in its courtyard restaurant, I'd say I was disappointed by what I saw in San Blas."

The Iglesia's pulpit of carved wood is an absolute treasure. It is must-see. I was completely wonder-struck. I still am. I wish I had done the audio tour, but honestly the splendor of the alter, paintings and pulpit spoke for themselves. The bookstore on the main square was delightful. The plaza is a relatively peaceful respite from the more aggressive street peddlers of the Place D'Armes although there still are plenty. But the fountain and for us sun-drenched public square were refreshing. Just off the plaza is another must-see: the Museo de Maximo Laura. Just breathtaking textile art."

San Blas is a Bohemian neighborhood, with artisans surrounding a beautiful small square and very clean market. Cusco streets are noisy because they are flooded with taxi drivers who honk at you to get your attention. However, many of the streets in San Blas are too narrow for cars, and it was nice to have a quiet stroll in the busy city. The neighborhood is north of Plaza de Armas, the main tourist square, and a quick walk to most places you'll want to go as a tourist. My boyfriend and I ate lunch at the San Blas market a few times because it was so cheap, at 4 soles per person (1.33 USD). With it comes a bowl of soup, a plate of food and a glass of juice. There are a dozen places within the market to get food or jugos naturales. They also have fresh produce and meat."

Be warned, to be allowed into the San Blas church you have to either pay or by a collective ticket that allows entrance to a variety of churches in town included Cusco's Cathedral at the main plaza. San Blas church has a pulpit carved out of a single piece of wood that it is worth paying for.

My favorite hotels are in this area and the place is hopping until 10:00 at night. There are many small wonderful caf\u00e9s to be found along its many side streets, as well as some very well known, larger restaurants. There are also great bakeries and unique antique shops. Take the time to walk along Carmen Alto, Lucrepata, and even Recoleta. The beauty of San Blas is discovering it's very steep and narrow streets and the fun of peering into the many ancient doorways. Because my hotel is on Cuesta San Blas I have spent a lot of time here and love how active it is with young tourists at night. You can also pass through this area on your way up to Saqsayhuaman if you are on foot. No need for taxis here or anywhere in the historic district! You can reach it all by foot if you have comfortable shoes. And it is all cobblestone, so leave your heels at home!"

Also there are domestic dogs everywhere, far too many to ever count once you start climbing into the warren's den of streets further up from the church.There is a church and plaza with an excellent waterfall fountain, and some small shops adjacent to it. If visiting on the right day ( and I am not sure which this is, it was there one day and not the next ) there is a craft market in the plaza. The area around the upper part of the plaza has a real hippy, backpackers feel to it with vendors setting up shop on blankets on the sidewalk and selling handmade crafts and bodywear.

For the last month, I've been staying in the San Blas area in a small hostel at 114 Tanda Pata with private room, bathroom and use of a kitchen for just 20 soles a night and feel at home in this wonderful community. This is a hippy and artesian area with narrow cobbled streets and an array of bars, cafes, restaurants, shops, galleries etc to explore. I've been here for four weeks already and never tire of exploring the area. The San Blas market is small and there's a fantastic Veggie food stall called Govinda Lily's just by the main entrance where you can eat a delicious 2 course meal for just 6 soles. There are also some fresh juice stalls which are amazing value. The church at San Blas is home to an incredible pulpit carved from a single piece of cedar wood which is a work of art and a must see. I feel very safe here, no matter what time of day or night I'm wandering about. I like to sit in the Plaza facing the water feature and writing my journal. More often than not, local people come and sit next to me and I have the opportunity to practise my Spanish. There's an amazing bakery on Tanda Pata called Pantastico and their chocolate brownies are the best I've ever tasted (on the right as you go up the stairs by the water feature). Their vegetable empanadas are great too. I'm going to find it difficult to leave this area - I feel so at home here."

If obviousness bothers you, San Blas is a partial cure: the walk up from the plaza may make your head throb (given that you're already at 11,000 feet above sea level), but it's worth the hike to find quality artisan shops, funkier little bars and 4-table restaurant nooks, lesser-known courtyards and a wandering llama or two. In San Blas, the general law of overseas travel applies: The less convenient a place is to get to, the fewer bozo travelers you'll encounter and the more interesting your experience will be."

San Blas has this really amazing vibe. It feels rustic and old, but yet retains many lovely restaurants and a square with a church. It's of course full or tourists and people trying to sell things to tourist. So the only annoying thing is that I would walk out my front door and have half a dozen sellers trying to sell me something. But it's just an amazing place and I am sure I will move back there again sometime in the future."

The bathroom was adequate, but like many hotels and hostels, the hot water was sporadic.Because Cusco is in the Andes, the nights are cold, so be prepared to pile on an extra blanket - which was available in our room.The location was great to explore the older areas of Cusco.There was good Wifi but weHad to go to the roof top patio - not a hardship.The restaurant next store was worth a visit too.

It was a nice walk, but slightly uphill. The sidewalks are very narrow, but it didn't seem to be an issue as there was little vehicle traffic.San Blas is the more bohemian part of Cusco with a large variety of shops, restaurants, and colorful streets. The San Blas Church is situated on the square with the same name. The church is a simple adobe structure with a pulpit carved from a single tree trunk. It was built in the middle of the 16th century on an Incan temple site. The square was quiet on the morning we were there. And although there was a fountain, it was not running. Around the square are a number of unique artisan shops, many selling religious works, as well as the usual tourist souvenirs. Also, most of the shops were selling items of clothing made from alpaca. On our walk back down to Cusco center, we happened upon a lovely shop in an old colonial mansion. It had a central courtyard full of colorful flowers and a fountain. For any visitor to Cusco, San Blas it a must-see."

It's also rather a hike up the hill, and there are fewer commercial nasties than there are further down. The place is centred around a small plaza. The church is pretty enough. There is an antiques store, a Spondylus jewellery store, a store you can have your aura read by a half Arizonan, half Peruvian 'capitalist indian', a folk art museum containing spectacular papier mache and plaster works, and a couple of the usual tourist shops. Food is also available above the plaza. There is also a market on Saturdays and Sundays (though it seems to be rather erratic) in the square. It's not cheap - if youre thinking of stocking up on souvenirs, hit the Central Market (San Pedro) down the hill. There are many travellers with earnest expressions, striped clothes, unusual facial hair and crystal jewellery...I thought they had died out years ago!"

Although if you have been to the cathedral first, probably nothing anywhere else in any religious establishment in Cusco will particularly stand out for its wow factor. Even so, you still could not fail to be impressed by the workmanship in this particular piece.I cannot remember if it was Pope John Paul II or the current pope, back when he was a cardinal, who had visited Cusco and declared this church to be his favourite spot of all of those he visited. Tough to argue with him although his reasons were undoubtedly different from ours.Since you will undoubtedly be visiting the cathedral complex spend the extra 15 soles or so for the complete boleto religioso, which gets you into the archbishopric museum as well, and visit this small church. Do go upstairs - there is no sign telling you either to do so or that you are not allowed. The sight of the last dozen years' or so fancy robes worn, I imagine because there are no signs whatsoever, in the annual Corpus Christi procession is almost worth the price of admission in itself.You can also sneak outside onto a little balcony which gives a pretty good view of the city as well. As an added bonus the little square beside the church has a thriving artisan's market on certain days of the week."

The streets are very narrow so that only one car can pass through and most streets cars don't even attempt to drive on. The tall white walls of the buildings hold your gaze and the many little cafes and restaurants can keep you within the few blocks for your whole trip, but might burn a hole in your wallet. This is a pretty touristy area meaning that the prices are high and there is a street vendor on every corner. It's still a good place to check out and take pictures, but look for food elsewhere if you're on a budget."

Don't miss visiting the small historic church or the many art galleries. My personal favorite was the small museum set up by the Mend\u00edvil family known for their long-neck sculptures. It will seem a bit scary at first walking through a small passageway, but it opens up to a small courtyard where the family lives and works. There you can view some of the art being made as well as a room full of long-neck sculptures made by their family."

My favorite thing about San Blas is the winding cobble stone streets and the white wash walls perched on top of the old Inca stonework. You could take a map, but it's better just to start wandering and let yourself be surprised. Beautiful purple Bougainvillea flow over some of the walls. There are some shops and restaurants, especially near the Plazoleta San Blas but apart from that it's quiet and quaint. So take a left at Carmen Alto, and then a right at Siete Angelitos, then take a turn down Siete Diablos and keep wandering. You can always walk down the hill to get to the plaza or up to get to the highway, Cristo Blanco and Sacsayhuaman ruins. Aside from climbing all the way up to the road San Blas offers some of the best views over the Cusco valley. As for the plazoleta, it's great place to sit in the sun and read a book. You can people watch too, but it's a lot calmer than the Plaza de Armas. Hippies and street artists regularly gather to practice and mingle in the Plazoleta. There's little church and a small artisan market on the weekends and some great little shops that surround the plaza. Do you do yoga? Visit Cusco Yoga Inbound for a 1.5 hr class in the morning or the evening. Visit the Frogs or 7 Angelitos bar for live music. The Meeting Place is a nice spot for coffees and light lunch. Proceeds go to a good cause. El Buen Pastor is the best for a pastry. If the San Pedro market is too overwhelming for you, try the San Blas market. Just climb up the steps above the purple wall and fountain and hang a right and then another right once you hit the end of the alley. The offerings are simpler but prices may be better. Stop in for a pizza dinner at the cozy Sumaq restaurant on 7 Angelitos. The competitor across the street is delicious too! Then there Prasada I and II and El Encuentro for vegetarians and Jack's for good homey food. Te quiero mucho, San Blas."

If you continue walking up behind the church, you get good views and explore interesting alleyways, etc.There are many very good and inexpensive restaurants in the area. To name two of the favorites located on Calle Choquechaca--Jacks' Cafe (usually crowded) and Quinta Eulalia (wonderful Peruvian/Andean food). My favorite is Pacha Papa, opposite the Church of San Blas. It has a delightful interior courtyard to eat in and the food is exceedingly good and Peruvian. I would highly recommend \"salterito\"--an appetizer of lima beans, cheese, corn, peas, onions and tomatoes.No real dislikes. But for some the steep walk up to San Blas from Plaza de Armas would be a major slog. If walking is not your thing, you can take a taxi up to the Church and walk down."

It takes some effort to get there but once there you can enjoy some of the most beautiful streets and squares in Cusco. On top of this it has also great views on the surroundings."

The san blas plaza is surrounded by wood workers and artists practicing techniques dating back to the early colonial times when the cusco school of art was most famous. On the weekend the artisans market is a must see."

A picturesque locale with a church and square which with its white walled houses and blue painted doors and windows has a real Mediterranean feel. Lots of shops down alleys off the mmain street which is quite steep and demands a slower pace in the rarified air. Plenty of local colour and atmosphere."

We sat in the square after lunch which was most pleasant. A slight 'hippy' air about it maybe ( reminiscent of my youth in the 60s!!). We tried to get into the church but two chaps sitting on the steps barred the way and wanted money. We retreated, sensing a scam attempt."

This precious plaza with the cathedral, children, fountains, great restaurants and the most beautiful artisian work I have seen. Olave and Mendivil are famous and you can just stand there wathcing them work and truly feel inspired.This is a bohemian district of San Blas, where you will enjoy popular artists who are dedicated to weaving, sculpting, and molding wonderful works of art.I plan to study spanish in a school called The Amauta which is located in this devine district."

OK I'm probably looking at this through rose-tinted spectacles, but I love Cusco and San Blas is where I lived for a few months (my mate stayed there for 2 years!) You're living amongst/with Peruvians, there's a great view across the city, it really is a lovely little neighbourhood. If you can, visit for the fiesta of los trembeladors, it's brilliant."
