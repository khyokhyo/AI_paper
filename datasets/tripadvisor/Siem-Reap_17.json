It was a lovely 'first' as it was quiet, we got some wonderful photos and it was not yet overly hot.Make sure you get to the causeway which is lovely - some great shots to be had looking over the same from the temple.I've only rated it a four as if you have limited time it is not a MUST see - but if you have more than two days it is a good addition to an itinerary.I was pleasantly surprised by how clean the bathroom facilities were here!"

We read up a good bit before visiting, so we knew who the characters were that were represented and had some idea what the meaning was. Because it's remote there's not nearly as many tourists. It may be my favorite temple out of the bunch. We negotiated a tuktuk to take us here and the 'nearby' (actually about 15km) Kbal Spean for $23. The coffee at the little coffee shop near the entrance was terrible. Unless your children have an abnormal interest in Khmer history or architecture and bas reliefs, I'm not sure why you'd bring them. Seems they won't enjoy it."

After Visiting Bantea Srei i headed to Bantea Samre , its one of the finest temples built in Hindu temple -Indian Architecture . the temple is bit far from Siem reap town, hiring a tuk tuk for a day will do good. There are some restaurants and refreshments around and vendors along the side , its not much crowded . The temple sructre is well bult with intricate carvings , the sanctum of the temple is built on a elevated platform and the surrounding the prdasstal platform of the temple sanctum is adorned with nagas sculpture . The main entrance and the causway is built in traditional Khmet Angkorian architectural style. I spent an hour strolling around the temple . Its really a wonder to reflect upon the the intricate details and the precision of the temple engineering that Khmer Kings have evolved over the ages and it still stands as a legacy and epitome of their empire and glorious past."

This temple is not that visited so one can spend hours here admiring the stone carvings. A unique feature of the temple is a moat around it (but no water) similar to Angkor Wat. Interesting place."

Forget Banteay Srei, this one is far better - especially if you have young kids - plenty of places to climb and plenty of areas to get lost inside the temples. I understand it is even better in rainy season as the moat can fill up with water. Well worth the trip here and with plenty of shade to escape the heat it is a must. Avoid the restaurant opposite though as they charge stupid prices for standard food. This temple is also hardly visited by tourists so you really will have the place to yourself for those classic Angkor photos."

Banteay Samre is a short distance east of the reservoir of Srah Srang and can be visited after sunrise at the reservoir - we did this and found that by arriving at the temple around seven thirty in the morning there was absolutely no one there apart from a sleeping cat and two local women sweeping - and even they all disappeared ...It's a wonderful experience to have an Angkor temple entirely to yourself and it felt very special as we walked around the (dry) moat in the golden early morning sun, which cast a lovely glow on the stones. The temple was built in a sort of Angkor Wat style in the 12th century and must have been very beautiful when there was water in the moat to reflect the walls and towers.Between Srah Srang and Banteay Samre are a couple of villages where it's well worth stopping to take photos - we were lucky enough to see a small herd of water buffalo tethered by the road who were as interested in us as we were in them!"

It is small and takes little time to go through compared to the larger temples. But it is singular in its apparent state of preservation of the stone carvings and is really an expression of high art and craftsmanship.Because the temple is small, you are likely to find yourself behind hordes of people who are all vying to take a photo at the spot you wanted. Relax, be patient and take your time. Most of these folks are in tour groups and have buses to catch and they will pass -- until another bus shows up. Having time to look and take photos at your leisure is your best asset, so I prefer coming without a tour group.Take the time to walk around the moat that surrounds the temple complex. There are lovely views to be had, reflections in the moat and some shade and breezes. At least that is the case before the full-blown dry season, when the moat may be empty. "

If you've already visited the bigger temples, with the thousands and the hordes, and you've got a couple of spare hours and not feeling too templed out, this temple could provide a bit of peace and quiet, yet you're still seeing something quite spectacular. Personally, I really loved this temple. Banteay Samre is like a miniature of the big Angkor-wat style temples, although there is a big wall that goes all the way around, which is made of laterite, and so has that lovely orange glow. The towers are smaller, and more compact and pushed together. The carvings are in good condition, so take some time to get a closer look.I went late afternoon, and was practically the only person there. There were more guards than visitors! The only shelter there is under the trees next to a small line of shops. You can cover this temple in less than an hour. No climbing is required as it is completely flat. Surprisingly, there\u2019s a lawn inside, between the wall and the temples.It\u2019s a bit of a way out, and so is recommended to stop here, on the way back from Banteay Srei, which is even further out."

Banteay Samre may be quite a distance from the center of all the temple-visiting action, but don't be deterred - it is worth it!A pathway lined with stone posts lead to the perimeter walls and the gopuras, finally to the central temple, which is reminiscent of Angkor Wat itself, only in a smaller scale. The level of preservation is astonishing - even the roof decorations are still present! The reliefs are in a similar state of preservation. With less tourists, this can offer a more peaceful alternative to some of the more famous temples. Definitely recommended!"

The temple is unusual in having an interior moat which you can walk around entirely. The centre area has some lovely stone carvings and I liked that there was hardly anyone here.

Because it is out of the way, you are also treated to some great scenery and you get a chance to see how the locals live. Lots of great pictures of rice paddies and small communities along the way. The 12 century Hindu Temple is dedicated to Vishnu and it appears to be a miniature Angkor Wat - similar style. The carvings and reliefs are in great shape as it must have been restored recently. Banteay Samre is one of the best temples to visit as you do not feel rushed by the crowds and you can explore the temple in a leisurely manner. Be sure to have water with you as it get really hot in the afternoon."

Our wonderful and knowledgeable guide, Dy, with ICS Travel, constantly provided us with an abundance of fascinating history about each temple. The Banteay Samre temple was incredible. In comparison to our visit at Angkor Wat earlier that morning, the Banteay Samre almost felt secluded. I read that the Banteay Samre doesn't always make it to people's top list of temples to visit and isn't on the route of most tour buses. The temple was beautifully preserved and was described to us as being a miniature Angkor Wat. While it had similarities to the Angkor Wat Temple, it was smaller and more compact, but there were vast similarities between the architectural design and engravings. The Banteay Samre Temple had only one tower, instead of 5 like the famed Angkor Wat, and the Banteay Samre Temple had two libraries, instead of 6 like the Angkor Wat. The Banteay Samre had galleries and its' sole tower was in the shape of a lotus bud.Always, remember, that even though its scorching hot, while visiting temples to wear proper temple attires, which requires ladies shoulders to be covered as well as their knees. I wore pants to be safe. I wore lightweight clothes since the temperatures are hot!! I definitely recommend a guide because you learn so much more about each temple and truly makes you appreciate everything about the temples that you might overlook completely."

            "review": "Really wonderful!. We really enjoyed our time visiting Banteay Samre. It is certainly a beautiful temple and there are some amazing carvings/reliefs to be seen. Bigger than a lot of the other temples, you can see that it was built along the same lines as Angkor Wat, and shares a lot of the design similarities.Before you enter the main temple be sure to walk across to the top of the stairs opposite, that are flanked by two huge Singhas, and look down the long paved causeway. This is the original road to enter the complex and was decorated along its complete length with carved Nagas. The day we visited a group of monks were enjoying the shade at the top of the stairs and happily posed for photos.Wandering around the temple you can just imagine how beautiful it would have been, and how wonderful the interior moat would have been filled with water lillies and birds. Take your time to enjoy the beautiful carvings and the skill of craftsmen that built the complex. It isn't hard to imagine how it would have been in its day.In the forest out the back of the temple there is a village and on the day we visited they were having a celebration, so we enjoyed the music playing and had fun with the hordes of children running about the place. We took our time to really explore this temple and enjoyed the wonderful stories our lovely guide had to share. As with each temple, the history is just incredible and having a very knowledgeable guide just added to the whole experience.A lovely place to visit indeed!Things to remember when visiting:-* Be sure to book a private guide so you can move at your own pace. Make sure you get one that really knows their stuff as hearing the stories and legends around each temple was far more interesting than just hearing the facts. (If you need a guide then feel free to PM me - I'm more than happy to give you a recommendation!)* Wear sunblock and a hat. It is HOT.* Go early to avoid the majority of the tourist buses.* Be sure to take the time to just sit quietly and drink it all in. Bus loads of tourist will come along but they're gone soon enough so be patient. * Please remember to dress respectfully. Yes, you're on holiday and yes, it's hot but this is a temple.Enjoy! :)"

Move a few yards behind the roadside restaurants and you will see the real Cambodian farmers going about their daily tasks."

Banteay Samre was constructed around the same time as Angkor Wat and has seen some recent restorations. The style of the towers and balustrades bear strong resemblance to the towers of Angkor Wat and even more so to Khmer temple of Phimai in Thailand. Many of the carvings are in excellent condition. Banteay Samre is a bit off the beaten path, southeast of the East Baray. The trip there is a nice little 2 miles or so road excursion through villages. Combine a visit to Banteay Srei with a stop at Banteay Samre on the way back. Be sure to do Srei first."

I heard from a friend who went four months prior that you used to be able to walk into the center, however, that area now is closed off. So inside the main area, you are only able to view from the outer circle. Maybe that was why the area was so packed."

This temple is a little way out from the most popular circuits travelled around Angkor, but it's an easy 60 minute bike ride from Siem Reap, taking you past some less crowded areas and temples, and through the village of Pradak, which is fascinating in itself.Banteay Samre is a relatively small, but quite intact temple built in a similar style to its great big brother, Angkor Wat. The buildings are in very good condition, and work in beautiful harmony together. The dried out moats in the middle of the courtyards are very pretty spaces. There's some wonderful carvings, and a lovely central sanctuary which again is like a mini Angkor Wat.One tip: the entrance to this temple is from the north. Make sure you turn left once you enter, and walk round to, and out of, the east gate, to see the remains of the very impressive causeway complete with lion statues leading to the east gate entrance."

It's far from the main Angkor area, about an hour to get there but it's worth going to see. The color of the temple is a bit pinkish which is quite different from the usual temples we have visited. The detailed carvings also offer an interesting twist.The area seems to be managed quite well, you can see some of the staff roving the area. A lot of locals too, who visit towards the end of the day. The lighting was great also towards the end of the day, but I did read that the pinkish colors stand out more during early mornings.Not crowded at all, and this allows us to have a relaxing walk to and around the temple. I think this is the best way to really appreciate the serenity of the place.We did this as part of a Beng Mealea, Kbal Spean and Bantay Srei loop, so our last stop was Bantay Srei. Great way to end the day and the overall temple visit, we went to the main Angkor temples the day before.Bantay Srei is part of the Angkor Wat ticket so make sure you have a valid one.As with any temple, there are kids selling postcards, souvenirs, etc. One particular kid was trying to sell me a pack of 12 postcards for USD1. Expecting that they will be pushy, I told him that I already have one and no I'm not interested in getting another. But this kid was smart, he stayed on to show me where the entrance is, walk beside me until the entrance and answered my questions and told me that he will wait for me outside and maybe I'll buy his postcards later, without sounding like pushy or whiny. And indeed, I saw him running back to me with a big wide smile on his face when we came out. And because he wasn't pushy, I decided to buy a pack of postcards from him :-)"

Banteay Samre is the one made from grey sandstone near the south east corner of the Eatsern Baray. Banteay Srei is the one made from red sandstone, located about 20km north east of Angkor Thom.Anyway Banteay Samre is a well preserved (restored) compact temple with a single tower (very much like the main Angkor Wat tower), surrounded by the usual galleries and walls. It is very compact with small spaces between the structures which gives the illusion of the building and walls being much higher - a bit like midtown Manhattan.There are fewer (group) tourists here so one can spend a quiet time wondering around and understanding the basic concepts behind Angkorian architecture, making a visit here before the major sites such as Angkore Wat or Preah Khan a worthy investment."

This temple has something very special, I think it is the stone paths with balustrades headed by large lion statues looking down long avenues of trees so that all those approaching would have seen this awesome temple in its full glory colour and all. The temple is also in my opinion the best preserved with fabulous stone carvings, arches even the smallest carvings are retained. There is also a well laid out 4 bathing pools which with all the colour and dramatic carvings must have made this place very special. Like all the other temples, the amount of work needed to build such structures is mind boggling without mechanical help and there must have been an army of stone masons, all Cambodians???. The surrounding landscape must have been a hive of activity to support the temple, I wish that CGI could recreate the wonders that this temple must have given all visitors. Suggest that you buy your. 3 day pass the day before you visit, they are valid for 7 days and you can use the for any 3 days, will save you a 2 hrs wait at the ticket office, hot and crowded."

One of many temples in the National Park, this one stands out and is worth the extra long trip to get to because the condition of the carvings on the temple. Its also the only one I know of done in red sandstone. The details are so intricate, with dancers, warriors, and nagas coating just about every inch of the walls. Really impressive. There are lotus ponds on the outside of the temples walls, making for some nice pictures. This is a small temple, so you don't need huge amount of time here, but with all the details its nice to enjoy at your leisure.They also have a great little museum/gallery exhibit, detailing the history, archeology, and tales of archeology theirs trying to steal parts of the temple to sell to museums."

We'd just done the nearby beautiful pink Banteay Srei which was close to deserted, and this was our last stop. Once again we almost had it to ourselves. This is a medium sized temple that's a bit off the normal circuit, but certainly worth a visit. It's in remarkably good shape and far more \"intact\" than most temples. Inside it's quiet and serene. A lone monk sat praying or meditating in the center. Other than that just a handful of people amongst one of the nicest temples of its size in Siem Reap. Outside herdsmen were taking their cattle to pasture. It's a great place to sit and ponder on the lost people who erected so many magnificent temples in the area so long ago. There isn't the wealth of highly detailed carvings you get at nearby Bantea Srei (and as an aside many of the reviewer's photos included with this temple are actually Banteay Srei) and the walls aren't the same deep pink color. In fact, similar names, but like chalk and cheese. Both are definitely worth a visit though."

Banteay Samre is a very beautiful 12th century Hindu Temple that was constructed around the same time as Angkor Wat with similar style architecture.Banteay Samre is also known as the Child of Angkor Wat and it is a bit off the normal tourist track but is definitely worth the effort to visit here as there are many carvings that are in excellent condition, well preserved buildings and very quiet, not many tourists at all. I actually liked it a lot more than Banteay Srey. Combine a visit here with a stop at Banteay Srey; the trip is lovely passing through villages and rice paddies."

You could see the type of stones used and the style of construction that could be found in perhaps parts of the various other structures in the overall Angkor temple complex. What was interesting was the window areas that had what looked to be circular, intricately-carved, stone columns or poles, placed within the open part, that supported them. There could be four or more of them within each opening, seeming to provide support for the parts of the temple above the openings. The carving designs, all in circular patterns, may show that they were first cut and then rotated in some fashion to allow the carvers to produce what I though were really interesting circular patterns. Parts were thicker, other parts thinner, in what gave a sense of how advanced these artisans were with the tools they had to design and execute such items.An aside - walking to a nearby restroom after visiting Bante Samre, I came upon a huge spider web with a huge spider on it. Black, white, red, and yellow, with some stripes - I'd never seem anything like it. It was just off the trail, so easy to see and get to."

It was not violent in any way, but the rural setting of this area and fewer travelers may have made this more likely.I don't recommend visiting the shops here -- it was even worse than normal and I didn't see anything different than I'd seen in town."

We got there early enough that the place was not crowded and as I approached the ruins I felt like I was Indian Jones discovering some new ruined temple in my quest for some lost artifact. Unlike the places closer to Siem Reap this place has not been restored and only in a few places will you find wooden walk ways or support structures where it is too dangerous to do with out. This means lots of ducking in under low fallen stones or climbing up piles of ruble as you explore and nothing is off limits (though some places were hard to get to). We picked up a guide at the entrance, a Khmar woman around mid to lat 30s with a wooden leg which may have been the result of a land mine. She led us through showing us various things and pointing out interesting parts of the ruins and I think we paid her about 10 or 20 USD at the end, well worth it.Unfortunatly our time was limited as we had a flight to catch so I would recommend dedicating a day to this and maybe some of the surrounding areas.I will try to post some pictures later.erik"

The temple isn't built by a King unlike others. but built by a community dedicated to a king. As such the temple is small and isn't as grand as Angkor Wat despite being built by the same people that built Angkor Wat. The base isn't made of sand stone like Angkor Wat, probably they ran out of stones or that sand stones from Kulem is expensive to get. It's less ornate compared to the pink Banteay Srei but it's complex is bigger and has it's own solitude to bolster it's charm. Come here together with the Banteay Srei tour, as it's on the same route."

This temple also sees less visitors so it is possible to view it almost entirely by ones self. I had only to wait 10 minutes for 2 others to leave and then had the temple to myself for about 20 minutes. The carvings remind me of the detail you find at Banteay Srei. I almost hate to write a review as this will send more visitors to this lovely temple."

If you're going on any part of the grand tour, you might as well see Banteay Samre. It is a pleasant temple, free of the myriad of tourists who flock to the main Angkor attractions located toward the center of the complex. I particularly enjoyed strolling around unmolested by peddlers and monks selling either goods or blessings. In fact, I've had a lovely conversation with a monk there and decided to get a blessing after all. The whole experience was lovely."

We allocated one day to the temples that were a little further out (this one is only a short drive from the others) and our tuk tuk driver suggested including it and I am so glad he did. This temple has been completely restored and has a sanctuary tower in the centre. There were hardly any tourists at all there, very nice and peaceful after the masses at Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm etc. They have done such a good job with the restoration and this one was not on my list so we nearly missed it. There are two libraries and a high wall around the outside, several interesting carvings on the doorways of the inner enclosure. Great photography opportunities due to having it almost to ourselves. Include this one as its completeness make it really worth a visit."

If you plan to visit this temple, pair it up with a visit to Banteay Srey and possibly the Angkor Butterfly Centre, Cambodia Landmine Museum and the shooting range.It is not as small as Ta Som but I wouldn\u2019t call it medium either. I guess the word \u201ccompact\u201d is more appropriate. The size is about right for exploration but it should not take you more than one hour to do so. There is a short path on the left side of the temple that you can also explore."

Definitely great to visit, as you can feel like you own this huge temple with green surroundings all to yourself. Banteay Samre is very well preserved, there was some ongoing restoration work; as with all other temples in Siem Reap.Your tuk-tuk driver will most probably drop you off at the N entrance. Following suggestion from the guidebook Ancient Angkor, I walked all the way towards the N gate, but turn left and walk along the wall until I reached E gate. Then, I backtracked to see the terrance and walkway, which has some nice sculptures of ruined lions.The temple buildings in the enclosure are quite small, compact and they stood on a platform risen from the ground floor. This makes the temple quite special. Really worth your time."

On both times, pictures of this temple soemhow turned out to be among the best. It is a slight walk in from the main road and is walled, with the main temple inside in quite a good state.The inner moat (with no water of course) within the temple's compound is the only one I have noticed of the Angkor temples and walking around and accross it from one wing to another was good fun. As with each different temple in the Angkor area, this too gives you a different feel. Worth a visit"
