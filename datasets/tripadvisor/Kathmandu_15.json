Every years, tens of thousands of devotees from India pay visit mainly during the time of Shivaratri. Entrance to the main temple isn't allowed to non-Hindus given the historical reasons, however, I always see foreign tourists watching and photographing from another side of the river, mainly witnessing the cremation which is performed by the side of the river."

Its one of the most sacred,visited and known hindu temple of Lord Shiva in the world.Its only allowed to Hindus to enter the temple but all other religion followers are allowed to visit upto the gate and also watch some religious ceremony from the other side of the temple.As bagmati (sacred river)flows besides the temple, evening rituals (Aarti) are performed along the river and has a beautiful and serene atmosphere.You need to reach a bit early to find a good spot to view the aarti and the temple premise is big enough to take good time if you want to explore full.It has lots of other temples nearby like Guheshwari (15 mins walk) etc. Lots of devotees visit the temple and it has enormous crowd during special events,day, month for eg. during Shivratri and Shrawan and also on Mondays. Hence, pls plan accordingly.Temple remain closed during noon time."

Way overpriced, but if you want to see cremations and don't know how to enter from the back side across the river, you don't have a choice. But to be honest, it's worth $10 to witness how they send off their dead, as well as walk around some of the temple grounds. Near the river is where you want to be. The rest is not very interesting. The main temple is for Hindus only. There are lots of Sadus here, all wanting a tip for photos and such. They add a colorful back drop to the grey temples. Monkeys are plenty. It's a good place to spend an hour or two. It's a cleaner, more organized version of India's Varanasi. The cremations take place 24 hours a day."

Apart from the sense of peace and tranquillity that this temple has to offer, the lack of commercialization makes this a very pleasant place of worship. No one hounding you for money, no one pushing you around asking you to hurry with your worship and a general sensibility amongst most devotees lets you be with yourself, in the presence of the lord, even in a large crowd. Monkeys, Rams, Calves, Dogs, Pigeons roam about freely in the concourse thus making it such a beautiful sight to see. It screams of peace and oneness with the divine. One of the most peaceful experiences that I have had in a long time. It could be a little cleaner though. Having said that, I travelled during the monsoon and soon after a sort of a downpour - so expecting the place to be dry was a little bit of a stretch. A must place to visit."

Nepal can be an adrenaline adventure, a cultural eye opener, or a life-changing experience, depending on the itinerary and mindset of the traveler"

The temple would be really an attraction if it was kept clean as i ket seeing people either spitting or there was cow dung. We could see loads of monkeys strolling the temple premises. So if you are on a short visit and have an evening to send you could do pashupati temple , its worth a visit."

First and foremost: if you are a \"westerner\": someone or anyone who has not grown up in a traditional \"Hindu\" or Buddhist worldview but now claim to be a \"Hindu\" or a follower of Hinduism; DO NOT claim that until you have personally come and observed the daily rituals of traditional Hindus. Don't just make something up and call it Hinduism. Come and see real Hindu worship, death rituals, ceremonies and true Hindu faith in action before you simply \"claim\" to be a Hindu (I'm looking at you, Hollywood Hipsters).I saw death rituals and families seeking to find peace for their loved ones who have passed on. I saw Sadhus trying to impress me with face paint and strange antics using their \"private parts\" (I can't go into more detail here). I saw women seeking \"identity\" by asking these Sadhus to help them have children. I saw people worshipping idols, gods and statues. A mass of humanity seeking peace.

It is a UNESCO World Heritage site, which means you will get charged 1,000 rupees ($9.50 USD) to visit. Only Hindus are allowed to enter the actual main temple but you can walk around and enjoy the sights and take pictures. You can get a really good panoramic view of Kathmandu here as well. Myself and three others from my home stay visited here and were immediately approached by a youngish Nepal tour guide. We saw temples devoted to Shiva, Hanuman the Monkey God and several cremations happening along the river. The Hindus have a much more pragmatic view of death; it's just another part of life. There are specific rituals start differently depending on the age, gender and caste of the person who died but everyone ends up as ash in the river. Our guide said it can take two or three hours for a body to burn completely. We met a group of Sadus hanging out around the temple who speak English and will ask for money in exchange for blessings or photos. I'm not sure if they were legit or not but our guide assured us that they use the money to buy food for themselves and the poorer communities in the area so I obliged. On the other hand, I was really annoyed by the vendors that kept approaching me and trying to sell me crap that I didn't want or need. Our guide also took us to a nearby elderly complex where Mother Teresa used to work. The old ladies and gents were lined up for their lunch and had colorful laundry drying all around courtyard. In the center of the courtyard was a temple with a bell that one old woman rang incessantly for several minutes. At the conclusion of our tour, we tipped our guide and headed in the direction of our next destination. A black temple dog with white paws that we called Puppy escorted us as far as he could but had to leave us and turn back when we got to main road because that turf apparently belonged to other dogs."

UNESCO should definitely do something about it.Third, is totally absurd they showing their funeral traditions to the tourist. On one side there are families which cry and on the other side there are tourists who take photos. Absolutely crazy.Fourth, you can't even see the main Golden temple, it's only reserved for Hindu people (even though you paid 1000 rupees).Fifth, be careful with people who represent as tourist guides, they would just start walking by you explaining the place (event though you didn't ask them anything) and in the end they want money from you. And the last, be aware and careful when taking pictures whit 'holy people' there - they what money after taking pictures (they wanted 1000 rupees from each of us)."

Depending upon when you visit, you can experience so much, not just the \"Place\", it's architecture and it's Heritage, but as a truly visceral experience into the culture of this remarkable city, it's inhabitants, their religions and customs. Come on the right days during festivals, and the colours will amaze you with all the beautiful women dressed in their finest colours. Pilgrims come to pray at the Temple. Families performing the last rights and Cremation ceremonies . It all happens here, at Pashupati Nath. A visit to Pashupatinath on Monday. Every Monday in the Nepali month of July ( by the Nepali Calandar) is celebrated especially by the Hindu women, who dress in their brightest clothing, mostly red, adorned with plastic bangles on their arms, getting Henna applied. Here to go to Temple and pray for long lives for their husbands. Pashupatinath is also home to the cities main Cremation site. Tho's families with enough money witll cremate their loved ones on a traditional wood fire. there is an electric Crematorium close by for those that cannot afford the more traditional ceremony. Loved ones feet are lowered and dipped into the holy Bagmatti River one last time, sprinkled with the holy water, adorned with fresh flowers and then placed upon the traditionally arranged stacks of wood. If you are a tourist here, please respect the families and what they are going through, you are a guest in their private moment. Stay across the river , take photos with discretion, and respect. While it may seem like a tourist attraction, it is real life. This is also a very large Temple area, there is an adjacent Deer park, and you can walk completely around this place in about 1 hours time. many many steps if you want to circumnavigate the entire place. There are also many \"Holy\"?? men, in various places, they seem to situate themselves in conspicuous places closest to where the tourists are. They are 99 % Naked, covered in grey ash. Yes, you can take pictures if you pay! Why else are they there??? Still interesting, and free to look. There are a dozen ways into the Temple grounds, go with a guide, and they will take you through the main gate so they get a cut of your admission fee (very pricy for Nepal, I think 1000 Rupees depending upon what day and how greedy they are at that moment. Don't pay it, go around, find your own way in, they are just pocketing the money. This is free to everyone, else except tourists, so ignore them if you can, keep walking, say you are on pilgrimage, whatever... and of course, you can always pay. But... that still won't get you entry into the Temple itself. Want access, ??? you must be Hindu, at least for the day, yes it can be done, just go it alone, not as a large group if you really want full access to this incredible place. Also, if you come, get change from one of the change people just outside, they will give you a handful of 5 and 10 rupee bills to leave at all the many important sites, where if you want to wax Hindu you must leave an offering."

Till the gate of main temple complex photography allowed after that not.. Lot of people are queued to have darshan and offer Puja.Beside main temple there are temples of small deities.People are offering oil lamps. In the East of the temple river Bagmati flows . From the temple plain itis 100 to 150 feet down. On the constant cremation fire is on..In the evening there are aratis onin the Temple and in te far bank of Bagmati . In the tranquil atmosphere music and religious dance is really wonderful and fills one`s heart."

It's almost nothing like ever seen. From main entrance, you can only see a huge bronze Nandi's back. Since camera not allowed, this is the only view you can click of the inner part. There are many small cupolas around with idols in the courtyard. There are lot many steps where you can peacefully sit and even meditate.The main temple itself is amazing. Probably completely made of wood and stone, with beautiful stone and wood carved figurines of Devatas. The two story building with these features is mesmerizing. The view of the main Shivalinga is through a very small door. Take enough time to look at it if there's not much crowd. The inside is only lit by Diyas.Behind and around the main temple are other structures with idols. Just behind the temple and downwards flows Bhagmati river and there is also an area for cremation of bodies. On the opposite side of the river, again there is a line of beautiful small cupolas in front of which Aarti of Bhagmati river is held. Somewhat similar to Ganga Aarti in Kashi. From here only you can click the proper pics of main temple building.Overall it's a very soulful and peaceful experience especially being among the old and beautiful structures.You may take a guide too but I was not having much time so left the option. Lots of monkeys around! Careful while carrying the Prasad packets."

It cost us 1000 rupees each for entrance. You can't enter the actual temple unless you are Hindu, but the cremations are going on 24/7 and being able to watch this process from across the river was pretty incredible. The ritual has so many steps. It was all performed in a way that made me feel like i was watching a celebration of life, rather than watching mourning of a death. It was beautiful and completely different than anything I had ever experienced before. Be careful of the hippie priests hanging around, they lure you in for photos and then ask for steep donations in return! Otherwise, visiting this temple was a highlight of our trip to Nepal."

Pashupatinath temple is the most important temple dedicated to lord Shiva in Nepal and one of its most scared Hindu temples. Located on the banks of the holly Bagmati river (which much further down flows into the Ganges) and at about five km from Kathmandu, Pashupathinath is the place where Hindus from both Nepal and India come to die and be cremated, in the belief that dying in Pashupathinath guarantees their rebirth not as a worm, a pig or a dog, but as human, irrespective of the misdeeds in their lives... You can, of course, observe the bodies being brought to the cremation ghats, the oldest son pouring some incents and holly water from the river before lighting the funeral pyre, then ashes being discarded into the holly Baghmati and further down the river kids playing into the water and women doing their laundry. Here, death is not the end but just another step towards Nirvana.... The temple itself (available only to Hindus) is a masterpiece of Hindu architecture and, if you are interested in religions, in other ways of thinking of life and death, then you may not like to miss a visit Pashupatinath.. ."

Seeing the burning ghats and basically \"attending\" a Hindi funeral was quite powerful and felt almost intrusive; however, coming to the temple and watching the \"funerals\" is what many people (including locals) do. Oddly enough. I never hired a guide, but wish I would have. Apparently one of the Mother Theresa homes is nearby and part of the guided \"tour.\" I have found temple guides to be very hot or miss. When they don't know information, sometimes they make it up. It is best to check with your hotel and see if they recommend anyone. Also, taxis in Nepal are crooks.

As lord Shiva has promised all that who ever come and pray here will never be reborn as an animal."

Pashupati Temple is beautiful, with lovely grounds especially at sunset, but only Hindus are allowed in the temple itself, so many westerners and tourists will not be allowed in the temple proper. There are some scammers around as well - \"shamans\" who dress in full traditional attire and demand money, then try to \"curse\" you if you don't give them a donation. These men are not genuine, and you should not feel pressured to donate to them, even when they hold swords to your throat. Just be firm and walk away."

They will allow you to walk almost to the door and take a picture, and then they tell you about a \"back door\" where you can see everything. Not so! You can go around the back and see some cremations, but you still cannot actually see anything inside the temple. Considering the price (about $10) this made me more than a little frustrated. Furthermore, despite saying so on the sign, locals do not have to pay. So, the only people paying for the temple are the ones who can't even go in!Also, guides will chase you and try to tell you about the place even after you say no, monkeys are aggressive (I accidentally looked at one as I walked near it and it ran toward me to attack, but stopped when I turned my back to it), and lots of people will try to get money from you in some way or another.I give it two stars because you can walk around outside and there are some interesting things to see, but I would never go back and sort of felt that I had wasted my time."

When I asked why the others do not need to pay even though it says so on the board, he merely said because I am obviously a tourist. So tip to avoid entrance fee would be to dress local and look local maybe. I point this out because I see many people walk in without paying. Anyway, the temple itself is very interesting - many stories, histories to learn and things to see. There are two places where they burn the dead bodies and usually they burn about 2.5 hours to 3 hours depending on their sex. There are fertility temples and an old sacrificial temple too which is no longer in use. A man who works there approached me as I was sightseeing the place and started giving me information about the places, I really appreciate the info he gave me and while I did not ask for his help, I decided to tip him anyway when I left. Instead of being grateful however, he lamented the tip was too little. The tip was definitely not little for such a short time of \"service\" but his response gave me a sour feeling throughout the rest of my day. Hope others wont have similar experience!"

Cremation grounds are (a bit sadly) an attraction for visitors, photos can be taken at will (contrary to what happens in Varanasi where photos are a more sensitive issues). The sadhus waiting for visitors, available to pictures against a small handout, do not add very much to the sanctity of the place. The stream (as you can\u2019t call it a river) flowing within the temple grounds is not a beautiful sight either.

However, it must be remembered that this is a working temple for Hindu's and they are less concerned about what tourists think and more concerned about the way that they grieve their lost ones. Culturally it is as authentic as it comes and therfore for me it was perhaps one of the highlights of Nepal, along with Treking. Make sure yu get a guide, as it will make all the difference.

The area is fascinating, with rich architecture and ceremony on display. Watching the dead be prepared for cremation is a somber experience but also a spiritual one.

It use to be free to attend, but costs were introduced when it was adopted as a World Heritage site and over the years the cost have risen to Rs1000, which in my view is a little too much for those on a budget. Some travellers may think it is a bit morbid to watch cremations, but within the context of Nepal, local people are interested that we are interested in their practices. On the day we went, we saw an unprecedented number of deceased persons brought in; at least 9. This time we observed a very elaborate cremation with the ghat decorated with a canopy and garlands of marigolds. Alongside the cremations you will see all the people working to prepare the ghats and clear up after each event. As a cremation is taking place, you will see the mourners, the role of different family members, and at the same time there are the youth's with large magnets on string dredging the river for coins, dogs napping in the sun and monkey's chasing each other. Other bereaved people have returned to undertake required rituals. You may see a snake resting on a sandbag and worry when it drops into the trickle of pre-monsoon river.Away from the river the Sadhu's ply their 'trade', but be aware they require payment if you photograph them!There seemed to be little evidence of quake damage and I was told that the original design of the buildings meant that they are quake resistant. Some parts of the site are only open to Hindus, but this does not deter some tourists from over intrusive closeup photography!I understand that an electric crematorium is due to be installed in the future, so life at Pashupatinath will change, but this may reduce the number of trees cut down.Given the amount of entrance money collected over the years, there has been some improvement to the site and development, but facilities for tourists are still limited and signage and information could be improved. This is a site that is worth a visit."

This year the area was dirtier than previous years. It really does need to be cleaned. Not much water although I appreciate the monsoon is awaited - but the areas in front of the ghats do need some attention. One of the little bridges looked very precarious with a huge crack.Some tourist were very disrespectful by crossing to the temple side and interfering in funeral rites by taking intrusive photos - please don't do this.

Pashipatinath used to be a fun place to visit. It, and Muktinath, are two of the 51 Shakti Pithas revered by Hindus, that are found in the hills of Nepal. Located on the bank of the Bhagmati River, and now a World Heritage site, it is a 20 minute taxi ride from the center of Kathmandu, and just west of the airport. In 1967, there were open fields and rice paddys around the temple, but now there is solid suburban sprawl. And, as before, only \"Hindus\" are allowed into the temple. Us heathen non-Hindus can only peer into the entrance around the giant Nandi, or look down from across the river, which in itself is entertaining, but not satisfying. I say shame on Nepal because this sacred river is now a sewer filled with trash and plastic bottles. Why they would allow this to happen to a World Heritage site is beyond me. The universal attitude there, and many other areas in Nepal, is \"It's not my job.\" Nepal has received millions of dollars in foreign aid, but the government and the overseers of the temple can't even organize a trash pickup. For a country that earns most of it's foreign exchange from tourism and mountaineering, revers a sacred river in its capital, and has hoards of destitute citizens looking for work, why they can't accomplish such a simple, low-tech task like picking up trash, is beyond me. Instead of Pashupatti, I suggest going to the nearby Baudanath Stupa. It too suffered damage from the earthquake, but repairs are well underway. Visitors can circumambulate the stupa and unlike Pashuaptti, are welcome to enter the numerous Tibetan Gompas surrounding the stupa. There are several places to get lunch or tea, and a nice selection of shops. Best of all, there are no cars or motorcycles allowed in the walkway around the stupa. Highly recommended."

You are only allowed to visit the temple if you are a hindu but there is still much to see for non hindus including the main ghat area where bodies are cremated. Whilst there were many tourists sitting watching intently, this aspect of the temple area wasnt for me, but this ancient Shiva temple is a must for anyone visiting KTM."

Entry is 1000 rupees, so one of the more expensive temples to visit. You WILL be inundated with 'guides' who will accompany you around the temple and explain the significance of the temple/carvings/paintings/architecture. You may try to escape them but they will loiter after you until you pointedly tell them 'no'. That being said, they are rather handy with providing you with a route around the grounds and for taking tourist pics for you. The cremation pyres lining the river Bagmati, which is rather dirty, are in regular use. The day we went to visit there were three cremations. There is something rather... unsettling about being a tourist and witnessing a widow's grief at cremating her husband, all the while watching other tourists snapping furious pictures with over-sized Canon cameras. Brightly coloured and well-humoured Sadhus can be found and they're happy to take a picture with tourists, for a price. Around 100 rupees to take pictures with them. Don't be cheap and take pictures from a distance, fork over your 100 rupees. The monkeys that lurk around the temple are harmless and certainly less frightening than the hawkers that lurk at the entrance to the temple (and they WILL follow you to the car park!!) All in all, it's a holy site threshed with tourist features. Go see it."

Burning the dead, according to the numerous rules and rituals, is very captivating and striking to see. Defintely dicates a lot of respect and appreciation. The only thing that disappointed me were the saddhus over there. Anyone that has at least a simple idea about saddhus knows that they are rather solitary, very serious practitioners actually, not approaching other people lightly. The saddhus we saw at Pashupatinath are attractions. They approached right away with offers to take a photo with them or asking for money directly. Saddhus are normally considered very holy men, so for me, it was a bit disappointing to see these \"saddhus\" creating a very misinformed image. Hopefully in some of the many caves around Pashupatinath, there are some practicing ones too."

Pashupatinath is a very holy temple by a polluted river (as usual in this part of the world sadly) where devout Hindu's cremate their loved ones. Considering non-Hindus cannot enter the temple itself, the Rs.1,000 fee to enter the grounds is quite steep (unless you are a Hindu visitor I guess) but I actually understand that to some extent this is a place for deeply sombre occasions so perhaps it is a deliberately high fee to restrict numbers getting too huge. Nevertheless what you get for your ticket is access to the side of the river and to some sections where worshippers burn bundles of paper. By the river you may witness a funeral and it feels a bit voyeuristic. There's nothing to stop you taking photographs of a woman wailing at her late husband's funeral (albeit from a reasonable distance) but do you really want to be that person? That said, there was a boy selling candyfloss to some of the non-funeral visitors so make up your own opinion.Surrounding this temple are people with probably some of the most photogenic outfits in Nepal. Many of which may be dressed so in order to solicit tourists to pay to photograph them. I don't know if this is just something extra on the side for them or if they dress purely for this purpose. By the look of their waistline I suspect it is the latter.And that's pretty much it. It's not a big site. And surrounding the temple grounds are the usual tourist predators. Someone will slap a dot on your forehead and then expect you to give them money. I avoided my encounter with a Matrix-like duck backwards. To be honest I didn't really enjoy my visit. It is one of those things you HAVE to do when you visit Kathmandu. Tight lipped travellers with baggy clothed trousers will point to their guidebooks and insist that you're wasting your valuable time in Kathmandu if you don't visit and \"you've flown half way across the world\". Personally I'd rather visit a bar and find some locals to chat with. Then the tight lipped ones will return stressed and sweaty. The red dot on their forehead will show you they've been liberated of a couple of extra dollars and mark them out as targets for vendors for the rest of the day. Kathmandu is actually pretty laid back and tourists don't generally get hounded. This place is a bit of an exception. Visit. If you must."

I was one of 1.2 million people to visit Pashupatinath on the day of Maha Shivaratri, that it wwas a full-on experience is an understatement. Walking from central Kathmandu along Pashupatinath road was an unusual experience in itself because there were very few vehicles around and as I got closer, none at all because the road was closed. The silence during rush hour was a little unsettling in itself as was the stream of people heading solemnly in the same direction rather than the usual early morning energy from commuters and people opening their businesses. As I crossed the rise at the ring road the atmosphere and noise changed; in front of me were tens of thousands of people, many queuing patiently in the already long lines to get into the main temple (Hindus only), others milling around seeing what the street sellers had to offer (food, clothes, watches, household goods and no doubt more) and buying candy floss and balloons sold ny young boys (exclusively, I don't know why) who skilfully sought out those interested in making a purchase. There were just too many people by the main entrance so I headed to the first bridge and crossed the river to enter the site (not that I was evading the 1000 rupee entrance fee, I was told there was no charge on this day). lots of other people, the majority Nepalis, were doing this too. We had to pass by an open sewer depositing raw sewage into the holy Bagmati. A few minutes later I reached the first of the many small shrines to Shiva where his adherents, the Saddhus had set up camp and were offering blessings to pilgrims and selling cannabis. Some 7000 Saddhus were reported to be present most of whom smoked weed which is a gift from Lord Shiva and a key aspect of worship.. There was a heady smell wherever I went. The authorities had warned non-Saddhus not to buy or smoke the stuff and although there many police, armed policed force and army personnel around (another big number - 12000 in total reportedly) there were plenty of people, mainly young men who were openly partaking with no action by the authorities it seemed to me. I watched proceedings from the the other side of the river to the cremation ghats (I didnlt see any) for a while to escape the hustle and bustle for a while. Watching proceedings merely entailed several queues moving very slowly into the main temple but only the top tier of the pagoda is visible anyway. The queues were marshalled quite strictly with people who tried to jump in given short shrift and by that I mean handled roughly. (On the way out I saw one guy attempt to enter by an exit only to be floored by a rifle butt to the chest.)I moved on to the temples at the top of the hill hoping to get away from the dense crowds but this was a forlorn hope; it was as busy as near the river. Saddhus lined the steps offering blessings for a price. I bought a snack at the top only to regret it when I was surrounded by dozens of monkeys. I gave vegetable pakoda up causing quite a squabble. The residents of the deer park were also very skittish if not spooked by the occasion - they are usually calm.On the way out via the main entrance there were lots of social service organisations offering medical care, food and water to the pilgrims and the invitations were so warm and determined they were difficult to turn down. Entertainment of all kinds was available outside the sacred site including fairground rides, music and dancing. I left after three hours or so and the intensity of the crowds and noise had increased since the early morning and it was something of a relief to leave Pashupatinath and its devotees behind and find a cafe for a cup of restorative tea.Pashupatinath is a wonderful lace to visit at any time because it embodies and reflects the Nepali Hindu culture. It's turned up to 11 for Maha Shivaratri. It takes place towards the end of February to early March, in 2017 it's on 24th February. If you are in Kathmandu, don't miss it."

Initially, I was having a good time, walking around and enjoying the atmosphere of worship, but I had an issue with the number of people pestering you to let them give you a tour. We had a guy latch himself onto us, and refuse to leave, telling us random things about the history of the place and the nature of the worship, although we politely rebuffed him numerous times. It kind of took the pleasure out of the experience for me, but by no means should it deter anyone from visiting. It's a very interesting experience, just be aware that you might have to be very firm with some prospective 'tour guides'."

It was quite an experience I must admit and I would urge anyone in Kathmandu at the time of the festival to visit. Its 1000rps to get in and be sure to keep plenty of small bills on you if you'd like to photograph the holy men. Try not to be ripped off too much, because I was obviously a tourist the prices were jacked up tenfold so don't be afraid to give less than they ask, just not too much less! Also, I went with a Nepali man from my hotel, something I hadn't planned in advance but if you're alone (and definitely a lone female) I'd recommend taking a guide. One last thing was that whilst at the Temple there were many cremations taking place, with the families carrying the bodies through the crowd. Although I know this is a sight for some and I was told I could photograph them by a local, I felt it was disrespectful to raise my camera. Just think about how you'd feel if if was your relative's cremation and that'll give you an idea of whether or not to photograph!"

With respect, I didn't take any photos which allowed me to be much more present than usual through observation. I was also there right before Shivaratri holiday so there were more Sudhas hanging around than usual. You can ask them if it's ok for you to take a photo of them - they will say of course but then DEFINITELY ask you for money. I was prepared with 200 rupees in my pocket, though they asked for 1000 rupees (total rip off either way). I handed the 200 quickly and took off before they could get mad at me. Later I was talking to a local who said even 200 rupees is something they shouldn't get just for photos. If you get a chance to connect with the Sudhas, great, if you want to give them money, go ahead...but that was just my experience!The markets around Pashupatinath are also great as well as the multiple meditation caves within the area. You are welcome to meditate in them if you'd like, which was peaceful and wonderful as well."

Everything was new and exotic, I had hundreds of question and took hundreds of pictures. He was very patient, allowed me to take my time and absorb everything. I was allowed to tour at my pace and he was very knowledgeable. The Pashupati Temple is one of the most Sacred sites in the Hindu world. There here hundreds of Indians on pilgrimage. There were monkeys roaming the area and there were ongoing cremation ceremonies. The cremation services were very strange and foreign to me as a westerner. Witnessing these ceremonies and listening to his explanations, help me gain a real appreciation for their beliefs and see it not as a morbid display, but as a loving sendoff for your family member to the next life. I made this trip totally focused on my Everest experience, the Kathmandu Valley and World Heritage sites were not on my radar, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and I would recommend that you take the time to visit.

The sounds of the crying wails ripped into my heart and my own tears came pouring out in great abundance. This was the 1st time I smelled burning human flesh and saw my 1st cremations. If you enter with the Hindi pilgrims, you may see multiple vehicles bringing in the dead. The crowds moved me along and then I felt something hit me on my side. It was a dangling arm from a skinny naked dead woman with a purple cloth on top of her. I wondered who she was and where her clothing went. Did they recycle it? Did someone steal it? I was glad that someone threw the purple cloth on top of her to provide her some dignity in death. There were no mourners following her. She was alone except for the the cremators and the workers preparing her body to be burned. I watched her being prepared and stayed with her for part of the burning. They say an average body takes 3-4 hours to burn. If it takes longer time than it has a negative attachment I was told. I walked alongside the river and came upon the sadhu's little hut. I smelled pot wafting thru the air - a pot smoking sadhu taught in the hut I was told.

            "review": "A great privilege to contemplate your life and what it means to you. You don't have to be Buddhist or Hindu to appreciate the sanctity and holiness of this sprawling temple complex. Worshippers of both religions perform prayers (puja) and rituals in this place, representing and practising religious harmony. Many ceremonies and devotions are conducted here in this holiest of places in Nepal and people make pilgrimages here from all around the world. Many make their way to die at this place and it may be confronting to some to see these folk, generally alone, lying motionless on nearby pathways.The temple complex, a World Heritage Site, is rich in historical and architectural values and is also a vital social and cultural centre. Non Buddhists and HIndus do not have access to all areas however all are able to respectfully witness the elaborate Hindu cremation rituals which take place daily beside the Bagmati river. Two bridges cross over it and sometimes hundreds of people (both tourists and Nepalis) gather to observe the proceedings and to understand more about tradition, culture, respect and, of course, to contemplate their own life, spirit and time of passing.The complex is about 5 km from KTM cbd, admission in NPR1,000 and an ATM is located near the ticket booth. Unintrusive photography is allowed. At the entrance there are many people offering to guide you and offer interpretations of proceedings, customs and the environment. There is a taxi rank nearby, and trinket markets (if you must).Inside you will find holy men, mystics, sadhus and other practitioners of various esoteric knowledge, with whom you can consult, pray with or simply photograph for a small fee. Monkeys abound but will generally not bother you unless you engage with them. Don't touch them or look them in the eye and keep food hidden.I'm no expert but the reverent cremation process involves bathing the deceased, covering the person with special cloths, grains, garlands and other offerings. Incense is burned, prayers uttered, and grief is openly on display - the latter not so common in Western funeral practices. Men and women each have a different role to perform, and the deceased is finally lovingly placed on a pre-prepared pyre, which is attended to by a skilled man who ensures the pyre burns effectively. The family and loved ones remain until the ashes are placed in the river. You may wish to remain an uninvolved observer but you will most likely be \"involved\" by breathing some of the smoke arising from the pyre. Also the river itself is very sluggish here and efforts are being made to clean it up.Take time to wander along the stupas on the upper side of the complex and also on the less crowded side of the bridges if you are looking for more than just a view of a cremation. Talk with the locals there to learn more about the rich traditions and rituals and to understand more about your own beliefs about death and dying. By the way, remember that we Westerners cremate our deceased as well - we just don't tend to see death as an important vital part of life, as these people do - and so we try to sanitise the process and delegate funeral duties to others, perhaps to help us disconnect from it.These are only my uninformed observations so please forgive me if I have not well interpreted the fundamental processes - there are certainly many intricacies.If you have time, you can easily walk to Boudhanath from here."

This temple is a very holy place for a lot of Indian people, I was told it is one of those places that Indians travel to outside of India, as it is very significant.Just be aware, that when you arrive, the ticket office will sell foreigners a ticket but will not tell you that you if you are not Hindi, you can't actually enter the inner square and temple itself; so NRP1,000 (US$10.00), and you can only walk around the outside of the temple. In this regard, I think they need to inform people of this at the time of ticket purchase, as I found it a bit unethical as they aren't fully disclosing the entry terms.After paying, you will be swamped by guides (some official, some not); who even after being told their services are not required, will attempt to stay with you and begin telling you information - until being told in no uncertain terms, that they will be receiving no money from you.At the rear though, their is a small river/stream, where numerous funeral pyres burn and bodies are prepared by family members for cremation; they mourn their departed family members, cleanse them in the river, some relations shave their hair, and the bodies are then cremated and the ashes pushed into the river. My wife and I found it very interesting but didn't take photos of the bodies as we wanted to be respectful of the moment. *The photo we have included is only of a pyre being prepared, not actually a body being cremated.Their are a number of small stupas at the rear, and a few 'Holy' men sit up here, you are permitted to sit up here too and take in the experience. There are monkeys (Resus Macaques) here too, so be very aware of your belongings, especially if you have food of any type. These monkeys are very brave and sometimes aggressive if they want what you have; we watched a male monkey attempt to take a 6'3\" well-built man's food, then stare him down and call other monkeys to back him up - be aware of them at all times.All in all, we were disappointed that we were not told about not having access to all parts of the site, until after we had already paid; however the people/monkey & funeral watching experience is something we appreciated immensely."

Heading back down to the same path I went up just now, is the cremation area near the river. You have to walk past the cremation ceremony to reach the end where you'll see narupa cave. It was closed , you can only peak from outside. From there you walk up the stairs all the way to what I call the highlight of the place. It is an open field, but looks like a scene from the movie sound of the music. Great atmosphere for love birds enjoying the view from any of the edge.

Only Hindus can go into the main temple itself, but it is part of a massive complex, and you can see a huge amount without going into that main temple. One of the things we found really fascinating is seeing people washing their family members who have died, and performing ceremonies to cleanse (spiritually) their bodies in preparation for cremation, and then the bodies being burned on funeral pyres. Being a westerner, I was initially taken aback by this all happening out in the open and felt like I was intruding by watching it, but our (Hindu) guide happily explained to us that they are happy to have people see it, that this openness is part of the religion, and that they actually believe it brings more luck/goodness for the spirit of the deceased, the more people who watch it. Definitely something I think is worth seeing, to see how different cultures approach death and its rituals differently.

People seem to be fond of spending time near the bank of the Bagmati River especially in the afternoon, as we saw many of them just sitting there."

I was very fortunate to spend time there with a Nepalese friend who explained how, in the past, the while building by the river was to house those who were near death. It was like a hospice with doctors and caretakers. As the person came close to taking their last breath they are wrapped in cloth and taken to the river where their feet are washed (the river flows eventually into the holy Ganges River in india) while family/friends chant until they pass. The Hindu belief is that how we leave this life is how we enter the next, so they want the person to leave with only peace and thoughts of God. Today people are sent to hospitals and so do not come for this until they have died. After this ritual the body is cremated. There were many cremations going on while I was there. if you have time, it is a beautiful place to sit, observe and contemplate how spirit moving into the body, living in the body and leaving the body are all natural phases of life to be embraced. We were there in late afternoon and for the beginning of sunset. I am not certain about this, but I believe it is the best time to view the cremations."

But the architecture is quite different, for similar to Tibetan/East Asian style pagodas. There are many hawkers selling ceremonial-peripherals and souvenir items on the way to the temple. Once at the temple, you will be asked (if you are a Hindu) to remove your footwear and place it in a temple bag that will be kept safely in a shoe rack and a token for the same handed over to you. All non-Hindus can walk right up to the entrance of the gate and Hindus can proceed inside. There were idols of various deities inside and the prominent sight here that everyone on Trip Advisor seemed to be raving about was not quite pleasant/interesting (in my humble opinion) to watch. The river where the cremations were taking place was quite polluted and it was sad to see that nobody cared to clean it up."

Only Hindus are permitted in the actual temple premises, however, there is a lot of fascinating and mysterious culture to explore beyond the actual temple premises. The temple lies on the banks of holy Bagmati river (like the Ganges in India) where the many Hindu rituals including cremations take place. Sights of sadhus dressed in colorful yellow and orange robes with ashes and long hair and beard, signs of worldly renunciation are common in the temple area; there are also a number of ashrams and 'bhajans' singing groups of people along with numerous temples and shrines in the area that adds a sense of spirituality in the region.The view of the temple, flocks of people paying homage in the temple, the sadhus, the rituals, the river Bagmati, the architecture of the main temple and other temples - all of these add bliss to the environment. The view is most fascinating from the east side of the temple across the Bagmati river, where there are places for people to rest and experience the beautiful ambiance."

Follow the staircase that leads up from the east bank of the river to find some of Kathmandu's best relaxing trees and a good view of the city, watch out for monkeys (I have a friend who got randomly attacked), and walk around the old city part too. Can be linked with a walk to Boudnath.Would give 5 stars, but the 1000 rupee entry fee is a little embitteringly steep, especially if you're spending a while in Kathmandu and end up having to pay it several times."

You will see cremations on the banks of the river. You are allowed, even encouraged to spectate. You are also allowed, and even encouraged by guides and local \"holy men\" to use your camera. I ended up taking photos, but I was acutely aware of the grief of the families on he opposite bank. Just something to consider. A key detractor are the monkeys who are a pretty militant lot. It is easy to walk into or be surrounded by a full-on monkey brawl. These are not placid monkeys found elsewhere in the city so exercise caution. I am not sure if the combined effects of being covered in smoke and monkey pooh make up for the novelty of this site - I'll leave that to you to decide."

The structures straddle the Bagmati River which is ritually pure and holy but terribly polluted. There is so much going here it is advisable to read about the site before visiting. People line up to get inside to worship the linga which is the representation/presence of lord Shiva. This is open to the Hindu only so unless you are Hindu you cannot enter. I have met people in India who on the mention of Nepal say that they hope to make a pilgimmage to this Temple before they die. On the ghats or platforms on the river side of the temple cremations are constantly occurring. This may be shocking to people from developed countries but it is great example of how close the Nepali people are to the rhythms and cycles of life. I remember one visit where cremations, children playing in the river and women washing clothes were taking place within 100 feet of one another. There is a also a building on the upstream side of the river. It is called a nursing home by locals. Families bring people about to die here and the people who run the place are good at knowing when death its imminent. Individual are brought to the river's edge and placed on a slanted ramp with their feet in the waters of the river - the belief is that if a person's feet are in the Bagmati's waters at the moment of death s/he will be liberated from the cycles of reincarnation. There is also an old age home and a small infirmary run by the nuns of Mother Theresa's order. Cross the bridge and walk up the steps to the smaller temples and you will see numerous sadhus who are devotees of Shiva and make various claims about their diets and abilities to perform various feats. Pashupatinath is a kaleidoscope of activity - a must see."

We went there from the hill side passing the river and some small buildings looking like an older temple, where a lot of monkeys lived.We passed a guard, where we paid 1000 rs each and got a ticked. The path from the hill side can be a bit steep at som places.When we arrived to the crematorium a funeral ritual just started. It was really interresting to see the hindu culture, but also a bit stange to be watching as a tourist. It's different from our culture, to burn dead family members outside while watching, so some people might find it a bit macabre.But it was a very peacefull and quiet cermony, which gave us a good insight in the hindu culture.If you want to take pictures of the painted men sitting outside the temple, they will charge you."

We went on a Nepali holiday, and there were many families visiting the temple, dressed in their best. At the main shrine, which we, as non-Hindus could not visit, we could hear the sound of a lively bhajan, or religious song. being sung. As dusk fell a huge troop of monkeys came thundering past, the big alpha males standing guard to make sure all the mothers and babies made it safely past the humans. All in all a lovely visit, which I would highly recommend to any tourist."

They can be very aggressive.Following the smoke to the entrance of the temple. For foreigners, we will have to pay 1,000 Ruby ($10 usd) to enter which is one of the most expensive one in all religous and historical sites in Nepal. There are many ceremonies and cremations along the river which you can observe and taking pictures. I did not take pictures of these ceremonies out of respect of the death and their family. It is interesting but to some, it may be a bit disturbance to see bodies and smell of burning flesh. There are many sadhus hanging around the temple and calling you to come taking pictures with them for a fee! They are a bit creepy though!Overall, it is interesting place to visit and observe the local rituals. You might want to wear a mass for the smoke and watch the direction of the wind!"

This was a site where cremations are carried out by the river each day. We watched as funeral pyres were constructed out of wood and butter and then saw a number of bodies being cremated on their journey into the next life. We also saw a number of ambulances bringing dead bodies to the site for cremation. While at first I thought that this site might be confronting I was intrigued and surprised to find that I thoroughly enjoyed it. This might sound macabre but I was impressed by how open the whole experience of death was for these Hindus. This is one thing in the west that we try and hide away from our minds, each other and our kids and it was so refreshing to have it out there for everyone to see. I guess I felt the same about a number of things with respect to Nepal and Kathmandu. Our world in the west is sanatized in many ways. A great example for me was smell. On my return to Australia and then heading back to work on my first day I tried to take notice of the smells that I encountered on the way. It was all so sanitized and I got a whiff of my deoderant and really not much more. This was totally different in Nepal as you are constantly bombarded with the amazing smells of life including the good ones like food and wood fires of many types and some of the not so good ones such as burning bodies, dung and decay but which when added to the good ones make up life. So come and visit this Hindu site to open your mind and visit Nepal to re-awaken your senses."

It is a wonderful looking structure and very old.Apart from Pashupatinath Temple, there are other smaller temples and buildings to see on that side, but we felt as intruding tourists so we crossed back onto the eastern side of Bagmati River across the bridge. Here we could witness the burning of the bodies on the pyres and the rituals leading up to the final fiery moment, as well as the last step - someone cleaning off the pyre ready for the next corpse. The view of the temple, the surrounding buildings and the river are all quite good from the other side.As several of the main sites to see in Kathmandu Valley are now either destroyed or badly damaged by the earthquake and \"squares\" may not take so long to visit because of it, this is a good option to put on the list of places to see and experience.Recommend visiting here and with a guide who can explain to you the importance, significance and rituals which will add to the experience."

Perhaps you just go for the atmosphere. There are many, many mini temples all over the grounds, some up very steep stairs, some in amongst tranquil gardens, some along the river bank, but they all look very similar and after a short time I had a sense of \"seen one, seen 'em all\". Down by the river side, you may catch a funeral taking place and it's best not to photograph this activity.Sitting around the temples are holy men in full make up and 'costume', but rather cynically, it appears they really are there just to have their photos taken with tourists and charge for the pleasure. I can't imagine The Archbishop of Canterbury sitting outside Westminster Abbey in his full regalia charging for his photo. Alas, the most interesting part of the complex is not open to tourists or non-Hindus. A massive, resplendent, golden temple structure sits separately and only believers are permitted to enter. Even if you somehow convince you are a follower, you still are not permitted any photography inside. You can however climb above the compound, up some steep stairs and you can then get a few snaps inside the grounds, but the view is still restricted.For the price of this complex, I was disappointed. There are far better and far cheaper options in Kathmandu."

Only followers of hindusim can enter the main temple, But all the other bulding are available for foreigners to visit.Along the right bank of Bagmati river numerous platforms for funeral pyres are built.The cremations on these platforms are a common activity everyday.It is also very common to meet sadhus in pashupatinath temple.Sadhu are wandering ascetic yogis, who are trying to acquire liberation from the cycle of death rebirth by meditating.It is belived that those who die in Pashupatinath Temple are reborn asa human,regardless of any misconduct that could worsen their Karma.If you are attacted to the places where death can be felt,consider Pashupatinath as your first destination.It is a temple with special atmosphere of death, death is present in almost every ritual and every corner of it.

More so, you will need to keep your footwear at the designated place and walk to the main temple area barefeet. In case of rainy days, this becomes a little messy.The holliness of the shrine has been well accepted by hindus over the years. The positive vibrations of the place is well evident and you will find it quite tranquil in here.After the massive earthquake this year, the temple structure has stood still even after 380+ aftershocks! That is quite a marvel. But on the flip side, which is also normal, is that tourism has been hit in this country and my last visit there hardly saw much visitors from abroad."

Photography is prohibited beyond the entry gate of main temple. The typical pagoda style hindu architecture attracted me. The unique lingam with face deity is hugely popular. I don't know how but I recognised the place where I was laid down as a child of 15months [ Mother told I was suffering from high fever and suddenly got cured after visiting the place] when my parents visited the temple 28 yrs back."

Situated at outskirts of Kathmandu it is one of the most important temple of Lord Shiva and believed to offer Moksha to people who die here and hence attracts old age Hindus from across Nepal and India too. The River Bagmati flows at the side of the main temple and is an active Hindu cremation place. Most of the priest are from South India. Apart from religion I found it a great piece of ancient Hindu architecture. The main temple & the Nandi outside are crafted very nicely and indicates highly developed architecture of those period. Apart from stone crafting the wood work at the temple is excellent. The silver, copper and Gold crafting too adds to the beauty and indicates to wealthy temples of Medieval days. A nice place to be religiously or beyond.For non Hindus too the site offers good insight to history & architecture and they can spend an hour or two outside the main temple.The market outside offers handicrafts but I suggest Darbar square as a much better place to shop these article."

During my recent visit, I went to the temple around 11 am on a Friday morning. I was pleasantly surprised that the ubiquitous queues were missing this time. I was able to spend ample time in front of each of the faces of the Lord without being pushed away by the priests as happens on the busy days. After the darshan, I spent time looking up some of the other temples in the complex. There are statues of some the Nepalese kings who had been involved in several constructions within the temple precinct. I watched with interest as many locals were offering prayers to a large idol of Hanuman. I also explored a small temple established here by Adi Sankaracharya, the greatest exponent of Advaita philosophy. It was quite humbling to have visited this temple which has such a rich history."

The cremations on these platforms are a common activity , and we witnessed some cremation process while we were there, the first open cremation we ever witnessed.There's some chairs on the hills opposite the cremation area, facing towards Bagmati river.We took photos with the Sadhus on little stupas opposite Bagmati river , of course with a small sum of money, be careful ,deal with them first before you take pictures.Overall , a one of a kind experience ,worth the time spent , we highly recommend a visit to all tourists visiting Kathmandu.We hoped that no significant damage to the temple and surrounding building after the 25 April earthquake and the 12 May 2015 aftershock."

The temple area is full of interesting sights. Unfortunately, if you are not a muslim you cannot get into it but have to watch from the outside, the best view is across the river on the raised area nearby. The Sadhu are grat photography subjects, and they know it, and they will charge for it. R50 is the normal going rate although some will demand R100. Make sure you secure the rate BEFORE taking photos. There is a wonderful old age home on the right, before the temple and river river area. Go inside and meet the the folk there, they are lonely, without families and super friendly. It is also heart breaking. If you are sensitive you should avoid looking out over the river as the locals celebrate and prepare their dead for burning on the river banks, they then walk them over to the otherside of the bridge to the burning platforms where they light them and watch them burn, before sweeping up the ashes into the \"holy river\". The smell is not as unpleasant as expected when you think they are burning bodies, but they are well prepared and covered in some herbs and spices, but if you are sensitive it, you may wish to avoid this part.The local monkeys move freely across the whole area, occasionally flinging themselves from rooftops into the \"holy river\" to cool dowm. It act of childlike play enjoyed by both the monkeys and all how watch. There are plenty of local ladies who will - for a donation - bless you, paint you and pray over you. This is fun and unless you are very religious (in which case you may feel uncomfortable partaking in some other religious routine) makes feel you welcome.The temple area is strange collection of differnt buildings and it is worth exploring them all, however unless you have a guide to explain, there is no or little info there.

If one is lucky, you will meet some spiritually blessed Sadhus.A must visit.Please do not take photos - i was screamed at by a security officer in a very very rude tone -- something he could have done calmly and politely."

Boudanath Stupa looks more impressive, and Swayambhunath is a lot of fun, but there's nothing quite like Pashupatinath. I was fortunate to have my good friend Naba (a local and an excellent guide to boot) show me around the temple complex and explain to me in great detail what each statue, each area and each ceremony meant. During my visit there, I was able to also witness a cremation ceremony, which is powerfully moving. Since majority of Hindu Nepalis are cremated in Pashupatinath, there's something quite awe-inspiring about witnessing the end in a sacred place like this.I would highly recommend getting a guide or a local to take you around, as the grounds are wide and there is much detail to look at. Wear comfortable shoes as you may end up climbing up and down some very huge steps. For a bit of fun and cultural experience, have your photo taken with the saddhus (holy men) for a small token fee (they like accepting currencies from different countries, by the way!). I also got to talk to them a bit, which was quite nice.There is a small cafe near the top of this temple complex where they serve really good milk tea. For foreign travelers like me, entrance fee to Pashupatinath is Nepalese Rs 1,000 (US $10) which seemed pretty steep to me at first, but was actually worth it, in the end."

The main thing is that the cremations take place \u00a0here and I think that is every day. First they bring the body that is entirely decked in Orange and yellow flowers. They have to sacrifice an animal right at the thoroughfare to the bridge. So one will walk past the headless animal. Then there is this entire ceremony happening by the river. It takes quite long, all this happening in the hot sun. If this is your kind of thing, then it is a superb rich cultural experience to see what happens here. Personally for me, it's not my sort of thing.\u00a0One can also see a lot of holy men and women around. And a lot of goats. Hindus are not allowed to go inside the temple so that whole area is fenced off. And all at the same time people coming to ask you if you need a guide etc.\u00a0"

As a foreign tourist, you are superfluous, except for the inevitable scams and fakes that you should obviously avoid. Most of the visitors are not camera wielding Europeans or Americans but religious tourists from Nepal and other parts of the sub-continent. Some visitors have problems with Pashupatinath: 1. \"Those burning bodies were gross!\" 2. \"It's so so rude to say that only Hindus are allowed in the Temple\"Ref. 1. This site is revered and famous for its cemetery ghats. If you are that squeamish it would be better not to go. But a great pity as this is an important aspect of life, (and death), in Nepal.Ref.2. I felt much happier knowing where I could and could not go. It seems perfectly reasonable to reserve some areas for practising Hindus where they can make their religious observances away from our prying and camera snapping eyes. Few of us would object to the common signs in English Cathedrals \"this chapel is reserved for silent prayer\". It's not really that different.This was my 3rd visit to Pashupatinath in the last few years and I nearly didn't go as I had been to Varanasi, (world's most famous cemetery ghats?) earlier on the trip and felt that Pashupatinath would be a pale shadow of that site. However, I was wrong and now feel that this site is a unique and special place and like Bodunath Stupa is a useful reminder that Nepal is a country steeped in a complex mix of fervently held religious beliefs, irrespective of our own views.Unlike several other reviewers, I would advise anyone to avoid a guide, however authoritative and cheap they are. It is so easy to end up like a school child on a trip, where the endless transmission of facts, figures and information actually stops you from just experiencing the place in your own way. So my advice is........\"Just soak it all up!\""

I dont know, but the buzz of people, the stores selling rudraksha(sacred seed) garlands all along the pavement gave it its own charm. The graveyard which is situated just behind the temple was a bit unpleasant. I was not comfortable watching people burn their dead. Since Shiva is the known as the protector of the Graveyard, its location is apt. Its just good good to know what to expect before you visit. Its a religious Hindu's dream to visit Pashupathinath.

            "review": "An experience, but blatantly overpriced. The Pashupatinath is one of the most sacred Hindu temples, and for non-Hindus it is definitely an experience. It is full of \"sadhus\" (pilgrims) and worshipping Hindus, and it is also a place of open-air cremation on the banks of a small river. The cremations are public, and crowds of spectators gather readily; this is something which may irritate many \"Westerners\", and I admit that even though I consider myself an open-minded and seasoned traveller I was more shaken up by the spectacle than I had expected, too.However, I was even more shocked by the temple surroundings: it was full of beggars, but also of maimed and visibly sick people. I have read that many Hindus wish to die at the Pashupatinath temple; some people that lay crammed on the ground gave the impression that they were soon going to. Again, this may be an important part of Nepali / Hindu culture, but nevertheless I could not help getting more uneasy than I had expected. In fact, I was so uncomfortable that I completely skipped visiting the main temple.All the above points concern my personal, subjective experience and I believe that for other travellers, the place may have a completely opposite effect: the way that the worshipping Hindus deal with death (their own or that of loved ones) in this place may surely appeal to many, and the sadhus and crowds of worshippers give the precincts a buzzing vibe.However, I believe that objectively the entrance fee of 1000 nepalese rupees (about 10 USD!) is far too high. Signs claim that the money goes into the maintenance and renovation of this UN heritage site, but I am not sure how reliable that is in a corrupt country like Nepal. But in any case, I quite frankly did not think that the place was worth that entrance fee as a tourist site."

The entire ceremony can take an hour or so - the cremating can take several hours (so an attendant stays with the pyre, adding wood until everything is ash, at which time it is brushed from the platform into the river). The alley way/street leading to the area is lined with lepers begging and sadhus (not holy men here, just pan handlers), so it is not for the faint."

For non-Hindus it is an opportunity to see corpses being burned and your wallet being lightened. The entrance fee of 1000 rupees ($10) is really a lot considering they are pretty clearly doing nothing in the way of conservation at this Unesco World Heritage site. - Hopefully one day they will use that money to clean up the place and fix the dilapidation of places like the state run home for the elderly. At the ticket office you will be aproached by a guide who may or may not call himself a guide. This person will follow you, whether you want it or not and inform you of where it is alright to photograph (in my mind, funerals are not for gawking at and definitely not for tourists to take pictures off, but there you go...) - If you managed to land one of the good guides, he'll also provide you with a wealth of knowledge about the history and customs related to the temples, shrines, cremation and the Hindu dieties and their avatars... So here's hoping you get a good one. The temple is only accessible to Hindus and it seems only if you \"look like a Hindu\" (converts beware!) which may be even more racist than charging foreigners an entry fee much higher than a local's daily wage, but the rest of the site is open to all. The riverside embankment has 10 terraces for funeral pyres and they burn constantly, 24 hours a day. You will more than likely see at least 1 fire being lit, another mid burn and a third being cleared away, the ashes being swept into the murky waters. By tradition a body should burn in four hours, any slower and they are considered to be burdened by great sins. - The wealthy and especially politicians are often burned with sandal wood and animal fat as catalysts to make sure they aren't seen as sinners. The Sadhus hanging around the temple complex are one of the biggest places where you can go lose money. They will gladly pose for photos, actually it seems to be all these so-called holy men do all day. It is a well known fact that these \"Business Sadhus\" come from all over the region, including India and live off the money they make. Do not be fooled by them, anyone can grow a beard and dress in orange robes, after all! The guide will probably ask you for about 1000rs, but the going rate is 500 per tour. Some people have been fleeced for many thousands, but do not be one of them! It is highly recommended to have a scarf or other device with which to shield your mouth, as the smoke and ash from the constant burning bodies is both annoying to breathe and rather disgusting when you think about it."

Even several streets away, we could feel the religious fervor of the people who throng here. We saw Linga stones in the street where the puja was recently performed. We saw people with bare feet performing rituals; further on we saw holy men resting on the Ghats; and we saw many cremations on the Ghats at the river bank. I was fascinated at the spectacle of it all...the shouts and chants; the mourners' cries; the scent of burning sandalwood; the exoticism of the site. Cows and goats and monkeys run free as they do in other parts of Nepal.Though non-Hindu visitors to the temple are not allowed, we saw much and experienced rituals and religious ceremonies that Westerners don't normally see. The golden roofs of the temple can be seen from many vantage points and the mountains rise high above all of this. The place is magical and must be experienced by any and all who come to Nepal."

It takes 20-25 minutes considering the traffic from Airport and City Centre to reach here. You may only take darshan or you may perform a special Pooja called \" Pinda Dana\" or offerings to your forefathers. I performed one which took roughy an hour at the hands of a Brahman who typically takes Rs 2500 ( Nepali) for this pooja. He gets all the material required for the pooja included in this cost. This kind of Pooja is done only at Tyrambakeshwar ( Nasik, Maharashtra) and Gaya ( Bihar, India) and Pashupatinath.When you enter the temple you will see a huge Nandi ( Sacred bull and carrier of Lord Shiva) offered to the temple by the King of Nepal. Lord Shiva as Pashupatinath has Five heads and hence there are four gates to the temple for each direction. The fifth head is on the top of the Linga. You have to take darshan visiting each gate one by one. Aarti of River Baghmati is performed as of Mother Ganga in Benaras, India. Its a treat to watch. It is performed at sunset. Please check for time difference in Nepal as Nepalese time is 15 minutes ahead of Indian time.Overall its a deeply spiritual expreience to be at one of the holiest shrines of Hindu Religion. Must go in a life time!"

At first we thought it was because we had our shoes on still, but a kind woman told us that the area was for Hindus only. At first we thought we had paid to just stand in a courtyard, but after walking around we realised that we were to go behind the temple. This is where the cremations were happening. After exploring the rest of the complex, we sat on the opposite side of the river and watched a cremation ceremony. It sounds morbid but the actually experience was moving and sincere. We watch a family walked around the pyre and conduct various rituals before it was lit. Yes tourist were taking photos, but they were respectful of the family and were quite quiet during the ceremony. Certainly an experience. Also, this place had more monkeys than the so-called 'Monkey Temple'!"

In addition to the entry fee of another approximately US$10 each we hired a tour guide for about US$10. His English was very good and he was well informed and showed us all around the place. It is kind of a dreary place and while we were there we saw two cremations. One was already burning away furiously and the other was a man's body being cleansed and then set up for cremation. The Bagmati River flows by the site and the ashes are dumped into it at the conclusion. The river and the surrounding area are not very clean at this place. However, the river is treated as a sacred thing and it flows to the Ganges River in India. I was surpised by the number of tourists and other vistors. I am glad I saw this as I was told it is a must-see. I agree with that but also caution to not encourage by even a little bit the people walking around trying to see you scarves, jewelry, rocks, and anything else you could imagine. They absolutely will not take no for an answer. I finally told our guide that if he could not convince these hawkers that we were not interested it would start costing him money off his fee.

Is a whole ritual where the dead will be wash in the river, pray and then burn while their family uses the river water to wash their own head and feet. They believe is the holy water. Lots of monkey around and if you walk up the stairs to the top you will have a nice view."

As non Hindus, we were not allowed to enter the main temple, and we fully understood this, but the surrounding area is fascinating. The human cremations on the ghats seem very strange to westerners. They are public cremations and no one minds if you watch and take photos, though we did not venture onto the cremation side of the river. Some did and it looked and felt intrusive, though locals didn't seem to bother at all. The cremation ceremonies seemed very solemn and dignified, unlike those in Varanasi that felt grubby."

This Hindu Temple complex, visited on my last afternoon in Nepal prior to my flight home was a powerful sensory and emotional experience, which only those who experience the place can fully appreciate. A photo is just a two-dimensional view and cannot begin to capture the atmosphere of the temples, the holy Baghmati River and the Funeral Ghats. Nepal\u2019s equivalent of India\u2019s Varanasi is dedicated to Shiva. Sadhus and Hindus come from all over the Indian Sub-Continent to worship at this holy site. Many Nepalese are cremated here on open Funeral pyres along the riverbanks Families take the bodies of the dead to the river; remove all clothing and wrap their deceased on yellow robes. They take the bodies to the river for ritual bathing; where the mouths of the deceased are filled with water from the holy river. The cremation pyre is prepared and lit with the families and friends in close proximity. All this happens with the background sounds of the music and chanting from the temple above.Walking among along the river Ghats alongside the mourners; feeling the heat of the pyres, the smell of the smoke and the aural stimulation of the music was an almost unreal. I\u2019d seen photos and films of this; but to experience this at first was an unforgettable travel experience like none other."

Witnessing the ceremony form the very beginning up to the end was an immensely poignant experience. If you do want to visit here and witness this spitriual and very personal ritual, carry with you some tact and respect and avoid taking pictures or videos as some tourists/foreigners were doing. The sad part was that some of the people who work for the temple secretly allow tourists closer to the viewing cremation deck and let them take pictures or videos for a little dollar amount. I was summoned a couple of times, but I politely declined the offer. Just sit from across the river and ruminate on in the experience, a surge of peaceful sentiment will come to you right away.

There was a bereaved mother openly wailing just next to the ticket booth. \"You must buy a ticket, sir. 1000 rupees!\" I think he saw me balk at the cost and the absurdity of the situation. \"You can see the cremation!\"I walked away, a bit grossed out. I went (was steered) toward the other entrance, where the same selling point was eagerly proffered with a keen nodding action. At that point I walked away for good. I couldn't bring myself to buy a ticket to funeral. I wanted to see the temples, with the cremations a mere addition. No need to push the morbid fascination angle. Its there, of course, but sticking a price tag on it for tourists is totally distasteful."

I felt like I was witnessing the separation of body and soul with my bare eyes.

So keep fruits and other eatables out of the reach of monkeys. Behind the Pashupatinath temple, next to the river, there were around 7 cremations going on. The smoke from the cremation was overwhelming. I stood watching the cremation and the relatives of the deceased who have come to bid adieu to the departed soul. The friends and relatives of the deceased were so engrossed in their mobile phones and chit chatting with others, it made me think that there is no use of living life thinking of others. Our life is our own. No one cares once we are dead. The visit to this temple made me realise that life is just one and this life is yours, live it to the fullest without a care in the world."

My guide, Prem, had been a street child around the temple for a couple of years, then he started to make some money as a temple tour guide. Then he was adopted by an American family who put him through school and college. Now he is a master's graduate, speaks perfect English, and understands the Western culture. He teaches English and is a tour guide (I also did the Annapurna Circuit trek with him). Back to the temple, it is a very complex and intense Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva, who governs destruction and death. Therefore the Shiva sites are dedicated to incineration and death rituals. They happen in open air, and I stayed on the bank of the river and watched the rituals for a long time. The scenery, including the cows along the river, reminded me very much of the holy Hindu city of Varanasi, my favorite place in India. But while in Varanasi you are not allowed to take pictures of the incineration rituals, here at the temple you can, from a respectful distance. You can see some of my pictures here.If you need an outstanding guide for the temple, Kathmandu, Annapurna, or other sites in Nepal, here's Prem's info: +977-9849082363, premthapa305@hotmail.com"

In other words Pashupati is the master of all living beings of the universe. This is how lord Pashupati is eulogized in the Vedas, Upnisada and ohter religious books.Pashupati area is regarded as one of the most important places of pilgrimages for the followeres of Hinduism. Thousands of devotees from within and outside the country come to pay homage to Pashupatinath every day. And on special occasions like Ekadasi, Sankranti, Mahashivratri, Teej Akshaya, Rakshabandhan, Grahana (eclipse), Poornima (Full moon day) people congregate here in far greater number. Pashupati area is also included in the list of world cultural heritage. was build in 753 AD happened to be the ruler 39 generation before Manadeva (464-505 AD)."

Entry is $15 which is a bit over the top like a lot of places, however there is a lot to see. A guide will attach himself to you and I found, in my case, it was worth paying a bit extra as he explained everything. There are quite a few cremations every day and you are allowed to watch. You're not allowed to enter the temple if you're not a Hindu. Right up the top is a small deer park which is fenced in though but you can walk around it and it's quiet and peaceful. You will come across the usual holy (or not so holy) men who will pose for a fee. The Aged Care facility is an amazing place as it is so very different to our western ones. "

He however was expecting a huge amount demanding it away from the main area and hidden, which was quite intimidating. Be strong and donate a small amount. The area however I found fascinating and probably one of the main highlights in Kathmandu. Certainly not to be missed by any means! Really glad to have come and definately grab a picture with the holy saddhu's around the area!"

This is the most important cremation site in the Kathmandu Valley and boasts a beautiful temple to Lord Shiva. Sadly for tourists, the temple is only open to Hindus, but one can walk up to the entrance and peek inside or get a view of the temple from the opposite side of the Bagmati River - Nepal's version of the Ganges. Often, when visiting, tourists find cremations going on - Hindus in one area and Buddhists farther downriver. Watching a cremation and understanding what it means to have the family intimately involved in sending family to the other world, is quite an experience. It is also fun to visit with the local sadhus or wise men. Remember, though, if you take a photo, they expect to be compensated. You can also walk up the hill on the other side and come down past the Gujeswari Temple, with good views of Boudhanath. In the old days, this area used to be farmland, but now it is dotted with apartment houses for Kathmandu's growing population."

Bombarded with people offering a \"guided\" tour, the average tourist will get fleeced out of money by those looking to earn a quick buck.

It is a temple of lord Shiva and it was built in 400 AD is almost 1600 years old now.We visited the temple on June 14th, 2014. It was a good experience and there was not too much rush. We managed to do the Darshan in less than 10 minutes, which otherwise can stretch to 3-4 hours in certain times of the year.There are hundreds of monkeys in the premises, but they are quite docile and don't attack humans. But they are quite naughty and one of them ran away with my wife's sandals and shred it to bits!"

Firstly, please prepare 1000 Nepal Rupee Entrance Fees. this apply to all the foreigner (excluded visitor from Nepal Neighbour country). 2. Some local guide will be waiting nearby the ticket counter and approach for touring services. Try to talk to them for few minute to make sure they really can speak good english/chinese. Some of them might only good in greeting and introduction. For the touring services, they will ask for 5 USD or 500 Rupee. 3. a facemask is a MUST. This temple also an Cremation Site. And they did it in open air. 4. The Mother Theresa's old folk's home is near beside the temple. Based on my tour guide, this old folk's home have more then 150 old ppl. If you don't mind, just drop some giving to the donation box. :)As a conclusion, this is a MUST VISIT place. Please don't miss it."

You can greeted to a huge bull idol as you enter the temple and you get a sense of templeception since there are many idols of gods within the complex. The crematorium is visible to public and you can watch all the proceedings. Also once outside the temple complex, it's a haven for portrait photographers. A must visit for people who travel to Kathmandu. It's a 10 minute drive from Thamel, and costs 20 npr if you take one of the mini vans from ranipark"

The final stages of the Hindu cremation take place in the open air on the river bank, from anointing the body, to setting the pyre alight, to cremation, to shovelling the ashes into the river and preparing a new funeral pyre.A home for the elderly sits adjacent to the crematorium with a huge, shifting pile of firewood outside.

It is a square, two-tiered pagoda temple built on a single-tier plinth, and it stands 23.6 meters above the ground. Richly ornamented gilt and silver-plated doors are on all sides.On both sides of each door are niches of various sizes containing gold-painted images of guardian deities. Inside the temple itself is a narrow ambulatory around the sanctum. The sanctum contains a one-meter high linga with four faces (chaturmukha) representing Pashupati, as well as images of Vishnu, Surya, Devi and Ganesh.The priests of Pashaputinath are called Bhattas and the chief priest is called Mool Bhatt or Raval. The chief priest is answerable only to the King of Nepal and reports to him on temple matters on a periodic basis.The struts under the roofs, dating from the late 17th century, are decorated with wood carvings of members of Shiva's family such as Parvati, Ganesh, Kumar or the Yoginis, as well as Hanuman, Rama, Sita, Lakshman and other gods and goddesses from the Ramayana.Pashaputi Temple's extensive grounds include many other old and important temples, shrines and statues. South of the temple, for instance, is Chadeshvar, an inscribed Licchavi linga from the 7th century, and north of the temple is a 9th-century temple of Brahma. On the south side of Pashupati temple is the Dharmashila, a stone where sacred oaths are taken, and pillars with statues of various Shah Kings. The Bagmati River, which runs next to Pashaputinath Temple, has highly sacred properties. Thus the banks are lined with many ghats (bathing spots) for use by pilgrims. Renovating or furnishing these sites has always been regarded as meritorious. Arya Ghat, dating from the early 1900s, is of special importance because it is the only place where lustral water for Pashupatinath Temple can be obtained and it is where members of the royal family are cremated. The main cremation site is Bhasmeshvar Ghat, which is the most-used cremation site in the Kathmandu Valley. The preferred bathing spot for women is the Gauri Ghat, to the north."

I visited with my 25 year old daughter, and whilst the concept of sitting quietly watching the cremation formalities and rituals across a small canal seemed intrusional (and difficult to explain to others), we found it to be a thought provoking and contemplative experience. There are two cremation areas - basic platforms and \"no frills\" for commoners, and an area for more affluent people, with more ceremony and ritual.There was no sign of grief or drama, as the cremations seemed to be conducted more as a final formality and farewell before rebirth.A most worthwhile visit, which gives an enhanced understanding of local culture and thought. At no stage did our presence feel unwelcome or out of place - we were simply observers (amongst a few hundred others) quietly observing part of life's cycle.An important part of the Kathmandu \"experience\"."

Witnessing cremations and death so publicly is very alien from the way we deal with it in the west. For many this may be the first time you have seen dead bodies and it feels wrong to be taking photos and watching families experiencing grief. It is almost like a factory. Smoke wafts up from multiple funeral pyres. It takes 3hrs to burn a body and they get through 30 a day. The charred remains are just pushed into the river. There is the spiritual aspect too, gold robes, offerings etc - the whole place is drenched in traditions. The Sadhu's are great characters too. They will pose with you for photos for 10 or 15Rs. Spend some time here just to soak in the atmosphere, have respect for the mourners and don't be too intrusive."

Secondly, there were a number of cremations going on, and apart from the fact that I have no desire to see one, it felt offensive to be spectators to such an intimate and sorrowful event.Thirdly, the surroundings are dreadful: the river Bagmati is horribly polluted with sewerage and general rubbish (smelly) and there are a number of mangy dogs lurking about (would they bite?). The buildings are not well looked after and the general ambiance is jaded and slovenly.Lastly there are a number of \"sadhus\" that loiter about looking very grand in all their finery and painted faces, extorting money from foreigners to have their photos taken. They didn't strike me as the real thing at all (and I have heard that indeed they aren't!).

There were monkeys running around and cows roaming freely amongst the tourists and the mourning relatives of the deceased. The architecture and the history was fascinating.Some of the young guides were a little insistent, but I did manage to persuade all 4 of the persistent young men who approached me, that for me this was more of a spiritual experience for which I appreciated having my own thoughts, and for whom only I could be my particular guide.

The first thing to assualt the senses was the sight of an amusement park that is on the grounds. The large swinging pirate boat seemed strangely out of place. Perhaps this wouldn't be as real as I thought.You enter through a large gate that then becomes a largish path that winds its way up to the actual crematoria site. And yes it gets real. Passing by the sadhus etc, you come to the river where at any time of the day people can bring their relatives who have passed away to be cremated. There are platforms along the river where after ritual bathing/cleansing of the body the fires can be lit and the bodies can begin their reduction to ash. Its confronting to be so intimate in a strangers life as you see them grieving. But the process is highly ritualised and peaceful. The temple is filled with cows, and beggars and sadhus and grieving relatives, and a general sense of peace. You cannot enter the Hindu temple itself but are allowed to peer in, and can catch a glimpse of the extremely large testicles of a golden bull. Take the time to really see the whole site and appreciate all of the rituals that are happening. from the sons honouring their fathers deaths yearly, to the pilgrims coming to the biggest Hindu temple in Asia, to the locals digging pennies out of the ashes. For a site dedicated to death it is full of life and visually explosive."

I needn't have worried and I'm now very glad I have been there. For a start, the whole approach to the temples is lined with a multitude of stalls seeling offerings. Hindus vastly outnumber tourists, and although the ghats are used for cremation, there is no intrusion upon the rituals and a good distance maintained between grieving families and ordinary visitors. The most sacred temple is reserved for Hindus only but the whole vast complex can be seen from the hill on the opposite side of the river so that you can begin to undertand how it all works. It is a quite extraordinary place."

Although non-Hindus cannot enter the main temple, you can stand my the door and peer at the giant golden bull inside.There are various little temples and pavillions around which you can go in, including the five-pointed Mother Theresa temple, which is now a shelter for the elderly. You can get up close to the funeral pyres if you wish... Though this is not for everyone, it can be an interesting cultural experience. I would recommend taking a guide as they can explain more about Hinduism and the temple's history if you are interested. Though don't pay more than $10 (bargain this down if you can).There is a small bridge which offers good views along the river, and on the other side of it some steps leading to the Bodnath Stupa. If you face the bridge then turn left past the funeral pyres in front of the temple, you will reach the meditation caves. One of them is known as the \"Jimi Hendrix cave\" as it's apparently where Hendrix lived for a while. My guide said there is a celebration of Hendrix there every Sunday from 2pm onwards, not sure if this is true though?"

The place might seem chaotic in the first look but there is a different kid of peace among the chaos, the nagas and the yogis sitting all around the temple, the old ladies sitting in groups and singing, the pigeons, monkeys and cows, the hustle- bustle is one of a kind. There are shops around selling prasad and stuffs like rudraksha and pearls but I would advise everyone to be careful while buying such stuffs ensuring that it's original stuff and don't hesitate to bargain.

This very important Hindu temple is also the location of Hindu funeral rites for those who live in Kathmandu and, if you were raised Christian and know little of that religion's ceremonies, it is very eye opening. After you pay the entrance fee, you walk along the Bagmati River toward the temple itself. The other side of the river is where loved ones are washed and cremated after death. For me it felt as if I was watching something extremely personal and I was hesitant to take photographs. My guide, Vishnu, grabbed my camera and had no problem with it. As we walked along he described the process to me. Because the Bagmati is considered a holy river, shortly after death, families take the body to be washed in the river (slightly up from the cremation site) and then cremated. In general, only males are allowed to wash the body and attend the cremation. The oldest son walks around the body three times with the priest as it lays on the pyre. Then, with the assistance of the priest, he starts the fire from the mouth of the deceased (I assume an accelerant of some time type is involved). The family and friends stay while the priest attends the body as it burns. I felt very culturally ignorant to know so little about Hindu ceremony and, even though I was uncomfortable, I wanted to understand. As we walked along, Vishnu asked me about Christian ceremonies and when I described the 2-3 days we view the body at a funeral parlor, HE was clearly uncomfortable, but interested himself in knowing more. This site is really fascinating and moving, but prepare yourself to deal with things that you may find disturbing to watch. There is a smell involved and over time for me, the combination of that with simply dealing with death itself made me not want to linger. On the lighter side, you can have your photo taken with the Hindu holy men that are at the site. One of my favorite photos from Nepal is with two of these men; one of whom was a real card! The temple is further down, and as with all of these temples, only Hindus can enter. I'm glad that I didn't miss this; it gave me a personal window into Nepali life."

My niece was drinking juice and one of the monkeys took the juice box from her to drink the rest. Unfortunately the main temple was closed until 430pm, but we were able to pray at the smaller temples that are part of the complex."

Hindus across the world come to Pashupatinath Temple in hope to get free from the cycle of birth and re-birth. The temple is situated at the banks of Bagmati river which also serves as a Hindu cremation ground. Non-Hindu tourists may be disappointed as the entry inside the temple premises is strictly for Hindus. Leaving aside the faith and religious significance, i found the premises very dirty and choatic. The priests in various small temples (within the compound) try to rob you by offering customized prayer menu for the happiness and well being of family. Please just ignore them and don't be a fool. Please take care of the belonging all the time to avoid any unpleasant experience. Use only trusted car services to go around Kathmandu and confirm the fare with cab drivers as they usually befool tourist by asking for Indian Rupee instead of Nepali Rupee. Have wonderful stay in kathmandu!Rating: 2.5/5"

We were then harassed by a lot of ''guides'', something that can really spoil your visit...- most of all, they have doubled the fee entrance recently (from 500 to 1000rs) without any clear reason.

I spent most of the time trying to convince people that I was of Indian origin to avoid being swindled out of entrance fees. My attempt as Hindi was okay but not convincing so I opted to speak Punjabi in an attempt to confuse and convince all the same time. It worked and I was allowed into the main area reserved for Hindus only. Once inside, I was greeted by a persistent priest who tried to sell me a pooja (prayer) for 5000 NPR! Once I shooed him away, looking around the main religious area was difficult as people viewed me with suspicious looks of 'is she or she not indian\". Although amusing, it somewhat took away my experience of this place as although not religious I have a general interest in these things. That aside, the open air cremations were not as ghastly as I thought they would be, though I hastily retreated when the smoke got too much. Animals roamed everywhere. As you enter, there are lots of cows being constantly fed along with hundreds of pigeons. Beware of the monkeys as they are cheeky but make great photos. Bit of surreal place, lots of sadhus and priests trying to rip you off, animals and humans trying to coexist in some strange way. Worth going just for the experience and fascination of seeing life and death at the same time."

But if you think Pashupatinath is a normal, traditional Nepali scene don't kid yourself. Apparently the Nepalese who send off their deceased in the holy river think it is just as tacky as we do, and they want the excessive trappings of tourism driven from this place.

Definitely try to watch that (it is on the other side of the temple).The ghats, where Hindus are cremated within 24 hours of death, are down by the river. Take your time if you are hesitant about watching such a funeral. They take place 24/7. First, the deceased gets washed on the northern side of the bridge. Then the cremation is done on the ghats.

Best travel I advice I can give you. We might have just walked up to the rivers edge to view the first few funeral pyres on the other side and then left. Fortunately our guide took us all around the entire complex, with the climax being the section of the temple where the bodies wrapped in orange cloth were lying along the river waiting to be burned. The view from up high from the opposite bank of the river of the entire ritual will stay with me forever."

Pashupatinath temple is the biggest and most visited temple of lord shiva in the world.According to legends, the Pandavas sought the blessings of lord Shiva to atone their sin after the battle of Mahabharata. Lord Shiva eluded them repeatedly and while fleeing took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a bull. On being followed, he dived into ground leaving behind his hump on the surface and appeared in Nepal as Pashupatinath."

It was hard for me to reconcile the concept of a public cremation. The place itself was surreal. At one point there were children swimming in the 'river' literally a metre or two away from a deceased person (the body was covered) having his feet dipped in the water prior to the cremation. Monkeys were sitting adjacent to this eating food scraps while behind this there were about four cremations taking place simultaneously - all at different stages. Family members were performing the required religious rituals and onlookers (friends and tourists) stood observing. (Hard to believe!) With all of this happening, there is still an enormous amount of dignity and serenity.It is well worth one's while to take a face/mouth covering as there is a fair amount of smoke and I struggled with the odours that wafted through the area as the wind blew in different directions.It is a photographer's dream!"

The Pashupatinath Temple was one of the sites I saw; spent about 45 min there. First, they used to charge 250, then 500 and now, as of April, 1000 rupee to get inside. About 10 USD. The Temple itself is only open to Hindus but you can wander around the grounds. I hired a guide because the guide I came with did not know about the history of this temple. The temple guide was excellent. He was very informative and spoke English well. It was not clear to me he worked for the temple; I thought he was on his own (though did produce an authorized govt guide card). He charged me another 1000 rupee. While there a number of women selling beads tried to hit me up. I took a photo of one place and had to pay a tip. Then had my photo with some holy men. Before the photo the guide warned they would be looking for a donation. Fair enough. After the photos, I asked the guide how much. He did not advise. I gave 50 rupee and was told this was not enough. So I asked (again) what they wanted. He said 100 each! That would have been another 6 USD. I handed over about half that amount---300 rupees. Then, the end of the tour, the guide \"suggested\" I also tip him. He suggested i give him 5 euros (a note I had in my wallet, which he apparently had noticed). Ridiculous as that is about 7 USD. After having already forked out 23-24 USD, I was just done. So I did not tip. The guide was not very happy and neither was the other guide I had hired but could not tell me anything. He made some comment like, \"well he just went into the tourist office, they probably pay him.\" I had such a fabulous experience in Eastern Nepal where are no tourists and people are not tainted. This cast a shadow over my experience. The other part was seeing other tourists take photos of families grieving while their relative was being cremated. Over the top in terms of disrespect. I could not wait to leave this dirty, crowded city of over 7 million people."

In other words Pashupati is the master of all living beings of the universe. This is how lord Pashupati is eulogized in the Vedas, Upnisada and ohter religious books.The present architectural nature of Pashupatinath temple came into existence as a result of renovation by queen Gangadevi during the reign of Shivasimha Malla (1578-1620 AD).The temple of Lord Pashupatinath stands in the middle of an open courtyard. It is a square shaped pagoda temple built on single platform measuring 23.6 meters from the ground. There are gold gilt doors on all the four sides of the temple. Inside the temple there is a narrow walk engulfing the sanctum from where one can have closer view of Shivalinga.In the sanctum of the temple, there is a very attractive, about three feet high Shivalinga with four faces. All these faces have different names and significance. The face facing east is known as Tatpurusha and the one facing south as Aghora. Similarly, the faces looking west and north are known by the name Sadhyojata and Vamadeva respectively. The upper portion of this linga is known as Ishan. These faces are also defined as the symbol of four dharmas (the most famous places of pilgrimage for Hindus) and four Vedas (sacred books of Hindus). The images of Vishnu, Surya, Devi and Ganesh are also placed in the sanctum of the temple.Pashupati area is regarded as one of the most important places of pilgrimages for the followeres of Hinduism. Thousands of devotees from within and outside the country come to pay homage to Pashupatinath every day. And on special occasions like Ekadasi, Sankranti, Mahashivratri, Teej Akshaya, Rakshabandhan, Grahana (eclipse), Poornima (Full moon day) people congregate here in far greater number. Pashupati area is also included in the list of world cultural heritage."

A river runs through it where you can see bodies being burnt in funerals. Lots of green spaces surround the temple, and you can spend a good part of the day relaxing, strolling, and exploring. You can't enter the temple building if you're not Hindu, as with other Hindu temples, and many signs will remind you of that. The only thing that disappointed me greatly though is the large sum we had to pay to enter the grounds as foreigners. At 1000 rupees per foreigner, it was the highest we have paid in Kathmandu to visit any attraction.Overall, it is worth a visit, but does have have some drawbacks, including the ticket prices and not having access to the courtyards of the temples at least, which you can peek at through the temple gates. I suggest adding another site to your day after visiting this temple, and one that is nearby which I suggest is the beautiful Boudhanath stupa, which is also surrounded by restaurants and cafes if you wish to take a break or have some lunch."

My taxi driver offered to guide me around temple for free if I took his cab back to the hotel, but once I pay the Rs 1000 entrance fee, one of the guide there told him to leave since only official guide is allowed. The guide insisted to use his service by telling me many spots inside the temple are holy and I need someone to guide my way through. Well, I do not have a choice. Inside, there's nothing much to see, no cremation, and only Sadhu are the main attraction. Plus point is the shelter for elderly accross the temple's main entrance, I was there to take some picture but end up talking with doctors from India who is doing voluntary work, really enlighting.

The richly-ornamented pagoda houses the sacred linga, or phallic symbol, of Lord Shiva as well as the noteworthy gold plated roofs and silver coated doors. This is the abode of God Shiva and is the holiest of all the Shiva shrines.Religious pilgrims and sadhus, like the one pictured here, travel all the way from the remote areas of India to visit this sacred sight, especially during Shivaratri (the night of Shiva) that falls between February/March. Even though these devotees have denounced worldly possessions, each carries a Sadhu ID (identifications card) to freely cross over the border between India and Nepal.Chronicles indicate Pashupatinath\u2019s existence prior to 400 AD. Devotees can be seen taking ritual dips in the holy Bagmati river flowing beside the temple, also a World Heritage Site. The crematorium is just outside the temple and it is a dream of almost every Hindu to be cremated by the side of Pashupati Aryaghat after their death."

Apart from main temple, there are many small temples inside the campus. It is being told that Bhim ( one of the Pandavas in Mahabharat) wanted to worship Lord Shiva and he was searching Lord Shiva in Himalays. To take test of Bhim's devotion and to hide from Bhim, Lord Shiva hided himself in the look of a buffalo. But, Bhim identified Lord Shiva even in the form of buffalo. Then, Lord Shiva (in the form of buffalo) tried to hide himself by going beneath the ground(land). But, Bhim caught tail of buffalo. The place where Bhim caught the tail is presently known as Kedarnath (one of chardhams of Hindus) and Shiv linga in Kedarnath(India) is rear part of buffalo and the front part (face side) is in Pashupatinath, Kathmandu, Nepal.The shiv linga in Pashupatinath is having four faces of shiva on four sides of shiv linga(East, west,north and south). The devotee must perform Darshana of all four faces. There are many brahmins available in temple . Devotees can perform \"Pujavidhi\" through them with nominal charge @ Rs.311/- . Overall it was very good experience."

It can be very confronting for people who have not seen an open air cremation on a funeral pyre, let alone 10 in a row all burning simultaneously. It is sombre and reflective, yet also a fascinating step-by-step peak into the Hindu culture and tradition of cremation and and celebration of life. As you walk through the grounds you are exposed to every aspect of this process and as unusual as it may sound, photography is welcome, common and in some cases encouraged. There are many iconic Sadhu's (holy men) lounging in hidden nooks and prayer areas in the buildings surrounding the pyres, they come complete with their long dreadlocks & glazed eyes, particularly the younger ones. Take a little time to do a thorough walk-thru if you're chasing a photograph of an older 'wise' Sadhu, if you look closely and explore the myriad of mini temples and surrounding buildings, you are bound to see some extremely photogenic locals! These amazing characters won't talk but many will pose for photos and welcome the opportunity if a few Rupees are on offer. (Always show respect and ask first or point at your camera and nod, watching for their reaction) There is also a cornea depository bank just behind the main cremation area, it is the very last stop in a long list of processes and rituals. The spiritual river trickling through the grounds and separating it into two distinct sides is the iconic Bagmati. This section flows very slowly during much of the year and with all of the activities on the banks and never-ending dumping of ashes, it is nothing short of putrid and foul. It remains however, a highly recommended spot to pay a visit to while in Kathmandu. You will leave with a deep appreciation for the fascinating and ancient processes that occur in religions around the World. It is one of the most significant Hindu temples of Lord Shiva in the world that is open to the public. (**note: a few specific areas are off limits to women and non-Hindus- signage is posted**) Allow for 2 hours. Entry fee in effect. Taxi from Thamel = 25 minutes."

The river where ashes are distributed is considered holy, but to the observer is horribly polluted, complete with trash, livestock wandering and dogs. Bodies are cremated on pyres located above the river and ashes spread into the river below. Families of the deceased gather with the body next to the river prior to cremation. There is a building located next to the temple that functions like what we would consider a hospice. When a person is deemed terminal and near death, they are brought to this place to die at a holy site. It is a place to be respected and one needs to be cognizant of this and act accordingly. You will be set upon by very aggressive folks trying to sell items on the way in and out.

I had read about it before coming and was very curious to see what it was all about. Most interesting was the religious cremations of Hindu loved ones through the complex. 24 hours after death, those being laid to rest are brought here and placed upon concrete tiers lined next to a small river which is supposedly sacred to all Hindus. After a brief ceremony the dead are cremated on the tiers in public with their ashes being spread amongst the river. Incredibly serene and interesting,this temple was probably my favorite side trip while in the city. The architecture of the complex is also very good and the sight/smells are unmatched. Beware of the entrance as their are many oxen and cattle roaming freely as well as vendors haggling for a sale. Once you enter take in the sights but if you want to take pics I recommend walking to the back of the complex and up the hill overlooking the temple as there are many others doing the same and it is more respectful. There are also a few asthetics within the complex willing to do a photo op for less than $2 USD if you're interested. It will cost you $1000 rupees o get in or about $10 USD.

Nepal being Hindu Rashtra must consider this fact.However there is no snatching of money by pandas and mandir is having 4 gates for Darshan.While at Nepal one must visit this revered place of Lord Siva and seek the blessings. The heritage is well recognized by UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES and dates back to 400 A.D. Lord Siva and maa Parvati visited this place to bless upon the devotees according to Hindu Shastras."

Apparently the sacred river is dirty because all things that are brought/used for the funeral ceremony must be thrown into the sacred river along with the ashes of the dead. The dead is fed with rice grain and sent off with tikka powder as final beautification, given drink from sacred river and covered in yellow cloth. Packs of natural oil are placed on logs of wood, unclothed and burnt just as is, in the belief human enters the world naked and thus, will return naked. Similar to what Job noted in the book of Job in the Bible - \"naked came I out of the earth, naked, shall I return.\" ! It is interesting to learn that the river is cleansed once a year by the head of towns, armies, police and locals. This part of temple is opened 24 hours, 365 days, very efficient indeed. A mask can be handy if you have sensitive sinus depending on the timing. If you were superstitious and not used to seeing the dead, it is better to just look from afar and leave before entering the final part of this temple. If only a way could be found to put the dead and his/er final belongings 'eco-ly' into the river........"

These two things happen side by side so you experience the emotion of life and death at the same time.It is a place you can take time to reflect on what is really important in life, and it is quite moving to see the rituals involved around death and yet this is a happy place to visit.

It's been around for more than 1700 years. So visiting it is like a wal through human history. There are gangs of monkeys and rows of fake holy men, preening their moustaches and demanding huge fees for photos. The paths along the river are an open air funeral parlor, where families cremate their dead loved ones. But the forest and temple complexes up bove are a tranquil place where real holy men meditate and pilgrims wander in peace. It's a bewildering, fascinating place. Worth a visit.

My only regret is not negotiating a fee in advance as I fear we probably paid a lot more than market rate but chalked that up to another lesson learnt as a traveller.It was especially facinating to see the whole cycle - the Nursing Home, the Hospice, the Crematoria, the Temple, the Widows area, and even the caves and chanting mourners up the river. Of course the river is filthy ( they cremate up to 50 bodies a day !) it was sad to see children trawling the river for valuables but this is not unique to the Temple, nor Nepal. The resident religious men will hit you up for a dollar or two for photos but its a small price to pay for a very unique photo !"

About 30 R is ok but they will look at it as though you have given them a piece of dirt. Don't worry about that. There are so many amazing things to look at. The burning pyres with families sitting around. The wrapped bodies laying beside the river, waiting to be put on the fire. This a place where the guide is definately worth every penny but fix a price first. We paid 500 R for an hour or so.

I have been there a couple of times, and I would HIGHLY suggest spending a few dollars and getting a tour guide to explain what is going on. On two occasions, we got a tour guide and were amazed by what was going on. The first time we paid a kid near the entrance to take us around and he explained who the people were and what the ceremonies that took place there were all about. The second time, we actually got to see the entire process from the time that a body is washed in the water of the river to the actual cremation. Once you understand what is taking place, it becomes much more spiritual. I HIGHLY suggest going by... and even if you dont see a cremation, the Sodu's are always fun to chat with"

It's a frivolous fact to see how the tourist shoot photos and more photos without thinking in this, it has became a show. My reccomendation is to watch this ritual with respect and silence, but above all, to visit the pagoda area in which only a few tourist are interested to go. You can go just going to the right following the path of the river, climbing the long tram of stairs.You will find a little pagoda town full of monkeys. Beware of them, they are WILD, dont show or give them food, otherwise they may attack you, I've seen it. Treat them like they are: animals. If you're lucky, you'll be able to see the monks that live there doing their tasks. This is a really pacific place where you can enjoy the peace of the swayambhunath."

Out of respect, we took very few photos and only when we knew it was ok. The families of the deceased light the fires and in most cases their relative has died only hours before. We hired one of the numerous guides to tell us about the temple and I would actually advise it. They do know a lot and its fun to talk to them. But negotiate a price before. A reasonable price is around ten dollars US, paid at the end. If your guide goes above and beyond, feel free to give a small tip as extra. Our guide was great, but if you don't like any that approach you, just waive them off until you find someone you like.There is a lot of history here and its worth a look."

But of course being a Shiva devotee i am a little bit biased and would naturally recommend Pashupatinath temple to just about anyone.But the first time i stepped into this wonderful place i was overwhelmed with emotions and it was something everyone should experience at least once in their life.But of course Non Hindus are not allowed into the main temples but once can always sit by the Bagmati River and get a different feel of the whole surrounding.Anyhow the first day i went bit too late thats like 8 am and its already crowded!So the 2nd day i went around 6 am and that was better as you can do your pooja at your own pace and maybe get a look at Lord Pashupati a while longer and then you can join the bhajan group and sing along Shiva devotional songs..All in all i would recommend this place again and again..Oh yea stay away from sadhus if you can! and you dont need a guide to go around the temple..just be cautious of your surroundings and take care of your belongings..the usual precautionary steps which applies everywhere.."

The main temple is open to Hindus only all other faith have to stay on the back side next to the cremation grounds. If you are Hindu then use a guide who can tell you the history of the temple and explain the meaning of all the writings and idols. It was a divine experience for us. If you are looking to buy the holy bead \"Rudraksha\" then go to one of main shops. Its all authentic but expensive so bargain."

At the main temple complex by the river, you can watch locals perform funeral ceremonies where the dead are washed with the water of the holy (though horribly dirty) river and then cremated on the river banks. It's a humbling experience to watch. Up the big stone steps on the hillside there are numerous stone shrines and at the top yet more, plus more temple buildings. You can also walk from here to Bodnath stupa (the Lonely Planet guidebook has walking instructions). If you arrive before 9 in the morning you can see more locals going about their worship and ceremonies, before the tourist crowds arrive. Allow a few hours for exploring the whole site.There are hundreds of monkeys in this temple but beware, some are aggressive - I was actually attacked by one for no reason other than staring at it! Also do not carry open food if monkeys are around, they *will* try and take it off you!An amazing place for both sights and culture, it's a crime not to visit this if you have more than a day or two in the Kathmandu area."

Our guide explained the rituals, then left us to observe or not, as we chose. While I realize this may not be for all, I found it interesting and enriching. One of the big reasons I travel is to experience and appreciate the cultures of others who are different than myself.

You see dead people about to get cremated or in the process, so the smell is strong and in my case I could see human remains burning, which is not unexpected to see. If you are too sensitive, then you may avoid this place. Also be carefull if you are travelling with children. I personally do not recommend it, since there are too many monkeys and it's easy to fall in many places. Remember, this is a holy place in Nepal. It might be a different world and you will see many things you won't understand, so keep in mind that you are the visitor, this belongs to the hindus and it's up to them to understand and judge, not to us.

We went in the afternoon - brutal sun - so don't leave without your hat, sunscreen and bottle of water - oh, and tho' I hate to admit it, a camera. (Discreetly used.)There is a small entrance fee and unless you are a scholar of anthropology/Hinduism, you will find it useful and more meaningful to hire a guide - shouldn't cost more than 400 rupees for about one hour if you are a couple/small family. And, if you feel its appropriate, at the end you can tip and round it up to 500/=. Always agree on the fee before you embark on your guided tour, The guide will show you the funeral pyres and this might come with a warning if the BBC were going to televise it - \"some scenes are graphic and unsuitable for young children\" - or those with weak stomach. We arrived to see a partially burned body - blackened feet clearly visible. Observing the rituals is undeniably fascinating - the washing of the deceased's feet in the river, wrapping the body in orange cloth, decorating it with marigold flower garlands, and even the ritual walking around the body after it has been lain out on the bamboo fire chamber before starting the fire - in the deceased's mouth. The bizarrely made up Holi men with their loin cloths are more than happy to pose with you for photos - for \"small money Madam!\" Although this is not called the Monkey Temple - that name reserved for another temple here, the day we went every monkey in Kathmandu had come for a picnic - they steal the offering plates (especially tempting since everyone puts out bananas!). Very entertaining. Allow about one hour. This is not a place you want to sit and eat and drink. You will just drink in the cultural of it all and marvel at our differences - Our cremations so private and planned down to the last detail. These cremations so spontaneous and taking place so openly. I came away and immediately started to google many things that the guide had told me to better understand (and check his accuracy).

The funeral pyres seem to be going around the clock, and the mourners endless. A guide is crucial in my opinion as most guide books only point out the basics, but a good guide will answer many questions about the rituals you see happening on both sides of the river.*Note: There are plenty of tourist police that are very friendly, but are busting unlicensed guides. I witnessed many groups losing their guides they paid as the tourism dept is trying to crack down on frauds. Licensed guides go through rigorous studies to insure accurate information and good presentation is given to all tourists. Make sure yours has a license. I can recommend Kumar Dahal which I used for multiple days and was very helpful and informative. kumarngo@hotmail.comPashupatinath and Bodnath Stupa are close to the airport area, try to work that into your plans when you are nearby; either coming, going or taking an Everest flight. I hired a car and driver through my guide, so I was able to hit these as soon as I landed and just left my luggage in the car."

Anyway, it is also worthwhile to observe the complex as there are interesting Hindu stupas and other objects to see and of course, there are what I suspect, fake Sadus (Hindu holy men) who will pose for photos for you for a nominal fee.

Many people think of Nepal and think Buddhism, but Hinduism is more common in the Katmandu valley and the average Nepali will tell you they're the same thing anyway. So its good to pay a visit to the holiest site in Nepal. It might be good to get a guide or any Nepali friends you've made to take you so they can explain some things to you. For those coming from India it may seem a bit small scale but its a well preserved site and has lots of interest. A word of warning though, they do cremate bodies and as with the rest of the world people at funerals don't think of them as something for tourists to take photos of. Whilst I was there once I saw a camera nearly end up in the river (not the place you'd want it to end up) when a passer by saw what the tourist was doing with his telephoto. So remember to act like a human being and you'll have a very interesting and fun time. Up the steps theres a game people play where you try to walk across the stairs to put your hands in a hole (whilst having your eyes closed) just one of the things you wouldn't expect in a temple complex.

Western cultures tend to isolate death from life, but there is no hiding it here. Watching the families publically mourn their relatives is always heartwrenching for me. I do not believe I would have the courage to watch my loved one's cremation, but seeing them endure it gives a glimpse into why the Nepalese are so strong of constitution. Sensory overload is part of the experience. Remember that you are not on a NatGeo shoot and the people at the temple are not actors. Even if you don't \"get it\", please respect that this is a deeply spiritual experience for many of the people there. Even so, while the Babas (Hindu priests) may allow you to take their photo or offer you puja (Hindu blessing where they put a powder mark on your forehead called a tilak), compensation in the form of a monetary \"offering\" will probably be required.Going to the temple with someone who understands the religion thoroughly will help you gain much deeper insight into the deluge of symbolism. If you do not have any Nepalese friends to walk you through, be careful to hire a reputable guide; not everyone who offers their services really knows what they're talking about, but they surely will be able to make something up! The fee gets you onto the grounds and from here you can observe the funerals and many of the murtis (statues), but you must be Hindu in order to enter the actual temple. Try not to be offended that a higher fee is charged to non Hindu westerners. After all, it is their religion and we are only spectators. I don't think I would take young kids here unless the family is Hindu or you are willing and able to answer an awful lot of questions and deal with the possibity of nightmares. It can be intense, especially if you are raising your children to be spiritually aware. It may be tempting to buy souveniers, but the prices are exhorbitant. Do not pick the marijuana outside the gate. It is not free and someone IS watching. The Babas may be smoking it, but if you try to buy it or pick it, you could end up meeting a plain clothes Nepali policeman in short order. This is not personal experience, but something that has been publicized in the Nepali papers in recent times. The 70s are over."

However, it was probably my favorite of the so-called tourist spots in Kathmandu mainly for it's humanity and reality. I saw my first dead body (2 actually) in a hindu cremation ceremony. I have a decent knowledge of buddhism, christianity and Islam but have never before witnessed any Hindu ceremonies, so it was a revelation of sorts. I visited Pashupati on my second full day in Nepal, so it was also somewhat of a culture shock, in a good way, it was exotic and fascinating. Because of the spiritual element it is not inundated with tourists taking photos and you have more of a sense of the local. While my review may not make the place attractive to visit I thought it was amazing. There is also a deer park with lots of monkey's too, which are always fun to watch. It is ancient and the architecture is great, however if you don't like steps it's not particularly accessible on a hot day."

Every hour or so a body was brought to the river banks were in the presence of family and friends the body was purified puting the feet of the deceased in the water. Also family and friends washed themselves with some hands full of river water. After that the body was placed on a wooden structure, carried to the nearby crematoria platforms, also on the river banks, placed on a stack of wood, and after a short ceremony, more wood and straw was placed on top of the body and set on fire. In the mean time the remains of other fires that had done most of their corpse burning were shoved into the river, the crematoria platform splashed with several buckets of river water until all washed down into the river and ready for the next corpse burning. Add to that the general rubbish and cows that make the river their home, while poor children try to find still something valuable in the river. You have to see the filth of the river to understand that after this unique experience we were also dying, but more for a good shower to wash ourselves mentally and physically clean. Still, highly recommended as a new experience and reference."

The temples are worth seeing but unless you are hindu you are not allowed into the main temple.The best view of the whole complex is from the steps on the other side of the river, opposite the Royal Ghats. You can closer views of the cremations if you wish from the bridge. Families do not seem to mind, but it is best not to be too intrusive. It is probably better to visit in December or January when the river is higher as there is a fair amount of rubbish in it which is revealed when it is low."

I was soooo wrong! Pashupatinath complex is truly amazing, fascinating and spiritual. Temple complex is located on the way to the airport, just few km from Thamel. There are plenty of buses and taxis around, but probably your driver would decide to wait for you. We did that and that was mistake - you should take your time and do not rush. Pashupatinath is quite large and there are so many things to see and experience. Entry fee for foreigners is 500 NRP (approx. 4,6 EUR).At the entrance (like everywhere in Nepal) there are \"local guides\" which can help you. I usually refuse to use their services, but this time somehow happened that I didn't... That was absolutely the best choice I could do. Our guy, Prabin spent with us almost 2hours explaining in perfect English all sights, traditions, rituals and habits. It was stunning and I couldn't ask for more. Plus his sense of humour and professional approach and knowledge made our day. If you decide to go there, I can provide you his contact phone number and he could guide you around for some acceptable amount of money (not set, but you can agree before). Going back to the temple it was really touchy to see how bodies are prepared and later burned on the Ghats... You can see that from the distance or just from above. I know that this may be sad occasion, but as far as I was advised tourists do not interrupt in these special private moments. It is up to you if you wish to take photos or not. It is definitely something different. Prabin explained differences between ceremonies and that was really fascinating.Main temple, Pashupati Mandir is not accessible for non-Hindu. I really didn't care that I wasn't able to visit main shrine (as I am not Hindu) - you have to accept that. All area and other accessible parts are worth visiting.Go there in the morning as this is less crowded and everything is just waking up. Incredible feeling. You're surrounded by hundreds of pilgrims, visitors, animals, Sadhus (holy-men or just \"commercial holy men\" as well)... I know that smell and dirt (\u201choly garbage in the Bagmati River) may impact your personal impression, but I was stunned with this place. Next time when in Kathmandu will spend there definitely few more hours...I only regret that we didn't have more time - 2h was far too short to see everything.

We stayed at Dwarika Hotel and were able to walk to the Pashupatinath temple complex in about 20 minutes and we mingled with the street venders who sold weird and wonderful food as well as tacky souvenirs.It is a sacred sight which was very rambling and there is so much to see.We were not allowed to enter the temple but this did not detract from our visit in any way. The main sites for us were over the bridge and on the riverbank. There are several cremation Ghats and a number of them were in use. I must confess to a morbid fascination of watching several embalmed bodies in various states of cremation. Why? I ask myself, I suppose it is so different from my culture that I found it so captivating. I was also captivated(again) with the variety of holy men who paint themselves from head to toe in strange bright colours. Not sure if this is a gimmick as they are more than happy to pose for a photograph providing you give them a tip!Plenty of other temple sights to see, be warned of the monkeys, they are everywhere and so many of them and it is advisable to not eat food as you are liable to lose it! The other warning is that the place is very dirty with rubbish strewn everywhere. However, do not let this put you off, this is a sacred hindu temple and an experience you are unlikely to repeat."

Even though the entrance to the temple is only for Hindus there is a lot that you can explore here. There are different ways to enter the area hence you might not see all of what the temple area has to offer depending on which route you enter. If this is you first visit I would suggest you enter through Gaushala (this is also where the main parking is). There are lots of shops here where you can buy antiques but be sure you bargain. If you are not a Hindu you cannot enter the main area but there is a path between the temple and parking which leads you to a place called \"Aryaghat\". This is just beside the river and cremations take place here. You can walk on the other side of river towards a small hill . This place is very spiritual. Lot of benches are placed here under the trees, where you can sit, watch the cremations and see the temple. You can also see around 50 small temples here which are in built in same fashion. From this place you can start a small hike (30 mins ) or so into the temple forest. It is basically just staircases leading you deeper into the forest. Legend has it that this is where Lord Shiva lived. The walk is beautiful and you can see deers jumping around. The finishing of the hike is at another temple (guheswori) so make sure you know your way back .Also in the evenings there is special ceremony beside the holy river where people chant mantras and they have lights and incense burning all over. This is just magical. The cremations may scare you off a little but if you want to know about Hindu culture and experince spirituality ... this is the place in kathmandu.the only restroom around is in the main temple area (non hindus allowed) . there is no restroom on the 30 min staircase trek so use it before you start. Also be careful of tourist guides here.....some of them are fake people just aiming at money."

This temple is the most sacred temple for Hindus and for non -hindus it is place to see funeral rituals of Hindus.the temple is very beautiful with hundreds of statues, small temples of lord shiva and other hindu gods scattered within its premises. The main temple is also a masterpiece with beautiful carvings. The two storied golden roofs, silver doors on all four sides, five faced statue of lord shiva, two bronze bulls (one very big and other fourth of its size) in front of the western door etc makes this temple very beautiful. As photography is restricted the actual beauty of the temple area is not much known by the tourists. There is another very significant temple near it, the temple of Unmatta Bhairab. Unmatta Bhairav is supposed to be the fierce menifestation of lord shiva. The idol of Unmatta Bhairav in the most stark nudity exposing the pro-creative organ in its most prominent form. this god is believed to protect the children, also who can not conceive for a long time comes to worship this god. There are such several marvellous idols. When climb down at the bank of Bagmati where cremation goes on, one can see a small but very important statue of KALKI or Kali (not goddess Kaali). This statue is half buried into the ground. This statue is said to be built during Kiratas period (fifteen hundred years ago) and believed that if this comes out fully the earth will be destroyed and new origin starts again. In the evening one can see special arti a(worshiping with lights and hymns) t the bank of Bagmati. I think guides should tell this to the tourists also besides death rituals. They can see the temple of kali (or Birupaksha) ..to see the statue I think they may need a normal binocular........ If possible good to try evening visit to see the Arti......P.S. Free entrance for Hindus while NPR 500 for non-Hindus"

We walked here from Dwarikas (which is easy) and eschewed the services of a local student guide (one of whom was particularly charming and would have been happy to escort us round for a mere one pound), preferring to wander round at our own pace (although we did have the benefit of a 'spec' pitch on the funeral arrangements from another prospective guide...).It's undeniably interesting but, as a non hindu, there isn't actually a lot to see other than the rather-less-than-environmentally-friendly funeral pyres. Foreigners are charged 500 rupees for visiting, which is supposed to go into an improvement fund, but we saw little evidence of this and, in the circumstances, this felt far too high a tax on the curious."

This was by far the highlight of our trip to Nepal. Though some people may find the thought of watching cremations disturbing, we found it to be culturally insightful. Non-Hindus are not permitted into the main temple, though there is plenty to see at spots that are accessible. We wandered around the complex for a good portion of the morning, before taking a seat in the shade across the river from the main funeral pyres. We watched from a distance as three bodies were washed, carried to the yak-butter covered stacked wood and then set alight. We then watched the process by which the wood, with the body, is burned down to ashes, following which the entire burning pile is pushed into the river. We then walked across the bridge to be closer to the funeral pyres, and watched as one deceased lady was laid to rest on the wood while her family removed her gold and other items.The smell from the burning bodies is not so bad, though you can hear the body sizzle as you would if you were at a BBQ. It is a good idea, especially if you are standing reasonably close to the funeral pyres, to carry a handkerchief to shield your nose and mouth. If there is a wind the ashes are blown in all directions and you certainly want to try and avoid getting ashes in your lungs.If you really want an insight into life in its purest form then you must visit Pashupatinath \u2013 for a most fascinating cultural insight the entrance fee of Rs 500 (around USD 6.80) per person is well worth it. This is real life \u2013 this is not a site staged for tourists \u2013 it may not be suitable for children, unless they are mature enough to understand what is going on, and it certainly is not a place for people for whom the thought of death is disturbing. With that having been said, I repeat what I said in my opening line \u2013 this was by far the highlight of our trip to Nepal, presenting an interesting yet somber insight into a culture that has existed for thousands of years."

            "review": "NOT A TOURIST ATTRACTION...THIS IS THE REAL THING!!!. since 2008, during three trips to nepal, i've visitedpashupatinath on many occasions, the most recentbeing march 2011, the day before the birthday of 'shiva.' if you enjoy photography...without doubt,this is your place. one could spend hours here,seeing the cycle of life take place right in front of you. hindu belief is that as soon as possible after death, the physlcal body should be burned, so thatthe spirit may be freed. this ritual goes on aroundthe clock here. families gather to say goodbye to the deceased, while the body is prepared for cremation...part of this may include many family members taking photos of the deceased with cellphone cameras... during this time, a priest from the temple prepares a funeral pyre on the other side of the complex. the body is wrapped in cloth, carried to the pyre, and then around it three times.often, foods are left near the body to accompany the deceased on their journey. family often have to fight-off pesky monkeys, who want their share of the fruit. the eldest son, often dressed in white, the color of mourning, will light the fire...andthe family sits peacefully, while the body is consumed. whatever is left, is swept into the river, where young boys then plunge in to recover anything that could be sold for a few rupees. there is nothing gross or gruesome about this...it's just death, another part of life...as it's dealt with by another culture. in fact, it'sjust another page in your book of education. if you conduct yourself with respect, you may take photos from across the river. unlike in veranasi, india...you're not beseiged for unreasonable sums of money. a telephoto lens of reasonable length will get you as close as you'd want to get. it seems as though most are here to pay respect to the dead, and to pray, rather than to scam tourists... in veranasi...wewere asked for 1,000 inr ($25usd), for onephoto...better to come to pashupatinath. also in the area, are 'sadhus' or hindu holy men...some of them are real characters, and very worthy of your photographic efforts. they'll expect money...so you should go to pashupatinath with lots of small bills...20 and 50 rupees...for this purpose. see the attached photos. if you visit from year to year...you'll see the same guys... this year i brought same photo prints...they werefascinated. there are guides available near the entrance on the airport road...i've never hired one, as i always move about with nepali friends. either can help you run the gauntlet of semi-agressivevendors near the entrance. the entry fee is modest...whatever it is...it's well worth it."

It was definitely not something I had expected to hear or much less be able to observe while in Nepal. But of everything we saw, this was probably the most intriguing. It very difficult to put it into words but it overwhelms your senses. Even emotionally, it's very overwhelming-if you're planning to visit Kathmandu, I would definitely recommend you visit this site-even spring for the few rupees to have a guide explain everything as you go through!"

Our guide told us that a high-ranked police official was under cremation. We observed the whole process, which was both shocking and interesting. It was the first time seeing this in a short distance. There are a lot of Hindus priest. They asked for the photo taking but I did not as I did not know if they would ask for $ after photo. Are they real priest or just some way to get tourist money. Who knows?Apart from these, as we are not hindu, we just can't see much. But, the entrance fee is Rs 500. It is pretty high when compared with other temples in Kathmandu."

You get the feeling that you should not be here from the moment you arrive, what is worse is when you take out your camera in some other worldly fascination to capture the scene and show everyone at home what you witnessed. The Hindu priests (called Bhattas) can be seen walking around the complex, do not (unless you want to at lease) make eye contact or take their picture without permission, they do not take kindly to this. If you want a picture simply offer them some Rupees and they will be more than happy to pose. Probably my highlight from Kathmandu, a must see in my opinion to all visitors of the city."

The first sight I remember was a body of a dead person carried by his family. I kept walking by a bridge and saw three bodies in fire. It was amazing to see all that people praying and burning their deads. And there was more, the other side of the river, that runs inside the temple, was habitated by Sadus and many, many monkeys.I didn't expect to find so many diferent and socking things in that place. If you are in Nepal, must go there."

It was absolutely fascinating. Much further in, our guide pointed out the river, rather dried up due to lack of rain. Further down...a cremation was going on. Quite a surprise, but still this being a holy place--we saw all sorts of human endeavors--from the celebration of life, to the release into the next world. I don't think it's for everybody, especially the squemish--but hey, it's Nepal. And at the least, it makes for incredible stories."

Well worth it but check em out before you commit. This temple is where the Hindus come to be \"released\" for lack of better words. The dead are burned here and their ashes tossed in the river. There is also a hospice there where the dying go as it's bad form to die in your home. I'd suggest reading up on the Hindu religion a bit before as it would make more sense. I wish I had. There are monkeys, holy men, shrines, deities, the whole works here."
