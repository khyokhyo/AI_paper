After three days of temple touring, I spent the day in activities with Backstreet Academy, an NGO that pairs interested tourists with local artisans for lessons, giving the artists a substantial part of the course fee. The afternoon was a sewing class for \u201cCement Bag Handbags.\u201d I thought we\u2019d be knocking off some simple shopping bags \u2013 I had no idea that the seamstress Sreemom and I would spend 4 hours together to make two reinforced computer bags out of Thai cement plastic bags, one of her designs. We cut pieces of Thai cement bags, black cotton for lining, thick clear plastic for the covers, and foam padding. The materials were cheap and recycled, but each part had to be measured, pinned, fitted, sewn on an ancient Brother sewing machine, with mistakes ripped open and fixed, and a zipper installed at the top. I am weak with a sewing machine and chose a very-ambitious project - Sreemon was astounding in her patience and ability to help me do as much of this as I was able! She is a true artist - what I learned from her is patience, attention to detail, and being proud of what you do. Great way to spend an afternoon, and I love the bags we made."

Plenty of designs to choose and was so happy with mine that I started using it straight away. She has a disability but still fosters 12 children through an NGO so nice to support her family. Was told by Backstreet Academy that they would take me from the meeting point to her house. They didn't mention it was on the back of a motorbike so being a 50 something woman I decided to have my tuk tuk dei per follow the guide. This wasn't a problem just a bit of a bumpy ride in the countryside!"

            "review": "Incredible Off The Beaten Path Experience. The temples of Angkor Wat were amazing but I longed to meet the local people and experience typical Cambodian life while in Siem Reap. I didn't travel half way around the world to isolate myself in tourist areas that strive to replicate home.Luckily I came across Backstreet Academy's website. They offered a lot of different programs ranging from a couple hours doing crafts or other activities with local artisans to full day excursions.We selected the \"Unseen Cambodia: An Unforgettable Day In The Countryside\" tour. We had difficulty booking on their website and also with email communication. We phoned the local office and they were very accommodating arranging the tour for the very next day.As promised a tuk tuk driver arrived at our hotel at the agreed upon time and took us for the 30 minute ride to the village. We were greeted by our host Heng Sophean. He is warm and welcoming and speaks English very well. I am extremely inquisitive and he answered all my questions throughout the day without judgement.The structure to the day was consistent with the itinerary detailed on the website (rice farming and processing education and tour, crab fishing, visit to the local school, lunch, crafting) and all were very enjoyable. What I did not expect and what made the greatest impression was how the members of the community, most of whom do not speak English, allowed us to have an intimate look into their daily lives. Upon request we were able to look inside a home and see what a typical family lives like. We saw how the children play together and the approach to parenting, the interactions and connectedness of the members of the community and we experienced the amazing warmth and generosity of the people feeling much more like relatives invited over for a family gathering than tourists on a purchased tour. The cost was $48 per person for the 3 of us which initially struck us as high, but it was well worth the cost as we were the exclusive guests that day, no one else, and received a very personalized and flexible experience. I highly recommend this tour if my description appeals to you."

I was the only student at that time, but there were three other artisans at work around the same table. Seeing their patient and skilled work was inspiring. My young instructor spoke English well. Since I had not taken a design along he asked me to select one from two/three simple options. The etching itself did not take too long and they cut and curved the finished plate for me. I wish I had taken notes on the steps regarding the acid bath and blowtorch. That went by rather quickly. Though my queries were answered, it would have been helpful to have had a written record. The finished bracelet was in my hands in about an hour and half.I appreciated this opportunity to learn and interact with the locals. Will definitely be checking out Backstreet Academy offerings whenever I travel in the future."

So I went here twice in one day. that's how cool it was.Morning- I was meeting up with a friend after lunch so I had some time to kill, I found this place on TA and thought 'what the hell'. got there and pottery was the only option at that time. signed up, paid $19 (I think) and started making a mess. Make sure you wear cloths you don't care if they get dirty, mine did and I looked silly all day. At the end of producing 5-6 pieces, you pick 1 to have glazed and for you to keep, while the other pieces are sold at the markets where the proceeds to back into the academy. This place is amazing and there should be more like it around the world!Afternoon- since I had such a great time earlier, after lunch I forced my friends to come and craft with me. I decided at that point to do the oil painting and paid $20 I think. I, apparently, am not the Picasso I thought I was but I still had a blast! The artist had only me at the time so it was really a one on one class. He was so kind and patient (when I was not at times).1) they bring your stuff to your hotel when it is dry, wrapped wonderfully for travel! 2) oil paintings don't dry quickly!Plan on spending a lot of time, most classes that I've witnessed were over 2-3 hours. and I would have stayed for more classes if I could but didn't have any more time."

It\u2019s apparent from the very beginning that she\u2019s passionate about cooking and that comes across when she is teaching you to make the various dishes. My favorite was the Bun Cha.

After a little trouble finding the shop (essentially don't follow the address sent to you that starts with st 30, trapeang ses village.. and ask your tuk tuk driver to go to the street behind Sofitel Angkor Phokeetra Hotel and from there you will see the shop) we were welcomed warmly and quickly got started choosing designs and getting stuck in. We were the only 2 in our group and so the guy in charge had plenty of time and patience for the both of us, he was chatty and friendly with excellent English. We chose custom designs and each had our names translated into Khmer to use on the bracelet. The whole process took around 2 hours (assuming this would be closer to 3 if the group was bigger) and was really interesting and enjoyable from start to finish. Absolutely would recommend this to anyone wanting to create a unique souvenir of their time in Cambodia or just travellers wanting to do something a little different if/when suffering from temple overload!"

            "review": "Overall Great Experinece. I participated in 4 Backstreet Academy classes: Stone Carving, Knife Making, Crossbow Making, and a cooking class. The first three were great, and the cooking class was a huge let-down. The carving, knife making and crossbow classes all followed a similar format - they let you start off the project with some of the easier parts, and then finish off the more challenging aspects themselves so you walk away with a nice product. My two suggestions for improving these classes: 1) Have a model of the finished product on hand, or have the instructor complete their own so you can see the next steps ( many times I wasn't sure where we were headed, such as how much to take off in stone carving, and would have been more successful and had more fun if I knew what the goal was of the current step)2) Include a little bit more teaching, such as a little history or some general tips (such as - don't worry about taking too much off in stone carving - we can always fix it OR make sure you don't take off too much - it cannot be repaired). Some general guidelines about the crafts would have made the experience more enjoyable. The cooking class was not good at all - it was supposed to be 3 hours, including a trip to the market and a cooking experience in someone's home - it was none of these things. It lasted a little over an hour, was at a restaurant, and there was no trip to the market. The cooking itself was not engaging at all: put the fish in the oil...turn it now...turn it again....okay it's done. And to top it all off, I was charged $1 for the bottle of water they gave me. The food was okay but the experience was terrible. I love the idea of backstreet academy, and with a little improvement in the structure of the classes I would give it the final star."

It was just me and my partner and we thought a lot of the preparation steps were already done which was disappointing (eg. the Amok curry powder was done so we still don't know how to make THAT) but we also know we couldn't possibly have done it all ourselves anyway so that might be something you do more of with more people. The food was great and it was a lot of fun - was a nice last day on our trip!"

My friend and I had one day left in Siem Reap after seeing all the temples and other sights we were interested in and weren't sure what to do with it when we came across Backstreet Academy on tripadvisor. We stuggled to choose a course with so many great options available but in the end we decided to make cement bags. The activity was held at the Angkor Handicraft Association Market, which was really interesting because we could see local craftsmen making beautiful pieces and could make purchases knowing where they were made and where the money would go. Making the bags took around 3 hours, and we each got one-on-one attention from our kind and very patient teachers the whole time. My friend and I were very happy with our finished products - she made a fanny-pack and I made a laptop case. (Though one thing to note - make sure you add on at least an inch to the dimensions of your laptop if you are making a case, I very stupidly only added half an inch and now my beautiful laptop case will be a file folder forever more.)"

When I went to check on availability of the class, they didn't have any openings. However, I noticed that the same instructor also did a soapstone carving class, so I sent a request asking if I could do the stone carving rather than the soapstone. I got an immediate positive answer. When I arrived, my instructor was running a bit late. However, that was perfectly fine, because I was able to stroll around the area and look at other artisan made crafts. The thing I especially appreciated was knowing fully that the money was going to real locals and not some imitation from China. They really had some beautiful craft items. In fact, I also purchased 2 Kromar loomed scarves that my wonderful guide was wearing on our temple tour. There was a significant difference in quality between some cheap imitation knock-offs I bought for gifts vs 2 cotton material hand loomed kromar scarves - a little bit more pricey.Mr. Khet Poy was extremely patient and helpful during the 3 hour process. It certainly is more difficult than it looks. I don't have any innate artistic ability, but found I could handle this. However, my fine motor skills sure got a workout between my thumb and fingers - all the chipping and carving that's required.Since I was his only client, he was more than happy to discuss the local politics and history (he certainly did his best, but my fault for not speaking khmer). Toward the end, he was able to finish the product for me and it came out looking very nice. Despite the heat - easily 38 celsius, he offered me water and we worked under a shaded area with a fan blowing. He frequently threw water on the surrounding concrete to lessen the heat too. Definitely worth doing! Plus you have a personal product."

The circus tells a moving, intimate story of one of the founders who suffered during the time of the Khmer Rouge but survived and came out believing in the future of youths. The circus also offers sessions where you can learn some of the acrobatics! Not only is the act world-class, but it's also part of an amazing, life-changing social enterprise. Definitely a must attend.-Day trip to Mount Kulen:Our guides were passionate and very knowledgeable about Mount Kulen and Cambodian history - he was able to go all the way to BC!! Both guides also went out of their way to ensure that we were comfortable and happy. -Sunset quad bike:Safety was of the highest priority here; a rider in front and behind come along to stop traffic on public roads and ensure that everything's all right. The country side was scenic, and the sunset over the rice fields with grazing cows was a sight to behold.Thank you Backstreet for providing top notch experiences with reliable services."

We really didn't know what to expect when we booked this all day tour with Back Street Academy, but I must say my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it all! We were met at the Handicraft Centre by our translator and guide Soy and a lady whose name I forget, we then proceeded to a local market via tuk tuk to buy our ingredients. After we had everything we needed and we had nose around the market, we went again by tuk tuk to the ladies restaurant/ kitchen to cook our food. We were given chef's whites, chef's hats and plastic gloves, everything was clean and came out of a fridge (however we did cook outside so there were a few flies but nothing too bad). We chose to cook fish amok, vegetable soup, banana flower salad and sweet potato in coconut. We were guided though each stage and once we had finished we sat down to eat our food (which I must say was excellent). After we had finished we asked if we could go back to our hotel and be picked up later for the final part of the tour. Our guide Soy made the arrangements and we went back for a few hours, we decided to be picked up at 5 so it was a bit cooler and at 4:45, he was waiting for us at the hotel with a tuk tuk! The second part of our tour took us to three different markets, the first was mainly vegetables, some meat and fish and some other interesting stalls like hairdressers, fan shops and even an eyebrow threading place! The second market and definitely the most real life experience I have ever had! Sold all sorts. We saw everything.... Live fish, cow entrails, red ants, fermented fish and even a wedding dress shop that sold steak! It truly gave us a look into Cambodian life. The final market was more light hearted and gave us a chance to try some street food, including some crickets, palm tree grubs and deep fried frog. I can honestly say we were stuffed and had a really interesting time! Our guide spoke excellent English and was a really enterprising, he was running the tour and finishing his final year at University. We finally got dropped off at a bar near pub street and completed a cocktail course, out host here was adorable, she was funny and quite dry! All in all a cracking day, we really did have a taste of Cambodian life, but in a well managed and safe way! A big thanks to everyone who hosted the day! "

Our guide/teacher/new friend, Soy created this course to help share with others, what he and his father used to do every day. He showed us how to to cast the net for the best catch, remove the fish from the net once caught, and how to spot where bigger (catfish-like) fish were swimming. He had become friends with the people who lived nearby the rice fields where we were fishing, so once we were done for the day, we worked with them to clean off everything we caught. We then spent the evening cooking up a delicious meal from our day's hard work and enjoyed the local drink (Angkor Beer, Black Panther beer and some version of Cambodian sangria) with our new friends. The woman of the house even cooked us jasmine rice from her own field as a special treat. A very memorable and special experience and a must do if you have the time!"

Our facilitator was a local painter who guided us with the right colours and strokes to use and gave us good tips when we were really bad at painting. We came up with decent art pieces after 2 hours and although we got our hands really dirty, it was all worth it. The session cost USD$18 and i felt it was worth it as they provided all the materials and paint. Session was also private which allowed us to work in piece and had plenty of attention from the professional himself. Do note that the place is a little far off from the city area and you would require some time to reach. Also to note that if you are doing the painting, you would require some time for it to dry before you can easily bring it home. Ours was still wet even after a day and we had some challenges hand carrying it back to out country."

As first time painters, we weren't expecting to produce anything spectacular but were pleasantly surprised by what we achieved under Mr Em's guidance. It was a great, relaxing escape after seeing endless temples and made our last day in Siem reap really special and unique for us. Mr Em was clearly extremely talented as an artist but he was also very talented as a teacher, having lots of patience with us (even though we took far longer than the recommended 2/3 hours). I have been inspired to keep painting when I get home! He even packed our paintings so they would stay safe and dry for our bus trip the next day. This is an easy recommendation, thank you Backstreet!"

Unlike my previous iron pencil course by Bunhak on 13th feb which was very professionally conducted, my lesson of ceramic pottery on 15th feb was the direct opposite. The teacher started doing the first 3 pieces for me, after which i attempted to complete the fourth piece by myself. He was not attentive during lesson and seemed uninterested in teaching. At the end of moulding, he told us we are entitled to send one piece for firing, but tried to sell us the idea of paying extra $5 for each additional piece. I wasnt interested because only 1 piece was done by myself which I chose, the rest are extras he wanted to earn. At the end, he passed us a receipt of $38 for 2 pax. I took out my phone to check the amount in my email and it was only $35.5, another attempt to slice a little more off us. We asked if we could see the firing process and he said no. So we left our hotel (Santa Clara) and room number (11) and was told the pieces will be sent over by 12pm on 16th feb. We didnt receive by noon on 16th feb and decided to walk over to check and were told the pieces were not ready. I gave the staff there a lecturing on responsibility and told them they could have called me or my hotel to inform us if they could not meet timing as we had a flight to catch that day. The products were finally sent over. They were all blue in colour. I realised then that I could have chosen my favourite colour for my piece which the teacher didnt bother to highlight to me. What a great disappointment. This experience is in great contrast to my iron pencil course which was fantastically, honestly, professionally conducted."

Three of us took 4 hours to complete an amazing memento of the Angkor temples. The teacher was very helpful because it is his own creation, using palm leaves as the canvas for your hot poker drawing. He was interviewed for a tv program the next day on artists in Cambodia. It is a unique technique and we had to practise first to get the correct degree of angle and time for the different parts of the drawing. Try doing Angkor Wat itself and do it before you go to visit. It makes seeing it so much more interesting as you hunt out the various lotus flowers that you KNOW adorn this amazing building as you have drawn them!

It's intuitive and very simple. No problems there. We decided to do the copper bracelet making (from metal to masterpiece) in the morning and the coconut carving in the afternoon. Both courses delivered what they said they would do in terms of the outcome. However the experiences themselves were quite different. In the coconut carving we were warmly welcomed. Of the 3 hosts that we had only one spoke very good English. However this was not a problem. She was excellent at making sure we had everything that we needed and that we understood what we needed to do. We were expecting to come away with a keyring made from coconut shell which we had carved and we actually came away with 3 each. Excellent value for money and based in a communal space where a number of different activities could be seen and participated in. Very worthwhile. The copper bracelet making however was a bit of a different story. The course was supposed to take 3.5 hours. We were there for a little over an hour. We both left having bashed out a design on a piece of copper that became a bracelet. However the host was very impatient (this wasn't the lady advertised as it is a family business. We think probably her son) and kept taking over. We were also sat outside a silver shop for our tuition so anyone coming to the store could just stand over our sholders and watch which when you're trying to do something fiddly is very disconcerting. Overall the experience felt rushed and impersonal. The end product was good and we have a nice momento of our time in Siem Reap. I want to finish by saying that we wouldn't hesitate to use the site again and would recommend to others. Especially if you are I Siem Reap. Please check out the Angkor Handicrafts Association. It's a not for profit organisation that allows local people to make, sell and show others how to make their crafts. Doing brilliant work and we really enjoyed it."

For more than two hours I was personally instructed by Bun-Hak who is the originator of this technique, and ably interpreted by Ve Koeu throughout the process. I handled hot pokers to burn the template, and tried my best. Eventually Bun- Hak tidied up my feeble attempts and then I filled in the easy parts. Looking at the finished product I am totally pleased and will hang this proudly on my wall at home. And best yet, I have happy memori s chatting with Ve Koeu and learning more about Cambodia Life. it is an experience well worth the time and money!"

We were deciding between oil painting and iron pencil sketching and decided on iron pencil sketching because we were intrigued with this art that only Bunhak knows and discovered. Bunhak is very talented. He makes it appear very simple but when it was our time to do it on our own, the results aren't as nice. The translator told as that is expected because Bunhak has been doing this for years already and it was just our first time doing it. I learned a lot in 4 hours. Bunhak laid the ground works and made us do simple tasks. Tip - bring gloves or a cloth as it is easier to hold the stick (as it is hot to hold). We were each given a cold drink of our choice (although we asked for coke light, there was only 1 available, and we got Fanta berry and orange instead. no biggie.). We finished in about 4 hours. I'm not sure if you can finish the whole thing in 3-4 hours without Bunhak's help or if it would turn out nice. In the beginning, I already told Bunhak that I want the Angkor Wat design and if he can help me with it. He is very generous with his time. He does not speak good English but the translators are there to translate for you :)The finished product is something you would want to have framed as it brings back good memories of the afternoon bonding with friends and Bunhak and our translators.Try this when you are in Siem Reap!"

This was one of the more genuine experiences we had in tourist driven Siem Reap and it was a joy and privilege to spend an afternoon in the studio with him. We picked the image from his collection that we wanted to create and he then drew it on the palm canvas. Then we worked to trace his lines with the hot iron tools and to learn the shading and texture techniques. He did a great deal of work on the pieces, too, with was so generous of him. We were able to see the refinement of his skill and take away two finished pieces truly worthy of framing. Highly recommend this class!!"

The cycling and horse riding were a lovely way of getting out and seeing the countryside and local villages. The cocktail night we went on was the last Friday of the month at The Wooden House when there is also live jazz and a BBQ and this would be a good night to go as there isn't as much atmosphere in the bars on other nights. Very unique cocktails and lovely teacher. We didn't fancy several hours of bug eating but we sought out the stall for the 'Fear Factor' challenge and tried one bug each!

We got our introduction to 3 Cambodian art and crafts usiing Backstreet Academy: Bokator self defence, crossbow making and iron pencil sketching. An English-speaking staff member met us at an appointed place to bring us to each activity. Where the artist, e.g. the iron-sketching specialist is not able to communicate exactly what to do, a translator is there for us. Every activity was booked online, with payment instructions clearly stated. Well organised.For Bokator, the self defence class, the Grandmaster is able to speak English, so no translator was provided. My son and I had so much fun we plan to do it again when we next visit Siem Reap. For the iron pencil sketching, it is not an easy task for a 10 year old. As a result, the bulk of the sketching of the picture chosen by my daughter was completed by the artist himself. Nonetheless, my daughter enjoyed herself as she learnt how to handle an iron rod and the novelty of drawing a picture through burning a material. As for the crossbow making, it was an eye opener for a city kid to watch the craftsman shape the bow and the materials they used. It was like watching DIscovery Channel live, for him.Overall it was good fun for the family to do activities together and the children enjoyed these activities more than touring the sights."

During our stay we made our own slingshots and learnt to fire them, made and set traps in the jungle, went fishing in a pond for our dinner, heard traditional Khmer music played by our host, went rice farming and helped a little with some cooking. The second was a flute making course where we made our own traditional Khmer flutes out of bamboo. For both courses the hosts were friendly, informative, helpful and professional. Our courses were real hands-on experiences and we enjoyed learning new skills and about the Cambodian lifestyle. We would recommend Backstreet Academy to anyone who is visiting this part of Asia and wants to learn more about the life and traditions of a different culture."

Our host was Mr. Mean Nhean and his family, a 30 minute motorcycle ride away from Siem Reap. We (two young adults, 19 and 21, and Mom) were picked up by 3 motorcycles which were conducted by the son, the son-in-law and the guide Gaad, very safe drivers. Welcomed by the entire family of Mr. Nhean. Fitted us with huge hats for sun protection before we went to the rice fields. Had so much fun working in the fields, picking rice plants, ploughing (had a wonderful bonding moment with the family while laughing our heads off at our attempts on plouging), planting rice. Then went fishing in the pond. No rods, just getting into the water fully dressed with Gaad and the son of the family, using a net for fishing. Great fund and successful. Then back to the house, cooked with the daughter who showed us how to fix coconut soup with lots of veggies, chicken and pork, then a famous Cambodian dish called Amok fish, then a banana coconut dessert. All three of us worked with her, carefully watched by the entire family, lots of laughing on both sides. Mother-in-law watching carefully! We chopped veggies and chicken, made coconut flakes from a coconut just taken off the tree, wrapped fish into banana leaves, cooked bananas and a lot more. We shared the meal with the entire family which was an honor for us. After lunch, the Dad played music for us on this traditional Cambodian instrument with 2 strings, the son playing a drum. What a wondrful day! We felt honored that the family let us get a glimpse of what their life is like, let us sit at their table (or rather on it, Cambodian style). Our gude Gaad was incredible. He explained everything along the way and was the interpretor for the day as well. Lots of fun. Made us laugh a lot. With a lot of thank you's and bows we gave our good-byes and were taken back to Siem Reap. What a wonderful day that truly connected us with Cambodia. We received VIP treatment and felt humbled and happy."

Firstly I want to be very clear, this was an amazing experience that I would not have missed for anything!After falling in love with the cement bags at the markets we decided to do the half day course and make our own. On arrival we got to choose our own design with some members of our group going for the cool satchels, but me electing for the safer lower end of the skill scale with the shopping bag. Even after thoroughly testing the patience of our teachers they never once stopped smiling, encouraging or, in my case, assisting. And in the end I managed to complete my simple shopping bag (complete with hidden pockets and zippered lining).What I did discover is that their is no way I would be able to sustain my family in this industry and that those skilled artisans who do this work day in and day out are amazing. Don't take the soft option and buy these from the markets, do yourself a favour and make a memory of your own and you might just learn a thing or two along the way."

With Knife making, the blacksmiths to the majority of the work, but you get to pound a piece of rebar into a proper knife and do a bit of the finishing as well. The Iron Pencil sketching is not easy, but the key is to pick a simple design. While Bunhok definitely helps a lot, if you have patience and pick a simple design (or if you're just really artistic and coordinated), you will walk away with an amazing and completely unique souvenir that you made yourself (mostly). Samon was very accommodating, facilitating our last minute requests and spending time with us at each of the classes. Having the chance to learn from and engage with locals was truly enjoyable and made us happy to have had our original plans fall through."

We started off visiting a local market which was further off from the touristy hotspots to buy two big fish in case we couldn't fish any, and then headed to a village near Tonle Sap (20-30min ride away from town). We then got down to business and learnt how to fish with a fishing net, which was very interesting but tough. The water was very low so we only found some small fish, but we also found small crabs! After an hour or so, Koy and the driver set up a fire with charcoal and wood and we grilled all the fish and crab. We talked about Cambodian daily life, and knew much more about Siem Reap as a touristy town but also the culture and religion and life of an ordinary Cambodian. Soy and the driver were very nice and spoke excellent English! It was a highlight of our trip, and through Backstreet Academy, the money goes to the local people whilst we could also get an authentic local experience.

It was really good fun and interesting to see how the local people live and what they do to survive.He was very patient and took a lot of time to teach us how to prepare the net and then throw it to catch fish. It was really good fun and we both really enjoyed our time. It was also the low season so we caught a lot of small fish. I'm sure in the wet season there will be a lot of bigger fish to catch. We also went to the local market to buy some fish and we grilled it up beside the pond (you won't get hungry). We also bbq the rest of the smaller fish to eat for lunch. There is a lot of cool water and beer so just bring yourself sunscreen and a hat.Really enjoyed this - it's something different to the temples in Siem Reap. Thanks Soy!"

Both were unique and fun in their own way.We had the same tour guide for the whole day and she helped make the experience memorable at the pick up location. She picked us up on her scooter and the three of us drove off (which was an experience in itself) to first class - kickboxing.The kickboxing instructors were fun and worked us hard. The class was in the middle of a local neighborhood so we felt like we were off the tourist path. The bracelet making class was one of my most memorable experiences in my Asia travels (and I have gone many places as I lived in Shanghai for 3 years). The instructor is a land mind victim who is really making a difference in his community. After having his mother die, his father abandon him, putting himself through college, and being rejected from a government desk job because of his disability he decided to use his frustration for good - and create a NGO that focuses on providing life skills to kids with disabilities from land mines. Hence his bracelet making course. Not only is his organization an inspiration, the class itself was fun and the jewelry we made was beautiful - I get compliments every time I wear it!Do one of these classes. It will be the story you tell your friends about your trip. Trust me."

We were given very limited colours (brown, dark orange, off white) and therefore we asked for more paints to be provided - green, blue, pink, red, yellow etc. We were told by the host then that they could not supply these colours as they had run out of them. For me this is unacceptable and if they are putting on an activity and charging for it they should have the materials required to allow you to create the designs you want. My wife wanted to paint a flower but couldn't as there isn't a lot you can do without green, red, yellow etc. We left after about 40 mins.The next day we received our mugs and the quality of them was terrible. Prior to them being fired they were glazed however the person glazing has clearly put on too much and therefore all of the colours have run into each other making the designs a total mess. We ended up just chucking the mugs in the bin.Avoid this activity - there are much better ones to do!"

The bracelet making was located at another organization helping victims from land mines make a living. If the host didn't speak good English, a translator was provided.

It is a very relaxing pace sitting outside and talking with our hosts whose English was certainly good enough for conversation. The family lives in the compound with several other families and there were lots of children playing around. It was a wonderful chance to talk about and observe ordinary life. They have more jewelry to purchase if you want (no hard sales pitch) DEFINITELY recommend this class and organization."

We spent 3 hous sitting under a mango tree coiling, wrapping, and ever so slowly, making our respective bracelets. He helped us whenever we'd created a mess (frequently) but otherwise encouraged our efforts and all the while we quietly chatted. We had the help of our interpreter but actually Muy Sua Bel could do quite well himself. We were completely relaxed and comfortable and this morning gave us a very different understanding of the harsh realities of Cambodia's past as well as the challenges of the present.

The host did most of the cooking and we chopped a few vegetables. The market where we shopped was fascinating, out in the counry, full of local women doing their shopping, but filthy. The host is the mother of ten children. Several of them were around while she cooked and we had a great time interacting with them.

We were looking for something to do other than temples, and booked the coconut shell carving at about 8 pm last night. We were confimed last night for a 12 pm session today. This is a little pricey, but well worth the money. My family spent about 2 hours cutting out little shapes (stars, bunnies, fish, etc) from coconut shells. as a previous reviewer said, the coconut is much harder to cut than I thougt it would be. My eight year old was fine, but my six year old struggled. Both the artist and interpreter were very patient and kind to her especially when she cut off her bunny head by accident and knicked her finger with the little saw that we were using :( After we cut out the shapes, the artist turned them into beautiful keys chains. My girls helped polish them after he sanded them and added his finishing accent touches. It was really fun to spend time making something together as a family. The place where we did the carving has lots of other classes going on and you can buy some really nice gifts. It's quiet and tranquil, quite a nice change from the chaos of the temples that we explored the day before. Assuming that the money really does go to a good cause, and I have no reason to suspect otherwise, it was definietly money and time well spent."

The cambodian boxing was taught by two young boxers, as funny as skilled in their art, so we had a really good time. The flute making was in the BackStreet Academy HQ, in a sunny courtyard and we learned a lot through our instructor, at the end we left with our flutes and the one he made and gave us as a gift ! Our facilitator and the BackStreet Academy manager also took a lot of time to talk with us between the two classes, it was great to spend quality time with them while drinking the good coconuts they offered us. This is a real human experience, an ecotouristic choice and a funny moment you can't miss."

Torn between at least 3 we opted for the wood carving class. At times we have sporadic WiFi in our hotel room, so after putting a booking in and paying the booking fee we got a little worried we didn't hear back, however with the WiFi being sporadic and us heading out to dinner we shouldn't have worried as an email was waiting with instructions. When we arrived we met our translator who was a lovely lady, and our instructor Ann. He was very skilled, and although he was a quiet man, he didn't hesitate to help hold the tools right for us as we banged away with the mallet, he had a lot of trust in us! At times I wish I could if just watched Ann work on a more elaborate piece, as when he took over to assist or show us what to do for part of the carving, I was mesmerised by his skill. After this taster I am really keen to try some other classes and even more so to develop my skill in Wood Carving. We were also treated with a coconut milk drink during our visit, that was a fantastic gesture, and it was tasty!Thank you to Backstreet Academy for providing these classes, and thankyou to Ann for sharing your skill with us!"

I did the Dessert Making class (http://www.backstreetacademy.com/course/details/339) and it was one of my favorite experiences in Cambodia. When people think of Siem Reap they think (much like I did) Angkor Wat, and that's it. I had a day spare though and wanted to delve deeper into the social culture. Sometimes the easiest way to do that is through food, so I decided to search online for a cooking class. My translator was so friendly, a great conversationalist, she answered all my questions. My host was very welcoming, organised and so talented - I have no cooking talent, so the fact she managed to get me to make something that tasted delicious was a miracle - well done!I was so happy I got to spend time with people who were local to the area, they were so warm and fun to be around and left me with great memories. I highly recommend this course and the Siem Reap Backstreet Academy."

We took the soapstone carving and iron pencil sketching classes and wish we had more days to spend exploring their other options. What a great way to spend time with locals! This organization is about creating access to markets for local artisans and communities that might not otherwise have an outlet for their creative endeavors or the ability to make a living with them. A big part of their mission is re-invigorating economically disadvantaged communities and preserving and maintaining local arts. The artists don't always speak a lot of English, so the organization assigns facilitators to act as welcoming hosts for the students and as translators. While working, we swapped vocabulary words with the instructor, shared food and laughter (lots of laughter!), and felt like we came away with new friends. We also did a LOT of our shopping in their marketplace area, which felt great since we knew the funds were going to support the communities that make the crafts rather than a lot of middlemen. There was zero pressure to buy anything, we simply wanted to after taking the classes. A great experience and a fantastic way to spend a day!"

Granted, our versions were all of the simplified variety, but it was still an amazing experience and one that had us hammering away whilst humming \"whistle while you work\". Okay, maybe not the last bit, but it was incredible all the same.The skinny: you have to allot about 3 hours for the whole process, so if you're on a tight schedule, this workshop is not for you. In other words, if you're in Siem Reap for just one day, you should skip this. However, if you're in town for 3-4 days, this is an excellent way to mix things up and take a break from the temple tours. The best part: the local craftsmen show you exactly how to pound out your designs, so even if you're doing only the decorative work and they're doing the heavy lifting with the butane flame, etc., your handiwork is what people see as the end-product. The bad:- you must be a little \"crafty\", i.e. not afraid to pound out your design with a hammer- it's a little slow-going at first- you can only choose the simpler designs as templates (because of time constraints)The good:- definitely a one-of-a-kind experience- really nice to have to final product in hand (that you made!)- totally cool to watch the whole process unfold in front of youSo if you're in Siem Reap and you're a bit templed-out, definitely carve out an afternoon and go for one of Backstreet Academy's workshops.

Having read the good reviews we had high expectations. However, we were pretty disapointed. When we got there they made us sit at the pottery station and basicly told us to push on the thing with our feet. The lady was then making the pottery with her hands. It went on like this with no explanation for a while and we had to ask if we could try ourselves. (The ladies where really good and it was impressive to see their work, but when it was our turn the translator didnt provide any explanations on how to do it and it always ended up being the ladies finishing the project). The website says the course is supposed to last 2-3 hours but after an hour and a half they said that it would be better if we finished now because \"the road gets silent\" ( the place where you do the pottery is 300m from the airport road so it is not a silent road at 6pm).I am aware that pottery isnt easy, and not something you can be succesful at after a 2 hour class, however having basic instructions and tricks would have made the experience totaly different.p.s. if they tell you to meet at the ankhor mundial restaurant, this restaurant has moved a few months ago so be sure to go at the one located on the airport street. I wouldnt recommend doing the pottery class, but backstreet academy seems to have other options so maybe try another class!"

We had a hard time deciding what to do. We took the stone carving course with Mr. Poy Khet and I am so glad we did! Most of the temples in the Angkor complex are carved out of sandstone, which is exactly what we used for carving. You feel a great connection to the people who built the temple complexes as you use a hammer and chisel to create something out of it. You also gain a huge appreciation for how difficult it must have been to create the vast temple complexes. We created stone flowers that could hold candles. It was a much better souvenir to bring home than anything from the touristy markets in the area. Mr. Poy Khet is a great teacher. He is very experienced and patient and will help you in any way he can."

At the same time, he shared his knowledge about carving,materials and even his carving life. Finally he carved my name on the Khmer alphabet under my art work. That is the best souvenirs I got in SR.while I was waiting for the teacher, they have someone explained to me about the flower that we are going to carve and why it got chosen, they were able to answer all my questions about sandstone carving. I am now more understand and appreciate the hard work behind stone carving. This experience keeps reminding me those carving I have seen in Angkor temples."

This place is fantastic and I highly recommend if you are looking for something a little different and want to spend time chatting with locals while you are at it.From my initial phone call, they were incredibly friendly and helpful, and when I couldn't find them, they sent a staff member on moto to come and meet me! I took the pencil sketching session as this was available at short notice on the day that I called, and it was a lot of fun, and a nice relaxed activity after a lot of time out and about in the heat. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit, my teacher was superb, and the translator was great fun and very encouraging. And I had a lovely pencil sketch to take away as a momento. They have a great set-up, I never felt rushed or stuck on a timetable, and it really seemed that they love sharing what they do with others. Next time I am back in Siem Reap, I will be back to try another of their classes! Really impressed with my experience at Backstreet Academy!"

The Khmer snack class I initially wanted to take wasn't available but they quickly emailed me back to tell me they had a cement bag laptop sleeve class. It was $15 and was supposed to take 3 hours, but since I was the only person in class I got it finished in 1.5 hours, with the help of the fantastic teacher & translator they provided! The ladies were a joy to spend time with and I am now looking forward to taking other BA classes in Phnom Pehn or Hanoi. Their location is a bit off the beaten trail but absolutely worth finding!

I live in Siem Reap and have now done a couple and they are a great time. The bracelet making was an awesome and fun opportunity to meet a local silversmith and I ended up with a really cute piece of jewellery. I did it with a group of friends and we had a good laugh about how untalented we were. With the instructors help though, the finished product always kinda works out. I've also done the oil painting, which again was a hoot. Of course you aren't going to learn how to be a professional oil painter in an afternoon at a cost of $12 -- what you will get is a tonne of laughs, the opportunity to chat with local artists and a beautiful souvenir that you can brag about back home. They are really good value for money experiences and offer a controlled setting to talk to Khmer artists about anything you want to."

Something very different in addition to the temples, floating villages and markets. This experience was hands-on, with two local artisans and our translator, who joined in as well. Our youngest at six years was a bit young to use the tools, so she helped out with various jobs rather than making her own carving, and she felt just as accomplished as the rest of us once we had finished our three key rings each in various designs. (I recommend a minimum age of around 8 to do the carving). It turns out that coconut carving is quite a skill! This will be a memory that will last a long time."

Going on an outing with Backstreet academy to visit a local crafts person in Luang Prabang, Laos provided me with an opportunity to experience something that normally I would have definitely missed.I\u2019d seen the multitude of local crafts displayed at the famous night market of Luang Prabang, but my outing with Backstreet Academy took my beyond that, to the world of the people who sell their crafts at the night market, day in day out, in order to make a living.I was collected at about nine o\u2019clock in the morning by a tuktuk that carried also my Backstreet Academy guide, or as they are called, \u2018facilitator\u2019 who explained to me our plan for the morning as well as the way Backstreet Academy works. In all the aspects of a trip we were on, BA\u2019s objective is to let the local people involved in their activities benefit from it financially. This applies to the crafts person hosting the visitor, the facilitator, who\u2019s a young Lao student trying to improve language and interaction skills with foreigners as well as making some cash, as well as the tuktuk driver who\u2019s ensured to, working with Backstreet Academy, have a steady amount of work. I\u2019d learned this before on the BA website and it was the main reason that I joined Backstreet Academy on one of their outings. After a friendly chat with my facilitator we arrived at the place of Ms Ga Thor, a kind young lady who was going to be our host for the next few hours in which she would show me how the cute and warm house-slippers that I\u2019d seen displayed everywhere at the night market, are made. During the process it was fascinating to see how Ms Ga Thor lives and learn a little about her life. At 30 years of age she is the mother of 4, her oldest being 15. She lives in a 5 by 8 metre one-room house in which 3 corners are occupied by beds that, at night, accommodate the 8 people living in the house. In the fourth corner is the kitchen.In the middle of this Ms Ga Thor has her hand-powered sewing machine which is essential in the production of the house-slippers. While neighbours and relatives gathered around to watch us, Ms Ga Thor showed me how to make house-slippers, demonstrating that it was not so easy, by letting me having a go at it. I was happy that in the end she rescued me from my poor attempts to work the sewing machine to produce 2 lovely looking house-slippers which she then presented to me. It had been a worthwhile undertaking from the moment I had stepped into Ms Ga Thor\u2019s home but after receiving the house-slippers I was honoured with another gift when Ms Ga Thor handed me, and put a pretty hand-made bracelet on my wrist. From my visit to Ms Ga Thor it was clear that she and her family do depend greatly on each little bit of income that they can gather, and the idea that some of the money I paid for this outing (which I thought was little) goes to Ms Ga Thor (and, not to forget, to the tuktuk driver as well as the facilitator), made the whole experience for me a very pleasant one.\u2018Good show\u2019 Backstreet Academy."

We went to Angkor and saw those temples, we went to the markets, we even went hours out of the city to see other temples and ruins. So for our last day, with our bus leaving in the evening, we quickly searched for something different to do for a few hours during the day. My sister found Backstreet Academy on Tripadvisor. We quickly read over the reviews and saw that everyone seemed to really like it. So we sent an email the night before and didn't think that we would get a response in time for their 9am class the next day. When we got up the next morning (without any plans of what to do) we received an email from them telling us that they could take us for the cement bag class. Our tuk-tuk driver had a hard time finding the place, he ended up having to call them and they directed him there. They stood outside and greeted us. My sister and I each had a lady help us do our own project (i made a bag and she made a laptop/ipad case). After talking we found out that the ladies were sisters too. There was also another girl whom was like an interpreter. She was really helpful in explaining and answering our questions. They were all so nice and friendly. They provided us with water bottles and let us do everything on our own. The class was about 3hrs and once we were done everyone clapped and you just feel so accomplished. They had a tuk-tuk driver ready to bring us back and they even gave us key chains. After talking to the program manager here I realized that they have these classes in other cities as well. If i were to visit them I'd definitely go to a class. But for now, I definitely recommend these people here at Backstreet Academy in Siem Reap. They're just so genuine and friendly!"

Our hosts/instructors were much younger that I had expected (early 20s), yet were very attentive and patient. It takes longer than the advertised time to complete your work so it will probably be finished off by the instructor (they a happy to do this for you). The pick up point for the leather carving is the Entrance of Cambodian Cultural Village yet it is best to stop across the road. That is where the course takes place in the Batiment Khmer d' Angkor Thom. The criticism I have of the course is that Backstreet Academy have contracted with the school to have the visitor make a overly ambitious puppet. It is very time consuming and difficult to display once you get it home. A smaller carving without the sticks would be more practical."

One by one, the bartender got us to sample all the spices we would be using before we got onto the drinks.

We made four drinks, three we had a hands on training while the fourth was pretty much free and easy. I really liked that arrangement where the structure was well balanced. The cocktails themselves were delicious, every one of them. Except I would have personally put in an extra shot or two in mine. But that being said, all of them impressed me thoroughly.

The cocktail class is in a nice little outdoor bar right in the middle of town. All the ingredients and equipment were set up ready for us when we arrived, and as well as the teacher a representative from Backstreet Academy was there to welcome us. We learned how to make three cocktails, all of which were delicious - especially 'Tamarind Sauce'. The teacher spoke decent English and was really good fun. It's also worth mentioning what outstanding value this was - to order the same three cocktails from the menu would only have cost $1.50 less than taking the class!The following day we did the Cement Bag class in the morning. Actually, we had been supposed to do this the previous day, but our tuk-tuk driver couldn't find the meeting place, and after driving around aimlessly for an hour we had to give up and return to our hotel. I then called Akash at Backstreet Academy, who was extremely apologetic (despite the fact that the problem was in no way their fault) and arranged for us to do the class the next day at no extra cost. He also sent a staff member to meet us at our hotel to prevent the same problem occuring. As the regular instructor was not available, we were taught how to make the bags by two sisters who were doing their first lesson, although I would never have guessed this if we had not been told, as both were great. Throughout the bag-making process, two staff members from Backstreet Academy also helped out, and Akash was also present (and told us lots of interesting information about Backstreet Academy's history and plans). From start to finish the class lasted about 3 hours, by the end of which we each had a great new bag, and were also given a matching wallet and purse, which was a lovely surprise.Overall, we couldn't have had a better experience with Backstreet Academy - everyone we met, staff and teachers, were incredibly friendly and very professional. Our only regret is that we didn't have time to take any more classes, but if in future we visit any of the other cities where they operate then we shall certainly take the chance to learn some new skills! Many thanks to Akash and everyone at Backstreet Academy!"

I felt like I was taking a long time, but the student teacher and Samon were so patient with me! I highly recommend this experience for anyone hoping to really learn about cultural aspect of Cambodian culture and to give back to a good cause!This backstreet location just opened up a month ago so that's why it only has 4 reviews. I expect it to really take off over the next few months!Please come and participate!"

The business was family run and after a bit of ogling in amazement as I watched one of the assistants etch out an intricate classical design for a wall piece, I got to work on my mini piece of art. I brought my own design and step by step, with the guidance of my teacher, I came out with my own handmade bracelet. The feeling of satisfaction put a smile on my face. Overall I had a fantastic time and would highly encourage others to check out and select from Backstreet's offerings for a unique experience."

            "review": "Rewarding Fear Factor Challenge Experience. The Fear Factor Challenge experience was interesting in an unexpected way.My partner's biggest fear is insects. However, he decided to test his limits by signing up for the Fear Factor Challenge. Seeing him so excited about his experience made me excited too.What was unexpected was that the experience of watching Mr Ratana (insect chef) clean, trim, season and fry his insects was very appetizing. So experienced he looked as he fried his insects, it made the insects feel no different from other regular food. Smells really good with the spices too. My partner did the unexpected and partook of the crickets. And... Enjoyed it. And there after went on a rampage with the tarantula and the grasshopper. In his words, \"After you get over the initial shock of looking at the insect and you put it in your mouth, it's actually quite tasty.\" I diligently took mental notes of all the ingredients going with the insects and helped to do the marination of the insects myself. It was an interesting experience. I would be able to fry crickets now if anyone tasks me too! Bring it on. Haahahaahah...The whole experience was very well organised and felt really special. Transport was arranged for us and we travelled through a maze of Cambodian houses before arriving to Mr Ratana's place. Its completely unlike the typical tourist experience as it felt like Mr Ratana is sharing a part of his daily life with us. So much more genuine and personal.Whilst Mr Ratana was teaching us how to fry the insects, his wife was at the side trimming the wings of grasshoppers one by one. And his super cute son was playing with all the live grasshoppers. Its fun playing with his son. Not at all shy and though we didn't speak the same language, fun is an international language I suppose.The facilitators at Backstreet were really nice too. They got us a big bottle of water on their own accord. Samon from Backstreet shared a funny personal story about how he used to catch grasshoppers to sell to hawkers such as Mr Ratana. The facilitators were really fluent in both Khmer and English, so they could translate all our questions to Mr Ratana and translate his answers back to us.My partner became quite addicted to crickets in specific after this rewarding experience. Even craving for crickets to go with wine! Now it's time for Backstreet to come up with a cricket catching course so I learn how to get most vital ingredient to fried crickets. :)"

            "review": "Delightful evening with Backstreet Academy!. After a tiring day at the temples, me and my partner stumbled onto Backstreet Academy's Khmer cocktail class and thought it might be a nice way to unwind the evening. We were not sure what to expect but decided to go anyway. We contacted them on the day itself and received a prompt response with a confirmation for 6 pm. Communication was not a problem and the location was easy to find. Once we arrived at the place, preparation had already been made and we soon got the course underway. The experience I must say was brilliant. Spices and alcohol mixed together to create a wide mix of cocktails. Some refreshing, some spicy and some simply twists on classics like the mojito and singapore sling. Nonetheless, every one of the cocktails we made delighted our senses. The aroma and the taste was unlike anything you would get out a of glass of cocktail. The instructor, charming and professional, was very knowledgeable and friendly too. Go to the temples, get a massage and end the evening with this inspiring experience!"

Everyone was very charmng and we really enjoyed our afternoon in the company of the massage team who clearly knew alot about the topic. However we think more work needs to go into the course which was more of a demonstration to show us a full cambodian body massage. Although interesting, it was too much to learn in a few hours and I would have no chance of repeating what I saw. That said I would recommend backstreet academy who clearly have thier heart in the right place and will do thier best for you."

            "review": "Unforgettable one off experience- fear factor challenge. In one word, unmissable. If you get the chance I could not recommend this whole company highly enough We did both the horse riding and fear factor challenge in Siem Reap. The horse riding was very professional with the guide fluent in English and very helpful taking us around the town and rice fields for an hour. Fear factor challenge was a highlight with us being taught how to prepare, cook and eat tradional insects by one of the street sellers at his home. It was totally different to any cooking classes we had seen before and so much more authentic. The bugs were totally differerent to what i expected too, tarantulas now a firm favourite. The cook and translators were very knowledgeable and helpful and a good laugh too. Would definitely recommend this experience, great fun and a total one off."
