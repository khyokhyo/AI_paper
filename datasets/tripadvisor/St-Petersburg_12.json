I think it is an excellent way to explore the Russian countryside and get out of the city. There are lots of different areas in Pavlovsk Park which you can explore. We used the audio guide to walk around. Also Pavlovsk palace is a fantastic building with lovely architecture. I am sure you will come back to your hotel with many bright memories!"

This is a great architectural treasure filled with many fine pieces of artwork. The grounds are lovely and make a wonderful stroll on a nice day, but they aren't as extensive as some other places around the area. Still, very much worth a visit if you have the time."

Catherine the Great had the Palace built for her son Paul and his wife Maria Fiodorona it sharply contrasts to the glitz of her Palace and in my view remembered not just for its collection of clocks but chandeliers...look up and marvel! Another striking feature of this Palace is that in every room there are pictures to bear testimony to the Nazi destruction and the extent of the restoration programme. It is a Palace Park complex...the grounds are less formal and in winter it is great to take a troika ride through the Park"

But be sure to head out early to see everything in one day ... as there is a lot to see. The gates to Pavlovsk Park are immediately across the street from the Pavlovsk Train Station. Buy tickets at the gates to enter the park and grounds. A beautiful walk through the park leads you to the magnificent Pavlovsk Palace. Separate tickets are needed for a tour inside the Palace. We had no problem getting tickets for the interior tour. Dramatic interiors. Beautiful grounds. Pavlovsk Palace is not as grand as Catherine Palace, so if you only have time for one, I recommend Catherine Palace. But Pavlovsk Palace is certainly worth it. Also, take a taxi between Pavlovsk Palace and Catherine Place. The short 10 minute ride only cost us 500 RUB and was much easier than the train or bus."

It is nice to escape the relentless gilding of the Catherine Palace and see the much more restrained neoclassical style of the late 18th century to early 19th century. Interestingly, the stunning illusionistic ceiling in the largest room was designed but never painted during the time of the Tsars. It was painted for the first time by Soviet artists to the original designs. The Soviet restorers are probably the finest in the world in the 20th century."

            "review": "Beautiful, Ornate, and The Ability to Enjoy It. The tsars from Peter the Great onward built or expanded a series of impossibly ornate palaces outside of St. Petersburg. The Catherine's Palace in the Tsars' Village and Peterhoff are perhaps the largest and fanciest, but this one is equally beautiful but has the benefit of being far less crowded.Pavlov is Russian for \"Paul,\" who was tsar from 1796 to 1801. Not a successful tsar (in fact he was kind of an odd duck and was killed by palace guards), he stood between Catherine the Great and Alexander I (who defeated Napoleon). Worse, Paul's relations with Catherine, his mother, due to lingering and likely correct concerns that she had been complicit in his father's murder.This palace is seeped in that unhappy history, plus later events, but that doesn't detract from the fact that this is a magnificent structure. In World War II, the Nazis first occupied it and then set in on fire during their retreat, destroying most of it.The palace is amazing on two levels. First, it is quite beautiful with many exquisite rooms and decorative items. We've heard others comment that this is their favorite of the Russian palaces. Second, it is an amazing testament to the preservation and restoration efforts of the Russian people. When war broke out they cleverly preserved many artistic works through careful selection and either sending samples off-site or even burying them outside so deeply that the Nazi's never found them. After the palace was torched, they spent decades restoring portions of the palace that were basically ruins. These rooms today are as stunning today as they were in the early 1800s.There grounds are designed like English gardens with pleasant walks and architectural features.Because this palace is smaller than some of the other attractions, it is not on the \"A\" list for tour groups and is therefore much less crowded, which we liked. We would still recommend using a guide because there is a great deal to see, many of the pieces warrant special consideration, and the palace's tortured history is worth hearing as you are actually viewing the rooms.Pavlovsk is a good choice to visit and easy to combine with other sites in the area."

While not as spectacular or overwhelmingly decorated as Petrodvorets, Catherine's Palace etc, this residence is, I find, more graceful and human-sized. It also houses a great collection of antique statues from Pompeii and around, as well as less prominent paintings of all periods from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, all in its suite of \"theme-decorated\", stylish rooms. The park is also well worth a pleasant walk - an English structure filled with Russian flora, some squirrels and a few decorative monuments."

Not exactly cheap, but good value to fully understand what you are seeing and to by-pass many of the queues. A small group also meant that we could take more time in every place.Pavlovsk was built for Czar Paul 1, the son of Catherine the Great whose much larger palace is nearby. Paul's place is a much more intimate palace, still spectacularly opulent but with a more homely feel. There were also less tourists here so if you had to choose one place to go in Pushkin, I would recommend Pavlovsk.It was extensively damaged during WW2 but has been lovingly restored using photographs and expert craftsmanship. A lot of the original works of art were buried for safekeeping, and recovered after the Germans left.There are a lot of original 1st Century A.D. roman sculptures and the portrait gallery contains an original REUBENS.Look out for the Cupid painting whose arrow follows you around the room."

Remember that most is a recent full restoration as it was almost gutted in the war. The painting in the large ball room was apparently reconstructed from drawings and never actual there in the original.

In terms of proportion and relationship to the natural landscape, the palace that Catherine the Great provided for her son, Paul, outshone her own. She gave Paul the land, six kilometers from her own estate (perhaps to prevent him and his wife from hanging around and being in the way), as a wedding present, and the palace grounds now make up the largest public park in the country. The palace sits on a grassy hill above a small lake \u2013 or large reflecting pond. Closing time was nearing, and inky clouds were gathering overhead, so we didn\u2019t go inside the palace; but strolling around the circular courtyard led me to appreciate the elegance of its graceful design and how impressed 18th Century visitors must have been when their carriages drove them to the entrance."

It was not possible for us to visit the Catharina Palace in Pushkin, mainly it was too crowded (you to be part of a guided group, or book well in advance). But 5 km from Pushkin is the Pavlovsk Palace, with in comparison few visitors. It was built by Tsar Paul 1, and it is impressive both outside and inside. The different wings and floors each have a different style (Italian, French etc.) and the palace is completely furnished. There is also a large park with small rivers, many bridges, pavilions etc. where you can have a long and relaxing walk.The easiest way to get there is to take minibus (marshrutka) K299 that leaves near the Moskovskaya metrostation. There may be other minibuses as well, try to find out before you go to Moskovskaya (very few Russians speak English)."

It is the tradition which comes from the XIX century when Johann Strauss, the world famous King of Waltzes , gave the regualr performances. You won't regret about the wasted time, taking into account the fact that the their price is very cheap, what's more. the concerts in the Round Hall are free.

The palace is lovely but needs restoration as you can see paint peeling,etc. Sadly, there aren't funds for this. But the interior was lovely and you really get a sense of what it had been like. There were also displays of photos of how the palace looked post WWII which was really sad. It is great that some many items were rescued and not found by the Nazis. The park was nice but we didn't explore much because of the weather. I think I would like to come back in the autumn when the leaves have changed - must be stunning."

If you want to get away from crowds and hordes of people, Pavlovsk is a great choice.How to get there? We went by taxi. We told our receptionist at the hotel that we want to go to Pavlovsk and they ordered us a taxi and told us beforehand that the price would be RUB 1500 ( $ 25 US$ ). Considering, Pavlovsk is 19 mi outside St Petersburg, this is not bad. We arrived at the park entrance of the palace and had a beautiful walk through the park and along the canals. There are directional signs to the palace.There are sumptuous rooms on the middle floor of the central building. Especially nice is the bedroom with a beautiful bed and matching silk wall coverings. Although, the palace was destroyed by the Germans in 1944, almost all furniture, clocks, and objets d'art were previously removed from the palace, because the Russians were expecting the Germans to take it over, which they did. The Russians rebuilt the palace after the war. When you view the left wing, previously occupied by Maria Feodorovna ( Paul I wife - you have to buy another ticket to view them), we had the feeling like she just left the rooms not long ago. The rooms are small and cozy with beautiful objets d'art. Afterwards, walk back through the park or explore it further ( it's beautiful). At the same park entrance there are usually a few cabs or you can take a marshrutka ( small white buses that stop there ) 2.5 mi to Catherine Palace, which we did. A taxi from there back to St.Petersburg cost us RUB 2000 ( US$ 32 ). We negotiated the fare beforehand with the driver - they all understand numbers. PS The nearby Alexander Palace was closed for renovation, but the park is open."

            "review": "one of the last imperial palaces. Easily accessible from St Petersburg by train:One of the last big imperial palaces in Russia, this time in neoclassical style. This palace has also been heavily affected by the World War II, but restauration has done a superb job. Not as overrun as Puschkin or Peterhof it offers (together with Gatchina) a nice alternative. By train accessible from St Petersburg roughly each 30 mins, it is also just a station after Puschkin, so you could combine a morning trip to Pavlovsk and then the afternoon in Puschkin (there the palace opens for individual visitors at 2 pm, but since tickets are timed, you might want to prebook Puschkin tickets onine). It can also be done in the opposite order. All rooms are richly decorated both the private apartments as well as the state rooms. I wasn't particularly interested in the museum of fashion, so cannot judge this part. Pictures can be taken inside after paying for a fee (which I personally think is totally worth it). The park is not as over the top as in Peterhof and Puschkin, but still nice for a walk through. If you should come by train, the 30 minute walk leads through the park. I personally visited Pavlovsk and Gatchina on the same day, but then you need to switch between different stations in St Petersburg and you need to be ready for an additional 40 minute walk in Gatchina between the station and the palace, so that combination is not for everyone."

I visited when a flower show was going on in the park. that was so cool. the courtyard was nicely decorated, there was a stage, a flowery fashion show, kids of the town had decorated their bikes with flowers and were riding in a procession of which the tsar and his wife were the highlight. the park is never ending.

We did this as part of a tour with an independent guide, who had a driver and we did this, Catherine's palace and Peterhof gardens in one day. It was a full day but well worth it. We were here slightly out of season in early May and it is the best time to come. No queues, in fact anything but. So pleasant to be able to walk around unhindered.You will be asked to wear overshoes to avoid damaging the original floors. Also, you are not allowed to take pictures unless you buy a \"photography ticket\".

The Saturday seemed fine, The morning at The Hermitage, lunch at Vladimir's Palace and then on a coach to Pavlovsk Palace. Things started to go awry when those who had opted to tour the Vladimir Palace instead of lunching there, then decided to stay on for lunch. We therefore started an hour late and then ran into the most horrendous traffic jams. We therefore arrived very late. Thankfully, the Director kept the Palace open for us. Three hardstone figurines had been taken from the vault so, upon arrival, we were taken in a side entrance to go immediately to the library to see those. We then had a very quick tour of the Palace. We did not do it justice, but, I do not think anyone visiting would certaoinly not be disappointed. It is well furnished and was a joy - but, not when you are rushing! If time is scarce in St Petersburg it would come after Catherine and Peterhof Palaces but before Alexander.

This palace was the elegant, charming and gracious home of Emperor Paul I of Russia and his incredible wife, Marie Feodorovna\u2026a role model for all women. The other palaces in and around St. Petersburg are grand and breath-taking; Pavlovsk is all of that and more. It is easy to envision Paul and Marie raising their large family in this charming home which is surrounded by gardens and a most incredible park with nooks and crannies and incredible vistas, pavilions, streams, bridges, look-outs\u2026. Plan to spend an entire day in the Park and it will be time well spent. Plan to spend another day in the Palace and you will see art and artifacts which are mind boggling. Pavlovsk Palace and Park will provide you with an unforgettable glimpse into Russia's fascinating history and its people."

Its cozy, natural, impeccably beautiful and different for every room you see. Someone here on Tripadvisor rightly said: you can just move in and live there! True as it sounds. One advice: beat the crowd and visit in a.m., when the mainstream storms the sights in Pushkin. Somehow everyone gets to see it only as a free compliment to Kathrine the Great Pushkin Palace, as it is nearby by modern standards. Do the opposite and do enjoy!"

In summer they have a little train tour around the park, and in winter you can ride a \"troika\" - traditional Russian sleigh with 3 horses, slide down the hill, play snowballs and so on.Try to get there by suburban train and then get a little minibus to the museum from the train station (almost all of them have the word \"Pavlovsk\" written on them in English). The train station is a part of THE FIRST RUSSIAN RAILROAD ever built (it was between St Petersburg and Pavlovsk). Back in the day it was considered so awesome, that even the famous composer Strauss gave concerts there for quite a while, so it's worth a look."

The palace of Pavlovsk is not that 'posh' or luxurious as the Kathrine's palace in Tsarskoye Selo (now -Pushkin) is, or the Winter Palace (the Hermitage) of Petergoff are, It is a palace, yes, but it's also a nice home built and decorated with a phenomenal taste of the owners (then Grand Duke Paul (future Emperor Paul I and his wife Maria) and the Russian Architect Andrey Voronikhin. You certainly want to stay there for a while. Ruined to the ground by the Nazi in the WWII, it was completely restored by the devotion and commitment of one young lady (at that time), whose name was Anna Zelenova. She became the director of the museum just before the war time and she managed to save most of the valuables from the palace and then persuaded the authorities to restore the palace, although some thought that it was impossible to bring it back to life. Moreover, most of the trees in the park were cut down and it was turned into a mine-field as fascists were afraid of partisan attacks. Zelenova was the first to enter the place with the very first soldiers of the Soviet Army, liberating it and immediatelly set out to work. This year is her 100-anniversary. She literally laid down her life to Pavlovsk and although she passed away quite a while ago, this is a person worth remembering. The romantic park in the English style is now fully restored too and full of flowers (when we were there many lawns were covered with snowdrops), various birds and numerous squirrels which seem to be very busy but rather friendly. Pavlovsk was a source of inspiration for Johann Strauss II , who spent a couple of summers there as a guest violinist and conducter, had a romance with the Russian noble daughter Olga Smirnitskaya, whose parents refused to give their consent to their daughter's marrying Strauss. He had a broken heart but now we have lots of fantastic music composed there, including such gems as Polka Olga, Persian March, Waltz 'Farewell to Petersburg' and many others. If you are interested in what brought about all this - do not miss Pavlovsk if you happen to be in Russia's northern capital. It's just a 15-min. journey by local train from the subway station 'Kupchino'. You can also get there by some shuttle buses as well or from the Vitebsky railway terminus (about 35 min.). in the center of St.Pete, Come, enjoy and relax!"

It has been beautifully restored from WW2 and I understood that more of the beautiful furniture was original as it had been put into store at the outset of the war. The gardens were beautiful too, including the very ancient avenue of Linden trees. However, we did not have too much time to explore before we had to leave.The only downside was the Cafe, which was suddenly crowded and noisy with a large party of tourists, pushing and shoving to get served first. We had mushroom soup and bread, which was only warm and tasted awful and were glad to escape outside to peace again."

My favourites were the Italian Hall, the imperial suites of Maria Fiodorovna, Nicholas II's mother. The park grounds running along the Slavianka River, Maria Fiodorovna's private garden & the Three Graces Pavilion were all well worth visiting."

Also by having a car, he knew where the closest parking was available, or he was able to drop us off close to an entrance. If you like that late 18th C style, this is something to see. It is too bad that most visitors don't have time to see this one, as the rooms and gardens are exquistely beautful. We were able to look at our own pace, and even retrace our steps. There is an interesting furniture exhibition, which occupies 16 rooms and is located on the III floor of the central building of the palace, which is a reconstruction of the interiors of living rooms of the upper class in Russia and the history of decorative art XIX - early XX centuries. Reconstruction were drawn from photographs, drawings and paintings with images of mansions and houses of Russia. You can view panoramic images of the rooms and this exhibition at pavlovskmuseum.ru"

It is also nice to have a tour in the park with a bike of your own or a rented one which is usually at the entrance from the city side. There are three main entrance from the railway, from the city and by the palace. If you are in Pushkin you can get to Pavlovsk by public transport on buses 370 383 and 545. as well as several private ones with same and other numbers.

Whilst the Peterhoff and Catherine Palace make such an impact due to their vast size and grandeur, the Pavlosk Palace makes a big impact due to the fact it is a lot smaller, is not quite so ott in decor but much more 'homely', is more relaxed to walk around and I felt, gave you a real impression of being a 'lived in' and 'liveable in' building not one really just for show. I would recommend going to see it quickly before word gets out and it becomes a victim of it's own success and gets over crowded.You are given plastic 'gloves' to wear over your shoes to protect the floors but they are comfortable and no problem to walk around in, even in sandals.It is incredible how beautifully it has been restored considering the horrendous damage it suffered in war. It has a lot of furniture in it, many paintings, and some stunning ceilings, coving and plasterwork. The grand dining room is set up wonderfully with a big display of crockery and table decorations. It is lovely and light to walk around and there is a lot to see.It is set in a vast park and we went on a carriage ride (each carriage seated 6) around the park which in the glorious sunshine we had, was a delightful thing to do. It lasted over 45 minutes and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. The seats were comfortable and we went at a nice slow speed. It really is a park, not formal gardens (the palace has some small formal gardens at the rear of it) full of meadows, trees, and a lake, I'd really recommend doing this.It also had free, well kept, clean loos!It turned out to be a real bonus for us to visit the Pavlosk Palace, as having seen the Peterhoff and Catherine Palace we did wonder if it would be a bit 'second best' in comparison to the larger palaces but it certainly was not, it is a superb palace in it's own right to visit."

Together with its sumptuous interiors and beautifully landscaped surrounding park, Pavlovsk Palace has become an icon of neo-classical style. The palace was almost completely destroyed by the Germans during WW II, but has been stunningly restored.Entrance to the park is advertised as being free, although the lady at the entrance by the Pavilion of the 3 Graces may want to sell you a ticket (150 R). Entry tickets to the palace proper (500R) are available from a booth to the left of the main entrance in the horseshoe-shaped courtyard. The palace is closed on Fridays. In contrast to Catherine's Summer Palace at Tsarskoye Selo, Pavlovsk is relatively uncrowded. When I was there, I practically had the whole place to myself."

The style is much more sedate and \"homey\" than most of the other big tourist draws. You will also not be tripping over hoards of other tourists. There is a lovely library which I had to myself to explore. I also really enjoyed the park area. I believe it was the old hunting grounds and though there are some paths and out-buildings, it still has a more natural feel than the Tsarskoe Selo parks. I'm a Canadian but live in the middle east and really enjoyed the nostalgic feeling of seeing birch trees and tall pines. A lovely place for a walk on a fall day."

After our trip to Catherine's Palace, we had planned to visit Alexander Palace, the one where Nicholas II and his family lived and were imprisoned, but our guide suggested Pavlovsk instead. Alexander Palace is mainly a memorial to the last tzar and his family, while Pavlovsk is a suburb neoclassical palace worth seeing in its own right. A gift from Catherine to her son, it's much smaller than her palace, but in many ways, it is more liveable and comfortable. Yes, it has its public rooms which are beautiful, but it also has private quarters where Paul and his family lived. If you go to Catherine's Palace and have a choice of visiting a second one, we recommend Pavlovsk. (It also has an excellent cafe where you can have a bite to eat and some sit-down time between the two visits.)"

Sons, Alexander (the future Emperor Alexander I), Constantine, Nicholas (the future Emperor Nicholas I), Michael and 6 daughters. \" He was married twice, both times in the brides eyes he chose Catherine II, but the second time he accidentally found his soul mate - Prussian Princess Sophia Dorothea of Wurttemberg, daughter of Frederick II Eugene, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg (Maria Feodorovna). It was a happy marriage. He lived for 47 years. Their children are beginning Holstein-Gottorp branch of the Russian imperial family tree. He put the blame that he has reformed Russian army on the Prussian model. And relied on a favorite Arakcheeva. But the emperor has introduced a decree on 3-day corvee, ie, facilitated the peasants life and led the Russian army put Alexander Suvorov, who in 1899. made a brilliant Italian and Swiss campaign.

Pay attention to the ceiling (painted ceiling) in the Throne Room or the State Dining Room (lean-to P. Gonzaga) - an optical effect of a flat surface. The blue vase in the hall of the World - a gift of Napoleon I's son Paul, Alexander I, is very beautiful its silhouette against the background of the park, vidneyuschegosya out the window.

Instead it hangs a picture \"Cupidon\" the bow, the arrow is always aimed at the viewer, I do not know why, but it is very memorable, and often found on the stalls near the palace as a souvenir, perhaps a kind of Pavlovsk`s souvenir. The park district is a big star. The square itself, from which radiating 12 lanes, bordered with bronze statues of Greek gods 2 - Apollo (the leader of the Muses, the god of the Sun) Mercury, 7\u043c\u0438 muses - Thalia (Muse of comedy), Melpomene (muse of tragedy), Erato (muse of love poetry) Terpsichore (muse of dance), Calliope (muse of epic poetry), Urania (muse of astronomy), Clio (muse of history) and 2 Goddess - Flora (goddess of vegetation) and Venus (the goddess of love and beauty).After Paul strangled his wife and children lived in Pavlovsk. In one of the inaccessible areas of the park (on the edge of the ravine), she built a mausoleum in honor of her husband. They've loved each other. And written on the pediment: \"Wife-benefactor. When we left the palace on the square a band played and was a wonderful children's musical ballet costume. We were told that right now there is something like the Feast of Roses (flowers). He wanted so badly to walk from the heart of Landscape Park. In Pavlovsk many artists with easels - because this is really beautiful natural images."

One of the nicest imperial residences we visited while on our shore day tours was a side trip of Pavlovsk Palace & Park located about 16 miles from St Petersburg - just outside of Pushkin. When taking the day trip to Pushkin make sure to plan time to visit the lovely palce of Pavlovsk and the park which is a gold and while palace built by Catherin the Great for her son Paul I (Pavel) in the 1700's. Pavel moved into this palace with his family of 10 children and they roamed through the 1500 acrea estate during the youth. Pavlovsk was never a \"state palace\" but was an actual home for this royal couple and the decoration and feel of the palace show you how much love and affection was present in this home. My grand-kids ages 18 & 21 loved Pavovsk Palace and we very much enjoyed our time spent touring the palace and walking the park after our visit to Catherine's Palace in Puskin. Thank you Red October USA for suggesting and make this wonderful day trip available for our enjoyment for without your suggestions we never would have found this lovely palace and park."

It was the most incredible experience I've ever had and a very important trip for anyone interested in Russia art, architecture and history...and I really DID \"make connections\"!!!We learned about Pavlovsk Palace in depth, met with curators of the decorative arts, textile, painting/sculpture departments and other experts - including members of the restoration staff. As Pavlovsk was almost totally destroyed during World War II, that was a story in itself! Then, as part of the program, we visited five additional palaces in the St. Petersburg area to learn about the people who lived on these grand estates, to compare architectural styles and to learn more about Russian history. Accommodations were a real treat - provided in a lovely palace-turned-private-hotel and we felt like tsars and tsarinas in the midst of all this splendor.There was much to see within walking distance of \"our palace\". The parks in this area are stuff of dreams with pagodas, delicate footbridges over streams, wildlife, formal and informal gardens and vistas designed for an empress. During leisure time, we could set our own pace and choose activities based on our own interests - which I appreciated.I understand that an optional program to Moscow will soon be offered in conjunction with the Pavlovsk / St. Petersburg program and hope to do that also at some point.This was a remarkable experience and unique in that I really felt I had connected with Russian people, interacted with them, learned from them and, as a result, now share their pride and appreciation of their old and rich culture."
