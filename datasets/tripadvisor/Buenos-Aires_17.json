            "review": "A building with a history and old, but well-maintained. I took the guided tour which went all the way to the top of the building (including the lighthouse room) and took in fantastic 360 degree views of the city of Buenos Aires. The guide was very informative in both English and Spanish, and explained the practical aspects of the still-functioning private offices as well as the decorative connections to Dante's Inferno. There is a small museum space (two rooms converted from former offices) that contains a few more artifacts of the building's long history.Tours are only offered at certain times, are limited due to the small size of the spaces at the top of the building, and sometimes book out days in advance, so you may wish to book your tour well in advance, especially if you are planning to go on a weekday or holiday.The Congreso of Argentina is just down the street across the park from the Palacio Barolo and offers free tours at certain times of day (I think the afternoon), so you may wish to do both in one day, if you plan it well."

            "review": "A not-so-well-known secret!. Most people living in Buenos Aires know about this place, but never been to it. This is one of the most amazing buildings I've ever seen. Designed by a masonic architect and ordered by a very rich guy, the place is dedicated to Dante Alighieri, intended to be his burial site (at least that was the owner's dream). The building is themed, it's all about the Divine Comedy and it's floors are divided into Hell, Purgatory and Heaven, so each section is decorated acordingly: Hell is very baroque, lots of details and symbolism. As you go up, level of detail is less and less and in Heaven, it's all very clean, with almost no detail.There's a guided tour (there's in english too) and they take you to the top of the building where there's a lighthouse in a very tall building with great sights of Downtown and the Congress building. Don't miss this place!"

We were a group of 6 people and had the most amazing evening exploring the building with a knowledgable guide who spoke Spanish and English. We spend 2 hours looking through different areas of the building from bottom all the way to the top of the lighthouse. Being in the lighthouse was amazing especially at night with light being on and moving around. The hight also offered best views of the city at night which were amazing. Fantastic night tour which I would highly recommend if you have time. The tour is only selected nights per week so please check with their box office and book in advance as it gets very booked up and busy. There is a number of narrow steps to climb so not suitable for people who have fear of closed spaces, difficulties to climb or walk or scared of heights."

            "review": "Intriguing Architecture (Money + Art = ?). Palacio Barolo built by two Italian immigrant friends (one with the money from his textile business, the other the architect) in 1923 was for a long time the tallest building in BA at 22 floors plus a light house. Build in Eclectic style, is the twin of Palacio Salvo built in Montevideo, Uruguay. The two partners, built this building using as a theme Dante's Divina Comedia. The basement and ground floors having been designated as Inferno (Hell), contain decorations representing Inferno. There are dragons, monsters and Masonic symbols everywhere. The next second through the 14 floors are designated as Purgatory, while floors 15 through 22 represent Heaven. THere is a light house, hosting a very powerful Klieg light designed to illuminate across the estuary of Rio de la Plata all the way to where it was to meet a beam from a similar light from Palacio Salvo in Montevideo. Alas, this plan did not quite work, though the lighthouse and its light are still functional today. It is worth a visit and the fee is nominal for a tour that is well conducted in Spanish, Portuguese and Englis by very competent young guides, while the spectre of Dante Aligeri (another guide, actor) pops up from time to time to recite a passage from his opus magnum, the Divine Comedy. There are daily tours (about 90 minutes) during the day and evening. The evening tours (8:00 pm) end up in an office set up as at the beginning of the 20th century, on the 20th floor where a violin is playing while the guests are offered a glass of wine. The 10 PM tour does not offer the wine or the violin but has a surprise in the light house. Worth visiting."

The tour provided the history of the building, traveling throughout to review the hidden symbolism in the work. Our tour guide switched between Spanish & English, asking to know who the English speakers were beforehand so that he spoke directly to us, which I thought was a nice touch. Keep in mind it is a tight winding staircase to get to the top, but the views once you get there are incredible!"

Specially worthy if you are interested in architecture, the tour was carried out in an hour and a half, you visit the first floors (the most decorated of the building) and the upper floors just up to the lantern (don't climb if you are claustrophobic, but you have very good views from the stage below as well). Last 6 floors are by stairs, because there is no lift, but the guide gives you plenty of time to climb if you need it. You have very nice views of Buenos Aires, and more than enough time to take pictures. At last you visit an apartment with furniture and photographs of the time when the building was finished. The guide was a very nice girl who told us all about the history of the building and made the visit very amusing (Unluckily I can't remember her name). The price, 160 ARS, may be a little expensive, but for me it worths the money."

The building has a lot of potential, which is not taken advantage of.First, the lobby (ground floor) is the really only part of the building that has true architecture that one can link to the Divina Comedia. It seems that all the money was spent here; the rest of the interior is very simple. In any case because of its history the visit is worth it. I also recommend that the visitor go up the stairs to the very last floor. 6 floors up the stairs. It would have been more appropriate if it cost 120 pesos, and not 200. But, it is a nice visit considering its history."

Friendly ticket staff and a great guide showed us round speaking alternately in English first: just for me, and Spanish second for the others in the group. The tour really explains the history and design of the building very well and the original lifts you go up in are an experience in themselves. The balconies below the lighthouse have great views over the city but the narrow spiralling stair up to the actual glass lantern of the original lighthouse at the very top, 100m above the ground was a fabulous surprise and it's a really unique experience all round. Highly recommended to any visitor to Buenos Aires."

The history and architecture are absolutely fascinating, and the exploration of the building and the lighthouse was amazing!! The tour was about 90 minutes, so plan ahead. We had heard it was only 45 minutes. Also, the last stair climb up from the 14th floor to the lighthouse level and the lighthouse itself is a doozy! The 8? flights of stairs are crazy narrow and tricky to navigate. But the view from both of the top levels is amazing as one would expect from the 2nd tallest building in South America!!"

I just walked up and purchased tickets before the time, and I am glad I did the evening tour because I got a gorgeous view of the sunset over the city. The guide was knowledgeable and the history of the building is fascinating.

Our tour guide was energetic and gracious in accommodating my partner who was the only non-Spanish speaker in the group. The view from the top is stunning (at least part of it) but I am not sure it is worth a 90 minute tour... Part of the reason the tour takes so long is the fact that building has had no major renovations since it was opened in early 1900s. The elevators move at the same speed and only take 8 passengers at a time. Given that the building is still a fully operational office space, this could mean a fair amount of waiting (as you move throughout the building) if you are in a large tour group. If your time is limited in Buenos Aires you may want to consider using that 90 minutes elsewhere."

The English speaking tour guide took us through the design and construction of the Palacio, which employs symbolism from Dante's Divine Comedy. From hell (the lobby, which is beautiful) through Purgatory (middle floors) and into Paradise (last few floors), we were provided with insights about the design throughout. It was a great supplement to the main event: the views.We were taken to a room near the top of Palacio Barolo and told we could open any balcony doors we pleased and step outside. Being from the overly safety conscious US, this was a wonderful surprise! There are plenty of balconies, just large enough to fit 3(ish) people. The balconies provide panoramic views of the city or the river, depending on your position.The guide then took us up a very, very narrow staircase to the apex of the building; the lighthouse. Though no longer in use as a beacon for ships, we sat for a short time for additional historical info, and snapped photos of the 360 degree views.The entire tour was about 90 minutes, and a great use of time. Finish that off with a walk to Cafe Tortoni for coffee and medialunas, and you will not go wrong."

The tour as such is pretty good, in the sense that the guide was funny and engaging and spoke good english. But the actual parallels to the Divine comedy was a bit of a stretch. Granted they wanted to do this up as a tribute to the great Dante, but other than a lot of math, there is hardly much art. Moreover, as the place is a commercial building there is not much lighting during the evening tour that we took. We did the tour plus tango show and the latter was an incredible let down. I am sure the dancers were very talented, but given that they had only a tiny space in which to twirl around ( I dont think I am exaggerating much if I say it was not more that a 10X12 space!) and we were all jam-packed into that tiny space, standing up, with them it was not at all an enjoyable experience! The views from the top, are spectacular. Like other reviewers have said, the last bit up to the \"lighthouse\" is up a set of increasingly narrow, concrete steps and not recommended for those who suffer from vertigo. All in all, I would say do the evening tour just for the view, dont pay the extra for any show and do it only if you have an evening to kill."

This tour wasn't originally high on my list of things to do in B.A, but I just happened to be passing by the building 10 minutes before it started and they allowed me to join.Everyone else had pre booked, and as this tour gets busy I would suggest that you book in advance. The cost (March 2016) is 200 peso's for foreigners.The tour is conducted in Spanish (and English if required). The guide was knowledgeable, humorous and entertaining. She also took the time to explain everything clearly in English even though I was the only English speaker out of 20 people In the group. The architecture is symbolic and you get hear about the design concepts and how the Italian architects based many of the features on Dante's Divine Comedy. There are also some Masonic connections which are also interesting to hear about.The tour ascends through various levels in the building until you reach the viewing balconies and lighthouse at the top. I would recommend the night tour as its great to see the city lit up from a high perspectives and you also get to see the lighthouse working.If you have even a vague interest in history or architecture, or you just want to get a good view over the city to take some photographs then this tour is for you.This was one of the highlights of my visit to B.A. and I thoroughly recommend a tour of the Barolo Palace."

Anna-Maria asked if there were any English speakers, and then led the tour in two languages. And it was the full content in English, not just the truncated, stunted English version. The story and history were fascinating and the views all we expected. If you only have time for one thing in Buenos Aires ( as we did), then spend 90 minutes on the tour here."

This fascinating old building, created as a mausoleum and an homage to Dante's Divine Comedy, is not accessible unless you have an appointment at one of its businesses or purchase a guided tour.

You get to hear fascinating descriptions of the history and architecture, given by a guide who speaks excellent English (the tour is given simultaneously in English and Spanish). It requires some climbing -- about 6 stories -- but after that plus a ride in a gorgeous and historic elevator, you have the most amazing view of the city from a glass lighthouse. Warning: this is not a good tour for people who are claustrophobic (tiny, narrow staircases) or acrophobia (the balconies and lighthouse are extremely vertigo-inducing)."

The building is said to be devoted to Dante Alighieri\u00b4s Divine Comedy. You do start from Hell, go up to the Purgatory and finaly reach Heaven in defined stages when all your feelings rise galloping through the beauty of the construction while observing the excellent condition the building is kept.

But if you want to see the inside you have to take one of the different tours available - during the day or at nighttime. All tours require advance reservation - give them a call the day before your intended tour (call after 12) -, you cannot just show up and hope there's an empty spot (this may be good or bad). The price of the tours vary - I took the photographic one, which is only offered once a month, lasts 2 hours and costs 250 pesos.The tour allows for some time (normal strolling plus stops for photos) in the main lobby, then the antique elevators. After checking two of the floors (we were also able to see an office decorated a l'epoque), the visitors climb 6 floors (narrow staircase) to the viewpoint. Here are 6 doors and small balconies to see the view (from rooftops to Evita's face on the television building, from the River Plata to the airplanes taking off from Newberry and Ezeiza). The safety measures seem very lax so:* Please secure all items (including the visitor tag) and tie your hair before getting out on the balconies, the wind and air draft makes everything fly and you don't want to have to grab them. * Pay attention to the balcony doors - when more are open, the air draft makes then close unexpectedly and with a very loud noise - if you are on the balcony, that's enough to make you jump :-) or give you a heart attack. So you may want to hold the door while staying on each balcony.From the viewpoint, an even narrower (and low ceiling-ed) staircase takes you to the light room, where there's a small space to sit, almost directly on the glass walls and floor of the lighthouse. Move carefully, the mirror is rotating and there's no holding rail or support."

He wanted to design an office tower that reflected Dante's Divine comedy and this is it. Tour was very amusing and the search light at the top (heaven) is a highlight!"

However,we saw the negative comments about the tour guides and we gave up the idea of visiting it. At least,we were not going to do the guided tour. We went to the building,the dragons,columns and some architectural details seemed very nice. So we decided to do it. So.the next day at 16.00 o'clock,we were ready to enjoy it. However, the tour guides had very strong accent in english as well as not being an enough one. As most of the comments says in here,i also understood the spanish part of the tour as much as I did in english part. But, I didn't really regret not having understood their english,because,they hadn't pretty much given any information that I didn't know,by the way, I knew very little about the building,just couple sentences. Their attitudes were not the best either, I haven't seen any tour guides who are less enthusiastic about their jobs in my life than them. It was very obvious that they were not taking it serious,not respecting the time and the money of the tourists. So, why would you make people who don't respect you earn money? I don't recommend this place at all. As for the view, if you can find another high building in BA, don't waste your money and time in this place."

The guide seems to have no interest in the building and its history (more in money) and he doesn't even ask the members of the tour if they have any questions,you dont see anything more inside the building than you can see for free in the lobby: first stop of the tour the galerie in the 4th floor with view down into the lobby -which we had seen already by beiing our ticket. then the tower with good view but thats all then!!! after the tower he guided us to his office which is a bit decorated in the style of 20th, there he makes promotion and want to sell you other nighttours (same tor at night?!) wine, traverarangments to Uruguay!!we were really very disappointed, we felt ripped of, in a tourist trap. 15$ is not cheap at all, the guy runnes his own business as he owns some space in the building an has an axclusiv acces to the tower."

The history lesson was rushed and really thin on detail. We started in the tour in the lobby, moved to the fourth floor, then the fourteenth, then the top, all in about 25 minutes. At the top we spent significant time waiting around for something to happen. After the top we went down for a glass of wine and then left.Overall the building is very worth seeing but the night tour is pretty terrible for its disorganized feel and lack of interesting/informative dialogue.

Afterwards you go into a small room for some wine and olives, which is fine but nothing impressive. I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 because it wasn't the most amazing attraction I've ever seen, but it was definitely a very fun experience and something to try while in BA."

Palacio Barolo is a landmark office building (including travel agencies, a Spanish school for foreigners, a Tango clothing store and offices for accountants, lawyers, etc.), located on 1370 Mayo Avenue, in the neighborhood of Monserrat, near the National Congress. When it was built it was the tallest building in South America. Built in Eclectic style, it was declared a National Historic Monument in 1997.Structure of the building: designed in accordance with the cosmology of Dante's Divine Comedy. The 22 floors (as the cantos in Dante\u2019s poem) are divided into three \"sections\": the basement and the ground floor represent Hell. After that (floors 1-14), the Purgatory. Finally, floors 15 to 22 and the lighthouse on the top, Paradise. It is amazing how light plays a more important role the upper you climb. A clear symbol of Heaven/Paradise. The Lighthouse: used to be used for optical communication with a twin building in Montevideo, Uruguay (Palacio Salvo).Some Gothic and Islamic reminiscences are found. Both the architect and owner\u2019s plans were to bring Dante\u2019s remains to be buried in the Palace, something which \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 could not be achieved. What the ticket includes: a guided tour and a plus: all the way up to a glass light house. However, be warned: the small narrow passage of circular and twisting stairways, iron-gated elevators and tight passages leading to the top are not for everyone. What\u2019s more, it can get claustrophobic. But once you get on top, if you do, the views \u2013 from tiny balconies - are spectacular! Afternoon and evening guided tours. The latter includes wine tasting, so it is a bit more expensive. Tip: pay attention to details, including those of the fa\u00e7ade. Guides: VERY friendly and flexible (with had a problem with our reservation. However, they were so nice. They even provided me with their mobile phone numbers. They are two brothers, related somehow to the building).HIGHLY recommend. Should be on your \u201cmust-see\u201d list. Wonderful panoramic shots! Eye-popping definitely!"

The building itself is very interesting architecturally and the guide was very knowledgable about the design and rationale for the different features. But the kicker is really the lighthouse at the top- incredible views of the city that really were the highlight. If you decide to take the tour for no other reason, do it for the view up top!"

Our tour guide, Tomas, was excellent in both Spanish and English. The tour took about 35-40 minutes. We were about 12 people.The Palacio Barolo is a functioning office building inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy. Most of the representation is symbolic. For example, the number of floors would equal the number of chapters, etc.The building is divided into 3 regions to represent Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell. The ground floor is supposed to represent Hell with designs in the floor symbolizing the fires of hell, and certain wall ornaments depicting dragons and demons. The architect had intended for the building to house the ashes of Dante, but his petition to the Italian authorities was denied; so the building lost part of its raison d'\u00eatre.The middle floors represent Purgatory, with a central atrium enabling both views upward and downward. These are mostly boring offices. There are a few flights of stairs to climb.Heaven is represented by the observatory deck at the top of a very narrow, railless staircase. I do not recommend this climb for anyone with a fear of enclosed spaces or any morbidly obese person. At the top, there are small balconies from which you can take the best panoramic photos of the city. That alone is worth the cost of admission, although there may be shops on higher floors that have similar views for free.Tomas recommended other sights in the city, especially the excellent El Zanjon.I would not call this a must-see, but certainly worth it if you're in the Congreso area already. The tours combined with a wine tasting sound interesting as well."

Built by an Italian architect, the central tower is a most impressive structure on Avenida de Mayo. The building has elements of Art Nouveau, neo-Gothic, and neo-Romantic designs. The building was influenced by Dante's Divine Comedy. The floor of entrance of the building has patterned medallions to give the impression of fire in hell. There are statues of grotesque gargoyles and other strange animals as well as a statue of Dante. There are references to Purgatory and Heaven on various fllors of the building. The exterior and lobby are however more impressive than the interior. The organised tour includes a ride in a really old fashion lift that takes you to the rooftop from where you get an uninterrupted 360\u00b0 view of Buenos Aires and the views up and down Avenida de Mayo including that of the nearby Congreso, are very impressive.Read more: http://www.frommers.com/destinations/buenosaires/A34261.html#ixzz2RfTDebJF"

There is a climb of six flights of stairs to see the views and then another climb if you want to go up in to the lighthouse. The climb to the very top will not be a good idea for anyone who has a fear of heights or small spaces. For those that don't, the chance to sit inside the lighthouse was amazing!

Second, the \" wine tasting\" consists of just one kind of wine and i personally didnt care too much for it, it was way too strong and bitter. Also, if you are over 6 feet tall and/or weight over 250 pounds you may simply not fit in a small narrow passage of circular stairs. Im 5\"10 and weigh 170 lb and at times I had to duck and turn sideways to sqeeze through. With people directly in front and behind you it can get pretty claustrophobic. Once you get on top the view is beautiful and the experience is exilarating because you are standing on a tiny balcony with a rail that is barely half your height at about 300 feet up in the air."

The history is interesting in terms of how the Palacio Barolo was crafted and the meaning behind it, but we could barely understand the guide even though our tour was in English. Here's where it gets even more disappointing. My husband and I met a couple who also wanted to photograph from the top of the building. When our tour was ending we asked our guide if we could have a few more moments to take pictures and he informed us that if we wanted to take photos of the sunset then we would have to pay full-price to do the tour again even though we had just paid. Now call me crazy or feel what I am saying, but I think that it is totally ridiculous that he charged us again (although he finally discounted the price by $20.00 pesos) just to take a few more photos on the 19th or 21st floor. If you can find a tall building to visit for free in Buenos Aires, then definitely go that route because this tour is totally not worth it for the 5 minutes they offer you. That is of course if your reasoning for going to visit this place is to take pictures. Otherwise, enjoy your tour."

The outside of the building, the lobby, and the views are gorgeous. The tour of the other floors of the building is pretty lackluster (unless you're big into architecture, but even then- not anything special on the inside to the average tourist), but it's worth sitting through it for the 360 views at the top. There are tiny balconies at the top that you can step outside to take pictures, and they take you to the very top and turn on the light house. Definitely worth an hour of your time for the views. There are quite a few very narrow stairs to get to the top, so note that if you can't walk up a lot of stairs it may be difficult. They do have an elevator at the top, but it only takes one person at a time."

The ARG50 was pretty steep considering that the tour started late, was less than an hour and the English explanation was only just understandable. You don't have to know Dante's Divine Comedy but a basic understanding does make you in awe of the maths relating to the structure of the building in relation to the breakdown of the poem. Also amazing that the entire building was financed and erected on the premise that Italy was doomed and that Dantes ashes would be brought to Argentina for safe keeping. Once inside, the interior is sadly disappointing - even the eagle, under which Dantes ashes were supposed to rest, is a replica & unimposing. The first part was by lift but then it was really difficult when our party of 16 started to make the climb up the torre - tower. Narrow, tiny, winding staircase up from \"Purgatory\" into Heaven where we could step out onto small balconies for a view of the city. Then up again into the actual lighthouse. For those with a fear of heights this is where it really broke down as our guide maneuvered us to sit on the metal struts (Not The Glass!) surrounding of the light mechanism. Risk a peek down for that sheer 100m drop!! Back down to the 5th floor for a look at a replica of an office as per the 1920's. Absolutely loved the story of the building - the inside reality was disappointing. Today not so prestigious to have an office there - no one likes having to share the toilets!"

This is unfortunate as I really wanted a picture of Avenida 9 de Julio so I can show how many lanes there are. Also, maybe because there was only me and two other people, the English portion of the tour was very brief and left out a lot of information that was given in Spanish.

            "review": "A must do in BA. My husband and I went on this tour last week on our last night in BA (we were flying out at 2.30am). I had thought it would be a great thing to do on our last night and was right. The two brothers that run the tour, Miqueas and Thomas, are amazing guides, really passionate about the tour and have a wonderful connection with the building. The tour is in spanish and in english - e.g. the spanish explanation first and then in english - and i thought this added to it, as whilst either translation is occuring you get to take in more of the building. The history of the building and the building itself is amazing - won't tell you too much as that is for the tour and the wine and cheese at the end is a nice touch. I booked with the brothers direct over the internet and paid on the night - 80 pesos which is really cheap for what you get. The brothers even take your picture during the tour and email to you. There are quite a few steps but you can go at your own pace - there were people of all ages on our tour. I could not recommend this tour highly enough."

We did the night tour and was treated to the history of this beautiful building and was surprisingly a good break from the other stuffy architectural tours. The views of the city from the top as the sun is setting and the cheese/wine at the end make this a great tour to do before dinner. HIghly Recommend!"

We just couldn't believe the view of this city. Thomas, our guide, has a passion for the building and its history and speaks great English and of course Spanish. You'll get an amazing view of BA that you just won't expect and you even get to go to heaven. This tour is great fun and well worth your time and pesos."

We both loved it and found the tour fascinating. Amazing building and the statistics and rational behind the construction following Dante's Divine Comedy. It is stupidly missed out in Lonely Planet guide for South America. Go see it for a wonderful view and the beautiful architecture. The friend I took declared it his favourite place in BA and would recommend to anyone too."

            "review": "Great place to take pics of the city. This building intrigued us from the outside so we decided to take a gander on the inside. It was our dumb luck that there was a tour starting in 2 min at 2:00. The Italian architect Mario Palanti was commissioned to design the building by the empresario Luis Barolo, an Italian immigrant who had arrived in Argentina in 1890 and had made a fortune in knitted fabrics. It was designed in accordance with the cosmology of Dante's Divine Comedy, motivated by the architect's admiration for Alighieri. There are 22 floors, divided into three \"sections\". The basement and ground floor represent hell, floors 1-14 are the purgatory, and 15-22 represent heaven. The building is 100 meters (328 feet) tall, one meter for each canto of the Divine Comedy. The lighthouse at the top of the building can be seen all the way in Montevideo, Uruguay. The owner planned to use only 3 floors (with secret elevators), and to rent the rest. When completed in 1923 it was the tallest building, not only in the city, but also in the whole of South America. It remained the city's tallest building until 1935 when, on completion, the Kavanagh Building took over this title. The tour came out to $40 AR well with the $10 us for the pictures of Congress and the unobstructed views of the city. They do wine tasting tours on Friday evening where they drink good wine and then take a hike up to the top of the lighthouse."

We were lucky enough to arrive on a Thursday and were able to get an English tour of this beautiful building inspired by Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy.\" The tour takes you to the rooftop lighthouse where there are 360 degree spectacular views of Buenos Aires. There are especially beautiful views of the Congreso building. The tour guide, Miqueas, is very well informed about the building and was a wonderful tour guide. We are happy that we took this tour because we were able to get a great view of the city. We went in the the afternoon but there are also evening tours plus wine tastings."

            "review": "Astonishing!. I had read about this building in one of the many tourist guides and handouts I had been given at the first place I stayed, and then happened upon it one day with a new Argentinian friend and his architect partner. It's an amazing building, and curious in that it was built based on Dante's \"Inferno\"- from hell to purgatory and eventually Heaven. I told them I thought you could go inside it and take a tour, so we asked and were told how to arrange it. A few days later, we met back there for the small tour (which happened to be in Spanish), but fortunately my friend Mat\u00edas was a good translator. There were probably only about 8 of us on the tour and they had an English handout for us. I felt like I had discovered the Empire State Building of Buenos Aires, and an unknown secret. We went up and up and up, and suddenly were outside on these little round outcroppings of the cupola. The view was 360 degrees, and up and down Avenida de Mayo- from the Casa Rosada (the Pink House) to the Congresso. Absolutely astonishing. And then, we went up a couple at a time to the very tippy top, to the light house. Truly incredible. We felt as if we had shared in a special Buenos Aires secret where few tourists venture."
