Such a contrast to the busy streets of Kathmandu, the garden is lush and green with so many flowers, and beautiful ponds and fountains are littered throughout. You can get a mat (although we didn't figure out how) or just spread out a blanket and lie on the grass. Nothing really to do there but to relax, take a few pictures and enjoy the beauty. Loved it."

The menu is quite expensive there along with the entrance fee however it is a recommended address to escape the crowd and buzz of the thamel city. Nearby is a himalayan java coffee to enjoy freshly brewed coffee. You will spend a very quality time with your loved ones inside the garden."

No holds barred - this is a must for all who are in KTM . have been travelling to Nepal for over 30 years ( going again in 2 weeks ) and this is somewhere we will always visit each trip . A calm sis of tranquility in the chaos that is Thamel . Have a cocktail in the restaurant or a meal - both are worth the money , just to allow you to sit and take it all in from the slightly raised aspect of the terrace I would love to see/hear Kutumba play in the gardens as they are superb and would complement the surroundings perfectly If you don't know of them check out Kutumba on line - they are truly superb"

The restaurant is nicely situated, but the chairs are really uncomfortable, having no backs to lean on. Background music is nice and low, and waiter service is good, and the food is generally good, except that portions of Duck seem to be very small? I had to ask double in order to ensure a decent amount, and they then tried to charge double, but relented when I protested. The wine is seriously expensive for a good bottle, varying from about $35 to $70 and then you can add 10% service charge and 13% tax. All in all though, I like going there, and it's relatively quiet and if they could just serve the food a little hotter, then there is not too much to complain about! The staff tend to hurry you a bit after 9:30pm, when they want to go home. Pricy, flawed, but recommended."

After touring Kathmandu Durbar Square, and then winding my way on foot north through the warren of hot, dusty streets to the other side of Thamel, I stumbled upon the Garden of Dreams, which is a splendid little walled park. It costs two or three hundred rupees to enter but is well worth it. It's an early-20th century garden on an Italianate-English hybrid model. There's a small two-story building on the north side of the gardens that contains a tranquil sitting area and a display of photos about the construction and history of the gardens.Be aware, however, that these gardens are apparently a magnet for amorous, apparently affluent, adolescents. Young couples were everywhere on the Monday afternoon when I visited. It might make one a bit uncomfortable, though it didn\u2019t bother me. In the absence of shopping malls I suppose I can understand why they congregate here. It was a bit funny, in fact.In any event, go and enjoy the Garden of Dreams. It\u2019s a marvelous respite from this crowded, polluted city."

Even if you have a dinner reservation at the restaurant, you have to pay the entrance fee for the gardens, too-bad, but this is Nepal, get it any way you can, besides we aren't talking more than a couple of bucks anyway. The restaurant, mostly outside in good weather was perfect, tables not too close together, plenty of privacy, and excellent service.

The caf\u00e9 serves a good variety of food and drinks and was clean with highly professional staff. Wifi can be bought on an hourly basis.

Enter, pay the modest entrance fee and be amazed! The noise of the street drops away, trickling water replaces it, birdsong, scampering squirrels; you wander, you go further, yet another corner, another vista... It is only later that you realize how enclosed and comparatively small the space is; how clever are the designs used, the continuing canal, the changes of levels, the narrow water cascade between 2 walls. Whether you come for peace & relaxation, to eat your horticultural heart out (delicate UK houseplants grown outside), to marvel at the exhibition showing the restoration of the gardens, to eat at the cafe, or to note design ideas to take home, this is not to be missed when you visit Kathmandu."

The Garden was built in the 1920s by a man named Kaiser (he apparently preferred the German spelling) but after he passed away it gradually became overgrown and parts of it fell into disrepair. But the early 1990s it was largely forgotten.Since then however the Garden has gradually been restored and now hosts a lovely cafe, many works of art, and some pleasant walking. It was not as large as I had expected based on the map, but it is pleasant and surprisingly peaceful. The walls surrounding the Garden keep out most of the nearby street sounds and the entry price is very reasonable, about $2 US.The Garden is also popular with local residents of Kathmandu. The photo shows a young girl who took the opportunity to run off and explore every time her parents (lower left corner) looked away. She's my type of kid, and you should follow her lead. Take some time off from the shops in Thamel and explore the Garden of Dreams for an hour or so. It's worth your time."

This is about the only place in kathmandu you will find any solace, it is quiet and peaceful, a lovely setting with plenty of space for you to find your 'own corner' to do work, relax etc. The buildings have suffered earthquake damage so there is scaffolding in place etc. But this doesn't massively detract from the setting, but may not make your photos quite as pretty as they might otherwise be.Not quite excellent, as I feel could be a bit more interesting as a venue, with areas to explore and such, also would be nice for a well kept children's area, a sandpit, paddling pool and a few swings in one corner of the garden, and if they were maintained to Western standards this would definitely add huge value and attract families too."

There are some cafes in case one gets hungry or thirsty.we were their in December so it was cold, so it was interesting to observe how the people in the park move with the sunshine to get warmth . on the lush yard you can find some kind of mats and bolsters to relax on. These are provided by the garden.What fascinated me was how many different kind of flowers were in bloom during this season.Another amazing observation i made was how clean and tidy every corner of the park is kept. No litter at all to be seen. During our time we could not enter some of the historical buildings in the garden since they were partially destroyed during the 2014 earthquake.Overall it's just a simple but beautiful place to spend some quiet time"

One of the pavilions has an interesting photographic display of \"before and after\" shots, showing the garden before it had been restored, renovated and remodelled to it's current well-tended state, after many years of neglect.Depending on the season you will enjoy blooming jasmine, bougainvillea, geranium, salvia, arum lilies, magnolia, snapdragons, alyssum, roses, and many others, plus a variety of trees and ornamental grasses. It's not a botanical garden but many plants and trees are identified and tagged.It's a bargain for NPR200, and is particularly pretty at night. Take a break and enjoy this unexpected pleasure.

The Garden's design has much in common with formal European gardens: paved perimeter paths, punctuated by pavilions, trellises, and various planting areas, surrounded by a sunken flower garden with a large pond at its center. It is an architectural landscape that encourages the visitor to stroll around and discover the Garden's treasures from many different vantage points.Next to the Gardens is Kaiser Cafe, where we have fun with an international standard lucnh.

And as for food, apart from the caf\u00e9 pavilion near the pond on the right side (mentioned above), there's the pavilion for liquors on the far left side; and I also saw (just before leaving actually) a small area for meals on the entrance side of the garden, though the prices of 700 or 1,000 nepalese rupees (about US$ 7 or 10) written on the board were \"definitely\" on the high side in a place like Kathmandu where about 150 will buy you a decent meal at a decent restaurant."

There was not a very wide variety of birds there, but some were beautiful. The birds however were dominated by an extremely large flock of house crows, whose cries were absolutely constant. It created a rather unpleasant constant very loud din. The layout of the garden was quite beautiful, however, and the flowers were amazing. There is also a nice caf\u00e9 there with a pleasant selection of food. In my opinionin this is a part of Kathmandu that it would be very profitable to visit."

The Garden is surrounded by high walls which does a fantastic job of drowning out the city noise. There were a few dozen people visiting while I was there, and many were reading or enjoying a cup of coffee. The Garden has a substantial variety of plant life, many of which are native to other parts of the world. Bamboo, succulents, tropical flowers, and cactus are among some of the variety you will see. Fish ponds are also found in a few areas and the beautifully manicured grounds are worth a look.Should you find yourself in Kathmandu and are looking for a little peace and quiet, I would suggest a visit to the Garden of Dreams."

As the day was heating up we decided to do what most locals were doing and that was find relief from the dust, traffic and bustle in the Garden of Dreams. This green and gorgeous oasis in the middle of downtown Kathmandu is not just for tourists \u2013 locals (free of charge) flock to the manicured lawns, picnicking, lying on rattan mats reading. It was once a private garden, considered the most sophisticated of its time, before the neo-classical buildings and pavilions began to crumble due to neglect. It has only recently been restored thanks to the help of the Austrian government (whose assistance can be seen in many parts of the city), and is now a spot not to be missed on a visit to Kathmandu.We were enjoying ourselves so much that we decided to linger over a crazily expensive glass of bubbles in the bar in the corner of the gardens where the chirping of birds were only upstaged by the ceaseless honking of horns beyond the high walls."

There is a sprawling lawn, beautiful gardens, and fish ponds which transport you to a completely different place. You can easily spend a few hours lying on the grass, reading a book and just watch time pass by.

Kathmandu's Garden of Dreams provides visitors with a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of nearby Thamel with its numerous shops, restaurants and street hawkers. The beautifully-maintained gardens date back to 1920, when they were created by a Rana Field Marshal and christened the Garden of Six Seasons. Although only half of the original gardens are still in existence, a comprehensive restoration funded by the Austrian government which lasted until 2007 has secured their enduring popularity. In Kathmandu, the Garden of Dreams is synonymous with a meeting place for lovers - both Nepali and those from farther afield. Couples and friends alike lounge on the expansive lawns, enjoy tete-\u00e0-tetes on the verandas, and savour coffee or snacks in one of the restaurants. At 500 NPR (5 USD) for tourists, it's worth the money and, despite some earthquake damage, has lost none of its considerable charm."

Snapdragons in pinks and purples abounded, the scent of gardenia wafted on the warm breeze. It is a haven for birds and of course young love! It must not be missed on your next trip to Kathmandu.There was some minor damage to the old colonial buildings and outer wall of the garden following the earthquake in April. The restaurant, The Kaiser Cafe was closed at the time we were there. The Gardens, thankfully, were open. An idyllic place for contemplation away from the dusty, busy streets."

For Westerners who know the hush of true botanical garden enclosures this one falls truly short of expectations. There is a hefty entrance fee of 200rps. For retirees (with passport proof) it is 100rps. Once inside it is surprisingly small.The main, very busy, thoroughfare of Tridevi Marg is adjacent to one entire wall of the garden and a side wall is another busy street. So you can hear all the horns of Kathmandu hustle and bustle.The on-sight restaurant is expensive --- the types of seating not conducive to true relaxation. Better relaxation can be had at nearby Himalayan Java Coffee House or one of the many Thamel restaurants that have truly quiet lush inner garden courtyards. These abound ---just peek in doorways."

If you are overheated and tired of the sound of blaring horns, you can duck in here and lounge on the lawn for 200 rupees (about $2 USD). I ate lunch here and loved the food (although the dessert wasn't really worth the calorie splurge). If you choose to dine here, reserve a spot the night before and plan on staying a while.

I like a few things and that is about it. Indian food is nowhere on my list of likes. So after hiking to Everest Base Camp and being back in Katmandu we had some people tell us about this place. They said the food was great and the beef was real beef and tasted like a piece of America. After loosing 17 lbs. on the trek this sounded like what the dr. ordered. So we went and first of all you have to pay 2.00 to get into the grounds which are beautiful! You are tucked away in this piece of paradise forgetting about the busyness of the city right outside the gates. It is beautiful both day and night when it is lit up. We ended up eating our last 3 meals there. I had the steak sandwich which was GREAT, fried chicken also very good, and then the filet which they bring two medallions to serve you. Plenty of food and so very good!! I was so thankful to have found this piece of happiness on the trip. By far the best food I had!"

This is a beautiful place to walk around a bit and enjoy some moments of peace in what is undeniably a hectic and chaotic city. Considering most people will only spend 1 or 2 nights in Kathmandu, the time is spent in a rush. Garden of dreams will give you a chance to take a breather and enjoy the beautiful scenery. We both really enjoyed the Cafe and our food was very good but like the reviews say it is undeniably expensive relative to the options in the city, so the actual value will vary from person to person.

The only two things you can do is either lie on the grass or have a coffee or tea in the shop, which both can be done anywhere in the Europe.

Beautifully set out this could be a small garden in Vienna or Prague ! Nice to see so many people relaxing here. There is a pricey cafe where one can dine in very pleasant sourroundings.I suspect however if this attraction was more than a few minutes from Thammel it would hardly be worth a trip - and it is so popular simply it presents a contrast to the rest of the City as opposed to being great in it's own right.

Some nice corners just to sit in, overall relaxing, quiet and quite pretty.. The garden is also quite close to the classic Kaiser library which is full of old books and things victorian and well a wander- ( but then we do like old and quirky, and there is some well preserved history there).

We were a group of 4 adults and 3 children, (11, 11 and 13) and the staff ensured that our hungry children were served quickly and with the modified meals they requested. The adults enjoyed a lovely, slightly expensive wine, with our delicious very reasonably priced meals. Highly recommend the momos, a traditional Nepali dish. A great venue for a special dinner."

It is a calm relaxing place with gentle waters running on the side with superbly sculpted flora. The entrance fee is not too expensive but if you are a tourist, you pay more than the locals. The Garden also has a fantastic restaurant - The Kaiser Cafe and a bar. Recommed the charcoal grilled fist at the restaurant. As you are walking about the nooks and corners of the garden, don't be surprised if you find some local couples necking around as it has become a dating spot for young people in Kathmandu."

Lalita was the best possible person for a chat when she was not busy. She was so welcoming: interested and interesting and I hope she reads this.

Initially I was a bit put off by the 200 NR entrance fee. However once inside it great to see that funds are being spent wisely to bring this once beautiful garden back to its former glory. Do allow yourself a couple of hours to appreciate this tranquil setting and do remember to take a book and chill. Definitely worth a visit."

Foreign visitors are charged 200 Rs, and it has nothing much to offer unless you want to eat something in the restaurant or have a drink in the bar. Wifi is available for 50 Rs. This garden is mainly used by young lovers to spend some romantic time together on one of the many benches. Overall a sight one can easily skip and certainly NOT worthy of rank 4 in interesting places to visit in Kathmandu."

Not in your dreams would you think to find such a plush, quiet, regal garden in the middle of dusty, noisy, crowded Thamel! The garden features a couple of quality restaurants - one at each end if I'm not wrong. Between them, lie ponds and amphitheaters, flowers and shrubbery, victorian benches beneath verdant boughs and elaborate pavilions for a quick nap, granite statuettes and inviting gazebos. If you have an idle evening to spend at Thamel, be sure to grab your book or iPad and head over for a quiet, relaxing time here. Order a glass of wine, or a poison of your choosing, and watch the moon rise over the tall Firs."

There are several old, grand houses surrounding the gardens that are slowly being renovated. In these grounds, you are encouraged to loll around on the finely kept, stepped lawns, or hide away in the many little discretely placed, lovers nooks. Fine dining is also available in one of several spots around the ground, the old main house being the favourite. Gardeners toil away all day in the many flower beds, ensuring the grounds are in great condition, whilst little squirrels run amok throughout the place playing hide & seek with each other.

The entrance fee may be a bit off-putting but it works to sort the number and kind of people who frequent the place. About half of the visitors there when we passed through were tourists the other half young Nepali students in small groups. In view of the entrance fee, most visitors will remain for a leisurely stay, lounging about for a few hours. Last year there were mattress-like bits that made it easy to sit on the grass and play cards or read in the shade. This year these were absent or hidden somewhere out of view.There are newspapers in English for those who want to keep up with events.There are several restaurants and caf\u00e9s in the garden, not all are open at the same time.

The gardens are beautifully laid out, with lots of tasteful seating areas to take in the surroundings. I was fascinated by the miniature striped-tailed cutie-pie squirrels that darted in and out of the shrubs and undergrowth. There are lovely lawns, so green and well-kept that Wimbledon Tennis Club would be proud of. But, interestingly there are large areas of grassland that people can hang around on to either sunbathe or picnic. You can go and get sun loungers and the like from a kiosk near the entrance to the park. We spent a couple of amazing hours here a couple of times, just to get away from Kathmandu's hectic streets!

A true garden of dreams for its spectacular scenery and atmosphere inside.When you first enter you will see a group of people relaxing on the grass to the left, and the beautifully filled landscape to the right shows an old style building which is the actual Kaiser Cafe, preceded by a splendid display of trees, plants and a big pond in the middle.Just to the right of the entrance and close to the wall separating the gardens from the busy street, is a shaded place filled with small tables for two or three. And if u happen to sit there don't miss the small squirrels that climb the pergola above you.In the garden of dreams you will find the exquisite Kaiser Cafe. Be sure to order lunch or dinner there. The cafe serves one of the best dishes in Nepal and I must say I have had one of the best grilled fish dishes in my life there!A place that you must see, sit in, relax, read a book, or eat at! It will be one of the best experiences in Kathmandu."

The walls keep some of the noise out.We were a little disappointed that the caf\u00e9 was so busy - we couldn't get a table. It's probably best to bring your own snacks, lots of families had this idea.There is even free wifi here! Not that you'll need it. It's lovely to just admire the surroundings and enjoy the peace and quite. Plenty of shade to enjoy the weather."

There is a smal, amphitheatre area where they and families were sat around. The garden is made up of lots of different areas all interconnected with pathways ... Very colourful, great garden design ideas. Good also at night when flood,it. A must to visit."

This is a lovely, well laid out and well maintained garden right inside Kathmandu city, just five minutes fro the hustle and bustle of Thamel. It is designed in the formal European style and was once a private garden of a Field Marshall who obviously had a sense of style and the means to execute his plans. After his death, it fell into neglect but fortunately, with help from the Austrian government, it has been restored to its original glory.A restaurant serves lunch, dinner and snacks besides alcoholic and soft drinks.It is the perfect place to relax : you can wander around a bit enjoying the flowers and plants and, if you choose, you can spend a whole day reading a book and having a drink or a meal."

It is not very big but we sat and watched the world go by for a couple of hours in there. Make sure you go to the toilet before you leave though, I got back to the entrance , didn't actually go out and decided to nip back to use the facilities and was told I would need to pay again to enter. I told them I had been in and could show them my ticket, they said they knew as they had seen us but I would still have to pay again."

It was a nice place to have a look, however I won't say it is a must visit in Thamel since it was not very Nepalese like. The entrance fees were reasonable, however the restaurant was over-priced.

Only problem is that I don't think they are keen on you taking in food/drink with you and the little restaurant/cafes there are SUPER expensive + tax, so a glass of wine could come to almost 1000 rupees!!! If your on holiday, why not spoil yourself, but not realistic for locals and expats all the time to pay those kind of prices."

Firstly it is beautiful and terraced with day beds laid out on the terraces for you to relax on. Already you understand that they expect you to relax and not rush off. There is a small amount of wild life, squirrels , birds etc, which makes it a little more disney like. Just two blocks from Thamel behind thick brick walls, entry fee is low, but be aware that the gate person may try to short change you. Yes I can add up and 2 x $200 from $1000 is $600 change not $100. Ahem. You can enter by a few entrances, but the side one near the atm is the best I found.Once inside there are a few eating options as well. Twice when we had, had enough of curry, momos and dahl baht we went here for the western food. Steak sandwich to die for. With pickles and cheese and real steak. Not buffalo. The toilets are very clean and very western, a nice surprise as well. So if you need a break from the noise and chaos you should definately go to the Garden of Dreams. AT worst its a pleasant break from everything. At best its a regular morning break for peace and reflection looking at the pools and plants and surrounding buildings."

People tend to seat themselves for protracted periods... so if you don't arrive early you will find your behind in an unremarkable part of a very successful illusion. The door charge means that the park excludes a large proportion of Nepali locals, who will never get to appreciate what the idea of eighteenth century; aristocratic Europe was like, for those privileged enough to be part of it.

The Garden of Dreams in Kathmandu is a beautiful neo-classical garden which, in collaboration with the Austrians, has been designed as a peaceful oasis in the heart of the city with striking architecture and an array of unique flora and fauna brought here from across the globe.One thing everybody will notice when they arrive in Nepal is the horrible pollution. Yet there are a few parts of Kathmandu where the pollution is not as evident \u2013 nor evident at all, actually. The Garden of Dreams, near to Thamel Marg where my hotel was located, is certainly one of those places.It is true that the area is crawling with both tourists and local Nepali people, and it does get very busy. However, if you are willing to brave the crowds, and pay the grossly over-priced 200 Rupees for entry to the Garden, then this will surely be one of the highlights of your short stay in Kathmandu. After hearing many disapproving stories online for such a high admission fee for a \u201d simple garden\u201d, I did question whether I wanted to spend that kind of money, as I was running low on local currency in my wallet and I didn\u2019t want to use an ATM here for security reasons. In the end, I thought that it would be too good an opportunity to miss, and one afternoon I took a local taxi literally around the corner from my hotel to the entrance of the Garden of Dreams.The Garden of Dreams is unlike anything I have seen before in my travels across Asia and the sub-continent. I am used to Japanese-inspired gardens, landscaped botanic gardens, and of course the tropical settings of the likes of the Lodhi Gardens in Delhi, and the Lake Gardens in Kuala Lumpur. But here at the Garden of Dreams, everything was very European-like, and I think that must be the reason it is so popular with the Nepali people, as it must seem like a form of escapism to them. There were many small groups and romantic couples have a picnic on the grasses here, but there is also a coffee shop called Kaiser Caf\u00e9, which serves international cuisine, albeit at rather expensive prices. The Garden is open from 10am to 9pm each day."

The first time we visited at the beginning of our holiday in Nepal was bliss, it was mid week, and very quiet and relaxing, somewhat of a haven from the madness,. hustle and bustle, noise and pollution that is Kathmandu. We wandered around the lovely gardens admiring the flowers, trees, shrubbery and wildlife (squirrels and birds). We stopped at the restaurant and had drinks and food (a little expensive by Nepal standards but still cheap compared to home). We visited again at the end of our holiday as we were back in Kathmandu just for 1 night prior to our return flight. it was so busy as it was the weekend full of lots of courting couples, noisy children and not quite the haven we'd been fortunate to experience on our previous midweek visit. You pay an entrance fee and if you go out are not allowed back in."

It was a great surprise to find such peace and quiet in a city filled with dust, blaring car horns and motorcycles whizzing by.Garden of Dreams is an ideal spot for resting, reading, having a quiet conversation and such, if you feel like escaping the chaos of the city. It's within the Thamel district, so I found it very accessible. Entrance fee for foreigners is Rs 200 (US$ 2) and Rs 100 for Nepali citizens (US$ 1), which are fair enough prices. There's a cafe and a snack bar inside, although the food/drinks being served were quite pricey. My friend and I just opted to buy ice cream outside and just have it there inside the garden. Although Garden of Dreams is no Versailles, there's quite a lot to discover in this place as you roam the premises. I found the variety of flora and fauna interesting (there was even an Egyptian papyrus plant!) and it was fun to discover nooks and crannies. Do make sure you find the \"secret\" garden, which has a fountain.There are many benches within the garden premises, and people are also allowed to use mats and picnic on the grass. It's a great venue for a lazy weekend afternoon."

This aptly named oasis in the heart of Kathmandu is the beautifully restored garden of Keshar Mahal (or Kaiser Mahal), the lavishly adorned former palace of Field Marshal Keshar Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, known as \"Kaiser\" because of his fascination with all things German - and Adolf Hitler in particular. The palace building is now the Ministry of Education and the library houses the largest collection of books by and about Hitler in South Asia.The story is that the garden was built with Keshar's winnings from a game of cowries - a form of gambling popular at the time. There is a statue of Lakshmi, goddess of wealth, in the garden to commemorate this. The garden is set around a series of pavilions representing the six seasons of the year (yes, Nepal has six, not four seasons). There is also a restaurant in the garden, Kaiser Cafe, run by the renowned Dwarika's Hotel. The restaurant is not cheap, but then the quality of the food reflects this. Entrance fees to the garden, payable at the gate, are also high, but well worth the price. The gardens are a wonderful place to escape the bustling streets of the capital and to reflect, perchance to dream, on the glories of the past."

I had seen in daylight and it had been a really nice, cool and quiet garden in Ktm, which sometimes gets on your nerves with its difficult and little bit messy feel. Knowing the power shortages in Kathmandu I expected the attraction of this place to go down together with the sun. I was wrong! When the lights get lit in the dark, the beautiful and classically stylish garden aalong with its cafeterias turns into a magical place. So beautiful, so romantic and so intriguing At least in December there was space for a couple of more couples to immerse in each other's company. And the mushoom soup in Caf\u00e9 Kaiser fit well in the cool air of the night."

We were not very pleased about the high entry fee, particularly not knowing the size of the garden. However, it is a gorgeous garden full of flowers, water features, and creatures such as fish, birds, squirrels, and monkeys. Inside one of the buildings is an exhibit of photographs showing the refurbishing that the garden has undergone over the years. There is a large area for people to lay down to relax or sleep, a swing, and cafe for refreshments. Our children really enjoyed the beautiful garden."

A bargain!Take your time and just enjoy the flowing water features, the beautifully laid out lawns and gardens. Explore the small gallery explaining how the pavilion was almost demolished, but saved at the last moment, to be restored to it's current grandeur. The only negative ... the price of the meals/drinks in the restaurant was rather expensive, especially for Kathmandu. However we did treat ourselves to some lemon cheesecake, which was probably the best we'd ever tasted!!"

Also the local amorous teenagers certainly use the camouflage to their advantage which was amusing to us!The restaurant is a definite must, coffee and cake is excellent.A great relaxing way to end a busy day!"

The garden looks well-maintained and clean. However, the bathroom in the garden is dirty. We liked the museum that has a collection of photos of how the garden looked before and now. Having a small pond and fountains is also a plus. There are many couples of college students there having a date or studying, please be aware that benches are occupied at almost all times, you have to have a look for an empty one. The entrance is 200 rupee. If you go only to Kaiser Cafe that is located in the garden you still have to pay 200 rupee. Overall, we enjoyed our time in the garden and miss our pomelo tree.

It is not large in size like similar gardens in other cities and countries. But it is a wonderful place for KTM. There are flowers, fountains, stone pathways, and a pond. It's the perfect place to relax with a book like many do. There is a small entry fee. There is a bar and restaurant inside. Some complain about the prices of dining and drinking here. But then again, you are paying for the setting, not the food, this should be expected. And it's why I didn't eat or drink there, not worth it.My favorite spot is the fountain directly on the right of the entrance. Sit and watch the peaceful spot and you will completely lose yourself and forget the passage of time. There are couples relaxing and sitting together closely, but I witnessed nothing inappropriate. Affection does not particularly offend me anyway. It is open until 10 at night. It is a nice place to visit to get away. Unfortunately, the walls are not high enough to block out all the noise and honking. But if the chaos of KTM doesn't bother you anyway, the place will not be so important for you to visit. The place is quite nice and a welcome escape. But to rank it as one of the top attractions of KTM, I think it's too much. It's a unique spot in KTM, but not one of the biggest attractions of KTM. Just my two cents."

When we were overwhelmed by noise, people and traffic, we found this lovely garden. Yes, it is small and there are a lot of couples looking for a quiet kissing spot but still worth the visit. We ducked into one of the cafes for dessert when the rain started, making for a very pleasant afternoon!"

There's an entrance fee to enter. The restaurant food price is not too pricy. Worth it. The garden is well maintained. Food is definitely a must try.

After 4 days of the dusty, noisy, crowded but thrilling streets of Kathmandu, I visited The Garden of Dreams before eating lunch and going the airport. Surrounded by a high wall, and with only one small door to enter, I had actually walked by there every day and not known it. It is what remains of a formal Brittish style garden built by one of the princes in the early 20th century. It was abandoned and in a shambles when money was provided by a European country (I don't recall which) to restore about 3 of the original 6 acres. It is a peaceful, quiet retreat just on the edge of Thamel, which is where many toursists stay. While archetechturally and culturally it does not fit in Nepal, it is beautiful nonetheless."

There is also a very small photography gallery about the restoration, which is quite interesting. There are also toilets in the grounds, that, wait for it... have toilet roll!

We ended up spending 5 hours there - reading, people watching, having lunch, sun bathing and even had a nap! The garden is the perfect relaxation spot for anyone who needs an escape from the crowds of Kathmandu, is tired after a hike, is waiting for a flight and wants some time to reflect on their trip or catch up on journal writing. The garden itself is beautiful, incredibly well kept and clean. The caf\u00e9 there serves lovely food and drinks, although a little expensive by Nepali standards but you can bring in your own picnic. There are even padded mats and cushions that you can lie on. Highly recommend the Garden to everyone."

My brother and son probably found it less entertaining than I did. It is a small very well cared for & mantained garden (this in itself is unsual for much of asia, but then it\u00b4s not an open public space dependent on municipal financing).It is very european in form and even planting perhaps and contains no real surprises, challenges or adventures. But it is a very solid and nice garden with just enough sense of place so as to reflect asia and I would argue that it\u00b4s size is a plus for even non gardeners can enjoy it without feeling that they are being ovewhelmed (or perhaps underwhelmed).We visited during the winter so much of the charm of flowering and leafiness was lacking. Instead I could enjoy the structure (sometimes I am such a nerd).As most people have pointed out it is a very, very nice refuge from the grime and noise of Kathmandu.It is easy to visit as it is of no distance from Thamel.The prices I saw for the cafe and restaurant seemed a bit high for me and I am generally not non indulgent of myself. But perhaps my memory is at fault. My recomendation would be to visit this garden as sort of breathing out place between sites (Thamel shopping and Boudha stupa or vice versa perhaps). I\u00b4m not sure about their picnic policy but buying sandwiches and such in Thamel and taking a lunch here on the grass would be an excelent part of a tourist day. An hour for a visit would suffice even for the most fanatical gardener. But for chilling....?"

The Garden of Dreams offers a nice respite from all this. Behind those tall walls (which block some of the KTM noise) are beautiful manicured gardens, water features and a lovely cafe. When Kathmandu ground you down come here to recharge your batteries."

It only took about 10 minutes to walk around. I do agree that it is a nice place to lay around, but not much an attraction beyond that. The garden aspect wasn't overly lovely. They had a few nice water fountains. It looked like they were doing construction on more of the garden, but it still isn't very large. Not many flowers in January that is for sure. The garden was full of young local couples. Definitely a lover's spot."

Highly recommended to do this as it is stunning all lit up at night and during the day it is a lovely place to go and chill. Had a meal in the restaurant which was ok but very expensive especially wine. I would suggest go for coffee and cake during the day. Lots of stunning plants and flowers so some stunning opportunities. Was my favourite place to visit in Kathmandu. Opposite entrance on the other side of the road is Fire and Ice pizza restaurant - ideal for lunch or dinner after the gardens if you are craving western food!"

Well worth the entrance to fee to have some peace and quiet (although, honestly, KTM is not at all as hectic as all that, compared to any Indian city!!), and just be. Pretty flowers, nice grassy areas and benches to sit on, (good toilets too), a real little haven. The caf\u00e9 is mega expensive though, so unless you want to blow a week's budget on lunch then I'd come here before or after eating in Thamel.There's also a little 'museum' that shows fascinating 'before and after' photos of how the garden used to be after it had fallen into horrific neglect, makes it even more special that it's so gorgeous now!Came here twice we liked it so much."

There is an entrance fee of Rs 200 presumably to limit entry but by mid-afternoon in the high season, it cannot honestly be described as peaceful and tranquil due to the sheer number of people, especially tourists and loved-up Nepalese couples! The high walls do seem to block out the rest of Kathmandu but the Kaiser cafe was full as were all the benches although there was room to lay out on the grass. Worth seeing but won't necessarily bother returning."

I knew it existed and always wanted to check it out but never imagined it to be so beautiful. Only a stonethrow from the dirt, rip-off and noise of Thamel, the Garden of Dreams is a real Oasis of Peace. Had I known it before, I would probably have spent a lot of time here.The Garden of Dreams is a historical garden that has been renovated after it had been falling apart for many years. It is kept up really well for Nepali standards, there lots of Flower gardens, water ponds and fountains... and clean toilets. Couchins and mats are placed on the greens, inviting you to take a nap or read the book you always wanted to finish. On one side of the garden, the Kaiser Caf\u00e9 is located, a Coffee Shop / Restaurant run by the 5-star Dwarika's Hotel. The food is good but extremely overpriced (what could you expect). Anyhow, the guards don't mind if you bring you own bag of crisps and a softdrink, as long as you don't start a campfire...For the couples of Kathmandu, there are few places where can actually meet to hold hands and talk to each other - public \"affection\" even if it is not more than innocent holding hands is still quite a taboo in Nepal and young couples often get trouble with the police if doing so. The Garden of Dreams has somehow become the most popular meeting ground for young couples and it is often quite difficult to find a sitting place, as all benches are occupied by the romantic young of the city - in tears or not... but there is the wonderful greens, which have enough space for everybody. The toilets are clean and it seems like a pretty safe place to let your kids run around and enjoy some nature which is otherwise seldom in a place like Kathmandu city. Go for it, a must see place after a long dirty day in the city."

Main plants are labelled in Latin and English.\u00a0Gardeners were clipping the hedgerows and sweeping away the leaves during my visit, so everything is immaculately maintained.A surprisingly large variety of birds were flying or perched overhead.Padded lawn matts available (no charge) if you want to lie on the grass.There is a small building containing a gallery of photographs showing the site before and after renovation.\u00a0Go to the 'Kaiser Cafe Restaurant' (turn right after entrance) within the grounds for drink or food and views along the length of the gardens.There is a 'Barkha Bar' (turn left at entrance) serving alcohol, snacks and ice cream. There's a small covered outdoor seating area as well.Numerous toilets available.There is a library within the main house, but this was closed during my visit.Cons:Entrance fee.WiFi chargeable (Rs 250 for 5 hours).Traffic noise - mainly horns - can still be heard over sections of the wall.Tip: Take a book to read and relax.Tip: The gardens are partially illuminated at nightfall.\u00a0Tip: If, with the Gardens entrance/exit on your left, you walk straight ahead across the crossroads, then first right (after approx 10 mins walking), you enter a street containing a Pizza Hut, KFC, an authorised Apple dealer and other 'western' shops."

The Austrian Govt. funded restoration, is a pleasure to now see. The bats are long gone and the garden's neo classic arcitecture is along the lines of many of the formal gardens of Europe. The rup160 and( 40 for a child) entrance fee is well worth it .Wifi is also available at rup250 for 5 hours. If you are into flowers you will be treated with a great variety of constantly changing blooms.The lush green lawns have lounge mats to lay on and there are many shady spots to just sit and enjoy. The temperature is noticeably cooler than out on the streets which can be a blessing in Spring and Summer in Kathmandu.The pond is full of fish lazily playing \"follow the leader\". The food in the cafe is excellent and if you have been living on dhal bhat for weeks it is worth the higher prices. Also the toilets are worth a mention if you are missing home."

The food was great, although a bit expensive. The place had ancient Roman architecture and was very pleasing. During the day it was not as romantic as it seemed at night; the place was swarming with couples and families and seemed a bit shabbier, but at night the place was very romantically lit and seemed indeed to be a garden of one's dreams! It's a good place for couples or simply to spend some time alone to read a book in a quiet, clean atmosphere. The mocktails are great too, and if you want to grab a snack, those aren't as pricy as the main course items. It's definitely worth a visit."

You could have a coffee or tea inside and rest after long day for some time. I have to admit, that I was expecting more different flowers, but that was still winter in February, so no surprises.

            "review": "The heavenly oasis of peace and tranquility in the middle of \"madness\". Everybody who spends at least few days on the streets of Kathmandu knows the feeling of growing fatigue and frustration\u2026. Huge traffic following \u201claws of jungle\u201d rather than the road\u2019s code, black clouds of exhaust gases, noise, pollution\u2026. make you dream about an isolated enclave of pure nature where you can recover from this madness\u2026.Frankly, it was exactly in Kathmandu when I realized that sometimes dreams can come true. Walking along the wall on the Tridevi Marg Street at the edge of touristic area of Thamel I found a modest sign promising the Garden of Dreams.Intrigued by this unexpected discovery I crossed the small and uninspiring gate to find behind the wall a paradise in the middle of the bustling town. Well, at first moment, may be due to the contrast with busy streets it seemed to me like the biblical Garden of Eden.Short introduction: The garden is a legacy of one man \u2013 member of the powerful Rana dynasty ruling the Nepal for more than hundred years (till mid 20th century) \u2013 Field Marshal Keshar Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana. Seasoned diplomat and statesman, but also well educated in literature and art as well as passionate botanist, from his frequent trips to Europe he brought several ideas and inspirations. The most important for future generations turned out to be his idea to create the garden of his dreams in the center of Kathmandu. The second one, was may be not an inspiration but rather an admiration \u2013 this time for the Austro-Hungarian Emperor Frantz Joseph. In German the word Emperor is spelled Kaiser, so Keshar promptly changed his name to Kaiser Shumsher. As it turned out both events played an important role in the destiny the Garden of Dreams. At the time of opening in 1920\u2019s the garden was considered as the finest private garden in the world. Just to give you an idea \u2013 each of six pavilions built in the garden were dedicated to one of six Nepali seasons. Kaiser Shumsher\u2019s inspiration came from old Sansktit literature and more modern poetry by R. Tagore (winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature).Just for the record \u2013 the mentioned six seasons are: Grishma (in Sanskrit Summer), Varsha (Monsoon), Sharad (early autumn), Hemant (late autumn), Sharad (winter) and Vasantha (spring).Well, to keep it short. After the fall of Rana\u2019s dynasty, the garden lost its \u201cvirginity\u201d, overgrown by jungle-like vegetation, with polls filled with mud and buildings crumbling. City \u201cdevoured\u201d half of this once stunningly beautiful space for urban development\u2026By the end of 20th century the Garden of Dreams resembled rather a \u201cPlace of Despair and Desolation\u201d.And here comes (like a Tale from the Grave), Emperor (Kaiser) Franz Joseph or rather his compatriots represented by the Austrian Government and an NGO Eco-Himal. They provided financial help and supervision of reconstruction work. On October 8, 2006 the resurrected Garden of Dreams was re-opened to public. It is a marvelous place to \u201click your wounds\u201d immersing in the pristine nature of flower gardens, ponds, water flowers, exotic trees and plants, place to walk along the paths covered by pergolas and trellises, place to sit on the grass and just watch the sky and clouds\u2026.. or sip the coffee served in Kaiser Caf\u00e9 Bar\u2026..Practical Notes:There are entry fees \u2013 for foreigners it is about NPR 160 (probably $2).For about NPR 250 you may have access to Internet (WiFi)Within Garden\u2019s premises operates Kaiser Caf\u00e9 Bar and Restaurant (a bit pricey but keep in mind that you are in an Oasis of Peace and Tranquility\u2026. and obviously these kinds of secluded places have to be maintained \u2026.Someone has to pay for that and I think if both Kaisers did it twice, we should follow with our modest contributions to the cause. The bottom line \u2013 when in Kathmandu, consider the Garden of Dreams as a place to be (\u201cMust\u201d on you list of attractions).Have a nice afternoon in Garden of DreamsTom"

Absolutely delicious and piping hot throughout (often, in Nepal, food can be a bit on the cool side). I sat and sipped a coffee, whilst my better half indulged in a complicated but quite gorgeous ice-cream dessert. Our postprandial stroll was most pleasant and I noticed that there are quite a few little nooks and corners tucked-away here and there, most of them occupied by courting couples. It is most unusual to witness public kissing or hand-holding in Nepal, which continues to be conservative and quite prudish about such things. I got quite a few outraged stares when I held my beloved's hand on the street. Yet in the Garden of Dreams such mores do not seem to apply - it is, perhaps, a tolerance zone of some sort.Overall, this is a great place to spend an hour or two - very much recommended."

Built as the result of money won on a bet between father and son nearly a hundred years ago, the Garden of Dreams is a fragrant, cool oasis in the heart of Kathmandu. With its palms, ponds, statues, urns, arches and pillars it has a symmetry and peace that draws into its fertile soul travellers of the heart and mind. In any location it would be a sanctuary. Surrounded as it is by the urban chaos of Kathmandu it is a well maintained miracle about the size of quarter of a city block. It has about it the magic of oriental delights, secret assignations, intimate spaces where courting couples can find a moment\u2019s privacy in the moonlight. Vistas, steps and buildings through and around which people stroll amongst greenery exotic and local. Fleeting glimpses of times past, of future hopes, ephemeral as dreams, as cool as the breeze that flows through pillars, soothing a green heart, fanning the fire of an enigmatic passion.This quote from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayam is on a brass plate inside the entrance.Ah, Moon of my Delight, who know\u2019st no wane,The Moon of Heaven rising once again:How oft hereafter rising shall she lookThrough this same Garden after me \u2013 in vain!"

And it is true, this is not real Nepal, so visit to this garden would mainly be for the amazing ambience, the food..coffee...relax.. and to get a bit of me time! And I read about people complaining about the fees.. which is hardly $2 USD... let me just clarify, that if these fees were not implemented ( which is still a very high amount for most of the poor nepalese people), this place too will be rigged by the people who have no awareness about keeping a place neat and tidy.

The gardens are within walking distance from Thamel and a good place to visit to get away from the chaos of Kathmandu. We enjoyed a late morning at the gardens, including a nice coffee at one of the restaurants there. Certainly it is worth the Rs 160 (just over USD 1) per person entry fee, though I do not believe it is worth the number 1 ranking of things to do in Kathmandu.

The Garden of Dreams in the centr of Kathmandu comes as a complete surprise to almost everyone that stumbles across it. As it is completely walled, it is impossible to view from the road, and most travellers would pass by it continually, without ever knowing it exists, unless tipped off by someone else. It is located next door to the Ministry of Education and opposite the Royal Palace Museum, on the corner of the Kantipath main road, and Tridevi Sadak (the road leacing into Thamel Chowk and the Thamel tourist area).The garden is open from 9am until 10pm. There is an entry fee of Rs160 for foreign visitors, and once inside, there is the Basanta coffee bar and the Kaiser Cafe (owned and operated by the fabulous Dwarika's Hotel)The development of the Kaiser Mahal Garden of Dreams was started in the 1920s by Field Marshall Kaiser Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana (1892 - 1964), who was captivated by the classically designed palace gardens of British royalty, and wanted to do something similar in Kathmandu. Surprisingly the garden lay derelict for a long time until being recently refurbished, and is now an absolute delight with a variety of pavilions, gardens, lilypond pools, arches, marble cupolas, and nooks and crannies where people can stroll, stretch out, chat and relax in peace, quiet and relative privacy. Garden attendants will lay double mattress squabs and pillows out on the grass for visitors to stretch out on during the day, and at night the gardens are transformed with atmospheric lighting, gas flames in the reflection pools, etc. It really is something special and a breath of fresh air in a busy Kathmandu day. It is easily one of the most romantic spots in Kathmandu and is a regular hangout for courting couples and students needing a quiet place to study or read."
