It is therefore difficult to rate this otherwise popular destination. The upside was the lack of hassle, but we missed out on the intrigue. The few traders open were good to deal with and seemed to enjoy the haggling over prices. There were a number of coffee shops on the edge and it was possible to walk up grab a table and enjoy a meal . As the eid festival is based on a lunar calendar, it would be advisable to do better research than we did and avoid the holidays so as to see this place in full swing!"

Snake charmers with flutes, great big cobras, and fat rattlesnakes greet you in an open air plaza under a tent. Their buddy is a chipmunk on a leash. If you want your picture taken with them, you must tip.I had an English speaking guide who was very helpful. He started out by saying he had to pray for fifteen minutes at noon during our visit and then we were off. The souk has everything under the sun for sale in a maze of little ally ways and open air smaller market areas.Our guide said he had a wholesale place for us to see which translates into he has a friend who was tipped off beforehand we were coming to shop. Many convoluted hallways later, we came upon a closed big wooden door and our guide knocked three times. The door opened to a private shopping store which was a souk unto itself. This was when our guide had to go pray for fifteen minutes leaving is the hands of the proprietor who spoke perfect English and wanted to sell us everything in the store.Fair is fair. He did have some good stuff, jewelry in the Berber tradition in particular, but everything started at $1,000. Duly noted, we cruised around hemming and hawing when he produced a pair of tin lighting sconces which looked pretty good until he claimed they were silver and were for sale for $1,800. Sensing our resistance, he reduced the price quickly, but still nothing in that store was worth the asking price.Which is pretty much the way it is in the Souk; everything for the most part is overpriced. The saving grace of our entire visit were the custom made remedy stores using original Moroccan spices and herbs. Saffron of a high quality was quite reasonable compared the USA prices. So we ended up buying a bunch to Moroccan concoctions like essence of Eucalyptus which is mind bending powerful to clear the sinuses and lungs and will motivate me to sturdy more when I get home.Tour the Souk. No trip to Marrakech is complete without it. The guide left it up to me what his time was worth and I gave him $10 per hour. He was fine with that."

This is truly a crazy and chaotic market where donkeys, cats, people, bikes, shops and trolleys share tiny little streets covered with arts and crafts from this beautiful and rich culture.The sellers are very persuasive and will try to drag into their shops where you will have to haggle for a bargain. After a coupleOf shops this you get tired of saying no or trying to guess a fair price for something and you start to walk past without looking to much to avoid being dragged in. The place is also a maze so expect to get lost since all the shops are very similar but there are always signs indicating the direction to the main square.Tip: Watch out for bikes and walk on the right to avoid being ran over!"

We found most of the aisles were different shops but were all selling the same things so if you want to buy something I would highly recommend looking around and getting some prices first. The shop keepers didn't seem to enjoy haggling with us cause we had walked around a couple of times before we decided to buy anything so we knew we could get everything cheaper and made sure we told them that. Be firm when talking prices. if you can't agree on a price then just walk away, 9 times out of 10 they will drop the price if they think you will go somewhere else. The only issue we had was every time we stopped to look at anything the shop keepers would come out and either grab our arms or put their arms around us to get us in the shop. At night the whole area comes alive with lights and music. The narrow paths through the souks can get very crowded and some of the slightly wider paths are shared with mopeds. We were approached by several young men offering to show us around but would recommend saying no. They try to take you off the beaten track and will expect money. We found ourselves being harassed by women offering to do henna tattoos on our hands, We had a few of the ladies walk behind us, grab our hands and try to start drawing. That aside It was an amazing experience and would happily go again."

I like the smell and flavour of all the oriental herbs, ointments and food.Watching all the craftsmen and artisans in their small dark workshops is amazing. I admire their mechanical skill and their ability to make something out of nothing. Would like to get there again."

When the guide arrived promptly at our hotel, I remembered him as our guide who we had met 10 years prior on our first visit to Marrakech, so I knew we were in good hands. He asked in advance what parts of the Souks and markets we in particular wanted to see and led us down all the windy passages pointing out different things of interest. It's a must see, the sights are unique, a totally different world. The vendors are happy to haggle, but its not done in an aggressive way, we had a lot of fun haggling over a pair of slippers with the vendor trying to convince us his price was as 'cheap as chips'. It definitely made sense to have a guide as you don't just visit the edges of the souk but instead have the confidence to go further in. A great morning tour, finishing with the tour guide either organising a taxi back to the hotel or pointing you in the direction of a good bar to have a drink and carry on people watching!"

They do pursue but don't let them push you into buying anything you don't genuinely want to purchase. Quite an experience but glad i have visited. It is easy to lose your way so take note of things along the way to find your way. A compass (mine was on my mobile) is very useful to keep you on track as most of the narrow streets are under cover and you can lose your bearings. People will try and guide you, be careful as they will expect you to pay them. Also they will try and tell you they work at your Riad to get you to follow them, they don't!Don't be put off it's a an experience not to be missed"

Be mindful that if you take a photo they want money and will get very abusive if you don't give it to them. This is also the case where ever u go Morocco - a photo of anyone (whatever they may be doing) will require payment. Of course, if the people are part of a photograph from a distance, that is fine. The big downside of the Souk and the Medina in Marrakech are the streams of motor bikes that practically knock you over as they speed through narrow lanes and make a hell of a racket. On the upside, try to stay around until sunset (7:30pm), which is magic. You can have a drink on top of one of the many roof top bars - that's soft drink by the way."

We got a shuttle from the hotel we stayed at and at the drop off point our coach driver asked what we were doing when we said the souk and said we were thinking of getting a guide he hopped out and found us an official guide. Now it seems there are official and unofficial guides, my advice, get an official one they will have a card round their necks. Our guide Mohammed made the trip for us, 61 years old and had being doing it for 20 years +. Bearing in mind it was 40 degrees he shimmied along, white robe flapping leaving us in his wake. Fortunately he realised quickly we couldn't keep up. The souk itself was a cacophony of sounds, smells and sights. Different areas for different items, a souk for leather items where all the artisans worked making handmade shoes, jackets and bags. Carpets, jewellery, the spice market soMuch to look at. So easy to get lost - so relieved we had Mohammed! As well as guiding us round the areas in the souk we wanted to go, Mohammed was a font of knowledge about the area, giving background information and suggesting places. We went along to the Koran School which is in the souk area, a sight to behold, the carvings and tiles amazing! Then back into the bustle of the souk, a buzz as a moped zips past you, stall owners calling out to you to stop and come in for a look at their wares. Cats weaving their way through the shadows and the sun finding its way through the gaps in the makeshift covers over the alleys. A break for a late lunch and to rest our weary feet, as for Mohammed he didn't seem to need the rest, he had carried the bags of shopping, guided us round and still looked as fresh as a daisy. We went in the morning and the central square had only a few people on it but in the evenings at around 7pm lots of stalls set up including acrobats, fire shows etc. There are also monkeys on leads, snakes, squirrels in cages, you will be encouraged over to look at the animals. Horses and carts lots of smells as you can imagine. Keep you valuables close and your wits about you and you will have a good time. "

I have even walked away from a stall and the stall owned has come after me agreeing my price. Be strong minded , but not rude. Remember it is their country and we are guests.

Yes they hassle you but come on they need money & want to earn a living. All you have to say is No Thank You!!!If you want something for \u00a310 stick to it or walk & say no thanks I buy round the corner! It's that simple. We got 2x silk pashmina. 1x large copy Gucci travel bag & 1x leather belt for \u00a344, Bargain .Try it! We would highly recommend a visit, lovely morning out."

It's definitely worth visiting the Souks to grab a bargain, I managed to buy some nice leather bags for a fraction of the price that I would get at home just be prepared to haggle. I wouldn't really recommend wandering around on your own though as it's so easy to get lost. We got lots of people offering to show us the way but obviously they were expecting payment so we declined. The stall holders will all try to get you to come into their shops but it's all part of the experience. Just relax and enjoy it!"

Perhaps I was expecting too much with the shopping for Morocco but we were very disappointed overall, the souk was for the most part just cheap tat aimed at tourists, as they say in Thailand, \" same, same but different\". There were a few exceptions with some nice, interesting shops, and the souk is definitely something to behold but we didn't buy anything. It is good if you like cheap souvenirs, which is not our thing. It is a maze, very crowded and an adventure to take in but unfortunately the shop keepers are so persistent and in your face that instead of looking, which you might if they didn't harass you, you just keep walking past trying not to make eye contact. Best to keep a sense of humor. The side streets are the best for a real taste of the local culture."

It soon become apparent why its the largest shopping experience in the world set in 5 square miles and you can buy anything you wantI would advise going with a guide, you get their experience whilst giving commentary and history of the souks around the Medina whilst visiting some of the what i would class as real life Morocco.The only draw back with this for me was our guide insisted on taking us to a spice merchant who then spends 45 minutes going through all the spices they have and their respective remedies to cure all of your ailments. This bit didn't interest me at all and for that i felt robbed of visiting time around the markets. If i hadn't of left it until the last full day of my trip i would have gone back under my own steam for a close look around.Be careful, there are motorbike and push bikes a plenty, the Moroccans are obviously used to the smell and speed at which these bikes zoom around so be on your guard. We were told to be mindful of pick pockets too, the Moroccan routine is to spend time sitting around and hanging out on street corners so just be careful in the most they are very friendly and always want to say hello and chat.Its NOT a place if you are unsteady on your feet, the paths/roads are very poor definitely not for wheel chairs either as they are very narrowYou get to see the local products/souvenirs being made in the workshops, but when it comes to selling to you the tourist watch the prices go up. The Moroccans love to barter so have a price in mind and stick to your guns.The square is a very busy place, with snake charmers and monkeys all dressed up, but be careful here, they want to charge you for taking pictures, the guy with the monkey extends his hand to shake yours, and before you know it the monkey is on your shoulder, and they insist you take a photo and charge you for the privilege. The same with the Henna tattoo ladies they want to shake your hand and then slap on a tattoo, some of these are henna tattoo's have been found to make people ill be careful even if you want one done."

Everything looks the same! All the shops are the same. Same stuff. Same prices. You just need to barter. But....do not stop at one unless you want to buy. They do not accept you leaving ! This is a shame as you want to browse but are scared too. You will constantly be told where the square is and they direct you. Ignore them. They tell you the wrong way often or they want payment for it. Do not get sucked into their kindness that is not genuine. We were often told the square is closed come this way. All lies to get you to go their own shops. The idea is keep going straight. Don't divert off. Don't lose your bearings. Just keep walking straight. Recall where you came out and go back in same way. We thought we would try it a different way back. Got lost for hours. Exhausting. Confusing. All looks the same in the end. Do not be taken in by anyone. They are not being kind helpful or anything like it. They want money. They say they don't but they do. Or they take you to the Berber shops. However do not be put off by this. By day 2/3 you are more confident. Great atmosphere. Busy. There are cafes in there too. You will see and smell some unpleasant things.

We bought 6 traditional candle lamps that weighed a lot and were solidly built from Bennani at 23 souk semarine. The list price was 1200 dhirams but by the time my partner had finished a friendly 'haggle', we got a healthy discount which we were happy with (I don't know if the stall holder was). Whilst this place is a maze (and make sure you know your way in and out if you can) it is not intimidating compared with other souks I've been to."

I managed to get two big (Ryain air cabin size) leather bags for 300 dirham each and they hand made me (from scratch) two very thich, studded dog collars for my two doberman for 150 euros. Took around 40 minutes but we had plenty of tea and chat whilst we waited, quite a nice experience. Haggle at two or three places before you go in for a serious shop so you know what price to expect and you'll find as you're walking away from one, the price drops to whatever your last offer was."

From fake goods to carpets to real Moroccan merchandise, it's different from the grand bazaar of Istanbul as this place mixes tourism with local community trading so you feel as though you have seen the real Marrakech and ancient Arab markets. You do meet nice shop owners who try their up most to help you (for some strange reason they have a beards) and then you also find the salesmen (who don't have beards- don't ask me why it is this way) on comission that insist on taking you to every shop they can in the hope you will get sick of being dragged around and just buy something you don't really want so they can pocket a days wage. Stick to your guns and politely tell them to 'do one'! There is no obligation to buy and if you tell them it is haraam to harass they soon get the message. I did see one salesman physically push a lady out the store as she was not buying...hence my next point of some Moroccan men in the souk, they are not representative of Moroccans and certainly live with a chip on their shoulder as if the world owes them something. Steer clear of these clowns. If you don't get lost you haven't ventured far enough and ignore any one providing directions as the easiest way to get out is to go straight until you get to the wall where you can find an exit or end up back in the jemaa el-fanaa. Definitely worth a visit for some gift shopping and experience local life. Not recommended with kids."

The variety of goods is amazing and if something takes your fancy, then go and take a further look as these places are true treasure troves. The leather goods are wonderful, but make sure that you are not paying a lot for cheap camel & you can tell by rubbing with a damp tissue & if the colour comes off, it is usually camel. Good leather you can hold a lighter under without any issues. Having said that, if you just want a memory or your trip, then cheap goods are fine. There are the most beautiful scarves to be seen, but read the labels well if you are looking for real silk as a slight rewording can be misleading. It is good to barter over prices & the general rule of thumb is half whatever they tell you & work on the theory that you just slowly increase & then stop & if the haggling goes on for a long time, so much the better. If you are not serious about buying an item, then please don't start the haggle as they have a living to make & you would be wasting their time. The wood carvers have to be seen to be believed, especially those who carve with their feet & the end product is quite delicate. If carpets are your thing, then you wont be disappointed as there is an abundance of many types of carpet to be seen. Have fun, go open minded & I know you will love it as much as I did."

My favorite was smelling and shopping for aromatics. Don't let the local merchants bully you into buying something you don't want. However, you can haggle for a decent price (haggling is expected), and you can definitely find unique, local goods that aren't mass produced by some factory in China.I would recommend going out at night; it's too hot during the day, and you can experience a lot of local culture in the evening. A lot of local women and families go out to the Souk at night, so I never felt safety was a concern as an American female tourist."

As always in Morocco, the price you are offered for goods in the Souk is much beyond what they are worth, always haggle. I was cautious of my valuables and never had a thing taken out my pockets but I suspect it does happen. One night myself and three friends (all males) walked deep into the Souk to find somewhere to eat that might be cheaper and less touristy than the main square. As we walked further the streets became quieter and there were less and less stalls. A man started to lead us back towards the main square but suspecting he'd want money from us we insisted that we'd walk alone. He did not listen. It's worth noting, this was not just because of a language barrier since a member of our group speaks Arabic. After a while the first man left us and another man took his place, the two of them swapping roles as we walked. The second man insisted we pay the first although we had constantly said we would not do so, to both men. The second man became aggressive and threatened each of us with 'a problem' gesturing to his shorts as if he had a knife. Eventually we made it back to the familiar area of the souk unharmed, only shaken."

Get lost in the maze, stare in wonder at all the beautiful hand-crafted items, and bring home the most unique, stunning and remarkable souvenirs. Get ready to bargain like you've never done before! Don't take anything personally, it's all part of the game. Have fun with it! Also, bring comfy shoes and clothes, especially if you're travelling in the summer months. The heat is intense - although slightly less-so in the souk as most parts are shaded over."

The shop owners don't hassle you to buy, which was great, although the 'lookey lookey' guys will hassle you, but eventually they do take no or an answer. Walking across the Medina we saw snake charmers and men with Barbary Apes which I found upsetting as they were on chains, if people stop taking photos of them this trade would stop. All in all a great experience"

Getting out of the souk was a nightmare, which turned very scary. We had asked some people for directions and they pointed us in a direction, which seemed to be going down smaller and smaller alleys, not going out into the wider main area. we stopped again to ask a couple of ladies who were buying food at a stand, and they looked alarmed and told us we had been sent in completely the wrong direction, and not to follow anyone and only ask women for directions. A couple of moments later one of the men we had asked directions of appeared and started shouting at the lady, her response was not good.We followed her advice, and only asked women for directions, and about 25 mins later we made it out into the main square.We did return to the souk, in daylight and it was a far better experience."

It is one of those sensory experiences that is complete 1. seeing - things that are unique and so very different to the UK 2. smell - the spices are awesome - for instance - just entering into the small square where Caf\u00e9 des Epices is located and the spice smell is wonderful3. taste - some of the wares are great (but beware flies and sugary foodstuffs though!)4. Sound - from the bartering, the hubbub of masses of people of many nationalities, to the sounds of the call to prayer - completely different to my part of the world....!5. Touch - two aspects here when I think about it - be careful when bartering - touching an object can tie you into a negotiation that you may find difficult to get out of - (these guys are good!). On the main alleyways, the crowds and people mauling trinkets is one thing, but go slightly off the beaten track and the handling of goods signifies considerable intent to purchase - be wary (see review of Shopping tour of Marrakech Souks for more!). However, also wrt this aspect, you might easily think that there would be hustle / bustle and pushing / shoving - but there is NOT. Don't be frightened. Yes - keep a close eye on the scooters and donkeys etc, that share the alleyways, but people in the UK could learn a lot from the avoidance of barging / contact in a crowd - truly amazing and says a lot for the people - just getting on with life.As far as the variety of material on sale - highly enjoyable.By the way - if you don't get lost - then you haven't explored.[Camera phones are good ways to take snapshots of junctions to remind you of your way back to base / the J'maa.]"

            "review": "I was robbed!!. Night one - Arrived at the hotel around 10pm, decided to go straight to the Souks as we were so excited to finally be in Morocco.Within minutes of being there, we had shop keepers calling us in, people heckling us asking us to buy excursions and little children following us, explaining that they were sick and needed money.At first we were taking all of this into our stride. We had read the warning reviews but being quite a savvy, and usually street wise couple, we thought we'd be fine.Soon after we reached the main square my partner walked over to an orange juice stall to buy us two fresh OJ's for the visit. Suddenly when I was stood waiting for my partner to finish his purchase, a woman came up behind me and grabbed my skinny arm extremely tightly. With her other hand she started quickly applying Henna from a syringe to my arm and hand. I tried to tug away and explain I didn't want this, and my partner turned around and was also unhappy about the situation. Suddenly about five more Henna women approached my boyfriend, attempting to put Henna on him to. It was really stressful but we agreed to let them do it, after all it would only cost equivalent to \u00a33 sterling right? WRONG. Quickly as my boyfriend was still surrounded she started screaming \u201c800 Dirham, pay me, pay me!\u201d. Now \u00a3800 is about \u00a360 so instantly I was saying no, that\u2019s too much, but then more women were screeching for me to \u201cPAY HER, PAY HER\u201d for the flower she\u2019s drawn on my arm. My money was in my bum-bag and so I undid the top zip, to get her 100 Dirham out (\u00a37 approx). Suddenly she stuck her finger into my bum bag and started ripping all the notes out, and then ran off. In total she took \u00a375 from me and then the other women had the cheek to demand another \u00a315 off my boyfriend. It was very intimidating, and an awful start to the holiday. We made a quick exit back to the hotel.A couple of days later, not wanting to let the event of Night 1 deter us from experiencing the Souks, we hired a guide. WOW what a difference! Nobody approached us, although we still had the usual heckling when walking past the stalls. We had chance to delve further into the Souks, and make a few purchases, but there was no trouble and we felt far less intimidated. We were slightly disappointed with the variety of stalls, as most were copies of one another selling either pottery, spices, leather, teapots and wooden decorative items, Moroccan clothing, or rip-off brands of fashion clothing. All in all though - a successful day.We were all Souked- Out to be honest so didn\u2019t visit again until the last day of the holiday. We wanted to spend our remaining Dirham\u2019s and after our last visit we decided we were brave enough to go alone, not wanting to pay for a guide again. Within seconds of arriving, we walked past the men with monkeys on chains, to get past into the Souks. They approached us and before we knew it, I had a monkey sat on my shoulder. Having learned our lesson my boyfriend agreed a price this time before hand, of around \u00a33.50 for a photo. The men took our phones and began snap, snap, snapping. Suddenly the price had risen to \u00a315. We couldn\u2019t be bothered with the agro so paid it. We ventured into the Souks slightly, to the area which looks like an indoor street. My boyfriend wanted a wallet so we looked at a few on our way through. The second we laid eyes on anything the stall-keeper would demand \u201chow much you pay? How much you pay?\u201d And on a couple of occasions when we said no they screamed \u201cyou go then! And go quick!\u201d which was really scary. Soon, as advised would happen without a guide, we were lost. We were at a sort of cross-roads area and were deciding which row to venture down next, when a man who appeared to be friendly approached us. He advised us that he spoke English and would be happy to point us in the right direction. We asked him where the best leather shops were and he told us his friend (who came out of nowhere) worked in the main leather section and would take us there. The friend was walking really quickly, we could barely keep up, through lots of confusing, winding roads and alley ways. After 5 minutes we stopped thinking that something wasn\u2019t quite right, when the gentleman turned around and pointed to a sign saying \u201ctannery\u201d to show us we were getting close. We then reached another man who gave me and my partner a lime leaf each to smell and began to tell us how the leather was made and dyed etc. We quickly stopped him as we didn\u2019t want a \u201ctour\u201d or we just wanted the shop, so he took us next door to the leather shop. Everything in there was way out of our price range, with bags costing the equivalent of \u00a3900 upwards, so we decided to leave. The man who gave us the lime leaves was waiting outside and started screaming at us to give him 100D for the tour. My partner said no, we hadn\u2019t had or asked for a touch and he continued screaming at us with obscenities that are far too aggressive to put on here. Then he jumped on his moped and started following us around, continuing his swearing and shouting. We were so intimidated, and there didn\u2019t appear to be any English tourists or any policy around to lean on for support. My partner advised me to pretend that I knew where I was and to walk quickly. Eventually we finally found our way back to the main square again when we were simply ready to leave.The souks are not cheap, like we\u2019d been advised, apart from the OJ. Nobody ever gives you a reasonable price to start with, and even after tiresome bartering, you\u2019d only be able to get items down to the price you\u2019d find something similar for in Next or TK Max. Everybody wants something from you; everyone turns vicious if you won\u2019t part with your Dirham\u2019s. At one stage we had a 5ft 5 bloke following us around pretty much demanding money from us, without having anything to sell to us. I\u2019d be really careful, it was scary for us and I went with a bloke, I can\u2019t imagine how scary it would be on your own or with just females. My friend went with her female friend before I\u2019d been and they caught a plane home after day 2. Although I didn\u2019t let this put me off, I can now see why she made that decision.Please don\u2019t hate me for this post, I know the Souks have many fans, but if I can prevent one person from getting robbed like I did, then my post has been successful."

Also ask around before you commit to the first shop as you might find something better just a shop ahead. Start with a third of the price n work your way up.

If you are new to shopping in less western style environments like souks and markets then Marrakech is actually in my opinion, a pretty good and easy start and introduction. The range of good and craftmanship is fantastic, especially if you stray a little into the further back souks away from the Djema square. When shopping in any market like this, the important thing to bear in mind is not \"how cheap can I get this\" but \"do I want this, and what do I think is a fair price\". Obviously its nice to get a bargain, but as long as its a fair price, it leaves me feeling happy as a consumer. My second piece of advice, SMILE! Being approached by sellers and talking about buying is a unfamiliar process for many, but in the majority I found the sellers in Marrakech to be polite, and helpful and not at all aggressive. You can find workmans stalls of lamps, leather goods, ceramics, textiles, its an aladdins cave of shopping, stopping off every so often for some tea along the way. This is a great shopping experience. Ask for items to be packed for flights as well and the sellers will, in my experience oblige. A lot if places also accept cards for larger items but its useful to have cash, Obviously dont be waving this around too much! If you are looking for more western style goods, then then there are some great shops on and around Avenue Mohammed V, great stored for leather bags, luggage and shoes. Marrakech is a shoppers dream destination!"

Generally what ever the price they say the real price is half! it takes time to get to this level often with saying thanks and walk out the door (you can always get the exact same thing in the next 20 yds) - most times the price will come down.3 top tips:1) don't make eye contact, don't reply when spoken to BUT smile and walk on. (this is not an insult - just practical help to get along a road with out being constantly accosted).2) have the exact right change (lots of small denomination notes and coins (no one has change!!!).3) have a Hamman, Grommage and Massage - awesome"

All roads lead back to the square.Be prepared to haggle and haggle hard, I got items for up to 1/5th less than the original asking price.....if they are not prepared to hagglrpe, move on there are plenty more of the same to choose from"

I visited the souks with my partner and had read previous reviews and warnings about the souks but nothing can prepare you till your there.As soon as we entered the market we were chastised as we walked with people constantly coming up to my partner trying to push us into their shops. Because of this we weren't actually able to have a proper look at anything as we felt harassed. After many no's we ended up giving in to one gentlemen which wanted to show us his spice shop. We had a sit down were his colleague explained about all the teas and products they had, we sat and listed baring in mind we had no intention of buying any of this as we mainly came to the souks for leather goods and little trinkets rather than spices and tea. However I was appreciative of the man's efforts as he explained everything well and clearly so I bought some tea as a thank you thinking this was enough. He was visibly not happy that I only bought 1 thing and his attitude changed.After another 15 mins in the souks we just wanted to get out so we left.As we were leaving I was approached by a women who offered to do henna on me. I politely declined , she acknowledge I said no yet proceeded to hold my arm and put henna on my hand. My boyfriend had to step in and ask her to stop. We then was approached by a group of men in traditional clothing who asked of we wanted to take a phot with them. After the photo they started asking for money for the photo my boyfriend gave 10dhs and they wanted more. At this point we was sick of the constant ask for more money and just walked away. When walking away we was approached by a little boy who was begging. After saying no because by this point we had given out a lot of money to beggars and people in general we said no. He then tried to prevent my boyfriend from walking by holding onto his arm and pushing him back. My boyfriend was really uncomfortable with this so gave him dirhams to leave us alone.That was our experience of the souks , I'm glad i got to experience it for myself however I wouldn't go back."

Then before we even made it into the Souk my hand was snatched by a woman and she started doing henna on me, little did I know that she would then request 2000 dirhams for it (\u00a3200)!!! I tried to haggle with her - seeing as I didn't ask for it and as we only had 750 dirhams left (it was the 2nd day) between us but she refused and said that she would come back to our hotel with us, or walk us to an atm!! We ended up giving them all the money that we had, and immediately turned around and got back onto the coach, we didn't even make it to the market!!

Marrakech from GPSmyCity was good as it can show you where you are and can track where you are walking. Means you cannot get lost.We had a number of people offering us directions who we politely declined or ignored. Sunglasses help block eye contact, as do hats.In this area, you will get charged tourist prices, more than double. We bought some plain tagines (to actually use) for 50MAD in the souk they wanted 120 for a similar tagine (price drops as you walk away)We had people saying hello and asking us the time to engage in conversation and then offer to show us the markets.. Having a map to hand helps. What i really liked was hitting some of the back alleys where they actually make the stuff. Language can be a bit of an issue here, i speak some french so could get by. We did not get accosted by henna ladies. Some stalls have misleading prices to get you in. If that is the case, we walked Away.Definaltly worth a visit, haggle hard if you do want something, dont accept their first offer as it will be double the normal rate. Tell them you have seen it on the way into the souk at half the price and you had not started haggling with the. We told them we were not paying tourist prices.We felt safe and secure at all times. You do need to keep your eyes and ears peeled as there are lots of scooters running through the area.As mentioned, and off line map with gps is crutial to enjoying yourself without the worry of where you are or how to get out/back"

What we found is a) the prices are lower for most items b) the variety and quality of the items is MUCH better (we bought things that the we never saw anywhere else) and c) they DO bargain.

I would recommend going to the Emsemble Artisinal upon arrival to Marrakech as there is a good variety of the same goods offered at the souks. The ensemble has fixed prices, and although they are high, it is a good measuring point as to what to pay at the souks. Afterwards, make a first short run through the souks just to see what is offered, pick out a few places or good you want to look for. Don't buy, instead ask the vendor for a price. This is not the time to get in a bidding war as once you make a counter offer, it is expected that you continue to bargain until there is a sale. Again, don't make a counter as much as the shop owner asks unless you are willing to seriously purchase the item. Only ask what their starting point is and be clear that you are only looking for the day. Usually the price they quote you will be at least 3x what you should pay.Once you've got a starting point for certain items through these means, and you are ready to buy, decide on what the max is that you are willing to pay, make a counter offer about 1/3 of the original price and be firm only going up in little increments. Once the vendors understand that you know the value of the items and don't wobble, they will sell it to you as long as they are still making a profit for themselves. Be clear that you know the value and say that you can get the same item at a different shop for the price you offered and walk out. If they want your business, they will go after you."

Each souk is a specialised area like wood work, pottery, iron, clothing etc but they all merge into one so don't try to distinguish just let it happen. Be prepared to bargain for all purchases except food. The locals make this an art form and you will develop your own way but generally offer half the original amount and negotiate from there - the less you show you don't really want the item the more chance you have of getting it at your price. Now a warning - you will almost certainly get lost, the souks are a maze of narrow winding alleyways that all look the same .. there are young locals everywhere waiting to rescue you, for a price, they are almost impossible to shake off. There is no getting out of paying somebody once you ask for directions except ask a trader, someone who cannot leave their shop and take you somewhere that you really don't want to go. This can be very tiresome and annoying so try very hard not to get lost."

But after getting over these teething issues I found myself really enjoying the haggling aspect of buying stuff! The sellers can be fairly persuasive but you get used to it after a while! Loved the variety of things to buy! Hugely enjoyable experience even after realising I'd spent double for things that I bought on the first day. Massive learning experience!

Every so often you come up to what looks like it might lead to a dead end, they generally do and there always seemed to be a lot of men sitting about and would generally give you a bad feeling, at which point you leggit! However we didn't come to any harm, the first couple of times in May I had blokes sling scarves round my neck and even this time I had a few grab my arm and even when you tell them not to they carry on. Personally I wouldn't want to go round anywhere in Marrakesh on my own. In the evening we went for food in the square and that was horrendous until you choose somewhere, at one point I had 3 men blocking my way. But anyway, the souks are quite fun to look at, a lot of the same stuff but it just means you can pretty much get it for the price you want if the first guy doesn't relent but usually they call you back anyway...Also the olives are so cheap!

You can't really stop and admire and take pictures as they will take this as bait and that's it you could be followed out to your riad (as we were) whilst trying to make out they helped you leave and so deserve some money. The best advice I would give anyone going is to go with a local. Not only can they negotiate for you (if that's not your thing) but they can navigate much easily around the souq then you will ever be able to do and I think they're presence deters the chancers.

Take note some will get angry, but there are more nice stall holders than angry ones... Stalls that are filled with puzzle after puzzle, hundreds of them, mostly wooden, the stall holder will help you with the one that you cannot fathom....

Some will allow photos, some will chase you away. So best to ask first. Don't get lost, it's a myriad of maze upon maze, I don't have a sense of direction my husband guides me or I may still be there! See how they sell food, meat hung in the open on hooks, baking attracting wasps, all normal... Find a local grocery shop, and really see how the locals live and what prices THEY pay for the local goods, then know what prices you should be paying with a little extra on top for profit.... An eye opener... Buy your argan oil here!"

You will find sometimes the leather goods (e.g. small wallet) are cheaper at the beginning of the market rather than deep inside. The best tip is you need to spend time to explore and compare the prices - so would recommend spend a day to explore then decide what to buy then go back to beginning the bargain process. The other tip for not getting lost in the souk is try to look up for the road sign - yes look up! They put the sign up at the corner of the building - not many tourists know so they often to pay money to the boys running around to take them back to the market square. "

If you want to buy something most stuff doesn't have prices labelled and for those make sure you haggle at least half the price they tell you and be firm! If in doubt just smile and a no thank you they will understand. If you don't want to be hassled do not ask anyone for directions, do not accept anyone's help even though they say they don't want money because at the end they always end up with wanting a small price for helping you. I know it might seem rude but you have to ignore it when they keep telling you this way to the square as some people point you to the wrong direction on purpose then someone else will tell you a different way - the map on TripAdvisor app will be your best friend! It is the most interesting experience in my life well worth the visit but you have to be street smart and savvy! The best stalls for us were the nice leather stalls and spices."

If you love bargain, then this is a wonderful place to do it. Workmanship varies so get a certified guide on your first day as they know the souks inside out and will help you through the various sections so the you can recognize landmarks as it is easy to get lost. My favourite sections were the Babouche.inspect the workmanship and make sure they do not smell. I chose more of a berber style with tassels approximately 90 D leather bags also were beautiful , look around before you decide.Bought a metal lantern and bought the leather bag and slippers to stuff the bag around the lantern. The spice section was great , bought the pickled lemons used in cook, and bought saffron, ask your guide for a real saffron spice vendor. We went almost everyday in the morning before it got too hot and we were there a week."

It's a little terrifying as its huge & easy to get lost in, but thankfully exits are plentiful and many of the market workers were happy to point out exits and ways out when we got super lost. Haggle like your life depends on it, most will come below 50% of their starting price. I'm not a believer in haggling to the last penny but pick what you think is a fair price and haggle to that. It worked for us in almost all cases, paying between 5-10\u20ac for shoes or 10-20\u20ac for bags for example. If you do haggle too aggressively they will ask you to leave so don't be surprised if that happens. Mind the henna ladies, they tend to grab you and start doodling on you without asking. And while the snake charmers are cool to see in one respect, it's also pretty upsetting to see how the snakes and monkeys get treated so be wary if this may upset you. Overall I must say we felt pretty safe here despite being 3 females on our own. It was an experience to say the least :)"

If you want to get the most out of the Souk I would recommend to hire a guide who will also explain the history of the places seen, as well as, ensuring you are safe. This gives you an overall better experience. We hired our guide through our hotel and was not disappointed, he was really warm and protective as we walked through the windy streets. It is important to mention that the guides don't get a lot of money and to increase their income they will take you to shops that they have an agreement with. This is not an issue if you make it clear that you are not interested, they will not insist and move on. Be prepared to do a lot of walking as there is a lot to see therefore, wear comfortable footwear and light clothing due to the heat. When walking through the Souk everyone is trying to sell you something, hence the buzz of the place, be ready to \" haggle \" hard and to be sure you are getting a good deal by knowing the conversion factor of the currency and if you are not happy with the price by walking away will sometimes work in your favour, they don't want to lose a sale. Other important points to note are; try and not expose all your notes when buying an item, have your notes organised differently in your pockets and ladies need to hold their bags close. You can easily get carried away with the hustle and bustle and spend a lot more money than planned. A good place to visit again."

The monkeys and snakes are mistreated and will be placed on your shoulder followed by a loud demand for outrageous sums of money.People will deliberately send you in the wrong direction, try to to become your guides, and generally make your life miserable unless you give them money.If you insist on seeing the square and the souks please hire a guide from your hotel ONLY to escort you and don't plan to take any photos as the locals will tell you, \"No photos!\" and be very aggressive toward anyone carrying a camera.As you get deeper into the souks and medina local men will take great delight in giving you the wrong directions or to tell you the museum (or location of your choice) is closed or it is forbidden to walk down a certain street. Most of this information is not correct and can lead to confusion and to becoming lost very fast.Please make sure to dress appropriately (covered arms and legs) as we saw many tourists in skimpy outfits and felt embarrassed for them.

We fell for the \"hey lady come with me\" \"I'll show you the way\" well we walked and walked and basically got took round in circles by young lads,who when demanded money off us became aggressive & one grabbed me I felt unsafe & unable to protect my daughter.

Please take my advice and really don't bother going your missing out on nothing, I've never felt as scared in my life. When you didn't respond to their shouts \"hey lady\" we got abused and they shouted things like \"nice tits\" nobody is to be trusted there no matter what story they give you.

If you are seen to give to one they will all hassle you. So just say NO until you are leaving for the day 20 dirhams less than 2 pounds Example ladies sandals no more than 60 Dirhams, We paid 150 Dirhams for a medium sized letter bag which is about \u00a311.

We got lost and ended up following a guy in to a tannerie which was good to see until the man who showed us around expected 200 Durham each from us which we refused to pay, then we got lost heading back to the square which to young boys showed us the way and expected money from us which we refused and then he told us we had to go the opposite direction which thankfully we ignored and went the way which seemed busiest! Even at that they kept following us! We told him we had no money and they said they would show us where the ATM machine was! Literally everyone in the souks is out to rob you. I bought argan oil I'm a shop one night and the man ended up showing me some hijab outfit which he put on me whilst groping me! I totally froze and was shocked, if anyone had done that at home I'd have gave them a mouthful of abuse but it wasn't until he was trying to take it off me to which I snapped that I will do it myself. The whole experience was scary, they are all out to get money from you. Even when sitting in a cafe or restaurant they come round trying to sell you watches, cigarettes etc and the restaurant staff just let them which is shocking. It is filled with culture but their greed just makes the experience a bit sour, do not trust anyone in the souks and be very firm and assertive! Also I spoke to a woman in the hotel who told me if you are with a man then they have no time for you, she told me that if she tried to haggle they told her to be quiet and spoke solely to her husband. Do not go here if you do not enjoy any of the above or feel like it is something you could handle."

Leather products, clothes, first copies, berber medicines, accessories, jewellery everything. Leather products are great for the price. All the merchandise is good and cheap. Never accept the first price the shopkeeper offers. Haggle like a pro. We spent a lot of our time haggling. Don't be shy to offer just a quarter of the price, they will settle for 50% less at least. Everyone will invite you to their shop but don't stop if you are not interested in what they are selling, if you waste their time some of them may get angry. And if you are a genuine customer they treat you real well. Even if you don't want to shop, visit the souk, take a stroll, its a one of kind experience. Don't miss it! The leather products we got stink quite a lot, however keep them under the sun and the smell will slowly go away eventually. "

We thought we were doing well but ended up in an entirely different place than we intended. That being said, we enjoyed our experience. The market stall owners will heckle you, but we found it less annoying than in Egypt and Turkey. We heard lots of horror stories of stall owners more or less holding customers hostage and hassling them into buying things, but we did not have that experience. I think it was useful that we knew what we wanted to buy (pillow cases and wooden jewellery boxes), as this resulted in being very targeted about the shops we wanted to visit. Be prepared to haggle and walk away if you don't think the price is justified. But don't forget - if you are happy with the price, it doesn't matter if you could have potentially found it cheaper a few stalls down. As long as you are happy, it is worth it!"

By day this market is bustling, alive, encapsulating, it draws you in with the smells, sounds, colours textures and people. It is of another world! Beware the locals will harass you to pay them as your tour, I would recommend an arranged guide the first time if you're bothered about getting lost as the souks are like rabbit warrens and can be difficult to navigate. Everyone will try luring you into their stall/shop with the promise of \"just looking\" but once you're in whatever you look at will be hard sell. Have fun, they love a barter and some banter always goes down well but have a maximum price set and don't be badgered into paying more, don't be afraid to say No, if there's room for movement on the price they'll chase you through the market trying to sell if not they will just let you go! Nothing is for free if they ask to give you something they'll expect a gift in return ie payment, and the women doing henna tattoos are the worse, they will grab you and start tattooing be if they can and whatever they do they will definitely demand payment so don't be pulled in by \"just a small one for luck as a gift from me\" they will still want paying! Many love photos but ask first as equally as many will be offended, some expect payment for the privilege. By night this becomes the most extraordinary outdoor food court, hundreds of stalls selling food and drink, all calling you in to sit and eat. It's mainly al la cartel but each item is priced individually and many will automatically serve the bread and sauces regardless of being asked and will charge, however food is so cheap it won't break the bank! Throughout the whole thing there are beggars and kids trying to get money, food and cigarettes for their families, you've got to be tough or you'll be broke or broken within a day! Any left over food can be given to them if you like otherwise the stall keepers in the restaurants will move them along. It's a truly magical place by day and night, I could spend a lifetime trying to put it into words but the words do this place no justice at all, you really do 'have to be there' to appreciate it. Oh yes the horse and carriage through the souls and medina is a must especially at night!"

The best thing to do is just dive in through one of the entrances off the Djmaa El Fna and spend a few happy hours getting lost. The shopping is great but you need to haggle for everything or you'll be fleeced by the wily shopkeepers. A good rule of thumb is not to show too much interest in the Item you'd like to buy, and when they give you a price, drop it to a third of the asking price. Eventually you should arrive at a price somewhere in the middle. Also, only haggle for things if you really want to buy them. If they won't budge on price, be prepared to walk away. You'll no doubt find the same thing elsewhere."

However, having been to similar markets in Turkey, Tunisia, and Egypt, I did not find this to be anything special. As female tourists, even though we were fully covered (long pants and long shirts), we were still verbally harassed by the men in the souks. Nevertheless we were able to pick up some things inside. As a word of advice, NEVER pay more than half of their initial stated price. Many shop keepers have the same items, so if you don't like the person running one shop, the next one probably has the exact same thing. Also if you have certain items in mind, do you homework before you go. For example, when buying scarves, the sellers kept trying to tell me they were handmade of silk. I asked what type of silk, and he told me cactus silk (vegan silk). As I sew, I knew right away it was neither \"silk\" nor \"cactus silk\", and was most likely a polyester/rayon blend. I asked the seller to do a burn test on the fringes of the fabric, but he refused. Realizing that this was obviously not handmade, nor was it a natural fabric, I got him to reduce the price from 180 MADs to 30 MADs."

Yes, there will be pushy sellers, annoying shop owners, etc.. but it seems that the further away from Jemaa el Fna you go, the better the souk gets: not as many people and not as much in-your-face trade.Another advise is to ask your riad owner or a local person who is not interested in selling you staff how much this or that would cost. The most annoying thing for us at the beginning of shopping (and I suppose for the majority of people) is total lack of information on the prices, that is when you don't know how much things cost and you just want to get a rough idea of the prices and then keep on looking. It is hard because the sellers won't let you go sometimes if you inquire about a certain item. Most of the time, we were told by the locals, the first price that the seller announces is about 3 times the real price. So, the shoes that are 180 dirham could be purchased eventually for 60.Once you know what things cost, and you decide on what you want to buy, it will be easier dealing with the sellers. We chose the least aggressive sellers, as it seems that most of the tourist goods come from the same producers (regardless of what the sellers would tell you).Also, don't be afraid to walk away as you can always come back and you WILL find similar things in the next shop or stall. Remember, the more you engage in a conversation with the seller, the less likely you are to walk away empty-handed."

Some of the people can be abit rude if they don't get what they want but that's very rare and you can get that anywhere. Haggling is like their sport out there so it is normal for them to say a high price as they expect you to haggle. Make sure you do because otherwise they will try and rip you off. One thing we wanted they started off at 500d but then by the end of it we got it for 100d so stick to your guns. If they won't budge straight away pretend you don't want it anymore or have seen it for cheaper somewhere else then they are sure to drop the price. One of the stalls at the back on the right is a very lovely man who sells a lot of fridge magnets and key rings, all the souvenirs stuff and he is a lovely man, he doesn't try and rip you off but he is also okay with you offering the price you would like to pay, we had no problems with him at all. It is a very different experience but you have to bare in mind that this is their way of life, what they are used to and it's their livelyhood at the end of the day so you have to give them some leeway.

As the title suggests be careful who and what you photograph.

Then after they have done squiggles on your wrist as you pull your hand away and say no thank you they demand a lot of money. Refuse to pay if you didn't want a henna tattoo. Best not to let them grab you in the first place. I seemed to spend the whole night telling these women NO! Other than that it's an interesting experience the souk. Always haggle the price for everything your interested in buying. The stall holders they love to haggle it's their way of trading. If your eating on the open market there we found the best value and quality was bar number 1 it recommended on trip advisor. At all costs avoid bar Chez Simo 81. Our experience was terrible there they completely ripped us off with the bill and when complained they just laughed in our faces. My friend got a bad stomach from the food that night.  "

As said I have been in Middle Eastern souks and never had this level of hassle and intimidation....... Okay, it is relatively easy to handle, but really it shouldn't be this pressurised....... Also get lost for a minute, and some 'guide' will want to show you the way - for a cost of course....... Which is never enough. Untrustworthy and hassle from those selling in the souk. It should be fun and an interesting walk, with genuine sellers who respect a 'no'."

If you find yourself down a street and its only u and a bunch of cats then youare probably in a residential area or just not headed towards the souks so turn around! don't be afraid to walk away if the vendor wants more than you are willing to spend you will see the same stuff probably 2 shops down. Also a word for the the wise the decorative tagine are not for cooking only for serving. The vendors won't tell you that so just be aware. If you pay more than 200 MAD for a tagine for cooking you got ripped off!!! It happens to the best of them but just keep that in mind. The best ones to buy are found in the stores located in the residential areas because they aren't tourist traps. I went to a store and the owner was honest and sold me a tagine for cooking for 60 MAD that's like 6 USD, don't be fooled. Enjoy and have fun haggling for deals!"

But there's something special about the Marrakesh Souk. Hard to describe but it is unlike any other. The feel and the energy is different. If you are with a guide, you'll end up paying more because the guide expects his 'cut' at the end of the year. Never mind, how they keep a tab on it. We were in Marrakesh towards the end of our trip and joked that \"If you drink the mint tea, you'll end up buying something even if you don't want it.\" That's how good the Moroccan merchant is about making you feel thankful to him for the purchase. So if you have no intention of buying, do not sit down and accept the tea. You will buy. And when you hand over the cash you know you've been screwed, but not how badly :-). That said, Morocco is a surprisingly beautiful country and offers an amazing experience. Go there and Enjoy Yourself. You'll love every minute of it. We did. B'Saha!"

It's smartened up a bit over the years with new floors etc but it has retained most of its character. The metal souk is the most fascinating to me though the age of some of the workers worries me. The spice souk is also nice though as a tourist you will inevitably get ripped off."

The people do not take no for an answer, you have to barter for everything as they are constantly trying to rip you off! The souk says no bikes or motorbikes however you often find yourself crushed against a shop whilst one pushes past. The men often cat call the women which is extremely uncomfortable especially as I was dressed head to toe. It is like a maze and you often get lost however some people are willing to help you get out whereas others will take you to their mates shop. It is a good experience to see the goods on offer (although many imported from China and are the same) however it becomes tiresome after a while. Watch your bags at all times whilst in the souks as you are very close to people."

You can get things for cheap but you have to be confident ;) Enjoy and don't be afraid to explore, there are many hidden gems"

It was too crowded, too full of aggressive sellers, beggars and hustlers, and I spent so much time saying no to stop people from bothering me that I really didn't have a chance to enjoy myself there. On my first night I got yelled at by a random woman who accused me of taking her photo, but even when I showed her my camera photos, she continued to scream abuse and some random man joined in. On our second night there, we found a food stand to eat at despite men physically dragging my friend towards their kiosks. On the third night, some man put a dirty monkey on our arms when we weren't looking, forcing us to tip him. So all in all, I'd avoid this place if I were you. And Morocco is full of decent markets, it doesn't have to be like this. Because Marrakesh is such a big tourist destination, some may think this market is authentic or typical and it really isn't. Prices here are much higher than other parts of the city, so be ready to haggle or browse around at least before you settle."

Know how much you think an item is worth and go for it. Watch the plastic sandals and bags, the jewellery described as silver!! The south bit of the medina seems to have Morrocan prices not tourist prices!! Example lady in Riad said spent \u00a380 on drink in a \"bar\" a bit stunned and sober. Others spent half that and drank during happy hour. Sardines and chips in Kasbah half price to price quoted in medina. Young couple asked price of calleche (carriage and horses for 1 hour) and told 300 dirhams. Another chap offered 150 dm. Checked out lovely healthy brown horses, no hips/ ribs showing and they stopped to let horses drink in the New Town. Ask price before you buy. Try to have small change from bank. same young couple had snake put around their neck and demand for 500dm!! Then hands grabbed and hennaed. (Not very well). Gave them a little cash!! However lots of lovely jelabas, scarves, (dye may run/need washed before use). Lots of lovely pastries. Argan oil might be cut with another oil. The local cafes usually have local prices and lovely snacks. Tok Tok drivers seem to be disabled, so worth a go using them for trip from Kasbah to Jemma el Fna especially if tired/hot. about 40 -50 dm. Enjoy the amazing experience, just know your price and don't be bullied into paying more than the value."

As many people will tell you, you have to be cautious of being conned or feeling trapped into buying things. We had been told not to go with a guide as they would lead us to places where they'd get a cut of the sales, and we thought we were smart in venturing alone, but we definitely weren't. A seemingly sincere young man pointed us in the direction of the square, and then left us be, before catching up to us 'casually'. He was lovely but it turned out to all have been a routine. After leading us 40 minutes through the maze of tiny streets, he attempted to abandon us at a tannery where they were making leather. We told him to stay and he said that unless we bought something at the tannery then we could find our own way out. At this point I was quite irritable and refused - we hadn't wanted to go there and the 'tour' was two minutes around a smelly work yard with men staring at you - so they left us. This then left me and my friend, both of us girls in our early 20s, to find our way out. It took us about an hour of being mislead by people and given the wrong directions, until a native Moroccan doing his food shopping took us to the square. We were so grateful as we were starting to panic with not knowing who to trust or where to go. We hadn't seen any other tourists anywhere nearby, so we knew we were in a sticky one! My tip here would be to make sure your taxi drops you off at the square, not near any of the smaller entrances, and stick to where you can see other tourists. Once you get stuck anywhere where you feel uncomfortable, don't engage in a dialogue. We're glad we were staying in the New Town of Marrakech because if our whole stay had been on the same lines as the Medina and souks, are experience would have been very different (for the worse). I can see the appeal of the souks and Medina experience but for us it was a bit too lively and unpredictable. I definitely wouldn't go there with children due to the volume of people and the amount of bikes and carts speeding through the small side streets."

The half day tour is highly recommended as your guide will take you deep into the souk where the trades are including dyes, leather and metal work. Watch the artisans at work and buy their products. Remember to negotiate and pay no more than 30-35% of their starting prices. I recommend you go to the Government store before shopping here as prices are fixed and set by the government, helping you to benchmark. You need to walk away and have the vendor chase you to ensure you are not paying too much. And if they give you a free gift as you leave, then you know your negotiating skills need to be sharpened!"

Don't worry about getting lost, its inevitable but plenty of help is available, on the whole the people are lovely its only the sales tecniques that are agresive not the men. keep your sense of humour, they love to laugh. Be aware that goods are not cheap but most are beautiful and hand made and you have to be prepared to haggle as much as they do. Even if you don't want to shop the whole thing is a brilliant experience not to be missed."

We had a tour guide booked through our hotel for the morning in the souks who inevitably took us to he's friends shops where he hoped we would have bought things. I would advise getting a guide for first time but so wish we had gone back to experience this at our own pace. The men at the stalls are v persistent and if you show an interest in anything they will try to sell to you but as long as you can smile and say no thanks they did seem to leave us alone. Massive eye opener to see things being made how they have been for centuries including carpets and metal workers. Just have lots of change on you and remember to smile and be polite."

The male shop keepers are AGRESSIVE so you need to be prepared to sort of tune them out and not be intimidated by them. Do some research online before you go to see what items they sell here, and what you might want to purchase. I googled souks of Marrakech images to get an idea. My favorite things are the pottery, spoons, blankets, tea glasses, and leather bags and shoes. Bring a lot of money and an extra suitcase if you can! We found the agreed upon purchase prices to be about 1/3-1/2 what they sellers tell you originally. Start low when they ask you your best price because they will bargain with you all day! Also if you are buying Argon oil, try to buy it from the women's co-op. The money will go to VERY NEEDY women who are widowed or divorced and not allowed to do any other work besides Argon and weaving. Have fun! You are in for a TREAT!!!!!!!"

If you look like you're even slightly lost, helpful young lads will offer to show you the way (expect a tip to be asked for!).We were shown to a 'special' one day Berber festival of cloth. Seeing the way they colour the cloth before weaving into garments. Of course it ended in a shop where the lad was very helpful. It clicked eventually...

As you entre the souks people will pounce on you for your custom, and if you show any interest in products it is difficult to get away from the sellers. As you go deeper into the souks the prices get better, but the price on offer is always much more than you need to pay. Typically you can barter down on major items by around 65%. I bought a Berber rug that was priced up at 6000Dh for just 200Dh and the seller seemed very happy to make the sale. If you venture past the main souks, off the beaten track of the tourists, then you will find the most ineteresting items and the best prices."

Yes, you are hassled constantly but being polite and refusing politely is the only way. Look shocked at the first price and then barter hard, never pay more than half price and push for more; don't be afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't feel right. Refuse all offers of help from cheerful, helpful young men - they want a tip for showing you the way and will show their displeasure when you refuse.

Be firm and say you are not interested (in French or English) when approached by an eager merchant. Do not pick up or touch an item unless you are interested and always bargain over the price (a good rule of thumb is to start at 40-50% of the stated price. If you then walk away, the merchant may even come down from his \"final\" offer). While you can navigate the Souk on your own with the help of Google Maps, you probably need a guide to direct you to the best shop for each type of goods (which is what we did). Beware of pickpockets, though. You are asking for trouble if you have your wallet or iPhone in an easily accessible back pant pocket or exposed side pocket of your purse. Enjoy!"

There are also story tellers, musicians and henna artists in abundance. To get the best effect, go as it gets dark.There are a coulple of cheap eateries where you sit at trestle tables and can continue soaking in the atmosphere. Best bargain is freshly-squeezed orange just from one of the many stalls, for just a few dirhams.There are lots of souvenirs and knick-knacks everywhere, but for better bargains and a more peaceful pace, take the lane \"Rue Riad Zitoun\" south from the square. It gets less frenetic, the further you go. At the end of it, you will come out into a small square and there is a \"covered market\" close by. Shop here for scarves, jewelry and spices. You can still haggle, but the prices are much more reasonable to start with."

If I ask - they say no, if I do not ask, they might even scream and chase me with a stick. (Happened to my husband...) I'm used to this problem from other countries as well - where they hide their faces or I must pay them to get a photo. Of course religion is important, and I always respect that, but this was the worst country ever in this way.

It was just after Xmas and as a travel guide advised sharing our food we took all the left over goodies in an old ladies shopping trolly. Travelling on a shoestring we had decided on a very tight budget so upon arrival my daughter announced that if she was expected to live on hard boiled egg sandwiches she would need a lettuce..a dash into the poorly lit souk followed by a taxi ride and we were at the train station washing our lettuce in the basins of the ladies loos (gave the attendant a stollen cake) and then onto a shared cabin to Marrakesh....people in and out all night so we shared fresh pineapple.The following morning we arrived at the huge square Jemaa el Fna, found a pension down a little alley, haggled for the room price and shared christmas cake with the men who sit in the back room drinking tea and set off out to explore. We spent the next four days, morning to night wandering the souks, visiting old palaces and ruins, walking the seemingly endless old walls of the city, trying amazing foods in the open air restaurant that is the square by night, dodging snake charmers in the market that is the square by day.We were never hassled once, in fact were treated with great respect I suppose as it is so obvious that we are mother and daughter and spent many lovely smiley moments as the morocan women marveled at my daughters beautiful blue eyes.For any woman who fancies a little adventure this is the place to go and the shopping...well where do I start! If you enjoy fun and haggeling the old city of Marrakesh is for you. A truly wonderful experience."

Fruit/ fruit juice that will cause explosions in your mouth. And if you are faced with the choice of Marrakesh or Fes, if you're a shopper Marrakesh is the place (although Fes does have exciting souks selling a variety of stuff you can also find is Marrakesh.)

We went and of course got lost (as you do) navigating through numerous stalls selling a variety of items such as paintings, clothing, ornaments, souvenirs, household items and just about everything. The experience was ok, but after just a few minutes of strolling around, we figured once you have seen one, you have seen all. Most of the stalls sell the same thing so never settle on prices from one stall. Similarly, HAGGLE!! For example-I was quoted 140DH for a magnet and after haggling it was knocked down to 4DH..They purposely quadruple (loosely speaking) the prices so always ensure you haggle. Also don't try converting prices to your home currency and say 'Oh that's not bad' as this is what we were doing and yet still found out we were being ripped off completely."

Once you're more acquainted with the layout of the City centre, feel more relaxed and have no pressing appointments then it might be a good time to enter. But beware you will get lost, mercilessly hassled and fall prey to opportunists looking to 'Guide' you somewhere and expecting to either drum up business for friends or family or simply to press you for a tip.

Great if you wanna blow wads of cash or just explore it on your own. A large variety of interesting items to see, and the vibe is intense at night, when it is peak time for locals out and about. You can find 5 MAD panaches (50c euro) and 9MAD moroccan cheeseburgers (90C euro), along with other miraculous discoveries.A few things to keep in mind for this specific souk to get the most out of it are - beware petty theft, it is quite high in the Marrakech souk, especially in the large crowds (so keep your wallet, valuables and cash in moneybelt, or breast pocket, nothing in open pockets or back pockets). Also do not accept the open invitations of people wanting to show you to their store which is 10 mins walk away, chances are you walking into a hustle for money. Be firm but polite. - tourist markup prices. There is up to a 1000% markup on items for sale to tourists, do not be scared to walk away from a sale if you aren't happy with pricing, guaranteed you will find the same item elsewhere for much cheaper. Bargain is the word and don't settle just because the sellers are pushy, they know how to act to make you feel bad. Do your research and check out a few different places- it is worth getting lost in the souk as there is many different industrial sectors, from metalworking to carpentry, sewing, pottery etc etc. However if you end up lost, just keep walking around until you see signs hanging down from the souk ceilings pointing you in the directions of various gates and the main square of Jemaa el Fna. Ask a policeman for directions or other tourists you see before asking the locals on the street, chances are they will demand money for showing you the way out- try and dress a little respectfully. You are in a different culture and should endeavour to respect this to make your going easier. I have met many people who have complained about the abrupt comments and whatnot that goes on. The majority of this can be avoided if you are wearing trousers or a long dress and a long sleeve shirt. If you have thick skin, by all means wear a singlet and a pair of shorts, just prepare yourself for the attentions of locals. If you use this as a rough guide, you will have a great time inside the souk and find all the secret, niggly places that sell delicous food, smoothies and rare beautiful products as well as interesting architecture and live works. Highly rated and recommended."

You need to prepare yourself for the souks mentally as you will be pulled from every direction!!! they will tell you 4x the price so remember to go right down and haggle your way up.. its fun but tiring as we used to paying ticket prices. you will get plenty of gifts and its very reasonable if you know what you want, enjoy the hussle bussle and colouful souks, a brilliant experience"

Recommended to go with a guide, not to be lost in such big and very confusing place.By taking guide you should be ready to pay him between 20-40 EUR depending on how long you will stay with him. But you will be sure that everything is organised simple way, he will bring you to the things you want to buy, he will find you the taxi or carriage and will agree the price. If you love the actions and attraction you should go there in the evening."

A place everybody visiting Morocco should put on their bucket list. You can buy there absolutely everything metal work, glass work and very good quality leather. Plus You can train Your negotiating skills. Always start from 50% of the asking price, because usually that's the real price for non tourists. Visit it 2 times once during day time and one after sunset. I promise You won't regret it."

Do bargain, with good humour, but who cares if you or they get a good price - if you like it and it's worth it for you everyone wins. I found a really beautiful box I could never have afforded back home. And once we'd bought from a couple of people, they were friendly next time we passed and we had some splendid Berber tea! It would be a shame if these artisan trades died out, so explore and support."

Spent an interesting morning in the Souk which comprises a seemingly endless warren of narrow, dark streets, occupied on both sides by small shops or stalls selling a wide variety of goods. These included: pottery, clothing, trinkets, leather goods, food (meats and vegetables) and beautiful displays of colourful spices and colorants.Unlike similar markets I have visited in Egypt and Turkey, the hassle factor is very low. Naturally, you are invited to visit their shops and stalls but never in an intimidating manner and they will accept a \"No!\" with good grace.Finding your way out can be a challenge and, not being able to easily leave made us feel a mite uneasy and claustrophobic. No visit to Marrakesh would be complete without a visit to the Souk."

You will get lost by the way, no map can rescue you but this is the magic. We got some great souvenirs and every single thing we got has its own little story which makes it very special."

There are many shops and winding roads and alleys just loose yourself and don't worry about getting lost. You will always spot a taxi parked up somewhere to hail down. This is a great place to visit even if you don't need to do shopping. I got all my presents here at really good prices, u just need to haggle. Never take the first price they give you and also always get individual prices for your items you pick. These market traders say you pick the things you want and after we give you a good price but this is just a way to raise the price. Get all the prices individually and then calculate the price into your own currency and see if it's worth the price or not. I saw a shawl in the souks which the man selling it tried to sell to me for 600 dhirams. I saw the same scarf afew shops away at only 100 dhirams! When I told him this he tried to tell me it's made from real silk and the one I saw that was cheaper is cheap quality from China. Funny how when I tried to leave the price fell dramatically from 600 to 150 dhirams!! Also try to reach prices before you sit in any cabs. Once your sitting inside they will feel they have the upper hand and will triple the prices!"

Make sure you negotiate long enough then just say no thank you and leave; they often are willing to give you a way lower price.

We didn't like being pushed all the time, and it is a miracle people aren't being run over by the scooters more often. the air is very dirty, you just want to hop into the shower after being in the souk. the quality of the products is often poor. we'd recommend to go to the \"Ensemble Artisanal Marrakech\" instead.it is an experience and we get the fascination, but we didn't really enjoy Marrakech due to the souk. When we come back, we'll only use Marrakech as a transit to go to the Atlas mountains again. To us that's the beauty of Morocco"

If a man starts following you claiming to be a guide, suddenly \" lose interest\" in where you are going and lose them. Then find your own way, otherwise you will be pressured for money.

Everyone is out to earn a buck and it is the duty of the tourist to keep the economy vibrant, so don't be getting annoyed at the constant attention. They are doing a job, and you are there to enjoy it.The orange juice at the OJ stalls is delicious. And a bargain.Everything is on sale at Jemaa el Fna.. If you don't want to buy anything.. Don't. Simply say \"No thank you\" \"Merci mais non\" or \"La Shukran\" and they will probably leave you alone. If you get taken to Abdullah's brother in law's carpet shop and you don't want to buy a carpet you would be wise not to accept the tea as that is the opening round of the hard sell. I have to say though that, personally, I do like the odd carpet shop visit as it is a very interesting experience. (and no, I've never bought a carpet) If there is something you really want.. Start low. at about one third of what you would like to pay.. And, most importantly, enjoy the experience.Caleches. Horse drawn carriages which will give you a tour of the city. Years ago when there wasn't so much traffic, a Caleche ride was quite enjoyable. But what I saw on my visit last week is that the Caleche is overwhelmed by traffic. Can't say that I'd like to have a go now.. But don't let that put you off. It may still be really good and you will be contributing to the economy and helping to support a centuries old tradition.Dining. There are plenty of good cafes all around Jemaa el Fna, and when the food vendors set up in the evening you will be spoilt for choice.Top tip. You will be seriously harassed by restaurant/food stall touts. To stop them in their tracks simply say \"Sorry, I've already eaten\".I had a selection of cow bits at one of the food stalls one evening. Absolutely delicious! Be brave :-)"

Don't panick, you can always find a taxi at the end of a walk way to take you back home, or find a helpful stranger to walk you out the right way (although a tip will be expected for this service). The rule in the souk, I learned, was what ever price they start with, you divide by two and start there as your bargaining point. Have fun, smile and don't offer a price that you aren't willing to pay (it's bad manners and frowned upon by all merchants)! Other than that, you'll come away with a once in a lifetime experience and some good swag to bring home!"

Many hawkers vieing for your attention. The stalls are great and packed with artefacts, souvenirs and keepsakes. Some of the stalls are selling the tackiest of things. Please be wary of buying freshly squeezed orange juice as it may run right through you within half an hour or so! The cleanliness of the Souks is negligible and if you are squeamish of watching an old man squat down and drop a load in front of you then a Souk is not a place for you. Admittedly, I was so astonished to see this I almost took a snap with my phone. The meat and fish on sale are swarming with flies and the sweet pastries and cakes are swarming with bees. A really stark clash of cultures that might be a little tricky to adjust to for some travellers. It can be exhausting trying to constantly fight off the traders trying to sell you something. If approached by any beggars, put up your hands and most emphatically refuse...this is the only message that will dissuade then from hassling you. Great to see the vibrant colours and hear the many sounds of Morocco. The snake charmers, monkey trainers and horsemen are to be avoided as they treat these animals deplorably. The leather goods are lovely but be mindful to find out what beast the leather has come from, the leather briefcase I bought was camel leather and it's muskiness was overbearing. The Souks are not the best place to be around at night. This is a place for intrepid travellers with steely stomachs and no sense of smell."

Generally if you are polite to the stall holders and don't engage in conversation you can get through without much hassle. It is a shame that they hassle you because it has the opposite effect on us.....we just DO NOT go in and look or buy, so it is there loss. Many of the stalls are full of the same stuff and you see the same items again and again and again!! It is a maze of streets and one can easily get lost. Just ignore the guys telling you that you are going the wrong way and I suggest that you set up your iphone with directions and you will be ok. Act confident as you walk through and we didn't carry bags or open ourselves up to potential pickpockets. The worst thing was having to avoid the constant motorbikes that drive like maniacs and the fumes they produce.....take a scarf to cover your mouth!! It has to be done as it is colourful and the spice aroma's are pungent.........good luck!"

Spices are good value saffron is especially appealing if your a foodie . Have a laugh and a joke with these guys on the stalls and you'll win them over . There's leather goods ,snide footy tops and everything you see in every other toot fest the world over ."

You can wander through the maze of alleys on your own although it is impossible to find a map that details the intricate labyrinth of streets.We included the souk as part of our guided tour, and it was well worth it, our guide took us in to many areas where we could see the artisans at work in the various quarters, metalworkers, woodworkers , the stucco being hand carved. We got so much out of the visit. We plan to visit Marrakech in the future and I would definitely use a guide again so we don't miss a thing, the cultural information you get is fascinating ."

He then asked if we wanted to see Argan oil being made which we didn't, he was on the phone to someone and next thing we come to a very dark alley with several men waiting and staring at us. I refused to walk any further and made him take us back, we finally managed to get rid of him and surprisingly he didn't even ask for any money. Worst bit of the whole experience was the amount of animal cruelty. I am a massive lover of animals and seeing monkeys on chains performing acts broke my heart. DO NOT go here if you hate snakes, they are everywhere, you literally have to watch where you are walking, even though I don't like snakes they should not be performing these sorts of acts and be in the wild ! I wanted a henna tattoo done and we agreed on the price before, then they wanted to charge us 500 dirhams after they had done it. We only gave them 150, but it came off within two days anyway. Be careful of the women who will just grab your hand and do it without you agreeing then charge you. Luckily me and my mum are strong willed and will not pay anything we never asked for."

We paid about \u00a335 for handbags (for my wife) which is apparently a good price compared with English high street outlets. The sellers in the Souks are very friendly but a bit pushy. Just a smile and a no thank you will not cause them any offence - then just walk away. Within the Souks there are \"Guides\" who are keen to show you to a particular area - this will probably be where one of their relatives' shops is and they will expect a tip for their guidance. Overall the Souks are very safe places - pickpockets can be a problem (although not for us this time) so keep your cash and cards close at hand. Avoid putting anything of value in your back pocket.

I worked on a third of what was originally quoted, I found I had to come up slightly on this but give it a go. It may take a bit longer to haggle but you'll get fabulous bargains! A trick is to walk away on your final price, if they call after you you're in! If they don't your offer was too low. Enjoy!"

They pride themselves on great workmanship which is evident when you take a tour. Now the health and safety bit. There are black smiths. Welding. Also all the chemicals and flames etc associated with various trades. No eye protection except ray bans. Using bare feet to hold metal in place You get the idea.

The seller will fake shock and insult but it is all part of the negotiations.

All I can say it was fantastic we went on a Saturday night and it was so busy the food, the smells, the music, the dancing, snake charmers, horses and monkeys on leads and a massive array of people. Such an experience that I will never forgot and a must do. The souks were amazing they had everything and anything you wanted.Yes I bought some bits that I am happy with although I feel that you can barter with the shop owners but to be honest they are ridiculous the prices they first come out with. When I looked a Hermes bag the owner kept saying do u know how much this is in the UK. Well I did and I still wasn't going to pay \u00a3100 for a fake. I do feel the shop owners get a bit carried away as they know how much originals are in the UK. Same as when we bought some saffron cause it was expensive in UK they thought I was going to pay more. This irritated us a little. Although the whole experience of being at the souks was fantastic and I would defiantly go back.As a lady with blonde hair I did receive unwanted attention and feel maybe ladies from other countries should be respected more, I covered my hair next time I went and did not receive any unwanted attention. I feel if English men gave unwanted attention to ladies in Marrakech their would be a huge problem."

Cold chilled water is available to buy as is freshly squeezed orange juice. Look around before parting with your money, just find a landmark so you know where you entered. Be wary of traders who will encourage you to enter their stands, the word LA [that means NO in Arabic) said strongly will have some effect. Watch out for cild and adult beggars.Hope this is useful - Enjoy the Souk.Some hotels run a courtesy bus to the Souk, so take advantage of this if you have it available.The Souk is a massive market with places to eat traditional food cocked by local traders and buy kaftans amongst other things.

The souks wind throughout the area north of Jemma el Fna, and it is very easy to get turned around and lost. Be sure to take something with GPS, which makes it fairly easy to navigate and find your way out. Spice markets, pashmere, street food, restaurants, local wares...fun to just wander and take in the sights and smells. The vendors are aggressive, but if you don't make eye contact and ignore their pleas for you to enter their shop, they will leave you alone. For a clean bathroom, just find a cafe (their are many), and buy a cup of coffee or tea. A great way to spend a morning or afternoon."

Offer a third of what they are asking and maybe settle at half. Go to the Artisanal first as this is a government run 'mall' where prices are set so you can see what you can expect to pay for something before buying in the Souks. Learn the word La Shukran (no thanks) as you will need this!! Watch for the teenagers that want to show you the way as they end up taking you to one of their stores where you will be hounded to buy.

If you are unsure about venturing out into the vast array of endless alleys and what reassurance that you know where you are then I would recommend getting a guide however I didn't get one and even though I was with my wife and 1 year old, we just went within the souks and explored what they had to offer.We had an idea of when we had to have lunch and set off looking for a restaurant 20 mins before lunch so we had ample time to look for one.I didn't carry a map as I looked on Google maps at the hotel to get a rough idea of where things are. You can get a INWI PAYG sim and use this to navigate via your mobile as well.There are plenty of shops here and I would advise not to go into the first shop and buy something that you like as you will find the same thing cheaper further on.To give you a rough guide, what ever the price you are told, half that and then negotiate on a price from there.There was only one shop (a metal ware shop)which was close to Mosquee Bab Doukkala which gave me a reasonable price and I didn't feel the need to negotiate.Outside the Souk, there were people with monkeys and when I took a picture said I can give them anything between 200 - 250 dirhams, I ended up paying them 20 which I thought was too much as well.I would suggest just enjoying the whole experience of the shops and of haggling and walk away if you are not happy with the price that you want."

Be careful of people telling you something is closed or the street is shut - it's a lie. They simply want to \"guide\" you into the shop of a friend or family member. Prices are average. Leather is everywhere. Of course not ecological :) for all you organic Eco freaks... Let's make it obvious. It's not happy leather. Most of sources are in baskets outdoors with all the pollution, motorbikes dust and crap settling over it. I suggest buy from pots or shops that have lids on stuff.Be careful with henna ladies - they start paining your hands without your permission and boom there goes 35\u20ac...

After a while, obviously looking lost a huge guy approached us and informed us that we were in a very dangerous area and to watch our bags. He offered to guide us but I refused. He then walked ahead telling us to follow him as it was safer to show us the way even though I protested numerous times that we would find it ourselves. He 'guided' us to a deserted narrow alleyway and demanded 600 dirhams! I was outraged and refused. He became very threatening and aggressive, shouting in my face and waving his arms around. I handed over a small amount and threatened him with the police. He then left still remonstrating that he was very angry. It was a very frightening experience. He had in fact led us away from the museum so we were even more lost. I approached a covered woman who asked a gentleman to guide us to the museum. It took 20 minutes of stressful walking, dodging mopeds, sellers, children and touts. We eventually arrived to find a couple shaking and in tears. They were students who had just experienced exactly the same as us, just a different guy involved! This is a total scam!!!! Taxi drivers and local young men are clearly in cahoots. It is daylight robbery and very traumatic. From the moment you set foot in the medina you are harrassed and told you need to go right, left, straight on, or back the way you have just come by young guys who then want to guide you in the right direction for money or hand you over to another friend to be guided, we talked to people who had been passed on several times and still left in that maze of streets! We hated our experiences in Marrakesh. Never in all our travels have we been so aggressively pursued for money nor have we felt so unwelcome. It felt hostile, threatening and very uncomfortable.

Don't take pictures with or of monkeys/animals without asking the price first. Because you do have to pay for it. Not sure why anyone would support this sort of animal cruelty anyways. The monkeys have to wear nappies and I doubt they're treated well. Went here with a Caucasian friend and he was constantly harassed. We ended up getting followed one day by someone we had a brief chat with, he demanded money afterwards because he had apparently given us a \"tour\". He then told us of how he lost his whole family and kept repeating \"give me my money\". We eventually lost him, but it was pretty scary lol.I got a decent leather bag but ended up paying \u00a318 more than I should of because I was manipulated by the shopkeeper. You will be asked if you want spices/hash/drugs approximately every 30-120 seconds here. Which gets annoying after a while.Definitely worth a visit though.

Being a typical man I can honestly say shopping doesn't Realy rock my boat.BUT the souks and their settings and prices are fantastic.Real bargins can be found with just a little haggling.Just remember how much the item would cost at home-remember your in morroco and walk off in a strop/huff when the merchant thinks your an easy touch, when he follows you down the dark alleyways you know you will get your bargin."

            "review": "Can't visit Marrakech and not visit a souk ..... There are a number of souks, some interlinking, others stand-alone. Some are very obviously tourist focused and others catering more to the local residents. The riad we were staying at, was off one of the passages that make up the Souk El Kessabine, which is a tourist focused souk, which leads off Jemaa El Fna square. We felt comfortable at all times when walking through the souk and although the stores shut down around 8>9pm, there is street lighting at night. Yes, vendors will try to draw you into their space, but a smile and a no thanks - or a complete blank if very persistent - works just fine. Be confident and determined and it will be respected.Don't enter into negotiation, if you have no intention of buying. Be firm if you are not interested in making a purchase. Know what you are prepared to pay and stick to your guns - be prepared to walk away if necessary. I have been haggling in Turkey for twenty odd years and the experience was really no different here. In my opinion, you can expect the final price to settle around two thirds of the vendor's initial price - a little less if you drive hard.Be aware of your belongings, just as you would be in crowded places in the UK - or anywhere else in the world if it comes to that. Don't accept anything offered as a gift, until it is established if there is to be a fee attached or if it is being offered as an addition to push the price up to a vendor preferred price and don't shake on a deal until it is clear what you are shaking on. There are bargains to be had and some lovely things to buy, just be definite on what you want and what you are willing to pay.Also beware of cyclists and mopeds in the souks - damn dangerous and strictly speaking, they shouldn't ride in the souks, but it isn't policed so it happens anyway. Really enjoyed the souks and by and large the vendors are friendly enough."

I negotiated the purchase at the price I envisioned and prepared to leave but the henna lady then insisted on the equivalent of 40 euros for the henna tattoo. We told her \"you said it was a gift,\" her answer was \"I would normally charge 250 euros, for 40 euros, it is virtually a gift.\" The majority of the crowd (all local vendors) sided with her. As I saw a no-win situation for us, I gave her 10 euros (my cab fare to the hotel). The woman was still aggressive but placated enough so we could leave.We walked 2 km back to the hotel, my wife sporting her 10 euro henna tattoo.Watch out for these \"gifts.\""

Personally, I would have been much more inclined to purchase their goods and interact if the hassle would have been toned down a bit. I much preferred the Agadir souk to this one for that reason. Still, I believe the more you experience this souk, the more you will enjoy it as you adjust to what it is. I was cautious and conscious of pickpockets and consequently had no issues there."

Full disclosure, I'm a history and art lover and this place is the perfect combination of both! - The souk is a street market that has everything from spices, textiles, art, traditional clothing, rugs, lamps, jewelry... I was over the moon happy. Tip: Get a local to walk you around the streets, it gets crowded and confusing if you don't know your way. It is helpful to know french as the population speaks little english."

I had some general directions but once you are inside the narrow passageways they all seem to look the same. If you ask a local they will be keen to show you the way but then they want payment. Anyway I had no option but to hook up with my unappointed guide and he led me past stalls selling carpets, tagines, lanterns teapots and many other exotic products. Dodging between donkeys pulling carts, scooters and cycles we finally arrived at the wool souk where I was given a demonstration of the dying process and then draped in pashminas supposedly made from the dyed wool. I was doubtful of this as I had seen the same pashminas for sale in India. Anyway I avoided buying any to add to my already large collection and made my escape. I would have liked to have seen the tannery but not wanting another guide I decided not to bother. There a what seems like hundreds of stalls but after a while you realise they are all selling similar goods. I bought some pretty pottery dishes but I could probably have bough the same thing at home for less."

Just want to warn others about the little ploy the people use (the young and the older generation)in the souks?Our experience was, we were looking at a map to find the Yves Saint Laurant gardens when we were approached by a man around 50years old who said he worked at our hotel and asked where we was headed,us thinking what a nice person. He advised us that it would be better to go at midday because it very busy with coaches doing tours in the morning. He then advised us the go into a more government regulated part of the Medina. We walked with him and then bump into his \"friend\" who just happened to be going our way.  We were shown into a rug shop where we were duped again and bought what we thought was a fair price for a rug.  We carried on with our morning and went to the gardens as planned,a must see place.  Then back to the souks again in the afternoon. Came out of the Ben Youssef and was spoken to by a young lad of about 20 years old who told us about the tanneries,still unaware by their little ploy,who then shouted to another lad who happened to be going that way.He was insistent that he was not a guide!!We followed him till we got to the tanneries. We went in but the smell was horrendous,even with the mint we were given to mask the smell. We told the owner we was leaving because my partner began to feel sick. At this point he told we had to finish the tour with the young lad. It was also at this point we had realised we had be duped in the morning as well.  He then followed us around the narrow streets for about 10 minutes making my partner very nervous and ruining the rest of our day. When he stopped another lad became noticeable. We managed to find the main square again and left The Medina.  We had paid about \u00a360 for the rug which later we seen very similar for \u00a330 in the Complexe artisanal which is situated very near The Medina. I had read so much about the souks and their little ploys to get you but they were so convincing and pleasant you get sucked in. On the whole it was a good experience but you can get very disoriented because of the many little alleys and streets. Always walk on the right and the mopeds do not care!!!!Also when you enter the entrance just past the Complexe artisanal you will pass all the horse and carriages,take heed it smells really really bad.

It is an amazing place but it is very easy just to look at the shops and get carried away haggling on silly pieces you can find anywhere. A lot is so overpriced that too much time is spent try to get it down to a reasonable price. The real gem of the souk is to see the makers at work, the tanners, the metal workers, etc etc. and just people watching, there are also some great food stalls. The carpets in the most are overpriced and poor quality compared to other places. The people are lovely to talk to if you take time. Also women Please please cover up. I met so many women who despite having been to Morocco several times still insisted on wearing vests (sometimes tight) with little to imagination and then wondered why they were hissed at or hassled (some even put it down to part of the culture and accepted it) HELLO.. Nevertheless is a great experience and place with lots to offer. A word of warning, check your change, do not flash the cash (obvious) and remember after dark when the souk shuts down it is a very different place and just looks like lots of dark alleyways easy to get lost in. You will end up being offered 'helpful' directions that sometimes lead to 'cousins' restaurants or nowhere near where you want to go. Enjoy"

You will get pestered at every stall and after a while it gets really annoying, everyone is after your money. The square has quite a lot of entertainment Inc monkeys, snake charmers acrobats and other things. Food is available all over and in the evening there are literally hundreds of of street stalls cooking in the square. As yet we haven't sampled any but there are a lot or people eating there so I'm guessing it's pretty safe to sample the food. I'll be doing it later in the week. I cannot stress enough about keeping your whits about you and not walking of with anyone offering guidance, they will tell you, not that way, it's closed and dead etc but trust your sat nav and follow it, as it works very well. My experience was one of very busy, all they want is your money and it stressed me out a little as i wanted to just wander and soak up the culture and atmosphere.

They have cottoned on to travel advice telling tourists not to allow people to \"show you how to get somewhere\" in the souk as this usually ends with payment. Now they offer to lead you for free but you only end up paying them via any commission that is added onto prices you pay at shops. Some offer false advice too. One gentleman said he was going to show us a Berber market with traditional work being showcased, he spoke very clearly to my husband about football and when asked how far away this place was from the Djemma el Fna (as we had a bus to catch back to our hotel) he kept saying 4mins. What he led us to was a tannery, a place we had no intention of visiting, there was no work on show and it took us a good 40mins to make our way out subsequently missing the bus and the second later bus to end up paying 100 dirhams for a taxi back to the hotel. It's sad as there are some real gems you can find the further you venture into the souk but so many people are not honest with help for directions, best to avoid straying too far from the entrances and stay where you can see other tourists. Prices have also rocketed by more 3 times what I paid 2yrs ago (I purchased a suede bag for 100 dirhams 2yrs ago and an identical one was now going for 400 dirhams with the gentleman originally asking for 1,000 dirhams.) Go in at 20% of their asking price and never pay more than 50% to avoid being overcharged. There's a lot of tourist tat on sale here so if you want something unique, best avoiding here as you'll pass hundreds of shops and waste a lot of time."

Bit do keep your wits about you and keep valuables and money concealed and secure.If you are looking to but be prepared to barter...its not fun if you do not. Never ever pay the opening price...you can expect to haggle then shop owners down to at least a 1/3rd of the opening price. Also be prepared to walk away if the price is not right for you. Only recommendation I would make is be firm but polite.The souk is made up of numerous different zones, with each zones specialising in a different craft or goods. So move about and explore the different areas and linger at the ones you like.The souk can be a little overwhelming to the faint hearted so I would suggest you go a few times during your stay...maybe at different times of the day and keep the visits relatively short. It can become very tiring and draining to keep telling people you don't want to buy their goods.It is a great place to go also even if you do not want to buy anything. I go for the photography opportunities but make sure you ask before taking pictures, some shop owners clearly do not like their pictures being taken but are happy for you to take a picture of their stall/shop."

There are streets that specialise in fabrics, some full ow woodworkers and others with metalworkers. The variety is amazing but it is easy to get lost. Take note of the position of the sun in the square and look up to orientate yourself. If you do get lost, there are always lots of children willing to guide you back to the square for a few dirham. Don't be tempted to visit the tanneries as they are pretty grotty. The ones in Fez are the ones to see. If you do go, expect to make a contribution to the 'cooperative' that runs it. At night, the square comes alive with food stalls and entertainment. I prefered the more specialist stalls selling a particular style of dishes to the ones that sell a bit of everything. I ate at a tiny fish stall one night and a vegetarian stall another and they were both excellent. The one I wanted to go to on the corner sold all sorts of kebabs and other meats but it was so busy I couldn't get near it! The entertainment was centerd around 2 or more people playing instruments and was really good. Others were going round the crowd looking for tourists to 'contribute' and got cross if you gave them small change... It's hard to believe everyone was having so much fun with no alcohol in sight. You have to go outside the souk for that. The Orange juice stalls were brilliant. It's a few years since I was there but a large glass of freshly squeezed juice was 10 dirhams. That's less than 70p. Have fun with the people on the stalls. They love to haggle. If it gets too much, just walk away. They can't follow you. Also don't buy fossils or geodes. Most of them are faked or dyed. The dye washes off and the 'silver' crystals (galena/lead crystals) are glued on!"

I have been to the souks in Turket, Egypt and Morocco and this is by far the most aggresive and the best at the same time. Be prepared to haggle, ignore people and have people try to sell you things constantly. Go in with the right mindset and its a lot of fun. Feeling like some time to yourself and unwinding - spend the time sun baking. We bought rugs, blankets, kitchen stuff (bowls, cups, plates) and a stack of random things. With anything the price something is worth is what you are prepared to pay. As a rule, I was normally able to settle at close to a third of the asking price, but they were almost unhappy to sell at that price. They are really happy with around half of the original price, but make sure its what you want. If you do start negotiating, I walk away unless I get the price I wanted. Only then do they normally finally drop down. We also found some wholesalers at the back who made plates and cups and got some really good prices.Be careful, its easy to get lost in here, so you may want to load your location on google maps as you leave the hotel. It can be quite unsettling if you get lost at night."

Anyone who will walk with you has almost certainly has a money agenda (taking you to a tannery, then their Uncle/brother/sister/dog's shop, e.g.). If you want a guide, get your riad/hotel to arrange. You won't get hassled then at all, probably.Taxis: their meters work (except to/from airport) - be firm, and move on to another one. Shops: if you want to buy at the cheapest cost with zero hassle, go to the \"soukamarket\" Complexe d'Artisanat on Rue de la Kasbah. Slightly ruins the magic.If lost: ask a shopkeeper. They won't leave their stall.Photos: don't take photos of people, snakes etc without asking. They have every right to insist on payment.

There's nothing wrong with bargaining, but sometimes I just don't feel like interacting with the sellers and just want to have a look, pick that and that and that, give the money and walk away. My advice is to be polite and keep your wits. You'll never get the price a local would get after a good bargaining session. So just enjoy the experience, buy what you like and never feel sorry about the money you spent. Go for the jewelry, the traditional clothing and the leather products, they are amazing!

I went once before in 2007, but I guess I was too young to remember how horrible it was. I was so excited to be there, walking through tiny alleys, enjoying the great colours and products and I was keen to take pictures of the locals and their products. It's a different reality though. As soon as you set foot in the sook, be prepared to be harassed by hustlers. They just cannot let you pass without annoying you with their products. They do not take no for an answer and I can assure you, after the 5th time (make that a few meters), it becomes VERY VERY ANNOYING. The first day, you have patience and you keep saying no politely. But it does not get any better, and I had to devise methods of not being harassed by looking down and avoiding eye-contact. Some people can make you very angry as well by blocking your way and then having a laugh when they succeeded in ruining your day. Be very careful when taking pictures, as they would expect you to pay them! People are very keen to offer 'help', but nothing is free - once they see you are a tourist and trying to find your way, they will immediately come and offer 'help', and they expect a lot of money in the end. Also, be careful of young boys who lie to tell you that 'the road is closed', and they will take you round a longer way and then ask for a lot of money in return! Be careful of mopeds and bicycles in the tiny alleys as well, as they don't care about pedestrians and are unapologetic as they whizz around. This has been a general experience in Marrakech."

Here's a word of advice, you really need to get the souks and the people who frequently deal with tourists under control if you're going to want visitors to keep coming back. From even before we got to the souk, it was a hassle. We decided to take a horse drawn carriage from our hotel (less than a mile away) to the souk to do some shopping - we agreed on a price (30 dirhams which was fair according to everyone I talked to beforehand). However, the driver decided to take us on a round about route, that probably tripled our time, and he wanted to charge us 500 dirhams instead. Outrageous!!! Eventually I \"settled\" on 200 which was more than I wanted to pay, but was enough to stop the conversation and let us go on our way.Also, another piece of advice, have the folks in the souk post SOME prices, and start hanging price tags on the merchandise like every other civilized country. The sales people in the souks could literally charge ANYTHING they want, and get away with it with uneducated tourists. Luckily we had done our research and knew what was a fair price, but having to haggle over EVERY purchase is tiresome, and honestly just made me want to leave sooner than we should have, and made the whole experience not as enjoyable. We had plans to spend 2-3 days shopping at the various souks in the area, but once was enough, and we didn't really want to come back. We don't plan on coming back to Morocco after this experience unless significant changes are made."

Le Bougainvillier was an oasis of sanity and charm. Not expensive and true Moroccan cuisine. There are bargains to be had in the souk but there's no such thing as a free lunch and so you pay dearly in other ways to save a bit of cash. The mandatory haggling is a chore. Be ready to feel sorry for kids selling meagre things as they sit in rags and all that conscience-stirring.

As one enters the area of the souk into its main square, there are musicians, men with birds, and the snake charmers. Not sure why anyone would use the word \"charmers,\" when describing the men with the snakes for they are as mean as can be. If you so much as make a move to taking a photo, one of the snake charmer's road crew will run up to you and aggressively (in a threatening manner) demand payment, even if you have not yet taken a photo. Just be careful. If you simply look, the experience seems to be fine.Once entering the souk itself, you are met with an endless number of small booths, each with an owner who shouts out to you, trying to lure you into his shop. Its fine to take a look, but be prepared to be hassled about purchasing an item. Don't worry though, as you can just walk out and, for me, they did not follow me. I also noted that most of the shop owners, once you make it clear that you will not be purchasing anything, were relatively pleasent. I think they have some sort of a code among the shop owners that they will not follow you once you leave their shop. The stated original prices for the items are high . . . outrageous actually . . . for most items. Be prepared to argue over the price and I do mean argue. Name a price 25% of asking price and be prepared to pay 40 to 50% of the original asking price. If you pay more, you are likely being ripped off. I am sure my algorithm may be imperfect, but suggest using that as a guide.You can easily get turned around within the souk and even those with a strong sense of direction will get lost, especially in the evening. It is a maze. By 7 PM, the stalls begin to close up and the tourists clear. If you stay too late, it can become scary as you literally do not know which pathway to take. Young boys/teenagers are happy to help you out (speaking facetiously) and will offer to lead you out. I saw little alternative to follow him and this young man started to lead me through a scary maze of back alleys to the point that I was worried about my safety. Fortunately I spotted a tourist and found my way out, abandoning the young man as he demanded payment. Thus, I strongly recommend that you leave the souk by 6:30 pm by following other tourists who hopefully know they way to the main square. I saw no evidence of pickpockets, but I suggest being very careful. Keep your wallet well tucked away. As you leave the souk into the main square, beware of the women trying to put henna tattoos on you. They will run up to you with something that looks like a needle, grab your arm and trying to draw on your arm. Do not let that happen, if for sanitary reasons alone.So, visit the souk for the spectacle. It is an interesting adventure."

            "review": "Venture inside. Though soukhs in other cities are claimed to be the bigger, I beleive the one in Marrakech is the largest. The difference is that the one in Marrakech is not a specifically designated area, unlike other soukhs. It's streets and alleys grown together to one big market; a large part of it is covered with corrugated roof and therefor making it even more like a whole. And it goes on and on in every direction, though the density of shops somewhat lowers on the outskirts.Don't be afraid of getting lost. Just use google maps and location services on your phone (but make sure you zoomed in on the area when having a wifi connection). No need for paying guides to get you back to the square. Enjoy shopping and seeing locals do their shopping here too.As for shopping and bargaining: we found starting prices pretty low. Still they expect you to bargain and why shouldn't you? We we're told half of the starting price is a good first bid. But I must say we did not always practise this. With prices of a few euro's we found it unfair to bargain the hard way. We like to keep in mind we're the wealthy tourists; what are one or two euros to us and what are they to them?"

This is the second time I've been to Marrakech and it hasn't changed a bit thank goodness!Here's a few tips to help you on your way around.First of all get a good street plan of the Medina and on your first day have a walk around and get to know your way to and from your Riad or hotel. Don't get too anxious if you get lost, there will always be someone to escort you to where you want to go, of course this will cost you a few dirhams, but not much.Secondly make sure you have some small change in your pocket to tip etc the endless stream of helpful people!I am concerned about previous comments about faeces and stench of urine. This is not the case. The drains aren't the greatest so they can pong a bit at times, but not all the time for sure. There needs the of reality about this place, it's not the West. If you are expecting the locals to be as hung up about hygiene as the Brits then you'll be sadly dissapointed. Look, we've got white blood cells for a reason. You'll not catch anything, so relax.A couple of previous reviews mention loads of cats and dogs. I'm not sure why, perhaps some people don't know what a dog looks like. In four days I saw a handful of dogs, let's face it they're Muslim , they don't keep dogs! You will see loads and loads of cats however. Anyone who has the misfortune of walking around a town centre in the UK on a Saturday or Sunday morning will know the real stench of urine in shop doorways, you'll get none of that in Marrakech. The main reason being that in Marrakech you don't get the drunken idiots, so refreshing. You can walk the streets safely at night, something that the UK can't offer as often. If you do not want something, you need smile and firmly say no, if you give an impression of weakness, expect to be badgered. Once you get the hang of this, everything is easy. The traders and locals will have been told no a thousand times already the same day, it won't cause a problem. Previous reviews mention being intimidated. There is no need to feel this. You are far more likely to get assaulted in the UK than here. Just remember to be very direct about what you do or do not want. If someone overstays their welcome, just tell them to go away and wave them off. All they want is your money, whilst they think they are in with a chance of getting it, they will persist, the nanosecond they realise you're not going to give them a bean they will instantaneously move onto the next soft touch. But no need to be impolite, be respectful but firm.The hundreds stalls in the souks are great to walk around, but it is easy to lose your bearings. This can be unsettling at first but there will always be a helpful soul to help you find where you are going for a few dirhams. Don't be too surprised if you ask the way to be sent in completely the wrong direction, then the helpful soul will reappear and take you there, saving the day and earning a big tip.Ladies will regularly get offered henna tattoos. Don't bother asking how long they last as if you are only there for 4 days they are highly unlikely to outlast your stay! If you allow your hand to be taken for a couple of seconds, expect an instant tattoo and request for money.The reality of Marrakech is that it is jam packed with thousands of people living on their wits. They work hard, long hours to scrape a meagre living. They don't have the welfare state allowing millions in the UK to spend a lifetime swinging the lead. As tourists we are understandably viewed as very wealthy in comparison. If we spread some of this by way of a tip here and there, it's nothing to us and a big deal for them. Personally I find the work ethic refreshing compared to the UK.Finally, NEVER EVER change money at the airport at Gatwick. The exchange rate is so bad Id rather be robbed by someone with a gun, at least you'll know you've been robbed. Use the ATMs. Unbelievably even HSBC will give you far far more currency for your money, at least 30% more."

It is bustling confusing array of narrow streets and tons of shops that sell everything. I highly recommend finding a good guide, but there are a plethora of guides around and if they have an \"official guide badge\" you can probably count on them. They at least have a wealth of knowledge about the city, and can help to find what you are looking for, or caution you about quality. Yes, they probably have favorite places and probably get kick backs, but they are very helpful if you have a limited amount of time. We found ourselves in a carpet women's cooperative, and of course expected not to buy a carpet, but the bargaining game is so much fun at carpet shops that you will probably leave with a carpet. (we did) We also went to a Argon perfumer and saw the pressing of the oil, heard about the remedies of the Argon oil, and made it out without buying though I did buy later in the mountain valley. The hustle and bustle is fascinating and the people so friendly. The amazing culture of the area include both Muslim and Jewish religions, and you can see it all right there. An awesome place to be. Keep your wallet in your front pocket and you will be fine. Drink some mint tea and relax. And, of course watch out for cars and motorbikes in the alleys as they do find just enough space to zip around."

There is a big difference going at different times of day, going late in the day means you can pick up a bargin from some of the sellers that have their goods on hand pushed carts and on cloths on the floor, where as the proper stall/shops are more expensive. We didn't go very far into the souks when we went in the evening as it's quite easy to get yourself confused if you don't stick to a rule of turning left or right only when you go in this way when you realise you've gone quite a way in you just reverse your route to get out, we did just that when we'd gone quite a ways in and ran out of shops and found ourselves in local housing. We never had anyone approach us which others had said happened to them, but we turned around and walked back and it wasn't long before we were back in the square. The souks are quite narrow and it is quite busy, not just with people but mopedes, donkey and carts, push bikes, people on horse back and in some areas rascal type vans!! They do beep their horns but it's quite hair raising at times, so if you are going with children be extra careful as we think it's an accident waiting to happen!! Our over all experience was good the sellers do keep trying to get you to go into their shop fronts but you just say no thankyou or you go and have a look and if there's something that you like the look of then ask how much and then when they say you shake your head and come in lower, the only time you don't barter is when they have an exact price on the items. If you still can't reach a price you want to pay then walk away, they don't get aggressive or try to keep you in their shop. It is somewhere you have to go to if you ever go to Marrakech."

There's definitely some bargains to be had here, but at the same time it's easy to get carried away and end up paying over the odds. There's also food markets which are mostly used by locals and you'll get to see some interesting foods there. The narrow streets are used by pedestrians, donkeys, bikes, mopeds and cars and it's sometimes a bit scary as the mopeds go really fast, but it seems to be an organised kind of chaos and there's no accidents. The leather tanneries are detectable from some distance away by the stench. They use pigeon poo in one of the processes and there's lots of dogs and cats hanging around here so overall the whole place has the mixed aromas of faeces, urine, death, rotting flesh and decay and various other unidentifiable pongs, all overlaid with the subtle scent of mint! It's absolutely filthy. Seriously. Do not wear flip flops here. Do not touch anything. Do not let anything touch you. If you have a sensitive disposition then do not go. It's not just the smell, it's the piles of rotting skin and fat and tissue and fur and faeces and rotting food and rubbish and so on that you just can't avoid. It's interesting, but disgusting!We were followed around by some guy who ultimately ended up demanding money for his 'guided tour' so we begrudgingly handed over the small amount of change we had to avoid the rising unpleasantness. We argued that he hadn't mentioned being our guide or even asked if we wanted a guide or indeed told us that he would want money for doing it but he was insistent. There was only one exit which he was blocking so we just gave in to avoid trouble for our kids. So be aware of this when you're there. Everybody wants your money."

It is mystery tour as nothing is what it seems or the price it seems. I was very nervous about going there as I had read reviews and get quite annoyed when pestered. The network of alleyways will get you lost eventually but just walk on and you will come out of them. If you show the slightest interest in anything then they will pounce on you and call you in. Even if you think you have got a deal once you get back to have a look somehow there is stuff missing or it is different. I realised that they were poor people so bartered with a smile and just thought ok will just get my pressies from one shop to save me going over the need to have everything thrown at me with confusing prices. So asked about a jilab which I had no intention of buying then focused on the scarfs that I wanted and they dropped their prices so I complimented them on that and just got the scarfs I needed for my daughters and said I couldn't afford three of each which they accepted ..... eventually. The picture shows a small street market in the souk just passed it is small alleyway on the right (going to the square) it was full of african and morrocan women and loads of kaftans, etc. It was small but I thought that the money would at least go to local women who probably needed it. Paid their asking price (which was actually quite reasonable) as charitable act. The kaftans were good quality and the price was v reasonable and most importantly it went directly to locals who needed it. I found that going into the quiet shops where they weren't trying to bundle you loads of stuff meant you got straight down to business and they were reasonably priced. Bought a tea glass in just 15 seconds and one price drop from a mature guy who was tidying his wares whereas a vigorous seller had wanted 4 times as much up the road. I am happy to barter if I have to as I don't like being ripped off but I am more than happy to give e.g. \u00a32 - \u00a33 to someone who I think needs it. I eventually enjoyed walking through the souks as I had dressed down and stayed alert, tried to look confident (even when doublling back a blind alley) and didn't browse directly - walking behind better dressed tourists helped me avoid being pestered.

It was not as good as some of the other centres we have visited (Fes for example), and is very touristy. However it was a good night out."

It is a little intimidating but if you stick to your guns, smile and walk on you'll be fine. It would be nice to be able to browse without being pounced on but you simply can't, a shame because some of the displays are amazing.

The souls are beautiful and you really feel your part of the action it's tiny alleyways the friendly Moroccan people the smells from the spice markets all made for a great experience, there is very little hassle in the soul compared to the square where they are a tad aggressive, you have to barter for everything but that's part of the fun, making deals laughing with the traders etc, I have to say it's an experience that everyone should try!! Probably not in the evening / night for a first time cause even in the day it's quite a massive rowdy busy and intimidating place!"

On the way a man approached us and said he recognized us from our hotel, he then said we were going the wrong way and he would show us how to get there. 2 hours later he was still with us!!! We could not get rid of him and he took us into the awful maze of stalls which was the most frightening experience of my life!! I didn't even open up my bag to take my camera out for fear of being mugged. Motor bikes were constantly going by and nearly knocking you over, donkeys had their hind legs tied together to stop them running away. Our so called \"guide\" would not leave us and was trying to get us into shops to spend money. Eventually we'd had enough and told him to leave us alone, he then was demanding money from us! We gave him 100 Dirham in the end even though he wanted 200, just to get rid of him. We then carried on walking round trying to find our way out of the awful maze. Another man approached saying he would help us to get to the open plaza but again he led us in the complete wrong direction and demanded money too!! There was nowhere to go to the toilet or sit down and have a drink. Eventually after walking around for what seemed like a lifetime we came out to the Plaza. After sitting down for a drink there we decided to watch the snake charmers. Again big mistake!! A man immediately put 2 snakes around my partner's neck and started demanding money for a photo. I made out I hadn't got a camera on me so he then got aggressive and said to give money for snakes. Everyone is out to con you. One so called guide even swore at us because we asked him to leave us alone. I couldn't wait to get in a taxi and get back to the safety of the hotel. The roads are so dangerous to cross too and the pavements are mostly in an awful state with large holes in them. I would never go back there again. I have travelled to quite a few countries over the years and I have never feared for my safety so much as here!!"

I have previously reviewed Marrakech Guided Tours and their educated local guide Abdul. He will show you the secrets of the Souk which most people miss completely and instead leave feeling brow beaten and bothered by the constant invitations to buy things you just don't want. I like to be polite when saying I'm not interested but a smile and shake of the head leads to even more efforts to persuade me to at least take a look. With Abdul (and other good guides) you are not bothered by sellers and instead are left to enjoy the surroundings in the knowledge that wherever he leads, you will be safe and not get lost. On this trip he took us to see a 96 year old man who has been hand stitching slippers (see picture) since before World War Two. His slippers are a wonder of an ancient and dying craft now that machines do most of the work. Abdul also takes us around the back of the stalls to show us the legions of workers squatting on the bare ground beating copper, tanning leather or engraving metal objects. He also has his favourite coffee shop in a local part of the Souk where it's just fun to watch the people. My tip to enjoy the Souk and not get lost is to hire a guide and ask to see the secrets."

So many people I had met at the hotel were talking about their visit to the Souks so I wanted to check it out and see for myself. In a way I am glad I went because it's educational in terms of seeing raw culture from your own perspective. However, the overall experience was very intimating! I'm a 20 year old student, believe myself to be pretty feisty and know how to use the word 'no', but there was something about the locals that really made me feel at ease. I have been to many markets in lots of different countries who try and haggle you into their shop but eventually lay off, the locals here actually get nasty with you and can be quite abusive. The whole environment is dirty and un-hygenic. If you're thinking of purchasing any sort of food from here, DON'T. There are flies on everything and I dread to think how they handle & prep the food. The Souks are guarded by massive 4 walls, I think many people refer to this as 'Old town'. And it's just complete poverty, which is such an eye-opener. Many pickpockets so be very careful and don't take any valuables or a lot of money. The place is insanely huge, almost impossible to walk around the whole place. From the moment I entered here, I was cleverly approached by a stranger who convinced me he worked at my hotel. He then dragged me to a spice show and returned after 5 minutes forcing me to give him \u00a380! There are also so so many forms of animal abuse which is just crazily upsetting and ruined my day. If you're easily upset by this I would advise you to give this a miss. There are drugged monkeys on chains which are trained to steal from your pockets, they are left all day in dirty nappies etc. There are also drugged and docile snakes. There were auctions to buy and skin live sheep. The whole thing was just completely insane and out of comfort zone."

Starting in the less confined but no less exciting main square where all manner of goods and services are offered, for a consideration. Whether it is false teeth, snakes, spices or freshly squeezed oranges the choice is yours. Entering the more confined and convoluted spaces of the souks, avoiding motorbikes and cyclists carrying baskets of live chickens, you are presented with a wealth of choice on all sides. We didn't feel threatened or unsafe but worried about getting lost. Leaving trails of breadcrumbs wouldn't work and there weren't balls of string long enough so we gave up worrying and went with the flow. Our first visit was exploratory, with the intention of returning to complete any purchases. This worked well as we were able to observe various negotiations and examine products, without the pressure of buying. The second, more focussed visit, produced several bargain items including leather, pottery and a rug, which we knew would be appreciated and fit into our luggage ! Our haggling experience, en-route to the desert, came in handy in the more intense atmosphere of the souks. We returned to the main square, to a cafe terrace, to witness the transition from daytime to nighttime accompanied by the sound of the call to prayer from the various surrounding minarets and the backdrop of hundreds of rooftop satellite dishes !Provided you have a good sense of direction everything else will fall into place in this fantastic environment."

By about the third time in we knew our way around better, and what to buy (or not!) and what price to expect to pay. Take your time, there are LOTS of stalls, and lots of options. Negotiation is all about you both being happy with the price, not about either of you getting the better of the other. We never felt unsafe or threatened, and just politely said 'La, Shrukran' when we were not interested. No one really pushed it. Really like walking back through there towards the end of the day, a lot less busy."

But its easy to get lost so be careful. you barter for everything (offer half what they ask). the shops and the workshops that make the items are all here in many, many streets. Huge displays of items, all sizes and colours and if they don't have what you want they go off and get it from a friend (lots of cooperatives). it can be intimidating if you are not used to haggling. once you stop to even look the owner will approach you and want to sell you something, he will not want you to walk away empty handed so if you don't want to buy simply say no politely, walk away and keep saying no and keep walking. Its the norm and they will not be offended. when you see the amount of goods for sale you wonder how they sell it all. a real experience, And ladies cover your body (not your head) out of respect, no shorts or short sleeves blouses, it will not be appreciated. go in the evening when its cooler, its open until very late. most hotels offer free buses to the centre and always stop at the souk"

I read a lot of comments on the internet about various safety/security concerns but I have to say my family and I enjoyed a wonderful day out in the Souk and whilst of course, one does need to have the safety of the children at the forefront of this experience, we personally did not encounter anything other than very pleasant, fun, playful locals who are simply trying to make a living selling their goods in the Souk. Bartering was fun and made the whole experience so enjoyable for the whole family and our children aged 9 and 15. We did not ever feel uncomfortable and not one local person was rude of offensive in anyway in fact I have experience quite the contrary here in England on occasions. The Souk has absolutely everything you could possible want to buy and the key not to getting lost is to have methodical strategy of which section to walk down and then simply return and change course. DONT WANDER OFF INTO A STREET THAT CLEARLY HAS NO VISIBLE GOODS FOR SALE AS YOU WILL BE GOING INTO AREAS THAT ARE NON TOURIST PRODOMINANT. Keep to the main square and you cannot go wrong. We went in the day and then returned at night - nightime is very different and it basically becomes a food market which lots of morrocan culture eg; Henna Tatoos, Snake Charmers, Monkeys doing tricks and local storytellers, it's a very different experience but both so equally enjoyable. Really do not be put of travelling to this wonderful place, very rich in cultural experiences for anyone!! Will definitely go again and get some more goods. One final tip - what ever the price asked go in with less than half of this and work from there, they respect a good barter and find this very enjoyable but the key thing is do not insult them and their trades as many souk sellers have family run businesses and work very very hard to produce the most amazing goods. They do business with a smile and it is important that we respect that they have to make a profit here and there and the whole tradition of this wonderful place depends on this - it is not about getting everything for a ridiculously cheap price!"

It honestly bought me some time to look at things without being hassled constantly. Of course, the moment you stop to look you will be encouraged to look for free with your eyes as it costs nothing! :)This was an enjoyable experience although very confined with bikes, donkeys, traders, tourists and locals wondering around in relatively small spaces.It's not M&S so best to accept it and immerse oneself!For me the souks were better than the square as the store owners don't touch you to try to get you in and people are incredibly polite, unlike the henna ladies in the square.At the end of the day, there are hundreds of people selling identical items and it's a wonder how anybody carves a living from this. Depending upon your mindset it's going to be very easy or very difficult to make purchases here. Not everyone is geared up to barter or to take the copious amount of clich\u00e9 flannel you'll hear over and over again. I found it a highly enjoyable experience because of these aspects to be honest. All the stall holders are incredibly courteous about you and your city or country and naturally, they are all giving you the ''best price''. I'm certain we overpaid on almost every purchase, but in context it's nothing and hopefully somebody will benefit from it.There are many stray cats and the donkeys pulling carts are straight from an RSPCA Christmas begging letter. It pulled on our heartstrings but again; hopefully by making purchases the benefits will be spread out.If bartering and tight spaces make you feel woozy, you could try the ENSEMBLE ARTISANAL. More spacious, less desperate feel to it but with many of the same items you'll see in the souks.When venturing with two tall blonde female teenagesr I was still comfortable; there was no apparent anger from anybody at the way they girls were dressed (one of them was wearing a vest) and there was no unpleasantness as others appear to have experienced.Overall a good experience I'd happily undertake again."

So much to look at - shoes, spices, kaftans, poufs, etc. - and buy!The trick I learned to negotiating is:1) do NOT speak English. I only know a few words in Arabic, so French got me through. People could tell I was not a native French speaker, and sometimes spoke in English, but I responded in French. This seemed to go over well. I have several Moroccan friends, and the prices I reported paying to them I was told were \"very good\". 2) Another trick is NOT to go to the stores at the opening of the souk - wander inside, and to the far corners. Watch the locals and see where they go. Don't stick with the tourists or you're doomed. 3) Don't feel bad about negotiating. This is the culture, and it's like an art. In fact, I really thought that was half the fun of buying. :)4) Pay in Euros. Pretty much anyone accepts them - bills, coins, doesn't matter.In the end, I'd recommend buying things like shoes (because they are so unique), which can run as little as a few euros to maybe 10 Euros for something exceptional. Poufs are also a great travel-friendly item since they come empty and flat (just fill them with bubble wrap at home). I bought 2 medium/large ones and paid about 10 Euros a piece. I also bought kaftans as pool cover-ups for family. I found a place in the souk where I could get them (from shorter to full-length) for about 4-6 euros depending on the style. The beautiful wooden inlaid boxes set me back maybe 10 Euros for a smaller one (roughly the size of my hand) with pearl.If you can do it, buy furniture. I didn't want to worry about shipping, so I didn't go there. But it is so exceptional, I wish I had. I, sadly did NOT buy any purses/bags. This is the one item I thought was overpriced pretty much EVERYWHERE I went. I mean, REALLY overpriced. I've bought cheaper bags from Moroccan street vendors in Belgium an Italy - same leather bags with the hand-hammered details. Keep in mind that while hand-made, the components (eg. zippers, liners) aren't always the best quality, so despite the cool leather colors, etc., nothing was worth what they were asking in my book. Sad - as buying a bag had been on the top of my list - but in the end, I'm glad I spent my money on other things that were more unique anyway. Plus, the leather items really do carry a distinct smell for a LONG time (I swear, I can still smell the souk in my poufs).Last note - as is everywhere in Morocco, the souk is a family-friendly place. I had my son with me every time, either in the stroller or in a carrier on my back. I've never seen a culture that is so delighted by children and so kind to them. I've never felt safer and my son was constantly smiling."

To be honest, it is not ideal for a woman or even a group of women to be travelling alone through this area as the men pass comments which are not at all flattering and just make you feel very uncomfortable. I had a male family member with me most of the time which made my experience easier. In the evening there are many stalls that offer food but I was told by our guide that it is not recommended as being the safest to eat. Overall, a very busy area, full of tourists, there are horse carts, snake charmers, various stalls around. I did not feel very comfortable seeing the monkeys chained or kept in small boxes, there was a man selling tortoises and chameleons all stuffed in the same cage. I would also advise that you do not take pictures of the monkeys/snakes (unless you are posing with them) otherwise you will be asked to pay money for doing so"

If you look lost you will find all kinds of volunteers who will pleasantly offer to lead you out or toward your destination, but the trip will end with a demand for payment. If you say you are looking for a particular item, you will have offers to take you to \"the best place,\" undoubtedly owned by a brother, cousin or friend who is handing out commissions. Just be wary, keep your wits around you, and know that you can get anything at a better price that what is initially stated. In fact, one seasoned traveler told us to start by offering 1/3 of the named price. It's kind of fun, once you get the hang of it, but you never really know if you are getting the best deal.

If you show interest they will talk to you and try to make a sale. Have a price in mind and be prepared to haggle. You will get the item for at least half they price they first say sometimes less so start low. Also walk away and they will drop the price again. Lots of weird and wonderful things to be bought. Mopeds and small vehicles drive through the narrow alleys so be careful and stand aside. Locals will also barge past and expect you to move out of their way, we took this with a pinch of salt as we are on third territory. Some are forceful with selling but walk away and say no thank you, there are a lot of people about so you soon get lost in the crowd. Have fun."

Yes some of the traders do tend to pester you to have a look at their goods, but others are happy to just greet you with a smile and be there for when you need assistance. I found that if i just ignored someone who was pestering me they would leave me alone and try the next person, if i engaged in a conversation with them (even just to say no thank you) they would continue to pester. The treasures you can find are abundant, it really is like an Aladdin's cave. You can purchase almost anything at the Marrakech Souks. Remember to haggle, ALWAYS HAGGLE, tell them what you are happy to pay. There will always be another stall selling very similar of not the same items. Have fun - it really is an experience ! x"

I got followed and the man was very aggressive towards me when I was on my own. When my boyfriend was there, there was absolutely no issues. Get lost in the souks, that's the best way to find the unusual trinkets. A lot of stalls sell the same things but the deeper you go into the souk, the more interesting it gets! NEVER pay the price they initially ask. Always pay a max. 50% of what they say. Some are harder to bargain with than others. The best thing to do it to keep your change small. Walking away from the stall is the best way to get the price you want, they know you will see a similar item a few stalls down so they would rather have the sale than see someone else get it! Make sure you watch them wrap your item in newspaper. Some decide not to put your item in at all! Be friendly but keep walking, they will ask many questions to lure you into their stall but if nothing interests you, just say 'no thank you' and keep moving. Taking pictures is quite easy as long as your not inside the stall! Get your travel buddy to stand near the stalls and use a camera phone if possible! No flash! I got lots of lovely photos of the souks by doing this and nobody asked for money. Last but not least, enjoy it! You'll have never seen anything quite like it! :)"

The woman began and finished the design in a couple of minutes, she then said that \"for good luck\" she would do a small design on my hand. I reluctantly agreed as I was wary of her motives. She agreed that this would be included in the amount already paid. Within minutes my small design had grown very large and I then told her to stop. We then tried to walk away but she grabbed my shirt and demanded more money from both of us double what my friend had already paid her. She became very aggressive and then swore at us, we managed to walk away from her, but the dealing left a very sour taste with us and shocked us.

Its amazing to see as there the variety of items on sale is actually very few but the number of stall selling the same goods is vast.

Our bus had our hotel name on it so everyone claimed they were our hotels official guides, and we should choose them. We ventured off on our own and one chap stopped to say hello claiming he recognised us from the hotel and said he would show us to get some spices (we then twigged he followed us from our shuttle bus) we declined and ventured to the nearest alleyway. The haggling side was fun and enjoyable and as cheap as you want it to be. The aromas and noises were memorable and you get carried away and follow the streets to better bargains. But then we seemed to stray into some areas that maybe didn't welcome tourists as much. People then guide or take you to areas we didn't choose to go all for a fee. By then we bumped into two others who had a street map (also lost) but 4 heads got together put us back on the straight and narrow made it an adventure again. We ventured back at different times and enjoyed it. But take a good street map or remember certain shops/cafes etc along the route or get a guide recommended by the hotel.

However, the workshops and leather markets within the Marrakesh Souk were interesting and gave an insight into how a lot of people live their lives. You have to keep your wits about you at all times because there are motor bikes and donkey carts zooming around the narrow streets from all directions. The square is very vibrant and hot during the day, unfortunately quite a lot of insistent children begging so be careful as little hands just seem to fly into pockets to see what's there. Generally though, good banter. There are snake charmers and dancers as well, very unfortunately, little monkeys dressed up in nappies but that is the Moroccans way. Everyone is out for the quick buck so be careful taking any pictures. Incredibly busy in the evening, people just pour into the square at about 6pm. Enjoyed the experience but wouldn't do it again!"

So keep in mind you will have to negotiate for everything. If they say 500 dirham give them 200 and start negotiating from there.

The best way is to find a quiet spot, keep to the wall, and take a general picture of the area and then crop it down to the spot you need. If you want to take a pic of inside the shop then find the one with a busy owner - he is unlikely to pay you any attention.Navigating: Start anywhere at Jemma El Fna and move upwards, walk as much as you want and take any number of turns - there is little you can do not to end up back at Jemma El Fna. We tried this trick a number of times - works without fail.Buying food: If you want to sample a few olive types or some sweets then just tip the owner 5-10 DH and dig in. If you want to buy some food for later, then what worked for us best is not asking the price and then trying to hustle down, but saying/showing exactly what you want and giving a small note or a 10 DH coin - this makes an impression of you knowing the price and even left us with some change a few times. The general idea is not to show any doubt over price."

The shoemakers will make a pair just for your feet for a good price and in little time. Everything is for sale and expect to haggle! It is worth checking out prices first in the Artisan market just on the outskirts of the Medina to get an idea of the prices(everything is price tagged there). Also some products are price tagged inn the souks too, generally small stuff that you won't be able to haggle on but otherwise, whatever starting price you are given, especially if you do not have a clue, offer back one quarter of it and take it from there. (example: a nice blanket was quoted for 800 dirhams, i offered 200, settled for 240 and was told i haggle like a Morrocan woman!). A true sign of under-offering is when the seller puts the item straight back onto the self and is highly offended. However once you OK-d a price, you cannot go back. As you walking along, sellers will hassle you and chitchat but you don't actually have to acknowledge them one by one, it is ok to walk by! Also they seem to have a 6th sense about where you from and will start talking in that language to you!!If you want hassle free shopping, this is not the place for you because as soon as you look at something, a person will appear and promote it to you. I must mention that they are nowhere as bad as in Egypt, for example, Morrocan souks are a lot friendlier and they don't mind if you just chat to them a little bit.No harm in saying you come back later, even if you don't!"

Sit and people watch - cool off with a fresh orange juice and make sure you visit both in the day and at night-time. Very similar and very different to Prague!"

Also we were advised it was safe and we wouldn't need a guide. As we departed the shuttle bus a man directed us to the square. We proceeded along a very narrow dirty street and tried our best to avoid being hit by the passing motorcyclists and donkey drawn carts. We arrived at the square which was full of horse drawn vehicles, men with monkeys on chains making them do tricks, snake charmers hitting their snakes with sticks to wake them up, shabby bars and restaurants and stalls selling would could only be described as junk. We walked on to the souk, which was also very dirty and narrow and we again had to avoid being hit by donkey drawn carts and motorcyclists. We felt really intimidated by the stall holders as they were shouting and grabbing at us to buy their wares. The stalls incidentally were full of the same old junk as well as fish, meat and vegetables full of flies. It was a maze and we got lost although we had a map. When we asked for directions back to the square we kept being sent in the wrong direction. By this time we were very frightened. A man came up to us and said he would take us back to the square. We were tempted not to use him but felt we had no choice. After a short time we saw some signs on the street corners which directed us back to the square and told him to go away but he kept following us and demanded money. In the end we gave him MAD20. He threw it back at us and said he wanted MAD200. We just laughed and carried on walking. As there were now crowds of people he grabbed the 20 and ran off. When we arrived back at the bus pick up point we were exhausted and realised that we had about half an hour to wait. There was a restaurant on the corner so we ordered 2 bottles of water. Believe me we were glad to get back to our hotel and would advise anyone not to go on that excursion."

We are two female friends, in our late 50\u2019s. We have travelled extensively through South America before, but this was our first time to an Islamic country. We prefer to do our own thing, book our own accommodation, usually in small B&B type hotels. We like to hire a driver for a day or two to visit areas outside the main cities. In the cities we will pick up a day tour. We also catch the local buses and trains between cities.We flew into Casablanca and were picked up by a private driver and driven to Marrakech, this we arranged through Riad Rafaele, where we stayed. This riad in the heart of the medina was a calming oasis from the madness. We arrived in Marrakech in the middle of May and it was 45 degrees celcius for our first 4 days there. Marrakech - Things we did in Marrakech: We did a half day private walking tour of the medina hoping to get our bearings and the tour ended in the main square. This knowledge didn\u2019t stop us getting lost on numerous occasions on our way back to the riad.Another day we caught a taxi to the Yves St Laurent Garden, Jardin Majorelle. The taxi driver waited for us. An hour was enough time to have a wander through the gardens. We did go early, as again it was very hot, and arrived before all the buses. Our other days in Marrakech we wandered the medina, trying different routes, sometimes getting lost, but never troubled by this. We always found our way to the main square.Places we ate \u2013 Caf\u00e9 Arabe was nice. We also had a delicious meal at Riad Rafaele but our favourite was Le Jardin, where we ended up eating three times.Found Marrakech fascinating, only the motor bikes zipping past at times was a bit too close for comfort. The people we met were friendly and helpful. It certainly wasn't the scary place people who don't travel make it out to be. We loved the different culture, religion, customs and dress, all so different to home.Just a note on appropriate dress \u2013 We wore mostly mid-calf length pants or skirts and shirts with short sleeves and felt this was quite appropriate and not revealing."

I'm sure it's part of the fun of a Souk for many visitors but I like to have a little time to think, touch and really look at things, pondering what they would go with or how to display them at home.

Some will be overwhelmed and discomfited by the merchants and touts grabbing for their attention, and others will welcome the sights, scents and sensations available perhaps nowhere else in the world. Many interesting items are available for purchase--leather goods, handwoven rugs, jewelry, clothes, food, perfume, cooking utensils--but the price is only cheap if you are willing to haggle in a good-natured fashion. Jemaa el Fna now attracts tourists but it used to, and still does, attract rural-dwellers coming to the big city to sell their wares and witness snake charmers, story-tellers, diviners, gamblers, musicians, tooth-pullers, and a cast of characters found few places else. I recommend visitors make several trips, one to case the place, another to buy items that caught their fancy earlier, and once at night to see the square transformed into hundreds of places to eat under the stars. The government has cracked down, somewhat, on overly aggressive guides. If you hire one, be sure he is identified as an official guide. He will at least shoo away other guides. I have eaten at several of the night stalls, all good, but the food can vary, from tagines in one, to kebabs in another, and chicken and sausages in a third. I recently went to stall 14, which offers calamari, fried fish, and shrimp. An excellent, hearty meal for four persons came to $12. That's not a misprint, only twelve dollars, for all four of us. If your travels seem to run together, with one city's shopping mall and museum indistinguishable from another's, come to Jemaa el Fna. One member of our party couldn't help saying, \"Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more.\""

Haggling is expected - you can cause offence if you simply offer the initial asking price (which doubtless will be too much) - try to think of what similar item may cost you at home, and offer 30% less than that - expect two or three rounds of pricing before settling - do NOT be afraid of walking away if you're not happy with the deal...

It's definitely not for the faint hearted but once you get the hang of it, it's one of the greatest experiences in the world. The trading and bartering is almost like an art! You have to really haggle well. The trick is to tell them what you're prepared to pay for the item you want to purchase. For example a scarf in UK usually costs an average of \u00a35. When buying from the souks, don't pay more than 70 dirhams equivalent to (\u00a35) The seller would usually start very high but always haggle for half or even less. Let's just say the seller is selling a scarf for 130 dirhams, just say you're willing to pay 50 dirhams. Then the art of negotiating happens. It's really fun! You will earn their respect if you've done really good bargaining. Enjoy! "

While the first afternoon was useful in terms of understanding the various sectors in the souk (potters, leather, dyers, metal goods etc.) it was a bit sanitised because the guide kept us on the move, and clearly had a couple of 'tame' shops in mind for us to visit. We had a lot more fun on the 2nd visit, and were able to have a couple of good 'haggles' for some local pottery and a top for my wife. Haggling rule 1, never take the first offer seriously. Haggling rule 2, for the best offers walk towards the door or even into the street. Haggling rule 3, always remember you don't have to buy at the end.One thing to be aware of, there is no 'street map', and if you ask a local for directions, he will insist on accompanying you and you will have to pay him. Seemed a very safe environment, no hesitation in recommending it."

Every store owner calls you out trying to drag you into their lamp/sword/jewelry store while young kids chase you around asking if you are lost. It really is a magical place that is a must see.As a tip - I've found that you can barter most places down by half the price before they get too angry at you. Do not ever agree to their first offer as I guarantee, they will be willing to work with you just to make the sale."

I visited the souks a couple of times, once in the day with my friend and once a night with my friend and some other girls we met at the hotel resort. Stupidly we first visited the souks at night and it turned out to be a very scary experience. We had almost finished our shopping and this man was trying to sell me a pear, he didn't have a stall or anything, just a pear! I ignored him and carried on walking and I realised I'd obviously offended him when he began chasing me and my friends down the narrow souks. He was clearly unstable or on drugs, but that didn't matter after he threatened to kill me! The stall vendors obviously knew this man and were very nice and chef him out of the market, telling him to leave us alone, but this put a massive downer on our holiday. I understand that this could happen anywhere but I thought it was best to mention it so other travellers were aware. I would definitely recommend that you visit this place with a boyfriend or husband, as the couples didn't tend to get as much unwanted attention, especially from the men. On a lighter note, when we visited in the day everybody was really friendly and the hassle was more banter than anything else. One very nice tour guide on his day off offered to take us to the tanneries, as it was the last day and wanted a thank you and no money. The stalls sell all the same thing so have a good look around and haggle your socks off. One vendor was selling a souvenir for 150dhs and another was selling the same thing for 30dhs, so there is a huge difference. One piece of advice we were given is to always walk on the right hand side of the souks, as mopeds, horse and traps and every other mode of transport will fly down the narrow streets without a care in the world. Overall a great experience and a definite must if you're visiting Marrakech.......just be careful at night."

On the one hand it is a great experience with all the shops and produce. However I felt this was tainted by the incredibly unpleasant behaviour of the hustlers and local vendors. I felt intimidated, pestered most of the time (I am a pretty widely travelled man and not easily intimidated). I also think these people spoil their own business: People would actually buy more if they could wander around and browse in peace. One vendor pulled my arm (literally) and shouted abuse at me for not buying his produce. Another called me a racist because of my refusal to buy and a third one cursed me and my remaining holidays. Therefore, despite all the interesting things on offer I think of the cities I have visited in the last couple of years Marrakesh is the one I am least likely to recommend. I was actually planning to come back here at some stage with my girlfriend but have now decided against. I don't think this is a place to bring a woman and would also caution single women against visiting this place. I think this place needs some clean up and perhaps either government intervention or an initiative by traders to establish some standards."

Good bargaining skills can reduce that first price by at least 50%, and for those who are highly skilled at haggling even more.Getting around without getting lost is neigh impossible, but do not worry getting lost is part of the fun.Few bathrooms are available so take that into account before venturing out of the main square where a number of cafe and restaurants have facilities."

We had a guide which I believe helped us to not be harassed as much as we would have been without one. He also took us to the more up-scales shops which were much more expensive and we were really looking for the bargains so make sure to tell them what you want before starting out. If you are heading to Fes after Marrakech save your purchases for there. We found much better prices and you felt as though you weren't going to be ripped off as much (maybe just an illusion?) Also, we were told by our guide in Rabat that the pure Argon oil is found in Fes and that they mix oils in Marrakech and sell it as pure but I can't say if this was true since you really can't tell the difference looking at it. We bought it at a co-op in the mountains hoping that the young girls making it would end up with more of the profits. Enjoy the ride!"

So go on an organised tour if you're not sure of your way around. Keep to the right when walking because there are mopeds everywhere riding up and down, so watch out! Fascinating place to watch artisans at work because here, different to our society, they repair things not just throw away and buy new. Be careful with photographing without first asking permission. People, on the whole are very accommodating and friendly and will agree. But beware, some expect payment and if you photo without permission they can be very aggressive in demanding payment. And you MUST barter, it is expected."

(Eg monkeys dressed up on a chain, snakes in bags, with their 'charmers' at hand, young turtles crammed in tanks, beggars with babies, food cooked in black filthy oils, women keen to grab you and start their henna 'art'....the list goes on).Nonetheless, it is different and certainly an experience! If you like to get a good deal and want some of their goods, then it can be fun to bargain. But be aware that you need to be quite abrupt to get rid of the persistent hassle to 'just look'! That is not the case.Good photo opportunities, however be wary of taking picture of locals. Most are far from keen, some clearly not happy and others only ok if you pay up front!!"

To stroll the Marrakesh Souks is quite an adventure but one realizes after a short while that although the Souks are rather large, most shops and their offerings are repetitious and identical. It is either blankets and leather, pottery, fake Argan oil and spices, or brass. Also, some of the sellers tend to be a little too aggressive which is a turn down. If you have ever been to a bazaar in Turkey with their large varieties and charming sales guys you will understand the big difference in having fun and having to feel uncomfortable at times."

It's like visiting London but not seeing Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Westfield etc. The souk is massive but there is no danger of getting lost as you'll eventually find your way. Best way to navigate is at each turn take a picture of a shop or sign and then try and come back same way. Do try and keep with the crowd. There are many foreigners here. Avoid walking into quiet alleyways for precaution. It's all about bartering here. Keep haggling and eventually they will succombe to you. The shops are repetitive so there are many options for clothes, leather bags, shoes, wooden crafts, souvenirs, spices and herbs etc. Do try some of the cafes inside the souk. Cheap! Some cafes do food. It's very nice. Many children beg here. Some sell tissues. Be careful when giving change as you may be hounded by other children. Sad but reality. The souk is the pinnacle of Marrakech. Best time to shop is mornings/early afternoon. After 7pm it's too busy but the buzz is amazing."

They will soon leave you alone.2) If you want to haggle, aim for a 1/3rd of the price they want.3) Go into the souks and come back out after an hour on your first go, acclimatise yourself before going in for another go.4) Go with 50 drm notes, if they see you with large amounts they'll want more money.5) Avoid the monkies on chains dressed as Messi, not cool.6) The snakes are harmless, don't be afraid.7) If you don't want to pay for anything, don't stop and look, especially the snakes and henna ladies.Enjoy it, it's brilliant, if not chaotic.

Pay attention at your pocket and be careful when taking pictures - Moroccans don't like it so much, and if you don't buy from them, they may ask you for money for the picture. The best is to take pictures on those from whom you buy. Also, if you are not interested do not ask prices or start a negotiation.Try to know the 'OK' prices for the products before - in your riad or something.If your lost, ask where the central place is, they will tell you. (Do.not accept fake guides to do it for you)Do negotiate!!! You will expect that. Sometimes they ask 4 or 5 times the price.When the price is fixed and written there, it is more difficult to negotiate."

It's expected. Some sellers are more desperate than others but don't make you feel pressured. They will all ask you to come in and look.

My husband did an initial visit on our second day with our oldest son (10) to get his bearings, know where the shuttle stopped etc. a couple of days later, I joined them with our younger son (7). We went around 6 o'clock so it would be a little cooler (once inside the main medina (walled area) within the main square, it is covered so much cooler. It can be quite daunting for younger children because it's busy, noisy with lots going on. There are snake charmers, holy men, monkeys wearing nappies and footy kits. Be careful not to take pictures as the handlers will badger you for money. There are also lots of ladies offering henna tattoos. I declined but one lady grabbed my hand as I walked passed and started drawing on my hand. The children were fascinated so I let her carry on and had to pay her what I thought it was worth (10 dirhams my not impressed husband had to hand over as he had nothing smaller!). As nice as the tattoo was, not a good idea if you have to hold on to a child's hand. That said, it takes 10 minutes to dry but it lasted approximately 2 minutes before being smudged by my son so i had to buy some wipes to rub it off (and from my sons hand) as well as the annoying glitter they also sprinkle on!!! there are hundreds of shops and stalls. The vendors try to get you to come in but a polite no thank you is all you need if you're not interested. I certainly didn't feel hassled and despite my reservations, enjoyed the experience of watching my husband barter for 'genuine fakes!' as the vendors called them. When we came out of the medina (8.30pm) all I could say was 'wow!'. The square was packed, lots of people everywhere, loud morrocan music, wonderful smells coming from the food stalls-it really came alive. The smell of horse poop when you walk passed the horse and carriages (for rides around the town), was quite overwhelming so hold your breath. There are elderly people and mothers with newborns begging for money which can be upsetting but as long as you keep you children held tight, you should enjoy this experience. We ended up going 4 times in total (my husband is a shopaholic!) so it can't be that bad!!"

The firat time i visited was a little daunting, avoid all the guides that are waiting as you get off the bus, there are some will say they work for your hotel and charge no money..this is sometimes trueas they get commission from the stalls they take you too and i have spoken to people in my hotel that found this a good way to get orientated but its your choice.The square is very large so make sure you remember where you came into it if you need to get back to a pick up point, our hotel shuttle dropped us at least 2 streets back so it was a bit of a maze.Don't be tempted to buy at the first stall, if you go right into the Souks then you will eventually come to the less commercial and therefore cheaper goods. They are all selling more or less the same things overall and some is better quality than others.I wasn't sure how i would be with haggling but as i heartd one stall holder say its how we do business, it is like a game in a way and i wasn't as bad at it as i feared. Decide what you want to pay and if they say no just walk away, i guarentee they wil come after you and accept eventually.In the square are snake charmers etc, try going into one of the rooftop cafes for a better view, we had lunch and it cost me about \u00a312 for the 3 of us, i had a chicken and veg terrine , my 2 sons had toasties with chips and we all had drinks so very good value.I am told it is another world again at night time but i didn't experience thsi as the hotel shuttle stopped at 6pm, however there are trips you can do.I now have some very nice coloured tea lanterns in my garden, as do my frineds, a lovely wicker basket, bracelets, sunglasses, purse and a couple of pictures on my walls all thanks to the trip into the Souk. Have fun but be careful of your money!! Also beware that if you want your family to take a photo of you with a snake around your neck or a monkey on your shoulder they will charge you so negotitate first. Similarly if you get a taxi to the Souk make sure that you agree a price before getting in.Enjoy :)"

This was my first time in Marrakech though.At the beginning it was very overwhelming and to be honest i was not enjoying it a lot. 95% of the guys at the souk are very very agressive and as soon as you ask for a price, they refuse to let you go. Then, they will get very angry. It was very annoying that you could just not ask for a price. It was energy consuming trying to deal with these guys.Then, I just relaxed and I really enjoyed the souk. If you are really not interested in buying something, better don't ask for it. I know it shouldnt be like that, but thats the way it goes.If they tell you a price, ask for at least 70% discount of the price they are giving you. Then start working for the price you really want. Sometimes its just hard to judge, so ask yourself how much would you be wiling to pay for it. If no agreement is made, walk away gracefully. Dont get caught up in their intimidations techniques! Better not to accept coffee or tea as that is one of their little tricks to catch you.The first day I got caught in a carpet shop trap. It was near our Riad and we decided to go in. Big mistake. We did want to buy carpets, but rule #1 is dont buy from the first place you visit. We wanted to visit a few places and then compare to make an educated decision. We stayed in this shop for about two hours as this guy would not let us leave!!!! He got sooo angry that it was our cue for not to buy from him. He was asking 22,000Dhs for 2 carpets. Then we saw the same carpets somewhere else for 4000Dhs.So anyways. Be smart, keep it light and enjoy!"

Our guide took us to dye workshops and ironmongers. It was fascinating to see everybody just about their daily work. Our guide also helped us a lot with batering.

When asking for directions the always wanted money and if you ignored them you would be shown the wrong direction.We were totally conned as we were invited to go into the Tannery, which smelt horrendous, and afterwards we were expected to pay them for this event.

A great suggestion is to visit a price controlled shop (Theres one outside Hotel Medina Gardens All Inclusive) before you head into the labyrinth of stalls to get a basic idea of what to pay for items. You might think you got a great deal haggling down that wooden dinner tray from 1500 MAD down to 600, but find that the price controlled shops sell it for 300. Be willing to walk away and don't show too much interest. Give an honest and fair price, but don't ever \"feel sorry\" and overpay. Know what you want to pay and don't go above it. Treat it like buying a car. A word of caution: Outside the souks are many \"snake charmers\" and a long stare at their reptiles can often garner an unwanted approach with a snake in hand."

I was lucky to be with my partner and didn't get too much unwanted attention (as he's quite big) but a girl we met on the plane said she wished she had been with a man as her and her two friends received lots of unwanted attention. I was worried before I went about what to wear - I though I had to cover up a lot - but there were lots of tourists wearing stroppy tops and short shorts and nobody batted an eyelid! I wore vest tops and either skirts to my knee or three quarter length trousers and they were fine! I also invested in some walking sandals before I went! They weren't the most attractive/trendy/cool shoes I'd ever bought but they were fab for all the walking!! Haggling is a necessity - never give them their first price and if your'e not happy walk away - they will follow you if they know you offered a good price and if not - there are plenty of places with exactly the same things!! The evening was extremely busy and loud - but a fantastic experience!! Loved it!"

It is great to get lost in the narrow streets. Sights and sounds unlike any that you have probably encountered before. There are signs around to help you navigate the maze of streets but you will end up lost keep a map close by and you can use your phone to navigate your way out but keep it secure. You have locals trying to get you into their shops as that is their custom. Although annoying try and not let it get to you and remember to barter and haggle when buying something."

Everyone is trying to get your attention to bring you into their shop, but they take care not to cross the line and pass the limits. You can get dinner, juices, souvenirs, see the snake charmers etc. I would highly recommend to everyone, especially in the evening. It's open until 1 am.Do cross the streets carefully. It can be a bit challenging at first. Enjoy!"

The place is very vibrant, bustling and colourful with thousands of different things to buy and see. We spent a good couple of hours just wandering around and taking it all in. My only complaint would be about the treatment of animals here. I am totally understanding of the fact that it is another culture and differences are to be expected, however some parts I did find unnerving. I wanted to go on a horse and carriage ride around the town but when I reached the front of the queue, I saw the man mis-treating his horse and so I changed my mind about this. There was also a group of men holding a large monkey in chains. They placed this monkey into my shoulder without asking for my permission and when I told them to take it off as I felt uncomfortable, they angrily demanded my boyfriend gave them money and followed us until we paid something. I completely understand this is how they make their money and we did try to keep an open mind when visiting but this experience did intimidate me and would make me wary of returning. However I imagine this was a one off as most of the people there were very friendly, pushy but still friendly, and so I would still recommend the souks as an interesting place to visit (just be careful around the monkey men!)"

            "review": "Your senses will be blown - sights, sounds, smells simply fabulous - see my tips on bargaining. Souk is what they call the market area in Marrakesh. It is full of shops and market stalls selling everything from tourist items, to leather goods, to deli food. Go with an open mind, enjoy this cultural experience.Most people spoke English and if they didn't, they would go and get someone they knew nearby who did. People were friendly, welcoming - even if you didn't buy anything. Yes, they are pushy and bargain hard but consider this an experience. I would suggest you divide their price by 6 and start there, moving up to no more than dividing it by 4. If you go even half of their price, they know they have an inexperienced person on their hands and will take you for even more!Be prepared, they will come up with every hard luck story to get your sympathy to pay more - it's all an act, don't fall for it. Walk away if you're not happy with the final price, they ALWAYS come after you and try to bargain even more, then eventually give in at your price so be strong. Keep a smile on your face and remember it's not personal, this is their way of life. Spices - smell them all and try them all, ask how to use them in cooking and learn a new flavour, then bargain for them. Same with delicious olives and preserved goods (see pics).When walking through the undercover markets, keep a lookout up to the roof for signs that tell you the exits which lead to different areas of the Medina. Very handy to leave at the correct exits. Don't worry if you miss a few - all paths lead back to the market and signs will indicate further opportunities to exit where you thought you had missed one. Walk close to the stalls to avoid being in the way of cyclists, motorbikes and carts. Very important - learn to say \"thank you\" and \"please\" in Arabic - they will appreciate that you've made an effort to learn their culture and always thank them even if you don't buy anything, it's all about respect."

Be wary of locals telling you that the tanneries have their last day and you must see them. This is a lie and they simply want your money for guiding you. Politely decline.We went back on the Saturday night and it was like a different place. Full of life and so much going on. There is no need to be scared or feel unsafe.

No.2 expect to go up from your offer e.g. he says 1000 and you say 500, he says 900, you say 600 until you usually meet halfway 750. No.3 This works especially in the souks. If he/she doesn't budge don't be afraid to walk away as they will come after you if they want to sell if not you will defiantly find another shop selling the same item a few feet down.No.4 Have a sense of humour and don't get too strung up with a bad experience it's all part of the fun and if you buy and find another one cheaper it doesn't really matter as you've bought an item you really like.

I will warn potential visitors - if you choose to walk down the extremely narrow pathway that separates all the food carts, be prepared for a confrontational experience that exceeds all those prior. They will do everything possible to engage you and have you stay for a meal, and very little you say will discourage that. The approach generally starts with friendly and welcoming (Hey, you Kiwi? Please sit, the other restaurants are no good!!\"), then after a few \"sorry just looking's\", it shifts to trying to guilt you (\"why won't you stay and talk to me man, what's your problem?!\") and finally aggression (\"GET LOST THEN!\").

Especially as its much cooler than out in the sun.The real beauty is that you never feel threatened or unsafe no matter how lost you are despite the constant buzz of mopeds and scooters down the narrow lanes, the people are friendly and there are signs hanging directing you to the Jamaa el Fna square all over. The stall owners were nowhere near the pushy, blocking ways of Tunisia / Egypt with most inviting you to have a shufty or a gander and leaving it at that.The stalls close to the square do just tend to sell all kinds of fakes and cheap import goods, so you have to immerse yourself to find the true craftsmen but they are there.Haggle hard and you can get some good deals, the fixed price shops are expensive and generally just used by tour guides to claim their commission."

I have always found Marrakesh intriguing and have been drawn to visiting for many years. Well I finally made it and it didn't disappoint-it is like a well kept secret that I fell in love with but am desperate for others to experience as well !The souk was a 10 minute walk from our hotel via Jemaa el Fna which is the central square at the entrance of the souk. Once you were through the main square you were presented with several alleyways which I am sure I never took the same one twice. Each one winds its way through the souk and I never really knew where it would lead me but this added to my experience. As a women you do draw attention-remember to dress respectfully with your shoulders and knees covered. I also wore my sunglasses as this enabled me to glance at a sellers goods without them knowing what I was looking at and not be pounced on ! A friendly but firm no always did the trick though and my pigeon French was always appreciated. I loved haggling-Moroccan slippers, leather bags and scarfs are a steal if you are prepared to bargain and remember they won't sell for a ridiculous price so don't be afraid to start low. Don't flash your money or wallet, keep map reading for a drink stop and be streetwise-also look out for mopeds as they speed through the alleyways !Don't be tempted to be taken anywhere from the souk by a guide or a friendly local-you will end up.at a friend's shop or the Tanneries and be expected to buy something."

You'll find yourself back at the main square before long. Look up there are often signs at junctions.I recommend walking deeper than the first 200 yards or so, that's for the tourists, go deeper and you'll find the souk has speciality areas and is still the main place for the locals for many items. Don't be frightened, it's safe inside, just a little confusing and can be hot, so take some water.Be aware that this is a working market and expect to meet donkeys, carts, motorcycles and the like. The motorcycles can be a pain, but the rest is pure souk delivery at its finest.Remember, be prepared to haggle, even half the initial price is still too high, be prepared to walk away, they'll chase you back if they want the sale and then you have the advantage.Overall, go in and wander about, expect to lose at least 2 hours easily, and just soak up the atmosphere...."

            "review": "Amazing experience but not for everyone.... Souks are the traditional market places or Morroco. They are sperated into various areas such as spice sellers, metal workers, tanners, or food markets, shoes, materials and herbs etc.The souks can be found off from the main square in Marrakech. Me and my friends made the mistake of going there around 5pm and this was stupidily hot. I reccommend going either later on as we were told they shut about 9.30pm or earlier in the day and not in the height of the heat. If you are a strong person that can say a definate 'no' and really dont mind being bothered or hastled or ogled at (mainly the women in this case) then you will get in and out of the souks fine if however you are of a nervous nature and cant handle people being quite pushy i suggest maybe this isnt the place for you. If you do go... go with a open mind and a friendly smile - i found if i said no and with a smile and wave of the arm the guys would stop trying to get me in their shops. On the other hand I have a tattoo on my leg which got many a comments together wolf whistles and remarks but im quite a strong girl so this i just brushed off with a pinch of salt and ignored. I know some people woud not like this at all but at the same time this place is renound for behaviour like this. When buying anything from the stalls do haggle with a smile and a friendly approach. We managed to get some good haggling done and save alot of pennies. I do think though the further you go into the souks the more haggling can be done as the first few shops at the start didnt seem to budge on price but the further we went in the more haggling we did. When it comes to buying the fresh orange juice from the stalls in the main square be very careful and specific on what you order. The orange juice is 4 dirhams but the other juice shoots up to 15dirhams and they will try and get you to buy that without making it clear on the price. The orange juice is really lovely and refreshing. Be assertive of your surroundings and people coming up to you, use common sence and be aware of your personal possestions and bags, wallets etc. We didnt come across any problems but im well aware some problems may occur. Be smart but really enjoy the experience, have fun and take in everything around you that you would not see anywherelse."

The pharmacist did a presentation about all their herbs and spices and what they could to enrich our lives, he was very funny and we parted with our cash.

THey follow you with Snakes and Monkeys you try get money out of you. You are almost knocked down by people on scooters. I would never go again you can not shop in peace.

Watch out for pickpockets as we had a phone stolen at the top end of the souk these seemed to be a more of locals aera with very few tourists around and we did stand out a bit just one of those things , it did not spoil our trip to Marrakesh. We brought some leather bags, scarfs, Shoes in the souk and after a bit of haggling got decent prices."

You have to have a good mind set to enjoy it...which, over-all I did.Best parts: Super interesting seeing a culture so different from mine, booths arranged in an esthetically pleasing manner, vibrant, lots of photo ops......doors in souk especially, good food, when by the spice and perfume booths the smells are awesome, goods can be purchased very inexpensively. If you've ever been to Mexico or Bahamas, or the like, this will be familiar territory.Worst parts: Lots of scooters, bikes and people, very aggressive sellers, lots of beggars and people who \"help\" you - but really drag you to a booth to buy crap, there's a lot of trash and feral cats everywhere, and it's VERY CLAUSTROPHOBIC. Ramadan difference....the souk clears out right near sunset and a calm descends over what was a cacophony just moments before. All of a sudden, your head clears, you can actually enjoy each artisans' wares without the constant pressure of having him show you 497 variations of the same item with a constant narrative of the benefits and quality of his product over the other identical products. The booth owners become less frenzied, and there are far fewer scooters to avoid. But as soon as everyone finishes with prayer and meal, watch out! The chaos is ten fold compared to what it was earlier! The square fills to the brim with revelers.  If you can find a place to sit and have tea on a roof top cafe, do so. It will make your experience of the souk better....the bird's eye view is pretty amazing."

Our riad was about a 3 minute walk from the souks & we visited them nearly every day. At first, it is extremely overwhelming, the mopeds speeding down tiny little alley ways, how dirty it is, cats EVERYWHERE & sellers coming at you left right & centre wanting you to come in their shop. We got used to this very quickly & soon just took it on the chin. 99% of the time, the people in the souks are very kind. The first couple of days I think we were being typically British & ignored the sellers but when we started smiling & saying no they were perfectly happy & we even had a bit of a laugh with them sometimes too.Moroccans are the best salesmen in the world so bartering here is a must. On average if you barter a third of the price you'd get a good deal But if they don't accept your offer, just simply say no thank you, walk away & they'll soon agree. Getting completely lost in the souks is totally normal & really fun. You get a taste for real morrocan life & gain insight into the daily life of living in the medina. Just don't let people give you directions as they will most likely want money. We traveled over Ramadan so it was pretty quiet during the day & rammed at night time up until 1am As a tourist you don't have to cover up but out of respect for the Muslim women I always had a scarf on hand to cover my shoulders. This definitely helped with getting less attention. I would definitely recommend this to all tourists."

There are also tortoises and other creatures in less than adequate cages which is upsetting to see, but you have to get passed that and head to the Souks. Here, my advice is to at least halve the price as to what they're asking for, then re-negotiate. Stand your ground on a fair price and if they won't budge, walk away - they will call you back I promise and you therefore win!

One of our favorite stops was the wood workers, who were carving chess pieces in front of us using the Berber \"black and decker.\" We were approached and called to shop regularly, however we politely declined and moved on. Our hotel gave us the recommendation to wait to purchase any items until the end of our stay. A smart suggestion because we wanted so many different items. One thing to note- many people were adamant about no pictures until you purchased something. Also, if you like something, ask for a business card and try to make your way back after the visit.

Don't expect to buy a bunch of stuff for a low price, even with bargaining, it's a bit pricier than one is led to believe.

When you get to the souk as soon as the traders spot you they are calling you to look in their shops. I would advise only stop at the shops where you genuinely want to buy something. If you slow down just to take a look at something they will pounce! Most are friendly and when you say no, mean it. Walk away and don't look back, then they will leave you alone. We only had one guy who was quite intimidating. It is a fascinating place, like going back in time. It can be confusing as to which direction you are walking but just go with it and you will come out into the open air eventually ! They have some beautiful goods but to be honest I would have bought more if I could have just looked without being hassled. We were told to offer a 1/3 of the price the traders ask as a guide to what the goods are worth. But as you are buying its up to you. We went during the day and at night. I would recommend going inside the souk during the day. At night we only went to the square not inside the souk as it was quite scary. The whole square was alive and buzzing with people, babies through to grandparents, snake charmers, traders, motorbikes! It was so noisy and as it was Ramadan it was extra lively.

But we soon learned how to navigate through the narrow alleys and through the maze to get where we were going. The Vendors are friendly, helpful but slightly aggressive in their efforts to lure visitors to their shops. After all they need to sell their wares, and they offer many fine products. All of these things would add up to a first rate experience for any shopper if not for the near constant flow of motorized scooters and motorcycles through the souk during the day. One quickly learns to keep as far to the right as possible, and more than one shop keeper kept us from being hit; but these motorized vehicles would fly though the alleys and narrow streets, weaving in and out of pedestrians with practiced skill. I only had one occasion where I actually thought I was going to be hit but he dodged at the last minute.To be fair, let me say that all of these bikes had good mufflers because noise was the least of the problem with them.Were it not for the issue of these non commercial motorized bikes, I would have given this attraction a much higher score. Otherwise the Souk seemed very safe during the day and at night. I actually felt safer here than in many American cities I have visited and lived in. The Souk is definitely worth visiting.

We stayed at the area:EL MOUKEF, MEDINA, MARRAKECH, MOROCCONot a good area.We walked to the souk, the streets were hard to navigate due to poor signage.We knew which way we were going but there are many young men who can speak English and offer in a very friendly way to help you get to the souk. But they point you to the wrong direction according to the map, we were warned by the riad manager.But when you ignore them and say no thanks, they start to swear at you in English continously.One man grabbed the map from my husband's hand and told me that he will \"f#*#@ me!\" And started chasing me.We went the square of the souk where one local was beating up a tourist. On the way home, a young lady was running from a man and jumped into our taxi before she was assaulted.Some merchants in the market are rude and aggressive.Things to know:1. The young men will purposely mislead you so when you panicked, another gang member will offer to help you only if you pay them.2. You need to bargain and start at 1/3 of the price. Maximum 50%. Don't worry as all the shops sell the same thing. You can always say someone in this market will give me the price I want as you all sell the same thing.3. Women- don't ever walk alone4. Food- eat cooked vegetables or peeled fruits. Don't drink water unless you open the bottle. Watch for certain brands as they used recyled water. Soltane is a good brand.5. Walk with your back in front of you, use money belt.6. Better with a guide as they leave you alone. Get a certified guide, Youssef Karroubi is good.7. Some parts of the market is better as the people don't harass you.8. Watch for motor cyclists speeding in the pedestrian ally way.My opinion:I am a seasoned traveller having travelled to poor areas to the Philippines, China. And have been to Italy, Turkey, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Cuba, Mexico and many other places. I can deal with pick picketers as they are non- violent. You just need to be cautious.There are other places to go aside from Morocco. It is the most backward country. I know the country wants to promote tourism to get money but you cannot change the mentally of the people especially in the poor area. Women are still considered 2nd class citizens. There are many nice people but the bad ones just ruin the whole country for them.Because of this - I appreciate my home, Canada even more.The riad was beautiful and the staff did everything to make our stay nice and were apologetic of their people. But it was not their fault."

Some real artisans are here (e.g. the lock maker, the lamp maker) as well as many vendors who just want to sell you cheap tourist items.

If they see that you are lost, a bunch of them will follow you to help you / point you to the right direction. It can be scary if this is at night because each of those expect monetary compensation.

I would definitely recommend not using a guide. They tend to direct you to the higher priced stalls/shops deep within the souks whom we suspected they had prior arrangements with. The souks are easy to find anyway and we found the second visit far less stressful and were able to enjoy the atmosphere and visual displays more. Beware though, if you pause for too long to admire or wonder at anything you will soon find a snake or monkey being draped over you or your hand being decorated with henna...for which you then have to barter a deal for something you didn't ask for in the first place. Stallholders will thrust items into your hands in an attempt to secure a sale. They will also try and charge you if you take photos in some of the areas so be aware of this. Don't make the mistake of thinking the deeper you venture into the souks the better bargains you will find.This was not what we found at all. In fact we secured better bargains and found the tenders were more open to bartering in the stalls just off from the main square. The smells of spices and argan oils create a unique smell within the souks which will both delight and confuse your nostrils at the same time! Expect to get dirty when you visit the souks. They are dusty and dirty. You have to be prepared to be firm and not be afraid to say no to people. We found it a great experience and got some beautiful unusual items at great prices to bring back home. Worth a visit, just be prepared for the reality that the souks are a little crazy."

They don't give you a chance to stop and look before they are over harassing you into buying. I found them vocally and sometimes physically aggressive. Understandably tourists are a great source of revenue but some of the prices they quote are astronomical, be prepared to bargain and bargain hard. I found that I got some souvenirs at around 30% of the initial asking price, in one case I got it for 10%. Beware too of the motorbikes and mopeds that drive all around the souk, without lights too at night! A sudden step and you could get an injury.

Once you've seen a few stalls, most are selling the same kinds of things, but still great for an exploreNegatives - if you stop and look, this creates an expectation that you will buy. This became frustrating when you wanted to stop and look, then think about buying. Pressure to buy was everywhere and you must be prepared to haggle as the starting price they quote is generally 3/4 times what you'll actually pay. Avoid anyone who offers to be a guide, or even a friendly face offering directions, unless you're happy to pay. We were \"guided\" to the tannery, which we weren't planning to go to, but having been giving a very rough direction by a lad in the street, ended up with 3 people hassling for money. If you're female, cover up. I was spat at even though by Western standards my shorts and t shirt were not revealing, this wasn't an experience I'd like to repeat.

I saw a top which I liked, the guy asked for 370 Dirham (about \u00a326 at the exchange rate I got), I suggested 50, he eventually agreed to 60 (about \u00a34.20). We got beautiful leather slippers for about 50 Dirham after the original price they gave was 250. Nobody was rude at all, but they were very persistent and at times once we got in the shops they did block the doorways so we couldn't get out, we just remained firm and asked them to let us leave. We also got a couple of people giving us unrequested tours, who obviously then expected money for their help, again a firm 'No' is enough to fix that.

Unlike some North African countries we have visited, Marrakech is fabulous."

I would recommend a guide as it adds interest and you see things you would otherwise miss. Also some parts are a little unsavoury so be careful. Yes you will be hassled but just smile and keep saying no thank you and they will leave you alone. Beware the scooters too, and keep a hefty hand on your valuables. Other than that, enjoy!"

The souks are indeed in a maze of little streets (we accidentally left the shopping area, followed an alleyway and ended up in someones house) however they occupy a small area so keep going or come back on yourself and you'll end up back in the main square. Don't be fooled into accepting a guide, they will take your money and lead you to shops they get commission from - you are fine on your own. Many stalls sell the same sort of touristy stuff but there are some real Aladdin's cave's in their so don't be afraid to look around and have a good hearted haggle!

The spice displays are amazing! There's something different around every corner - and it's a photographer's dream! One of our fave pics is a young shepherd boy with a live goat wrapped around his shoulders, possibly on his way to the meat market.We were given great advice by our Riad hosts to \"get lost, relax and enjoy the experience\"... When purchasing anything \"bargain the prices way below the original asking price\" - which is great fun and you earn respect from the seller (they will still be making a profit!) Also jump close to the wall and 'pray to Allah' when motor scooters shoot past you - This was essential for survival.At night the medina turns into a food festival with hundreds of food stalls with lots of seating.

It is such an interesting place and something that I have not experienced elsewhere.If you do decide to buy anything, never pay the asking price.

As none of us had change on us at the time we apologised and politely refused. The young boy walked away, only to have come back three minutes later and beg us again, this did leave us all feeling a little uncomfortable. We had decided not to get a guide as we wanted to explore the markets ourselves, however if you may be intimidated by the begging of locals and stall owners a guide may be advisable. In regards to our experience with the shop keepers it was very pleasant ! They were very friendly, and every other one greeted us with \"Africa!!\" or \"my sisters\" which we found quite amusing. Yes we did experience the begging of owners to come and look in their stalls but that is to be expected. In regards to the price of items/ goods they are set very high as a significant amount of their income comes from tourists, however it is very easy to walk out with the item 40-50% less than their initial asking price sometimes even more... Tips for haggling: If you want to purchase multiples say if \"I buy 3 I want them all for.....\" state your price, also claim you've seen it cheaper on another stall, or just begin to walk out if they don't give u the price you want, they will soon chase you with a better price ! Most importantly, be polite,it goes a long way..Experience of the environment:Mopeds and scooters coming from in front and behind which is very frustrating with all the other things already going on. A large funeral party (along with the coffin) also walked through the market, which did leave us feeling a little uncomfortable also.Overall a decent experience, I most definitely would not advise women against it from our experience as we were not harassed or ripped off at all, if you are worried just ensure you are dressed properly."

In this regard, it can be off putting, nerve wracking, at times disgusting and definitely uncomfortable to a certain degree for nearly all Western tourists.

We got suckered into a 'Herbalist ' shop which was pretty and interesting. The guy claimed to be a pharmacist and proceeded to wow us with herbal remedies and argon oil and creams.We each had a pile of must have things by the end of it but didn't have enough cash and hadn't brought our credit cards - thankfully!We agreed to have the guy come to our Riad to pick up the money and deliver the products that evening. When we returned to our Riad we asked the manager if we had been ripped off considering the cost of the items. He confirmed that we were over paying and also that we shouldn't buy 'herbal teas' because they are not heathy blends. We asked him to call the guy and tell him not to come because we'd changed our minds. He showed up anyway. He came back every day for 4 days. Our Riad manager sent him away each time. The day before we left my friend wanted to return to the souks for a bag. We were recognized and harassed by a man who knew the herbalist. He ran off to tell him we were in the souks. We ran as fast as possible out of the souks to avoid the confrontation. It was a terrifying experience and we felt we were in danger.We spent 6 days in Marrakech and thought we would enjoy the souks but honestly it ruined our trip.My advice would be to hire a guide to get you through it safely.

I spent three days here, staying at the Nesma Riad (see my review) about a 5 minute walk from the main market square in the Souk.Restaurant and food stalls abound in the main square and it's fun to just eat a good meal and watch all the action. There are lots of entertainers too. You can see snake charmers, monkeys, and other animals normally found in the zoo. Of course, if you take a photo of the entertainment, payment is normally expected. The Marrakech Souk is an absolute \"must see\" while in the Old Medina. Hopefully, you will have good navigation skills while wondering the isles in the Souk. It is easy to get lost, so set your bearing on one of the Prayer Towers near the main square.. I visited a number of Souks in Morocco, but the Marrakech Souk is the best ! Don't miss it....."

You are taking your life into your hands vis a vis the moped riders. Before you know it they're tooting their little horns for you to jump out of the way a la Indiana Jones styley ha ha!! Not sure why its allowed in such a tiny space but clearly no one else is bothered. If you've any sense you'll avoid the snake charmers and monkey handlers on the way in. These congregate in the main square before you reach the Souk alleys. (Hey! Some of you might enjoy having a photograph taken with a monkey wearing a pampers having been kept in a black box no larger than itself all morning in blistering heat. Who am I to say!!). The snakes look so half dead you'd swear they were made out of rubber. This is also where the horse and carriages park which don't smell too badly until later on in the day (when the horsey poop is clearly building up). Apart from that I wouldn't say I found the souk's all that smelly. Some of them are smellier than others like where they tan the leather and where they dye the wool. Anyway, its great fun wandering around the souk. You can really get lost in here. Be prepared to barter - its a given. We visited on a day when it was a bit overcast just after lunch time and I assume they'd had the coach loads of tourists through in the morning and by the time they'd had lunch they didn't seem to overly bother us at all. It was really quiet in some of the alleys too - barely anyone around - I could have wandered about for hours. Some stalls are better than others : the more traditional ones selling lamps and trays and crockery and leather goods. Be aware of the young boys who tell you they'll show you the way to where they dye the wool. They make out they're doing you a huge favour (even though you don't really want to go there) and make you go up and down and up and down all these alleyways. We ditched them in the end but I assume once they get you where they want you to go they'll want money. Lots of shops don't let you take photo's without handing over cash which I thought was a shame. You're more likely to engage with them if they let you take photo's. Some shops/market stalls even advertise the fact that they 'no charge for photo' so that's how much of a problem it is. Well worth a visit and a re-visit in the evening."

Its very different now but this is not a nostalgia for the old times review. Many things have improved above all the standards of many of the riads where one can stay.However to allow the presence of speeding motorbikes roaring down narrow covered souk streets is madness. Many driven in the evenings by young guys seem on a sort of dare to just miss people at speed. Why the souk shop owners are not up in arms about it is beyond me. They ruin the place with noise, pollution and actual danger . The traffic is awful throughout the old city but this is expected but the motorbike menace in narrow souks and medina is beyond a joke.It does not happen in the Essouira souk so why does Marrakech allow it?"

It is a large bustling labyrinth so it's easy to get confused, but the vendors are separated into areas by specialty. In one part you have the tanners and cobblers who are making shoes and purses. Then there is a section where the craftsman are making things from metal like light fixtures, locks and iron work. And there is pottery and things made from wood. Then there are spices, teas and oils. And many selling rugs and some selling jewelry. It's so fascinating to see these talented people making everything by hand. Most were also gracious if I asked to take their photo. (You must ask and get permission. A smile goes a long way in getting permission) The culture is to bargain but I wasn't really into that as I know how hard these people are working so most of the time we just paid the asking price. We bought beautiful hand sewn silk purses, argan wood boxes and oils, several table cloths and some handmade shoes. I also bought a lovely silk brocade coat. I would have loved to buy some of the fabulous light fixtures I saw but will look for them online.

As an experienced market shopper from all around the world, including China, Mexico and, another famous market, the covered market in Istanbul, I would say that true bargains are more difficult to be had here due to UK and U.S. tourists who are not used to haggling! It is very time consuming to drive down a price at these Souks to something reasonable. Certainly, the leather goods, whilst reasonable, are still way more expensive than in India. Getting the lightshades down to a good price takes some time. Nevertheless, there are bargains to be had by being a good poker-face haggler, going further \"into\" the souks and by going in the late afternoon/evening, you may get a better bargain if the market seller has not had a particularly fruitful day!!"

We were amidst extremely dirty narrow quarters where artisans sweated in the oppressive mid 30s with sparks flying wildly and rusty machines hammering. After the entire morning building anxiety at cat calling and pushy street urchins trying to trick us, we ended up in panic, running around trying to get back to somewhere recognisable.

Don't pass by the opportunity to haggle; enjoy it. It's part of life in Marrakech. Offer a fifth of their initial price.

The souk is a place to find almost anything Morrocan, including leather bags, slippers, clothing etc. The vendors are relatively polite, compared to places like China and can be bargained down reasonably easily. We found some good quality gifts for friends but you need to go deeper into the market and avoid the sellers around the edges of the main square. Good fun and definitely worth a visit."

I also needed a new suitcase as mine had been damaged at Marrakesh airport, bought one after much haggling, got it back to the hotel where it promptly fell apart...... Just a word of warning, there are snake charmers, monkeys there etc, take a photo of them and they pounce on you for money, when you refuse they get very very angry......"

We wanted to buy carpets and he took us to a VERY expensive carpet shop through dark alleys. The carpets was still too expensive after we bargained for half a day and the guide tried to fix the price. We realised that he must get a commission.After he took us to another expensive shop we went back to the hotel By this time our guide was actually very rude to us.We were upset because we wasted all that time and didnt get anything and we were to fly out the next day.We decided to cancel our flight and get a car to travel to Cassablanca and went to the souk on our own.We then only saw how much the souk offers as Binebine took us through back alleys.I bought 8 carpets for a fraction of the price of the previous day.This carpets shop was just off the main passage and easy to find. The owner was very helpfull and sourced the carpets that I wanted from his friends. We had to pay cash as he didnt have credit card faccilities. I am just sorry for the whole day I have wasted with the guide. Go on your own it is a lot of fun."

First of all anyone complaining about being harassed to buy goods, you have come to a country where they barter for everything and tourists are the main source of income to feed their families. What did you honestly expect? The souks are an interesting place to visit full of colour and a lot going on. It would not be a full visit to marrakech if you didn't get lost in this maze. Lots of items on display to look at, purchase and practice your haggling skills. We found it useful to try and pay half of what was originally proposed as the selling price of an item. You are paying over the odds compared to the locals but is not much more this way and it is worth it for some unique items. The two things we found disappointing was that most of the shops catered for women only and that every other shop similar items are being sold. We were hoping for more variety but that might just be us being picky. Make sure you visit and like us refuse to get pictures with the monkeys in the square. They are in chains and was not pleasant to see. If you want to see them head to the mountains where they are wild and enjoying life."

I have been to many places where as a tourist you are targeted by sellers and merchants to buy their goods but never hounded so much as in this place. I'm all for the thrill of haggling over prices for local goods but things got a bit too much.The worst of it was being suddenly approached by someone being friendly and offering you help you didn't need. They tell you that you may be interested in an leather auction which is just down the street and give you directions ( misleading of course). A bit further on some else takes over to show you the way then another person, who just happens to be going in your direction takes over. In the end you are bounced around the souks and end up being herded though the gates of the Tannery or a shop where the hard sell begins. They have it down to a fine art. Although I would say that there was no aggressiveness and nobody is forcing you, as a tourist you don't want offend peoples offers of help and you MUST be firm when saying no. Also be aware of people who offer you something and say 'take this for free' as 10 minutes later the will appear in front of you demanding payment.Be aware of coming out of your hotel / Riad and being approached by someone claiming to work there and wanting to show you a good restaurant or shop, again you will be led to somewhere you don't want to be.Now having said all this you can still enjoy the place as it is a must. Just stay calm keep a mental note of places you pass incase you feel lost. Go sit on one of the terrace caf\u00e9s and watch everything going on and chill. You can get an official guide from your hotel to help you. They will still take you to all the places in the souks and certain shops ( slippers, bags and herbalist) but you wont be hounded as much and it gives you a little more confidence. Good luck."

I will try and offer advice based on my own recent experience. 1 Allow yourself several visits. Do not buy anything on your first visit. Once you've been a couple of times, you'll have seen the items you want in several stalls and can then decide where you want to haggle. Believe me, you WILL see that item in more than one place.2 If you wear a backpack, use small padlocks on it. Pickpockets are rife here. My fianc\u00e9 got his camcorder deftly removed from the outermost pocket of his backpack. Lesson learnt the hard way.3 You will get lost. There's no way round it. Locals have even spray painted false directions to the main square and removed signage to disorientate you. Use your common sense - try to find noise, lots of people and you're generally not far away. Quiet lanes with Riads are usually a sign you're wandering away from the area. Be aware that young local lads will offer to assist you with directions. Don't follow them - they will take you a merry dance and elongated detour and then ask for money. Politely decline and use your own judgement.4 Haggling. Its obligatory! There's maybe only a couple of shops with fixed prices. If bartering doesn't appeal to you, then the souk isn't for you. Have a price in your head you would pay for your item and don't go over it. Most of the time, if you can't agree, the shopkeeper will often run after you and try to re-negotiate. Keep it light-hearted, have a bit of banter and it can be quite enjoyable.5 Harrassment. You won't get ten feet in the souks without someone wanting your business or money. When you stop for a coffee break, make yourself walk those extra few steps up to the terrace rooftops of the square cafes- its worth it for the view, people watching, and you'll get a reprieve from the constant bombardment of men trying to sell you mobile phones, ornaments, paper hankies etc! When walking through the souks, walk briskly. The most useful phrase you'll be able to say is \"La Shoukran\" (phonetic Arabic for \"No thank you\"). If you look at anything, or worse still, lift an item up, the shopkeeper will go in for the kill and expect a sale. If you don't buy, you are quite often cursed as you leave the shop. 6 Safety. Keep your wits about you. Locals zoom up and down even the narrowist of the lanes on motorbikes with very little notice or room to manoeuvre out of the way. All in all its a rollercoaster ride. Quite exhausting in some respects. Take your time to take it all in, take plenty caf\u00e9 stops to re-energise and re-hydrate and go for it full pelt! Very much a marmite experience, its one you won't forget. Who knows, you might even get that elusive bargain and great keepsake for bringing home."

Be prepared for lots of shopkeepers wanting your attention, lots of people wanting to sell you their products, and for lots of fun and good stories to tell when you come back home. The prices stated by the shopkeepers are way too high, so you have to aim for at least half what they're asking, preferably less than that. Do a search here at TripAdvisor or Google to get an idea of what reasonable prices for the items are. It's a good feeling when you close a deal (even though you still might be paying a little too much) :-) Lots of the shopkeepers have very similar items, so if you don't get a reasonable price, simply walk away and you'll find another shopkeeper somewhere else, where you can get a better price. Haggling is really enjoyable here when you get the hang of it!The souks are a maze within a maze within a maze, and it's surprisingly easy to get lost.

Whether this is true or not there is a need for heighten caution and awareness of the possibility of such intrigue.The food sold in the square at the Souk are home made and re-heated upon arrival. The level of hygiene or lack there of can only be imagined. The service is one of a kind, with food being slapped onto the table in an unprofessional manner. Whilst there are no flies competing for your food, often, used and unwashed cutlery are given to dinners and portions are very small. Ha, yes you can get Moroccan dishes there and the famous mint tea \u2615 too. Okay, that said, they really need classes on health and safety or general hygiene. Then the dancers, snake charmers and onlookers. Good entertainment all round if you are not relieved of your wallet. Come early if you must 7pm and make your way through as quickly as possible. And not just the square, but the main market itself is open too at night. There you will get to see the spies pyramids and hand crafted goods. Bargain for the prices at least half of the asking price. Try it, it is therapeutic."

We found 2 centres, one near the Saadian tomb entrance and one near the Koutoubia Mosque.When you're out watch out for people being 'helpful'. They often actively mislead you with directions or saying something is shut when it isn't and still expect small change. We got very good at switching off the automatic politeness mechanism and just blanking everyone that talked to us (works well in the souks and for any unofficial 'guides' too). No offence seemed to be taken and there were no threats.Although data charges were high (\u00a35/day with Vodafone) I used the map function a lot to find specific addresses.

You enter from either side of Jemaa el Fna and arrive to souk Semmarine, the high ceilinged main corridor with most expensive shops and all the goods available on show. At the end on left is La Perle Fassie, a large shop with fixed prices under 10 euros selling all kinds os babouches, sheepskin slippers. There are basic and exquisite models, remnants from last season and stock changes constantly. Further on are two monsieurs selling lemonwood kitchen utensils also with prices on show. I like to cook with their perforated laddles, they last for years and make a good present for anyone back home.When you proceed further down the souk prices go down, but in general they are up from last year. Consider if you really want the item before asking how much? to avoid endless discussions.You won't get totally lost if you keep to the streets with shops and people and don't wander to empty alleys. The direction to ask on returning is La Place meaning Jemaa el Fna. People will point you to the right direction, or the opposite, this is magic Marrakech.My favourite items are painted, woodframed mirrors, small handembroidered leather bags, babouches. I have also carried a wooden, painted table home and it goes well with my newest acquisition, a boucharouite, a colourfull berber rug woven with fabrics. The asking price in Tanger was 140 euros, but I got mine in Marrakech for 60 euros back in the souk and didn't even bargain."

My husband was called a bad man because he declined an invite to a stall. We worked out that if you try not to give eye contact to anyone you will enjoy the market more. Snake charmers do not like you taking pictures without paying them something after - we were told to delete photos unless we paid the man, which was worth the money as I got to hold a snake and watch a cobra do a little show.

The amount of times she jumped thinking she's about to get run over was too many to count.Do not eat here unless you want food poisoning. Food was covered in flies and bugs. One time we saw a dessert place that had hundreds of wasps all over the biscuits. On our way back, we passed the same place and the wasps were all gone; I'm sure others would be none the wiser and buy.The only positive is that you can sometimes see people making goods which is interesting. Despite that, you will find a lot of fakes. For example, Argan oil 10 times cheaper than in the pharmacies. Many times we were told to avoid buying fake goods in the souks by taxi drivers and other Morrocans.By all means, make a trip but be prepared to be disappointed; it isn't the best market experience."

Just walking through the souks can be exhausting and the best way to deal with it is to walk past and just shake your head and/or hold up your hand in front of you and shake it. Having said that though, it really is the experience of a lifetime - there are places like it but nowhere the same. The people have very little and just trying to make a living however they can and keeping this in mind does help when the calling is relentless. Soak it up, roll with it and just be aware that most conversations will lead to a hard sell"

If you get lost, there are plenty of other tourists around and shop owners will always point the way to the main square where you can pick up your hotel coach or get a taxi. You can also hire a horse and carriage, but confirm the price before getting in.There are some excellent \"buys\" in the souk.

We have been in the medina for 5 days now and have not yet tired of walking through the various souks mazes of alleyways and multitudinous shops. One thing we have learned is not to be pressured into buying (or looking or anything else). They say looking is for free (over and over and over again), however, when you walk past the shop more then once, they can be quite pestering and in some cases harrassing and rude. A downright nuisance as we're here a month and the souks are the coolest and shadiest way to get to the big square for us. This does not deter us as most are genuinely happy to show you their wares - so long as you are aware you are simply a wallet-on-legs to the vendors. Don't be fooled by the usual scams - the classic is saying only 10 dirhams (which is about 1 euro) for a belt for instance - and they will be very clear about it. Right up until you show the slightest interest and it will become 10 euros (or pounds or whatever) - you will so no, they will argue, follow you, wrap the belt around you. Do not give in - it just encourages them to use the same tosh on the next tourist. Resist your inate pesky western politeness and move on. If they won't take the belt back, drop it on the ground. Also don't be conned by Berber (or Touareg or Tribal) silver. That's what they make pipes from back home. Would you pay 25 euros (or 40 euros for that matter) for polished tin? Nope. Move on. In short, there are lovely, lovely handcrafted things in the souks, but develop your peripheral vision, walk slowly - look without looking and only if you are particularly keen on something should you show interest. Or just go your own way - you'll figure out the system soon enough you little mobile ATM you."

The same small, winding streets crammed full of open fronted shops people trying to sell you things. They even stock some of the same things!Once you get used to the way business is done, shopping in the souks can be a lot of fun. I personally really enjoy haggling, although it can take a bit of getting used to, especially when someone acts like you've mortally offended them by naming such a low price. A quarter or a third of the stated price is usually a good place to start (unless it's already very cheap), but keep in mind that you only need to haggle to a price you're happy with - don't make the process too stressful! You can probably find what you're looking for elsewhere when it comes down to it. Also, go further into the souks/down little side streets as you can usually get a better price in the less easily accessed places.Shopping aside, the souks are fun just to wander around in. The sheer amount of things for sale is astonishing, and I really enjoyed just looking into shops. The more relaxed you are about people trying to get you into their shop/make a sale, the nicer the experience is. Downsides are that you can get a bit lost, so try and find a map with an enlarged view of the souks and have shops you can use as landmarks. The sheer volume of people can be a bit stressful too, especially when you throw motorcycles and animals into the mix. Also, be careful you're not being sold a cheap/faulty item - do some reading first if you can. Overall though, the souks are definitely worth exploring."

The stalls nearer the main square are a little more Del Boy style knock off bags but the further you go into individual artisan areas the more you seethe real Souks. A must see if in Marrakech, have a list of what you want though and ladies be careful as stall owners will grab you and drag you in!"

We used a compass in the end so we new which way the market squar was. Its better to think of the souks as a cultural experience. Everything that is for sale has been made. If you go deep enough you will find the workshops of people dyeing material for scarves, hand stitching shoes, cutting leather for bags, beating copper panels its facinating. Each row of souk has a theme, it could be shoes, copper, leather, lanterns. Be prepared to haggle. If you dont want to buy say so imediately do not let them waist their time thinking you will buy just say i dont have any money. If they offer you tea or freebies they will ecpect you to buy so be careful. But if you do want to buy then haggle haggle haggle. Offer them a 3rd of what they say and then come up to between 3rd and 1/2 of what they origianlly offered. Its a game to them they enjoy it so have fun and make then laugh it helps! Also be weary of people who help with directions around the souks they will also expect to be paid however if youre really lost and might miss your bus then its worth it :) We also recomend eating and one of the little places in the souks. They will be a tiny room with a stove and 2 pots bubbling, they will be the niceat meals you eat and the cheapest they like tourists trying their local food and will talk to you and answer your questions. Local people also make the best tea :) My advice is learn to haggle, take a lot of space in your suitcase because you will want to buy everything, be aware that nothing is free and make sure you eat locally during the day :) xx"

We were advised to go into the Souk.....and....at the beggining as was \"shocked\" of all the people that were trying to sell you something...anything. its important to bargain...that is the culture....go down from high price to less than a half ;) . The streets were like a labirint, a lot of peolpe, motobikes, very claustrofobic in some way. It's incredible how they still make the products by themselves...in front of you they treat the leather, they make shoes, bags, clothes and lot more. It is like inside the souk there are many small family factories. The restaurants have marrocain cuisine but not only...very tasty...we went only to the ones with best Tripadvisor reviews and we always made a good choice. Peolpe are friendly and always look forward to help the touritst with ibformation ....but they are also sometimes insistent and that is a bit annoying. However it is an experience I recommend....the Souk it is one of the mant faces of Marrakesh and that is why it is so beautiful."

The people are still friendly though inside the souk for me though it just feels like a typical tourist gimmick, and when you journey off the beaten path and go into a local supermarket you'll find all your morrocan herbs, gifts, fruits etc freshly packed with a cashier, Hustle free.  The souk is good for buying hijabs, jilbabs, there's, and morrocan slippers. Don't let my review deter you from experiencing it, but maybe once is enough, ya dig."

Entrance gates lead you inside from the busy wide streets into a maze of small alleyways and roads and of course into the heart of the Souks. Take a wrong turn down an alleyway and you may happen upon an oasis of calm in a rooftop riad or restaurant. Suggest saving a Google map for use offline and favouriting your riad or hotel. Then use GPS offline to guide you back. Getting lost is so easy. The Souks at first appear intimidating but persevere you'll long for a stroll through them on your return to normal life.Take care as bikes, motorbikes, donkies and carts and even the odd car go through these narrow walkways narrowly avoiding the unsuspecting tourist. You'll get hassled to take a look in the shops, but decide on what you're prepared to pay for something then start haggling! You should aim for about a third of the starting price. Alternatively, visit the Ensemble Artesanal, the prices here are fixed and reasonable and goods are of good quality. This is near the tallest mosque by the main square. Just another cautionary note. In the alleyways outside the Souks young men will often tell you that the way ahead is closed. If you're sure of the way persevere. If you follow them you'll take a long detour and be expected to pay them. This was a daily occurrence."

There is always someone to direct you or guide you but you need to keep handy some MD to pay. Everything seems to be available in these twisty alley ways, full of shops and work places. You probably will be shocked to see young children working and caged animals and lots of things which would not be allowed in Europe. Watch out for mopeds, carts and even donkeys.There are a couple of ways of approaching these areas. Some small children can find it frightening and some teenage girls can be intimidated by the comments made towards them. I recommend the following:- Hold children by the hand at all times and tell them not to speak to or take things from strangers. Totally ignore approaches made by the vendors, children or beggars. This is unnatural to most people, but once you speak or acknowledge their approach then quite often it is hard to get away from that person. You can try just saying no but sometimes you still have to be forceful or rude to stop them from bothering you. NEVER take anything off anyone because it is considered that you have bought it. Some people enjoy the banter with the locals so you get what you get. They learn English from tv and adverts - this is amusing the first few times of hearing!If you are female and blonde and sometimes ginger haired you will receive attention. If you are a larger lady you will receive attention. If you don't like this I advise always have a head scarf/pashmina and cover your hair and sweep the shawl over your shoulder like the locals and totally ignore the comments. This works well. I have been told \"you are local\" as I have walked about, but I have been left alone. I speak when I want something and no other time. You are expected to BARTER. Don't be frightened to drop the price low, then go up and even walk away. You have to decide what you want to pay. There are plenty of places to buy. If you are near the price when you walk away they will follow you. You can buy lanterns, leather goods, scarves, recycled items, jewelry, spices, cosmetic type oils, argan oil, remedies for anti-snoring and things we do not get in the shops. Some are really good. ENJOY the experience, you might never get the chance again and it would be a shame to miss out!"

            "review": "Amazing colourful and noisy market - prepare to get totally lost!. We went into the souks on many occasions, and almost without exception, got totally lost! Even with a map, you will not end up where you expect and you will never be able to find your way back the way you came, so, just go with the flow and relax, as long as you have plenty of time on your hands and don't mind losing your way. I loved looking at all the goods on display and did buy some, but wished there wasn't such a hard sell and pressure to buy all the time, as I really would have liked to browse at my leisure and would have bought more. However, the moment you pick something up or show any interest in it, you will be hassled until you purchase. Not that they will tell you the price at the beginning....they will just promise a good price. So, my advice is1) Be clear about what you want and don't want, whilst remembering that looking is not really free, despite what they say2) Don't try on slippers just for fun unless you think you might actually buy them, because they will get cross! Don't let them take one of your shoes away (for size, when they go off to find what you want at their friends stall) otherwise you will be left in their shop with no escape!3) If you want to get from A to B quickly, just don't maintain eye contact, close your ears and keep walking4) Haggle like crazy. Start at 25 or 30% of the asking price.5) If you really want something, buy it there and then, as you wont find that stall ever again!6) If you're not sure, don't buy, as all the stalls sell pretty much the same stuff, (and im sure most of it is made in china, not in a little workshop behind the palace, which is what they all say!)Its brilliant fun - but be aware that as a tourist you are a walking cash machine and depite them appearing friendly etc, all the stall holders and vendors have one sole aim which is getting as much money out of you as possible!

As you get deeper into the Souks you will find unique Souks selling interesting stuff. I usually started with a 30% of the initial offer and worked to my real price. Just decide what you are willing to pay for an item and negotiate kindly and use the normal tools for getting a good price. Its half the fun but after a full day of shopping and battering you are ready for a beer or two. There are also many things to see including watching the other tourists.

The souks are a maze of narrow streets with stalls packed on either side and the occasional on the floor in the middle of the street trader. Everyone wants a sale and they try sooooo hard to get it. You will be hassled and invited inside to look for free. Be polite and persistent. Good idea to keep sunglasses on and avoid eye contact. Donkeys, scooters and people on foot all squeeze down the streets, but it kinda works. There are a few signs directing you to the square, they hang overhead and are in burgundy. Kids/teenagers are always on hand to tell you that the square is in the opposite direction to the way you are going, ignore them. They will take you there via their shops or friends shops and want paying. We got lost loads of times, but eventually got where we wanted to go. We used the line\" finished shopping heading back to hotel / riad \" when we where approached this worked for us. Also handy line \"meeting friends will call on way back \". Let's face it, they are trying to make a living, and they don't have the support we get in UK. Although the souks can be a little trying sometimes, we kept going back for more. So who is the fool here ! They are like those in Turkey but more intense. Some great bargains to be had, but you must be prepared to haggle. We got some great buys, so be patient and stick to your guns. We usually paid between 30-40% of the original asking price. The Moroccan people at first may seem a little full on, but soon you get to understand theirs ways and relax into it, and enjoy the experience. Never felt threatened or in danger. So head on in, and shop, ... But relax and be polite."

We used to get people shouying \"India, India, Sharuk Khan\" to us almost every corner we turned...Haggling with shop owners is great fun! I usually found that a price about a half/third of the initial price was acceptable to both. Have a clear idea of what you'd be prepared to pay, try get close to it and eventually as you walk away they will usually meet your demands...I had to remind myself its not always about getting the lowest price possible!You will get lost. One invaluable piece of advice I got was to download an offline Google map of Marrakech! This was a life saver! Turn on gps and you'll rarely get lost! You'll have a map of the souk streets to hand and If you do take a wrong turn you'll see how you can get back on track easily! When Google maps isn't enough, don't be afraid to ask a local, they are very friendly and will point you the right way. We usually asked shop owners after reading stories of people getting followed or being asked for money after being escorted to where they wanted to go.It is a must see when in Marrakech and you will either love it or hate it!"

There was a discreet police presence which was comforting. Only down side I found was late of an evening (stalls are open till the wee small hours) there was some unsavoury aspects such as what appeared to be cock fighting & gambling but at no time did I feel threatened or ill at ease. The backdrop of the snow clad mountains framed the woke square & gave an impression you were on a film set."

I was grabbed and painted on by a random woman with a syringe of henna and was mocked for saying \"No thank you\" repeatedly. The shops are very repetitive, in fact I think they only sell about 4 different things and this is then repeated over and over.

On arrival out came his hand as expected although he had offered to take us for free - I don't think so !!!!!!!!!. I gave him a few pounds in local currency , probably 3-4 pounds but this was not enough. He got very agressive. His stance and spechbeame threatening. We refused to give him anymore and made our way into the Tannery. We stayed here a couple of hours but when we came out the man was still waiting for us and took up his abuse of us where he had earlier left off. It got pretty nasty especially as wherever we went that da he was either following or would suddenly appear from nowhere to contine to ask for more money. I would never return to Marracech but I am pleased I did experience it the once as the rest of the holiday was O.K. Never without the begging though and the insults for not paying them enough."

You do get accosted a lot but in a friendly and often jokey way as you pass by. We were impressed by how safe we felt going round anywhere in Marrakech. Haggling has to be treated with humour and the Moroccans are very good at it! I generally found that a price about a third of their initial asking price was one acceptable to me and acceptable to them. If you have a clear idea of the max you are prepared to pay don't go beyond it and as you say sorry, that's my final offer and start to go they invariably accept the deal. I'm not interested in getting the very lowest price, just one that I feel is fair. These guys have got to make a living and they have a very hard life compared to ours in England.You do have to keep your wits about you in the Souks as they are narrow and often used by motor bikes/scooters/bikes and donkeys. One of the city maps we had showed detail of the Souk area which we found invaluable. You're bound to get lost sometimes but it's nothing to worry about and someone will always help you if you get totally disoriented. There are definitely bargains to be had and some of the leather work, ceramics and carpets/throws are very good value. The experience is very colourful and exotic, an absolute must. Relax and enjoy!"

Looking back I think I disliked the experience as much as I liked it. For whatever reason I think my hubby and I are the only people on the planet who just didn\u2019t care for Morocco. The people were not pleasant, the food not as good as we\u2019d heard, and the overall \u201cje ne sais quoi\u201d\u2026well\u2026just wasn\u2019t present. We didn\u2019t visit the Souk until the day of our departure (night train back to Tangier) and I wished we would have had more time. Overall the haggling was just too much of a haggle (pun intended) and didn\u2019t feel worth it. Did I get some good stuff? Yeah, I did. I got two pouffes at a very good price (beat that, Jonathan Adler, with your overpriced Pouffes!), two tea sets and some other small odds and ends. It felt when I was haggling that there was more to the conversation than what was on the surface; an angst among the haggle with the proprietor taking out a long history of aggression with me \u2013 a white American chick \u2013 almost to the point that he was going to get violent if I didn\u2019t give in to his ridiculously high prices. We bartered, ran through the souk in search of ATMs (there are a few, all kind of hidden behind the madness that is hanging carpets, shoes, spices\u2026), bartered some more, all in a rush to get back to our hotel which was out of town a bit. Leaving I felt like I needed more time to experience it, almost as if I was about to start enjoying it, but left too early to get the bad taste out of my mouth. I would give the souk another try, but only if it meant not returning to Morocco. So, in other words, I doubt I\u2019ll go back. Please keep in mind I\u2019ve haggled in other scenarios, other cities, all over the world, including in Mexico all throughout my youth up until now. I LIVE FOR THAT EXPERIENCE. So, I\u2019m no newbie to this and hence let down by the experience of the souk. Now when I\u2019m home in my bedroom looking down a the little blue and white pouffes I scored (finally got a good deal after what must have been a half hour of battling with the guy) I have a mixed emotion of, \u201cwas it worth it? Did I enjoy that?\u201d *scratches head, shrugs shoulders*. So, it\u2019s not for everyone, the Marrakesh Souk, but it\u2019s worth trying to form your own opinion. Just be ready to WORK for whatever it is you are buying, don\u2019t show too much cash, and be ready to walk away if you cannot get the price you think it\u2019s worth."

I was scared to look at anything having seen reviews on here before our trip and couldn't help but feel that living nearby would be terrible for your lungs. Having said that, (although much on sale is definitely 'tat') it was a great experience. I think the trick is to appear confident. We refused to take out our maps and as a woman, I didn't find the hassle too bad. By smiling and saying 'no, thank you' the sellers did leave us alone. My partner took the 'ignore them' route which was also quite effective. I didn't really feel that the men were letchy. Some comments were made but generally more polite and complimentary than comments I've had over here. I didn't venture into the souks on my own as my parter didn't let me(!) but I would have felt comfortable doing so in the day. At night we did get offered 'something to smoke' etc but again a polite 'no' and they got the hint. There is nothing really to buy here, I came away with a pair of sandals and my partner got a 'genuine fake' football kit but generally I wouldn't suggest going with the intent of buying anything outstanding.We didn't really have any experiences of anyone offering us 'help'. In fact when someone pointed us the way, we didn't believe him owing to what we had read, but it turned out he actually was only trying to help. I think it's important to keep in mind that if you look like you know what you are doing, people will leave you alone. Failing that most souks lead upwards to the square or taxis are dirt cheap (negotiate and check your change though) so jump in one if you get really stuck."

You don't have to stop at each shop but after stopping at the first few you will get the idea how things are priced and believe me there is a huge variance. So you have to haggle and it's works- if they say 100 you can start at 20 and be assured you will leave paying around 50. Try and keep change money I.e not hundred dhiram notes so you don't have to wait for them to go and find change and also sometimes you will get that lower price is some was decided at 70 and you just have 50 you give them the 50 and that's all you have!  Don't get items from the first shops you see, you should go through into the main souks and it's an amazing experience. People will be calling and you just keep looking and walking.

When I said I needed to catch up to my group the man said he saw them move on down the street and that we were being watched. It was very frightening. I was also pushed in the street by a man and told that women did not belong there by another. I was dressed appropriately. I won't go back."

You are certain to get lost, and if you look at a map you will be hassled by some evil character who will misdirect you, then \"help\" you for a large fee when you get even more lost. One guy pointed in the direction of the Jmaa el Fna, only his direction was 180 degrees out, and he took offence when I asked whether he was lost.Trick is to just relax, and not mind being a bit lost. At worst, you end up walking out of the souk in some random direction, and you can sort yourself out from where you end up.A problem with the stalls is that if you look at anything they really expect you to buy. It is not like browsing in a European or American shop. So you end up walking around with your eyes straight ahead. If you actually want anything, it is much easier (and generally cheaper) to go to the Ensemble Artisanal. At the very least, go there first to have some idea of prices."

It is very easy to get lost in the meandering streets so keep your eyes out for the blue signs hung in the rafters as they will direct you back to the Main square. The street food available in the centre on an evening is delicious. Definitely the place to go if you want to experience a bit of culture on your visit to Marrakech."

You have to do it, there is no choice, and it will be a largely wonderful experience, but as with all things everything is in the preparation.Firstly, with a good map, you won't get lost, and you are very unlikely to come to a sticky end (but do keep bags and purses protected). You don't need to accept any invitations to show you anywhere, partly because you can get there yourself, partly because any 'helper' will have an ulterior motive - either a specific shop or at least a fee for helping.Also, don't rush in and buy. Take your time, and if possible use a first visit to see what there is and to sound sellers out on prices. Never accept the first price, but try haggling to see where it gets you, and you will soon see where the bottom line is likely to be. The good thing is that you can always say no, and you will not have people chasing you for your business. Life is too short for them too. Prices on the edge of the souks (entry and exit points) will always be higher, so sound a variety of people out on prices. You will be surprised what a difference there is. Even such a small item as a knitted hat, for example. One square quoted a stunning variety of prices, from an outrageous 150 dirham (15 euro) down to 50 (5 euro) as a starting point. We bought for 20 (2 euro) after 5 minutes of animated discussion.Even the famous babouche slippers vary significantly, and there are plenty of sellers. One lovely shop in the centre of it all had fixed price babouches for a mere 50 dirham.Avoid jewellery and trinkets unless you like it, and try not to go into shops more than you need to, as they will smell business and snare you like a Venus fly trap!If in doubt, walk away and come back another day.It has to be said that the souks are generally not the cheapest places to buy things - you are a captive market - and you will find cheaper outside. If you can get out to the Atlas mountains or to Essaouira, you will find everything a lot cheaper, although the hassle factor is ever present. For example, a carpet costing 'only' 3000 dirhams (300 euro - good by European standards) in the souk will be less than half the price in Imlil. But you need a car for that!"

What put me off eating there was the hygiene or lack of it. Take for instance the Orange juice seller who sold juice in a glass that dipped in a bucket of water, there is no sink or running water, and gave it to the next person to drink. Also, the hot snails looked gross, they were in some brown broth. Most of the stuff sold was junk, I've seen better in a Croydon car bootsale.

When we first arrived, my partner was quite nervous and so the first day we didn't buy anything and we just had a wander around and got acquainted with the area. Luckily, I managed to convince him to go back again because I knew he would enjoy it if he stopped worrying. On our second trip into the souks, we had an absolutely brilliant day and it was difficult to tear ourselves away. It's a place where you could spend an hour having a look around, or all day hunting for treasures through the winding streets of the souks!!We kept our distance from the men with monkeys on leads, snake charmers and from the women with the henna, but these are only in the main square, once you get into the souks there isn't anything like that. The women with the henna certainly didn't appear to be very friendly so we avoided eye contact, I was convinced they were going to curse me!!If you visit the souks, don't worry, keep your wits about you and you'll have a brilliant time. I'd recommend women to cover up, as you would expect in a Muslim country anyway. This is not because there is a risk of leery men like in Turkey etc. because it's nothing like that, but I personally felt like I was able to enjoy the experience more knowing I was walking through the busy souks covered! If you are a softy, this may not be the place for you because the vendors drive a hard bargain. However, if they say something is 1000 dirham, offer them 100 and stick at it! It sounds ridiculous but they only start with high prices in the hope you will just cough up because your a tourist. We found that sometimes they laughed our initial offer off, as it was a fraction of what they wanted, but we didn't budge and just left the stall and on more than one occasion we were shouted back only for them to accept the offer. Not everyones idea of fun but I must admit I loved it!Not all of the stalls have that sort of atmosphere though, some actually have prices on the items, so I suppose if you don't want to haggle with the locals you can still pick up some things there - but you will probably pay 3x the price!There are a few shops on the outside selling fakes, but once you get into it theres pottery, mirrors, lanterns etc. We bought some lovely lanterns and a mirror. One thing though, don't buy the black soap, I thought it would be a great idea, but I was obviously just in the spirit of things at the time and realised when I'd got home that in reality I'd just bought tubs of black slime...

I've experienced markets similar to this in Istanbul and Bangkok, but the vendors in Marrakech were far more aggressive. Some would not take a polite \"no\" for an answer and followed us for blocks. I would certainly advise being discreet when taking photos of anything in this area of souks (or the Medina) because you will probably be harassed for money. Taking photos of the snake charmers or monkey handlers will almost certainly create a demand for money. I saw one woman take a photo of a monkey and instantly the handler grabbed the monkey and put it on her shoulder and wouldn't remove it until she \"rescued\" by her companion. The friendly locals would offer to take your photo (with your camera or phone) and request payment for doing so...repeatedly.Dining anywhere was a very lengthy experience, so if you have limited time, you will need to let your server know...traditionally the meals are leisurely. Lots of trinket type shopping, but there was a good selection of scarves and spices (both easy to pack) and argon oil (Moroccan Oil) (which can be challenging to bring home if not securely packed and stored in zip lock baggies to prevent leaking). Was easily able to use a credit card and American dollars in the souk. If you have Moroccan money (Dirham) you should exchange it prior to leaving Morocco as I don't believe you can do so anywhere except in Morocco. There are places at the Marrakech Airport that can exchange the Dirham, but if you want to purchase items at the airport many places will only take Dirham. Airport also offers the ability to \"shrink wrap\" your luggage if you want it protected against theft. Local airlines were very stringent with carry-on bag sizes, and I saw numerous passengers at check-in being forced to check their carry-on bags because they were too large."

The most notable piece of advice we received when heading to Marrakech was along the lines of 'get lost in the Souks and soak up the experience.'Don't, it's not much fun at all - and it's not that we're not adventurous travellers. It's a pretty grim experience. The goods on sale are majorly tat (although a few are of interesting local distinction) and there is a keenness amongst some of the locals to aggressively pursue lost tourists to lead them on a merry dance - in our experience this was to the tanneries, or just on interesting routes back to Jemma El Fna. Marrakech is a nice city but we wouldn't recommend the 'get lost in the Souks and soak up the experience' idea."

You will find leather goods, metal works, traditional clothes and thousands of other things - and you will constantly be approached (or one might say attaced) by sellers trying to persuade you to buy exactly their goods.If you don\u00b4t watch out you will probably pay way to much for what you buy. Haggling is of course mandatory, but as it will start from a sky high level you will probably pay too much, even if you succeed in haggling the price down a lot. Therefore it might be wise first to check the price level out in the city (e g at Ensemble Artisanal) before you start haggling in the souks.To avoid getting lost, and to easily find the places you want to visit, a properly working GPS is most useful.

A good place to get an idea on prices you should pay in the Souk is to take a look in the Artisan Centre about a 5 minute walk from the Medina. At the Artisan Centre, crafts are being made and are items are priced. If you plan to go out for dinner in the evening, plan your route, and if coming back later than 8pm, I would recommend, walking outside the Medina or taking a cab. Cabs are cheap. After about 7ish the stalls in the Medina start closing and can be challenging to negotiate as signs/direction are almost non existent.

It is such a shame as we found that you cannot even glance at something without the smallholder coming after you. One even followed us for about 100 yards through the souk!! There is so much to look at and the colours are lovely. Beware mopeds, donkeys and in fact anything coming through the tiny streets. Also beware of 'fake' guides. We had a local friend to show us around so were very lucky. Some of the signs to tourist places have apparently been put up by someone out of town so they are not correct. You can therefore get very lost or go around in circles! This is when the 'fake' guides come into play. If you get lost ask a shopkeeper. DO take a map with you. Many things in the tourist part of the souk are cheap and cheerful and WILL cost you an arm and a leg if you don't barter. Get them down by loads. They are the best salesmen in the world!! Things are in areas i.e. all carpets together, ironmongery together etc. There is so much to see which is so very different and in many ways exciting but potentially intimidating. One of the best phrases to use in the Souk is No thank you in Arabic. I can't spell it so can't write it. If they believe you speak a bit of Arabic you can be left a little more in peace!! Happy Souking!!"

Artisans still crouch in narrow openings banging bits of metal together and there are still some genuine, local crafts being pursued, if you can find them in among the bought-in tat. The problem isn't that there's nothing real there to wonder at and observe or even buy; the centre of the old city is unique and to walk its streets is to experience an assault on the senses. It's that to pause anywhere for more than a second invites relentless pressure and however much one tries to stay loose and enjoy the whole experience, falling into one carefully crafted ambush after another becomes depressing. Even after 'bartering' (why do the published guides persist in using that word as if it's a real fun experience?), spending ten times as much as something is worth just makes the buyer feel as though they'd rather be somewhere else. It's a shame none of the guides tell you the truth - not one I've read anyway. Perhaps if they did, the locals would wise up, hassle less, understand the difference between haggling and fraud, realise tourists have souls as well as wallets and make this wonderful city a better place to visit."

The Marrakech Souks were bustling with activity, shiny objects, colours and great smells.It's worthwhile going a couples of times during the day as storekeepers have different opening times. It's not the easiest job in the world navigating around stuff on the ground, other people and vehicles whilst simultaneously paying attention to shopkeepers and their wares. You could easily spend an entire day wandering through and getting lost, exploring shops, bargaining, buying random (and mostly pointless/useless) things. It's definitely worth bargaining hard and walking away if you don't like someone's price - you will definitely find what you're looking for in another store and it will let you know if the price they're asking for is the going rate everywhere or if you're just being taken for a ride."

From my travelling experience, one thing I would recommend for those who wish to buy something is leather products.Bargain bargain and always bargain! Bargaining is not a trade but a culture \u2013 where two people communicate with respect! Be your nicest and wittiest self, play (bargain) with mutual respect and at least visit two to three different shops before you eventually buy. For heaven\u2019s sake do not bargain for the sake of bargaining or because your Tour Leader told you that you have to ask for 1/3rd the price. It looks attrociously ridiculous and sad when Tourists bargain for 1/3rd the price for something that to start with costs half a Euro.I love Marrakech, Moroccon People and the Berber Culture that many prowdly retain. Moroccon People are extremely friendly and kind. But this does not mean that you should leave your antenas and brains behind.PLEASE BE WARNED : I would not recommend you to take out Money from the ATM vending Machines at Djema el Fna.

            "review": "Here's what I paid in the souks... and had a blast!. Alright, so here's a detailed list of what I purchased and how much I paid, with some pictures at the end. I was looking for how much other people had paid for the items I was looking to buy prior to me going out on my last day of my trip, which I had dedicated as a \"shopping in the souks\" day. Knowing what others paid would give me an idea of how I should barter and what to expect to pay. Also, I felt saving my last day for shopping was wise. The three days prior I had spent plenty of time walking around the medina and in the souks, picking out what I wanted to buy and from which shop (even though almost all of them sell the same things). Hopefully this is helpful to you.Let me also say that I found the souks fun and interesting. There's so much to see, smell, taste, and hear. The metal smiths area was really fascinating, to see them all pounding away and making things. If you can find that area, really stop for a minute to watch.You'll get lost for sure - it's part of the experience. On my second day I pretty much had the place mapped out in my head. But getting lost was truly enjoyable. As the days passed, I recognized places I had been and would purposefully go down an alley I knew I hadn't been down before, which is how I discovered the metal smiths area.Tagine: I only paid 35 dirham for a large tagine, the largest I saw. That's right, only $3.50 (roughly). I was able to do this because I had the staff worker at my riad use one of her local friends to purchase for me. Yeah, I know, that's kind of cheating, but hey I got the \"locals\" price. Maybe you can do the same.Teapot: I also used my riad's staff worker's friend and only paid 150 dirham - $15 for a brand new, shiny, handmade teapot.Small tagines: This was my first attempt at actually bartering. I ended up paying 220 dirham, or about $22 for FOUR. So, about $5.50 each. I think I lost that battle badly, but after looking at what others had paid, I was close to the same prices.Lamps: I was looking for some simple, dark coppery/steel colored, multi-color-glass lanterns. I purchased six of them for 500 dirham (~$50). I bought these directly from one of the smiths in the smith alley part of the souk. He originally asked 600, and after a few back and forths with prices he started saying that the \"democratic\" price was 550. I kept saying 500 and he said OK. I'm sure a tougher bargainer than me could probably have gotten them cheaper. 500 for six of them is about $8.50 per lantern.Slippers: Paid 300 dirhams ($30) for three pairs, two regular pairs of indoor slippers, and one pair of outdoor slippers. I believe he originally asked 500 dirhams.Scarfs: 200 dirhams for two of the nicer scarfs. He asked 220 and I countered with 180 (I know, not much of a bargainer I am...)Jewelry: One large necklace with turquoise and some other stones, along with a pair of \"silver\" (real silver? - who knows) for 200 dirhams. He originally asked for 250 dirhams.Signs: I picked up three hand-painted signs for 250 dirhams ($25). He originally asked for 650 dirhams!!! I think I did better bartering for those than other items I purchased.Carpets: Alright, so this was the big one. I read a lot about carpets. This was difficult, and I'm pretty sure I didn't do very well. I did make sure to purchase from a store involved in a woman's cooperative, so that most of the money would go back to the women in the communities involved in the cooperative, which I really felt good about. We were in the carpet shop for probably 1.5 hours. We looked through a LOT of rugs. I wasn't looking for anything large, in fact I was looking for two small rectangular rugs to place in door entryways. Well, they didn't really have those, so I ended up buying a runner and a small to medium sized area rug (pictures attached to this review). He started his price at 5,200 dirhams (roughly $520). I eventually paid 4,300, or $430, after some bargaining. He threw in a small square rug when we were done bartering.Overall, you will never come out on top. But then again, what is on top? You have to set limits for yourself on how much you want to spend. There are no set prices, but there is I'm sure a price at which the seller would not make any profit. Yeah, no doubt they rip tourists off, but that's how they make their living. And their standard of living is extremely low relative to developed nations. At the same time, it was fun on a few of the bartering sessions, and interesting to say the least on all of my bartering sessions. The sellers can be genuinely humorous, but truthfully you can tell ALL of them just want your money. On most occasions, immediately after the exchange of money and goods were completed, the sellers wouldn't give me a second look.I've read that most people start at roughly 1/3 the initial asking price. The sellers will be overly dramatic about your counteroffer, but believe me, it's all part of the game. They huff and puff, ask you if you're a Berber, etc, etc, but again it's all part of the game. Don't be afraid to start low, but at the same time don't go SO low you insult them. I have read a couple articles about tourists countering so low the sellers refused to barter and essentially were asked to leave the shop.Take your time, get lost, and be fascinated by another culture. The sellers are annoying, doing or saying anything to get your attention, even if you rest your eyes in their shop for just two seconds! But, you'll become immune to it in no time!Recommendations:-Go in the morning, 9-10AM, when there are less people. (The souks can and do get VERY crowded, with locals and tourists alike).-Get lost on purpose. Just ask any shop-owner to point you in the direction back to the main square, if you need to. Do NOT listen to anyone who approaches you and asks to be your guide or begins to tell you where the square is when you didn't ask - it's a scam.-Keep your money in different pockets. I had money in just about every pocket - front jeans pockets, zip-up jacket pockets, wallet, but NOTHING in my back pockets.-Smile. Laugh. Makes jokes with the sellers.-If you're from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, or other similar Western, developed nations (or Japan), the prices are higher for you. I was Canadian for one purchase, a Kiwi (New Zealand) for another, and American for another... it was fun telling white-lies like that. Didn't really make a difference.-I thought it was beneficial to have my girlfriend with me. We would \"consult\" or \"agree/disagree\" on prices. In one instance, by arguing amongst ourselves, the seller reduced the price by 50 dirham after I told him my \"wife\" wouldn't let me go as high as I had stated; it worked to our advantage. In sum, be creative on your bartering.Good luck!"

Be aware that if you take a picture during the day or night on the square you will be intimidated to pay for that picture! To buy items in the square and around it use the rule of tumb of offering 35 to 40% of the asked price and not increasing it until the final negotiation on the part of the vendor is pronounced. The more you stand on your price firmly the better a deal you can have. If they let you go you can then increase your offering by a small amount. That is when the deal can be made.

Never pay for what they ask you is at least 10 times more. for example they try to ask 20 dirhams a gram for euclyptus crystals when i could get it for 1 dirham a gram (and still expensive considering the market price). wooden boxes sold for 100 dirhams are sold in essaouira for 10. So have fun but don't pay anything more than what you would pay in your own country or online. Leather is not expensive if you have tons and tons of it and all the handmade things you will see are actually mass produced and you will see them in every souk of every city in morocco."

We've been to many that are much worse than these, though!The stall holders do take no for an answer especially if it's in Arabic (La) and followed by thanks (Shokran).Everything has to be haggled for, which is fun and good natured as long as the customer is... well, fun and good natured.Keep smiling, only haggle for things you're interested in and take the precaution of a visit to the Ensemble Artisanale before arrival. It's a government, fixed price craft emporium where you can work out the going price for all sorts of stuff before trying to beat it in the souks.Getting lost in the Souks is genuinely delightful but never accept unsolicited offers of assistance from anyone, though. You'll end up being charged for 'help', guided to the tannery where some rather nasty people might demand even greater sums to get you out!Ask a stall holder or just keep wandering until you see a way out!You can find everything you can think of in the souks but my highlight was the result of a search on Trip Advisor. I found 'Marrakech Food Tours' and booked an evening with them. It was the best thing we did in Morocco and we discovered parts of the souks we would never have seen otherwise. Just great!"

We had a half-day tour for our first visit as it helps to orientate yourself before going it alone ! We went 3 times in all - at different times of the day and all were wonderful. Leave plenty of time as you will undoubtably be pulled in for a display of carpets, then \"my friend next door\" at the fixed price shop, then another friend at the perfume shop. At the time you feel annoyed that your time is being used up, but the products on display are wonderful and the shopkeepers all have such an easy-going attitude if you don't want to buy their goods - if you don't then someone else certainly will ! The souk is marvellous. It is a maze of tiny winding alleys between crumbling buildings which house small workshops with houses upstairs. Here you can see the craftsmen at work - making everyday items for the locals - and you realise how much the souk is a way of life rather than a tourist attraction. The streets open out towards a smaller square and the area is filled with the more familiar free-standing stalls selling everything from fruit and veg to leather jackets. It is a feast of sights, sounds and smells and it is wonderful just to take it all in, regardless of whether you plan to buy anything. During the day, the main square is fairly empty and you are more likely to be targeted by ladies offering henna designs, men with pitiful monkeys with their teeth removed, snake charmers and water sellers with exotic outfits - all trying to have a photo taken ... at a price ! The trick here is to go to a restaurant with a roof-top terrace, then take in all the atmosphere along with a cool drink and a zoom lens on your camera ! You could easily be viewing a medieval scene .. if it wasn't for the jumble of satellite dishes on the rooftops. At night the main square is transformed into an enormous bustling throng of stalls, entertainers and people. The food stalls are manned by locals who have clearly grown up in England, so many have cockney accents and the set phrases \"Cheaper than Aldi and much cheaper than Asda!\" or \"Hey, have you been watching Eastenders recently?\" , however the majority of other stalls are there for the locals and only offer a smattering of English. The entertainment is vast and varied - very much along the lines of Covent Garden in London - with musicians, acrobats, fortune tellers, boxing, cock fighting and various gambling activities. Despite the huge crowds, we felt completely safe all the time.We bought very little on our trip, as our intention was to look rather than to buy, but the leather goods were fantastic, the fabrics were beautiful and the perfumes were intoxicating !"

(book through your accommodation). You get less hassle and can request to go to places you may not dare venture into on your own, like the tanneries! (here the hassling can be a nightmare) Beware though because your guide may still take you to certain shops where people will try (often successfully) to rip you off. They know all the tactics and before you know it you have spent too much! Every body no matter where you are is after making money out of you. Having said this i can assure you it wont take long to adjust to the bartering and this should not deter you. One important thing you also need to know is that often local kids, mainly kids, will yell at you that your going down the wrong way or a dead end! Chances are your not just keep going, if you engage in conversation your likely to be guided somewhere else and asked for money! Again a guide is a very good idea for your first visit. The day after i was confident enough to tackle it on my own and was fine. Remember if you do get lost hail a cab! dont pay more than 40dhms to go any where in the Medina, settle this price before setting off!"

I loved it and the seller's here are not as aggressive as in the square......You get a variety of goods.....if you buy slippers make.sure the soles are leather not plastic foamy stuff and check the leather handbags inside and out....Bartering is so much fun and the majority are good natured.....however some are truly awful....I don't mind bartering when they start at a realistic price....when they start at 1400 dirhams for a pair of.sunglasses I feel like walking out because you just feel they are making a fool of you!Best advice we were given is don't show too much interest in particular items.....don't pay more than a third to half of their first price ( locals are probably always given a third of what we are for first price) and if they aren't going down in price walk away and 9 times out of 10 they will change their minds!!!I got beautiful mirrors, slippers, scarves, glasses and dishes........one thing I will say is a lot of things are mass produced and poor quality....a lot of the stalls r selling the same stuff....spend some time and shop around and you will find some gems...also don't wear open sandals / shoes because your feet will get dirty"

My friends and I were called a variety of celebrity names, all with the aim of making us smile and getting us to buy.

The restaurants around the square are a good option but eat at the cleanest places, I was struck down by gastro and was in bed for 24 hours. Things to purchase are the baboosh shoes make sure you only buy the ones made in leather. Tinware lanterns are pretty and the hand painted plates are a must if you can put it in your hand held.

Yes you have to put up with the haggling but just politely say no and you should be good. Now for the bad, the streets are dirty and the locals have lived like this for years so I don't see it changing anytime soon. Once you step out of your Riad it's a shame and sad how the streets look and are kept. It's said that the crime for the most part isn't an issue but you need to smart. My wife's phone was stolen out of her hand and the thief jumped on a motor bike that was waiting for him and we never saw them again. Think twice when carrying purses, smart phones or jewelry that can be tempting to these criminals. Put your wallet in your front pocket and if possible have some cash in your other pocket so that you won't need to open your wallet out in the open. I would like to see the police do more to crack down on these individuals. Something like this can really make your vacation take a turn for the worse.That said we met some great people in Marrakech!

Try not to be led away by people who want to show you other shops, you may end up walking far away from where you started!The colours, smells and general atmosphere is very unique and should definitely be experienced if you visit Marrakech.

They love bartering and are good at it so be prepared to stick to your guns. As is usual when you take a guide he will include one or two places where the proprietor is known to him. On our tour this included a carpet showroom, a carpenter's workshop, a silk scarf shop and a herbal pharmacy but all very friendly and no hard feelings if you do not buy anything.

An item worth 50p back in Britain they will try and sell to you for \u00a350. I visited the souks again last month on my second trip to Marrakech. I have since been to many other arab countries, and this time around i was not phased by the aggressive selling at all. I learnt to just ignore the sellers or reply 'no English\". Souks are defo worth visiting as there is an abidance of things to buy and you can grab yourself a bargain. Myself and my brother brought gorgeous genuine leather bags from the souks (roughly \u00a317 and \u00a325 each) would would easily be worth at least \u00a360 or more here. A good code to follow would be whatever price they offer you, counter offer a quarter to a third of the asking price and then negotiate up to a reasonable amount. So in conclusion, visit the souks but have your wits about you!"

Luckily it is difficult to get completely lost as there are lots of blue signs overhead which will point the newcomer in the direction of the main square, the Djema El Fna.I don't see how the souks can be dismissed as just a tourist trap since it is clear that the locals shop here also, in fact Moroccan shoppers generally outnumber the tourists (at least when I was there during January). However, there's no doubt that the stallholders see the greater money-making opportunities when a foreigner comes along and many will try and lure you inside for a closer look if you pause to look at something, or sometimes even if you don't.The vendors generally speak good English and will come across as very friendly, but sadly all-too-often this is just part of the rehearsed sales pitch: \"Where are you from? Oh, I like that city, so for you I will offer a special price\" etc etc. Haggling is the name of the game, and if you're too soft, these guys will rip you off. It will take a test of your willpower and no little effort, but you can buy items for half of the price the vendors will initially quote. Unfortunately for those unaccustomed with this method of shopping, the practice soon becomes a bit of a chore once you've done it a few times, as does the fact that you can't have a proper look at anything without some salesman chatting away at you and insisting how good the product is and how good his prices are. Some will let you browse without hassle, but they are few and far between.However, here are a few tips which may assist visitors to the Souks:1) Never show too much interest in anything. The more interested the vendor thinks you are in a particular item, the harder he will haggle.2) React with disbelief at the first price he quotes. If you react as though this is a reasonable price (albeit one you think you can drive down a bit), then straight away you're telling him that any haggling on your part is just a case of chancing your luck rather than a sincere argument on the genuine value of the item.3) Although there are hundreds of market stalls, there are only about a dozen or so different types - whatever you see in one stall, you can almost certainly see in many others. Shop around for the best price, and make it clear to the vendors that you are doing this. They'd sooner sell you an item cheaply than miss out altogether when you buy the same type of item from one of their rivals.4) If possible, try to buy multiple items from the same vendor. You will usually get better deals this way, and also it means less vendors you have to haggle with.5) Assuming you're going to the Souks from the main square (the Djema El Fna) - the worst, most 'touristy' ones are those straight ahead of you as you enter the square from the direction of the Koutoubia Mosque. Aim towards the ones at the extreme left of the extreme right - from my experience these are a little less pushy and were sometimes a little cheaper. However, if you're staying in Marrakech for several days, then I'd recommend a day trip to the coastal town of Essaouira, where the prices are cheaper still (for exactly the same range of goods), the items are often priced so you don't have to haggle, and you don't get pestered by the stallholders as you walk past - an altogether more pleasant experience.6) NEVER agree to go anywhere with one of the stallholders, even if it's only to look in his brother's shop around the corner. These guys are after your money and whilst the souks are generally safe and friendly to walk around, you don't want to get into a difficult situation.7) Also, no matter how friendly a vendor seems, don't let them try clothes on you or they may then insist that you pay for them. In spite of everything I've written, the souks can be a fun experience, especially in you just want to sample the atmosphere and you're not out to buy very much. As long as you employ common sense, not flash too much money around, be careful of passing motorbikes etc, don't stray into quiet areas at night on your own, then they are generally a safe and friendly environment, and well worth experiencing. I walked round them alone and didn't feel ill at ease. If they're really not your cup of tea then try the nearby government shop (Ensemble Artisanal) when you can buy most of the same items for fixed prices without hassle (although it is a little more expensive, which can be evidenced by the fact you won't see many Moroccans shopping in there!)"

            "review": "Something that should be experienced. The souks in Marrakesh spread out over a very large area which are interconnected by a range of tiny steets, mostly inaccessible by car. If you have trouble walking far you should get a tour book and plan a rough route as taxis are only available on certain side streets. The souks can be accessed from Jemaa El Fna as a starting point, just by walking beyond the square northwards.Here you can buy everything from teapots, to clothes to spices. Everything requires bargaining and the majority of store holders will try and rip you off if they see you are a tourist. For example on a high quality and ornate teapot I bought (not just a flimsy decorative one) the guy started at MAD 380, which I told him was \"outrageous\" and \"UK price\". After 15 minutes of bargaining, I got it for MAD 90, which personally I felt was reasonable. If you want to know the rough value of an item you can also find some \"fixed-price\" stores where price labels will be displayed, although only take it as a guide.Some store holders will also not want you to take photos of them, so taking photos from afar is recommended. Also, if there is anyone that mentioned anywhere ahead is closed or not worth seeing, ignore them as if you follow them you will likely end up in a carpet / leather shop being coersed into buying something."

When entering the square in front of the Souk there are lots of guys trying to get you to go on a horse and carriage ride, my partner and I took one and it cost about 20 quid, so if your not interested just say no and after a while the guys leave you alone. The Souk is great but just remember keep saying no as the guys trying to sell stuff are experts at selling so be polite and direct and say no. I paid a fiver for a little castle thing in the Souk when I came back to the main square there was a guy with a cart selling the same castle for a pound. There are little sit down cafes on a street leading to the square these are a better place to eat, cheap and good food the waiters are on the street and they will ask you to sit down they have menus with pictures and prices are really good great food and nice people, the locals eat here but the locals don't eat at the food stalls in the square. If you go into the Souk on your own DO NOT allow the guys who come up and tell you the area ahead is closed and they will guide you back to the square tell them NO and keep going you will find your way out, they do know short cuts and you might have to tell the same guy no three or four times but he will get the message these guys are real chancers. They will try to hastle money from you if you let them guide you.My partner and I and our two year old son had a lovely walk through the Souk with no problems so don't be afraid just remember what turns you made and you will have a great time and HAGGLE if you see something you like remember the seller will start high so haggle hard walk away if he's not prepared to drop the price stick to the price you want to pay. There are local prices and then there are tourist prices to get an idea there are some fixed price shops before you get to the square they are on the main road opposite the old tower.Fantastic day out, any questions give me a shout."

No problem.If you come across something you do want to buy take your time to work out what you want to pay before you even start talking to the stall holder. Only now ask 'how much'. Shake your head, go much lower. keep going until you get the price you want. If they don't come down to the price you had decided then walk away. If you have suggested a price they are happy with they will call you back, believe me. If they don't call you back then you really have gone too low so use that knowledge at the next stall!Don't try and take pictures - they don't like it and will ask for money.Look down every alley-way.

My recommendation would be to visit the Ensamble Artisanal co-operative just past the Koutoubia mosque away from jemaa el fna first and take note of the prices! You can then barter with store owners to get what you've seen in the artisanal for cheaper!

            "review": "Day and Night Center of Action. It's been a while since we were there but the Jemaa el Fna is one of the most famous market places in the world. It's definitely not to be missed even if you don't think you're much of a shopper. As with most market places, it's really where any given society expresses its cultural values in what it offers as objects of desire. Every manner of artisan and local products are exhibited in stall after stall staffed by the most experienced of hagglers. The winding and meandering alley ways seem designed to compel you to navigate through a labyrinth of bargains in clothing, art objects, foreign designer trinkets, platters, hookahs and rugs to name a few. There must be hundreds of stalls. It seems nearly always busy with the national pastime of haggling which is elevated to an art form here. Master the \"look of disinterest\" and practice \"the walk-away\" technique if you hope to survive the maze without loosing your shirt. Seriously though, it is an exhilarating, fascinating, entertaining cultural experience. The busy-ness of the market though, makes it a difficult place to keep track of each other so those with children (small or big) need to make a conscientious effort to stay close, maybe hold hands etc. Similarly, physically impaired should curb the excursion in accordance with the density of the crowds, etc. The good news is, most of the market is ground level so wheelchairs and strollers can be used. But the human traffic can get a little heavy at times. There's always something going on from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn. In the morning, there are all manner of entertainers gathered in the central plaza (yes, there will be jugglers...). At dusk, the plaza fills with food vendors offering local produce and seafood. Yup, there are vendors selling braised snails (the biggest, succulent, inexpensive escargot anywhere, had a whole bowl myself), and fried sardines. Really quite tasty and not like anything you were likely to experience anywhere else. There are also cafes lining the plaza offering tea and coffees. We enjoyed a lovely dinner one evening at one of the larger cafes with a second floor patio overlooking the square. It felt as if the buzz of the market has not (and reportedly, it has not) really changed in hundreds of years. The market is an iconic part of Marrakech's rich architectural and cultural heritage."

You have to have some patience, try and explore and you will find many interesting spots. Once you get in there, it is hard to find your way out or which way you want to get out. I found the local people very helpful. For a bit of tip they'll guide you where to go. Some might stop you while walking confused and say which way to Djamel-Fna for example. Use their help, anything else is optional. The salesmen can be as in other places a bit bothersome. Always a tip to be strong and fair!If you are tired or hungry, try and find one of the rooftop cafes to relax and watch the whole thing from above with a good view."

One example I bought a Tajine for 70 Dh (Aprox 7euros). Initial asking price: 250 Dh.

Start bargaining at 25% of the price they ask, don't pay more than half of what the original price was. You can always go to the next stall!"

That's part of souks and Moroccan culture if you cannot handle that, just don't go. Or just... don't pay attention and walk on - you will be left alone. Few useful tips. 1. You will definetly get lost! On our first day we were walking about for 3h before we have managed to find our way back to the main square. Look up - there are wee green and red signs just above the shops that lead you to the main squares. And don't listen to local ppl trying to tell you that road is closed and pointing you in another direction (they do that constantly! God knows why, to sell more stuff on they own stand?). Trust your own instinct - after a day or two we were able to take shortcuts and go everywhere faster. Getting lost is good too! On non-touristic dodgy-looking side streets we managed to find real craftsmen in their dirty, wee workshops making real Moroccan scarves, carved stones, wood paintings and selling them for half of the price of the main market shabby stalls (that are loaded with stuff \"made in China\")2. Bargain of course. You should get everything at least half of the starting price. 3. Check what you're buying. Everyone will try to rip you off - sad but true. Giving you higher price but also selling you worthless stuff. When buying famous Moroccan black soap make sure you're buying one in sealed container with label etc (not the one on the pile, without any smell, and probably way out of date). Be careful with saffron (cheaper, dyed flowers may be sold as saffron)4. Tips on argan oil, that we were given in the hotel: The good cosmetic one doesn't smell. It has almost no scent at all. It also should absorb very quickly. If it leaves your skin greasy, it's not a proper argan oil. Also - if put in the fridge - it will set. 5. Watch your step.

Be thrilled by the explosion of noise, colours and aromas that awaken the senses. And be in awe of the craftsmanship and pride invested into making those pieces of art, be it jewellery, carpets, lamps or trinkets that brighten your home.The Moroccan people are proud, warm and welcoming. You are in a market place so expect to be approached they will haggle and bargain it's what they do to make an honest living. Generally the prices are easily reduced. If you go too low it can be insulting. A good bargain can be readily had. Enjoy the experience for what it is.I have been to the souks many times. They are many entrances and exits. Some parts are more touristic than others. The best experience and place to go is where the artisans are busy at work. Here you can watch the creation of many of the true treasures of Morocco. Handmade originals are more expensive but still negotiable. You can pay with several different types of currency or Debit/Credit card. Many places will organise delivery of the goods to your home. The food markets and stalls are interesting many delicacies are freshly baked or cooked in front of you. But please do check the quality and freshness before indulging. Unfortunately Health and Safety takes on a new meaning. So here are a few tips to help you with your visit to the souk:Have a guide the 1st time to save time and money. They are educated polite and helpful and not expensive.Have small change for photographsDO NOT TAKE PHOTOS with out asking and expect to pay for them 5 d local currencyRespect their way of lifeTake hand gelWatch where you are going its very busyEat in a Riad - good experience and lovely traditional food.Your personal belongings are usually quite safe but still watch them anyway.Enjoy our little friends as they experience first hand the souks, the kasbah, tombs, and Ourika Valley https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO5HYbOWcEY"

There are lots and lots of stores, with different types of items solds (shoes, clothes, spices, lamps, etc). I think everyone will tell you to bargain the price...well do! We bought everything 70% off the original price, and I think we could have got even a lower one. Vendors we engaged with in bargaining were nice, kept us from leaving the place until we bought something, and tried to get the most price out of us. There were a couple of places where we were not sure about the quality or the price so we offered a really low price and they left us go. On the other hand, be careful about people calling you or trying to take you to their stores, they told us sometimes they charge even more and it would be very difficult to get rid of them afterwards.We grabbed a bite to eat in the souks too, being much cheaper than in Djemma el Fna; in the Kessabine souk there was a very little place that served like crepes made of some traditional ingredients that were really good; there was one made with onions that was very tasty; and they were very cheap: only 5 dirham for each crepe (about \u20ac0.5). In another souk (I don't recall the name) we also bought bread (round big one) for 5 dirham too; and we had lunch in a small restaurant called Chez Bahia, where I enjoyed my first chicken tagine and a chicken pastille, they were both really good and tasty; these dishes plus two small sodas cost us 100 dirhams.We really enjoyed the souk experience!"

There is permanent smoke in the air from smalltime blacksmiths operating in the crowded alleyways, & alongside them traditional spice merchants pedal spells & potions, hemlock & mandrake, next to honey-flavoured saffron for scenting an authentic lamb stew, piled high in tempting mounds. Watch the craftsmen at work, carving, dyeing & weaving. As for the main shops - each souk has its own local craft speciality, from pottery & wood to silver & textiles, leather shoes & glittering jewellery to cooking pots & pretty, scented candles - perfect to take home. You could emerge with a richly patterned rug, an assortment of glazed ceramics or a metallic leather cushion! Feast your eyes on the displays of glimmering silk slippers, glistening piles of olives, exquisite inlaid wooden boxes & beautifully woven shawls. Bartering is expected, so see it as a game & don't be shy. For heavenly homemade organic soaps, heady with the scent of local flowers, visit L'Art du Bain in Souk Lebbadine. For aromatic oils as exotic as frankincense & myrrh, & amazing fragrances, visit the traditional Herboriste Avicenne in Souk Laghzel. The chic Akbar Delights in Place Bab Fteuh is famous for its finely-embroidered & beaded tops & skirts. In the bustling Place des Epices, vendors offer covetable china & woven baskets in many colours.But for me the best part was getting lost and just exploring the shops rather than actually doing some shopping!"

The experience of the hustle & bustle of the Marrakech Market is worth half a day, you'll pretty much have had enough of it by then.The best advice I would give is look but don't buy - you'll most certainly get ripped off. Firstly, it's worthless junk, not authentic Moroccan produce. The money that they try to get from tourists is laughable. For example, the starting price on a tea set will be about the equivalent of \u00a350, the idea is that you haggle and get the set for about \u00a325 and think that you've got a bargain. In actuality the tea-set is probably worth no more than a couple of quid, it's the made in China stuff that you see on the cheap market stalls at home and would never think about buying. I opted to buy some spice, I thought this would be a safe bet, so I bought some Saffron. Unfortunately when I got it home and went to use it it was useless. It had no taste whatsoever, it was either so old or wasn't Saffron at all - probably some copy made to sell to tourists.So basically, whatever you buy you will be ripped off. Furthermore, you'll have the hassle from the seller. If you merely look at something he isn't going to leave you alone. The Souks are packed with people but if you look closely you'll see very few people actually buying. This place could be so much better with some education from the government. If the sellers stopped hassling everyone then people would not be afraid to look at the merchandise instead of just walking passed. And if they charged reasonable prices than they would actually sell something.So as I say, it's worth a look but not to buy, and the restaurants are ok and reasonably priced."

These breaks are currently being widely promoted in newspapers and magazines at present and ours turned out to be excellent value. We were fortunate to stay in a 5star Opera Plaza hotel which is adjacent to the Opera House and the newly built main railway station with its many cafes on the roof. Marrakesh is full of contrasts - the 500 year old city is enclosed by a wall and is known as the Medina. In it is a treasure trove of buildings, monuments and homes - the most remarkable part we found was the \"Souk\" with its myriad of ancient passageways, mostly undercover, housing craftsmen of every kind working in conditions that have not changed for centuries. There are a large number of specialised areas such as metal working, leatherworking, woodworking etc. encompassing every trade imaginable to provide for the thousands of local population. You emerge into a huge open market area- Place Jemaa El Fna where you are offered everything you might need including garments, shoes, headgear and even complete sets of false, or individual loose teeth. There are also snake charmers and owners of monkeys who are insistent that you hold one in your arms whist they take a photograph, or you can tour the Medina in a 2 horse open carriage. Two distinct cultures are represented everywhere, the original Berbers and Arabs, but also more than 25% of the city are Jewish, and this amazing mixture exists side by side in perfect harmony, speaking mainly Moroccan, Arabic, French and English. You really appreciate you are \"abroad\" but never feel nervous as you walk anywhere. Outside the Medina millions of Euros and Dollars have been spent in building a new totally modern city with all it has to offer in 21st century living. Overlooking this unique combination are the snowcapped Atlas Mountains shining brightly white in the sunshine against the azure sky. There is so much to see and all this for less than the cost of 4 days half board in an hotel in London, Birmingham or Manchester."

Anyone interested in anything from home furnishings to food will have a great time rummaging around the small market stalls and chatting to the locals. The smells are rich, the colours vivid and the streets bustling. You will need to use your common sense in this area, keep your bags close to you and watch your toes when the motorbikes and mules tear up and down the streets. Shopkeepers will try and talk to you continuously and when you tell them no thank you, they will leave you alone. A friend and I received some funny lines from the locals, some a little unsettling but many entertaining, our favourite being 'fish and chips'. Females are best keeping themselves covered as much as possible, the markets are very heavily male dominated and some of which are not scared to stare. Be careful when buying raw meat from the markets, some is not kept cold and is not covered properly. There are stalls where you can purchase fresh chicken and if you ask they will prepare it for you on site. If you are sensitive about animals, I would perhaps avoid looking in any butchers, chickens are sometimes kept alive in cages at the back of the shops and it is not uncommon to see sheep heads hanging from the front of some stalls.I would highly recommend the street food here, my friend that I was travelling has a sensitive stomach and was perfectly fine afterwards. There are many foods to try and most do a small taster portion which is great if you are attempting to try them all. You can see how heavily influenced the street food is from French cuisine and you will find many of it different from what you see in the restaurants around the city.For your first time in the market I would recommend aimlessly walking around without a map. You will soon pick up landmarks to help you navigate. Remember if you are lost keep on walking in one direction keeping the sun or a large building like a mosque on the same side of you, you will exit onto a larger street or to a landmark that should be named. Don't follow any of the men that try and give you directions, I've heard a lot of stories for them asking for money when you reach your destination. The terrace bars are a great place to stop and refresh yourself whilst having a perfect view over the souk, enjoy some mint tea or an arabic coffee and take advantage of the toilets.Last of all don't forget to haggle, this is part of the charm of the market. Expect to pay around a third of what is offered, even if you are buying cigarettes. There are even more benefits of buying multiple items. If a shopkeeper isn't backing down and your price is reasonable, try walking away and they will often try and call you back."

By my last day I felt almost like a local. Do be aware of men wanting to help or guide you... Unfortunately I fell foul once and was led into a rabbit warren of back streets before being guided towards a shop that my helpful guide had taken me to... I politely but firmly refused to enter and started back the way we had came... a little shaken but more annoyned at myself for falling for it than anything else... on my way out of the souk a young man told me \"walk to the right to avoid the puddles\" which I was actually doing but my mistake was to say \"thankyou\". He walked along in front of me trying to engage in conversation and despite me totally ignoring him he was within a few steps of me all the way through the souk... finally getting to the public square I went into the first big cafe and drank a coffee very slowly... he followed me in and sat watching me for the full hour I was there.. only when I approached a policeman on leaving the cafe did he get the hint to disappear. My own fault really but not a pleasant experience that I want to repeat."

You really get to experience the culture of morroco through the souks with interesting smells and characters. You do have to be aware of mopeds as the locals travel through the souks on them but if you keep to the right of the path you will be fine. Also for women it can be a little bit intimidating with the men looking at you and calling you. If you don't make major eye contact and ignore them you will be fine.

In hindsight, 3 days in Medina combined with remainder staying outside might have been a better choice but the riad was so beautiful we loved our visit anyway.

Good price, we make you good price, not tourist price!\" with a very vibrant and large grin across my Moroccan friends faces. Then you are in the shop and things get a little interesting. They set the prices so high that you almost feel you are being made to be a bit of a mug. They barter so well and play on your good nature once you are in the shop and the feeling of wanting to buy becomes actually quite high with how they deal with their great humour and friendly approach. My first reaction was that it was overwhelming and being polite comes across as reason to keep talking to you so I soon had to learn how to just turn away and stop talking.After an hour of walking around you get used to the nature of the place and it does become a festival of colour, sites and sounds. At one point we got speaking to a random local who was walking the same path as us and led us to a few different shops ( that were obviously friends) in order to help us make a purchase for a lamp. He was a nice enough guy and it was actually an experience to have him lead us deep into the souks without knowing where we were or where we were going. I definitely spent more than I wanted to here and by the end of the experience I was feeling quite ticked off about being asked 'to take a look' and 'what you looking for', it became irritating and I just wanted to get out of there.Again, its a place you have to visit whilst in Marrakech but have a bit of a guard up , don't be too polite and know what you are going for before you go in and you should have a really enjoyable time.Good experience but the hard sell can get too over bearing"

On our 1st visit we wandered so far in that we got lost and ended up being \"guided\" back to the main square. Locals who offer this expect to be paid and are often standing around waiting for tourists who look lost or they hear a key word in a conversation and immediately step in to offer to show the tourist where this place is. There are stalls selling beautiful craft work and others selling household items or fake football shirts, track suits, etc. Different parts of the market sell things of different quality. Bargaining is expected. We found the type of flooring a good clue. The fresh orange juice on sale is good as are the nuts and dates sold in the main square. All over the souks there are cafes where it's very enjoyable to sit and watch."

It doesn't matter if you're looking for something specific or you just want to see how this place looks like. Be assured that someone will approach you and say that in tihs particular stall prices are very good for you. These guys speak in 10 different languages and they will insist that you have to see this or that. Bargain very hard. Bargaining is part of the culture, so don't feel uncomfortable. Remember that price for tourists is at least 3 times higher, so bargain extremely hard or walk away and find the same item in different stall and negotiate the price once again. If you start negotiations, but you decide to walk away - say very nicely thank you and start walking, shopkeeper will call after you and will give you better price. Don't accept it though. Keep asking for better price or walk away. These guys might try to \"intimidate\" you, but it's a mean business, so be persistent. It's worth to have gps and maps in your smartphone as it's easy to get lost. Get simcard from inwi network (120dh for sim/micro sim card with 3gb limit) and you will find your way out very easily. If you don't have map then ask other tourists where to go. If you ask locals then you'll have to pay them. This place is very unique."

It took me a long time to find my way around with confidence, but now I can get to where I want to reach and back out without assistance - but I still make the occasional wrong term. If visiting for the first time, go with a guide. When visiting on your own, the mornings are best, while after 4pm it is a seething mass of humanity. Goodness you have to haggle like mad when you make a purchase. Trust no one! This month I wanted to visit a guy in the artisan's quarter for leather workers. I had not seen Hassan for 7 years and I wanted him to make a suede waistcoat like the one I had bought in the mid-90s for a friend of mine. I more or less walked to his kiosk with a couple of minor wrong turns. On the way back I stopped to take a picture to remind me of the turn. It happened to be outside a Berber herbalists. 'Come in he urged'. I obliged, but said it was only to look. The conversation got round to perfume oils. 'We have something really special', the guy said, instructing an assistant to fetch something. 'This is Morocco's finest', he said handing over a 5ml file of pure perfume oil. 'It is only 65 Dhs (then about \u00a34.75).', he stated. OK, I asked, 'But since when has Jeddah been in Morocco?' We agreed that Saudi had some fantastic perfume oils. I said it was too expensive. He protested that it was fantastic, what Moroccans used themselves etc. I said I would show him something. I opened my bag and produced 10 boxed files of the same brand, but a different perfume. 'Can you explained how I have managed to purchase these at 6.5 Dhs each?', I asked. Needless to say, I went back to my original supplier the following week and purchased 12 of his favoured perfume at 84 dhs (it had gone up to 7 dhs each!). My advice 1. Never buy as a new arrival - wait until you have a tan and have become familiar with the pricing structure 2. when you see something you want to buy, work out what you would be prepared to pay for it in \u00a3 and convert that amount into dirhams 3. if this is then less than the asking price from the vendor, offer half of the price you would be prepared to pay and take it from there 4. if it is more, then simply walk away, smile and say 'anna ma skeen' - which means, 'I am broke' in Arabic. 5. When they come chasing after you, offer half of the amount you would be prepared to pay and take it from there. Have fun, it is a great place!!"

The souks offer a variety of leather goods, spices, pottery, jewellery, metal work and loads of other weird and potentially wonderful things. When you find something you are interested in and want to know the price, the shop keeper will demand an unrealistic and verging on insulting price. Now this is where the haggling begins, my rule of thumb is that you generally want to pay 25% of that price give or take. A good example are Barbouches (the little leather shoes) which are worth between approx 70 Dh (\u00a35) and 100 Dh (\u00a37) a pair, depending on quality, not the 300+ Dh they will initially ask for. They will also try and tell you they are the best shoes ever made and also likely compare them against some cheap 'plastic' looking shoes. Don't be fooled!During the haggling, aim to look slightly offended when hearing the initial price. Also give out signs that these shoes are way to expensive, even tell them so. They will then ask you for your best price. This is where you have to be strong...hum and har for a good 20 seconds and then tell them 60 Dh. It is their turn to look offended now, although actually we are near to the right price. They will probably tell you that you're 'crazy', but again don't be fooled. They usually come back quickly with another price, but this will also be extremely expensive. Again refuse. This is when you start heading for the door, handing back the shoes and shaking your head. During this walk to the door you are likely to continue haggling, incrementing your bid by 5 Dh or thereabouts but staying in the 70 to 100 Dh bracket. Haggling even continues 10 steps up the street in some instances. Deal done! If this fails, no problem, the exact same shoes will likely be sold in another 50 shops within a 5 min walk. So plenty of chances to hone your skills! ;)Some other tips:- only buy Argan oil from the chemists, the oil sold in souks are generally of a poor quality (i.e. topped up with olive oil).- watch out for poor quality leather products, which generally smell bad as they have been softened with camel urine and pigeon poo.- if you don't want a henna tattoo, make sure you give the henna ladies a wide berth as they will try to physically snatch your hand to give you a so-called 'gift'."

They didn't like you walking away. Doing this with a guide in tow proved much more fruitful but the feeling that you're fair game isn't a pleasant one as a constant. An oddly unsatisfying experience without a guide."

The general atmosphere was nice but it's definitely away from what I call \"a great souk\". If you've been to Egypt or OAE then you know what I'm talking about.The souk itself is a giant puzzle of little (sometimes dead-end streets) full of everything - from fruits and vegetables to cloths, shoes, souvenirs and digital gadgets. Like every Arab country here you have to bargain hard for a discount. Normally if you offer 1/3 of the initial price and the seller agrees to give it to you - you're screwed. That means that even on this price the seller has already fooled you and received a lot more that it actually costs. But the feeling to bargain itself is great :)One more thing you have to be very careful about is not to get robbed. There are a lot of people just wondering around and trying to talk to everybody. Keep in mind that those people are actually trying to distract you and steal your phone, money or other valuables. Always keep your pockets safe."

Beware of the men who hang around and try to \"show you the way\". Ignore them! some are harmless, and you can throw them a few dirham if you genuinely need help. However, there was one man in particular who seemed to be the messenger-type for the leather bag souk area. When we decided not to buy the over-priced leather bags, he was extremely verbally abusive, like nothing I have ever experienced. I was quite frightened, as he continued to see us a few times afterwards, giving us \"the finger\", and shouting \"f#%k you\" as he went by. Many of the souk-salesmen have this attitude of entitlement from the tourists. I do not agree with this, as nobody should feel bullied and ganged up on, to buy anything, or to do anything. I dread to think if I was a lone female traveller here, you really need to keep your wits about you, especially in the evening time. (This abusive man was tall, wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap, dark skinned, ignore this horrible man.)"

Arriving in the hot afternoon sun, laden with suitcases, pale skin and the look of someone not having a clue where they were going, I soon found myself on the outskirts of the walled market area having taken the short bus journey from the airport. There were no shortage of young children (watched from a distance by their parents) who were very eager to guide me to the Riad I had booked and of course relieve me of some of my money. Having found the Riad, I paid my very helpful guide who went on his merry way, not before trying to squeeze me for a bit more cash. Best thing is to be direct, with a smile and laugh it off. The sounds, smells and colours are like nothing else I had encountered and for the more claustrophobic of you I would not recommend it. If you enjoy everything moving at 100 mph, bikes and people from every angle then you will enjoy every minute. There are street vendors offering every type of food you can imagine, drinks, fruits and I was happy to try most things. The place is quite an attack on the senses. Along the quieter alleyways and away from the main tourist areas you can feel quite isolated as the night goes on, every person you see will try and direct you to the well known tourist restaurants, with roof top gardens. I did indulge for one night to such a place and found it most enjoyable with wonderful food, although I usually try and avoid these places. What I didn't know, is that late in the evening, gone midnight, they begin to close off some of the gates within the walled city itself. So I found myself, having left a random bar and talking with a most welcoming Moroccan family, walking around at about 2am totally unable to find my way out! Every alley I turned down was a dead end with the huge wooden gates locked from within. Each time I found a new path it was blocked, often finding groups of men chopping meat on large heavy wooden blocks, with meat cleavers. Merely people preparing food for the next day. Eventually I gave in and paid for a road sweeper to show me the way out. Now the actual market is full of snake charmers, monkey handlers, various showman, fire eaters, acrobats, something for everyone. If you do stand about watching, as in every big city, be mindful of pickpockets. Otherwise it is a very safe enjoyable environment. If shopping, never pay full price for anything, taxis, clothes, shoes, you will notice that there are no price tags in any of the shops or stalls, the price goes up depending on how wealthy you look. If you don't want to bargain, don't bother buying anything. The atmosphere here is quite amazing, I often stand back and watch what is going on and have often found a rooftop to see the whole of the square to watch the comings and goings. I've been back many times and can understand why some people don't like it and why others fall in love with it. I'd advise only coming to Marrakech for 3 to 4 days and go on elsewhere. It is a unique place to visit but if you want the history and a more authentic experience then go to Fez in the north of the country. Think if London was your only experience of England, the differences are the same. The nightclubs I found to be friendly places and a lot of fun, drinks were in keeping with mainland Spain and other major cities. Generally, people are friendly, helpful and happy to chat to you. Respect the culture, read up on the laws and you'll have a great time. Read \"voices of Marrakech\" by Elias Canetti before going."

If you slow to look at anything, you are immediately pounced on and given the 'hard sell'. Many vendors claim that they have hand made Berber items and unique antiques, real silver, etc. Marrakech was our last stop of travelling for 2 weeks around Morocco and we saw those 'unique' Berber items at practically every tourist stop during our travels in Morocco. Unless you really know your antiques and silver - beware - it's just mass produced junk.We were one of the unfortunate tourists that got lost in the souks and when we slowed to try to get our bearings, we were approached by a young man. He told us the way out was just a few minutes away and pointed us in the 'right' direction. When we started to go that way, he went out in front and keep telling us to go this way. We knew that he would ask for money but and pulled 10 dirham discreetly out of our wallets to hand over and be less likely subjected to demands of more money. He did show us a way out but what was surprising was that when I gave him the money, he claimed he didn't want it. Just at that time another man approached, told the money from the younger man and began to berate us, saying that 'This is not money for a man! It is money you would give a boy'! We just kept walking away and not engaging, but he kept following closely and yelling. Finally, he gave up with the final words of 'Get out of Marrakech, and never come back'! Ummm... okay... I have no objection to never going back there."

The sights and sounds (as well as the bustling crowds) make the Souks daunting for some, but relax and enjoy. The locals are very friendly and there is little to fear (other than the small risk of pick pockets and the many mopeds that share the narrow passage ways). The Souks are divided by crafts/goods. Stick to the leatherware, fabric, and metalwork sections and steer away from livestock/food preparation areas would be my best advise ! Don't forget to haggle - you should look to pay no more than one third of the original asking price. A must do experience in Marrakech (most hotels offer guided excursions if the don't feel brave enough to visit independently)."

The trend that guide or even a taxi driver takes you to the places to buy where they get commission, which is common i guess any country.Anyway please visit in the evening after 4 so the shops are ready, during the day there wont be the local market and it opens everyday like some suggest Friday they don't open which is not correct. we did our shopping on Friday afternoon."

Just a warning to those considering a trip to the walled city of old Marrakech as this place is not easy to handle but it is still worth it because you are taken into different world. There are few street signs and it's easy to get lost, the traders pester you and don't give up. There are some nasty young men around who pretend they want to help you to get to your destination but actually get you lost and then demand money from you. There are a lot of fast motorbikes, bikes and small vehicles mixing with pedestrians, so you have to be alert. In the square people shout out at you to get your attention to get your money, locals can get annoyed with you if you take photographs or may demand a payment. If you pay for your meal in big notes you need to demand the change as the staff are happy to keep it without asking. Haggling for goods got the price down by 40%.The place is dirty. the hygiene is very poor and animals are seen as animals and not pets. But like i said, it's still worth going for the experience of entering a world removed from the one I am use to."

I read some reviews about needing a guide, the threatening atmosphere, dirty, it\u2019s a rip off, high prices etc. Just go with an open mind and a smile on your face. You certainly do not need a guide \u2013take a map, but don\u2019t worry about getting lost in the souk, that is part of it. If you really feel that a guide is an absolute essential, then book one that is trusted though your Riad. But at least give it a go on your own first.Tend to agree that most of the stuff is the same or very similar. But it\u2019s still a damn site better than seeing the exact same retail chains in every single city across the world. Just go to Marrakech new town (Zara, Starbucks, McDonalds etc.) and you could be anywhere in the world. Makes you want to run straight back to the souks!Of course the shop keepers try to entice you into their shops. When there is so much competition around why wouldn\u2019t they. But a polite \u2018no thank you\u2019 or \u2018non merci\u2019 with a smile on your face goes a long way. You will soon find that the vast majority of owners are not the slightest bit threatening, but have a good sense of humour and this is part of the game.Haggling \u2013 yes, you have to haggle for everything. After a while it can become a bit tiring. But it is part of life here. Embrace it and take it for what it is. Just remember a successful negotiation is not about winning, it\u2019s when the seller thinks they have a good price and the buyer thinks they have a bargain. Pay what you are happy to pay and what you think is reasonable, that way you can\u2019t feel ripped off. As a rough guide the end price should be somewhere between 30% and 40% of the original price offered. Prices appear to be higher around and near the Fna square. Check your purchases before handing over the cash.Don\u2019t try to do the whole lot in one go \u2013 take a break and have a mint tea somewhere. If you see that one item that you must have and you stumbled across it by accident \u2013 buy it. Chances are, unless you have a very good sense of direction you won\u2019t find it again.Hand trucks and trollies are used in the main souk streets to move things around. Keep a listen out and move aside. Mopeds use the side streets around the main souk areas and within the median itself, so look and listen. Looks chaotic but it works.Safe to wander around day and night."

I cant stress enough how it's just all so much garbage. Somewhere there is a big factory churning out this stuff (someone else mentioned Made In China and i can see why). Marrakech's main economy is tourism, in fact it looks like there is nothing else. You will be constantly hassled to buy. I'm good at handling hawkers but it does get annoying.2. There are no road rules to speak of and it gets tiring having to dodge mopeds zipping through the pedestrianised areas all the time. There are not many pavements in the Medina and the drivers all dangerously cut blind corners, it's pure luck if you don't get hit.3. There are three major food groups in Marrakech:- tagines, kebabs and pizza/pasta. You will get sick of them by the end of your holiday.Obviously the Italians do pizza and pasta a LOT better so be prepared to be disappointed.A lot of tagines are bland, bland, bland, like the old days when you used to boil vegetables to death.The kebabs are a constant letdown, served with greasy chips, or no salad, or no rice, or just lacking in flavour.There is an over abundance of almonds in all sweets and desserts.Overall the Marrakech food experience is extremely poor compared to any contemporary country.Souk Kafe is the one oasis amongst the culinary mediocrity, I have left a review.4. What the Morrocan's consider a tourist destination is different from you and I. There are much better examples of similar things in other parts of the world.Jardin Majorelle is considered one of the top attractions in Marrakech but they're really pathetic when you compare them to something like Kew Gardens. The only redeeming feature is getting away from the Marrakech rat race. El Badi Palace is a joke, poorly preserved, no interesting architectural features and poor signage, the storks are the only thing you won't see much better elsewhere.The other attractions have the same low quality feel.5. Having to constantly haggle prices on everything wears you down, and you still know by the end of it you're a tourist getting ripped off.6. Everybody is out to make a buck off you. This includes dodgy men and boys who keep telling you a way is closed so they can offer you a different route and charge for the privilege. At times they can be quite menacing (ignore them).Likewise expect to be asked for money from your guides etc even if you arrange and pay for excursions through your accommodation.It's a shame people like this ruin their tourism industry.7. Marrakech is not cheap for a tourist. I found things starting at not a million miles away from London prices (known as one of the most expensive cities in the world). You have to haggle but see number five above.8. And it's just dirty.If you have to stay make it a maximum of one or two days otherwise it will just wear you down. Take some proper walking shoes, my partner didn't and struggled at times."

Every one is very friendly and we have never seen any crime. All prices are negotiable and it's not difficult to get he best price- it's always at least a 1/3 of what they start with reply with 1/10 don't budge much and then walk away. If they want to sell they will come and finally agree to what you are offering. 50 mdh gets you well made slippers, 150 mdh gets you a large double thickness pashmina shawl or a Fez hand painted large ornamental plate. Well those were my bargains today. Great local sweets like nougat etc. safe for anyone to walk around and no dress code, my teenage daughters never felt uncomfortable ( apart from in the livestock/butchery part)"

This is my favourite souk, it has such colour and variety, and the stallholders are really good, they don't pester you although, of course, they will try and sell you something if you show even the slightest interest. The leather goods and textiles are so good and the leather is really good value, so bargain and enjoy your puchases. Always take your camera, there are so many things too see, and the light coming in through the slits in the roof covering gives wonderful effects. You won't get lost, just keep a hand over your bag, and allow 2-3 hours to wander around. It is perfectly safe, no need to go around with a guide, I wander on my own very happily and I'm female."

Maybe you just don't need to know. Some places in the world are to be just felt, nothing more, and these souks are definitely that type of place. One thing has very different prices in many spots - you should negotiate with the seller, I admit, I overpaid for some things. Essaouira's souks are calmer and cheaper, but there is different atmosphere, strictly connected with the have-no-words-to-describe Jemma El Fna square. You can be bit shocked of bit aggressive sellers, it might become little irritating after a while. Keep smiling and telling \"Shukran\" or \"Merci\" or just ignore them. Don't buy a fresh food there - flies everywhere, cats around. Patisseries are good, but not everywhere, just look forward TripAdvisor logo (original one !! some local restaurants/shops have false, painted logo). Just go there. And feel. And believe. It is once a lifetime place you must see."

Cow and goat heads are displayed outside the stalls. People have live lizards , hedgehogs. tortoises, birds and all sorts in tiny cages in the burning sun all for sale. Donkeys with open weeping sores stand without water all day and evening . Really difficult to see and the images will stay with me for ever, but it`s just a different culture. Do not take notice of all the lads offering to give directions, they will send you the wrong way and take money for it.

The stall holders are good natured but, to stop for even a second to admire anything is to commence the hard sell.

I was a bit afraid as I heard the shop workers may get aggressive and not allow you to walk away but after the second day my daughter and I walked through the alleys freely and comfortably. Do your research before buying items so you know how much each item is worth, don't get caught up in the transaction bargaining and walk away if you're not okay with the price, they'll follow you but won't harass you. Just know you'll find the same items right around the corner so if you can't get the price you want move on, but if you notice your asking price won't ever get taken, then you need to change your final price because it's too low. I walked away with no shoes which I was expecting to leave with at least 20 pairs. They were asking $20 for leather sandals which I can buy in the US for less and way better made and longer lasting. The detailed handwork of the items sold are so amazing, each time I purchased an item I knew each was individually handmade not by a machine that's mass produced."

In no way did we feel threatened. We were invited into shops to view the good, just say no thank you. If you are offered some Morrocan tea decline as you are then invited into the shop for some intense selling and told we gave you hospitality so buy.A word of caution, beware of the bicycles, scooters and other motorised vehicles that drive up and down the narrow lanes, a nightmare. If you get lost in the Souk, look at the satellite dishes as they all face the big Mosque, La Koutoubia, so you can find your way out. It is also best to refuse any offers to be guided around the Souk.We took the shuttle bus from our hotel, Riu Tikida Gardens, we were on a 10 day holiday in Marrakech, 22nd September to 2nd October.

There are some basic rules you have to remember - basically you don't need any of what they are selling, they start at an exorbitantly high price and your response has to be equally low - very very low and from there you bargain. Bargaining is great fun, again with rules - lots of acting, facial expressions of horror at the prices they say, clutching of the head in disbelief, saying no, no, no, several times, but most importantly - smile and be polite at the same time. They love it when you enter into the game. Then at the end when the stallholder is pulling a long face and reluctantly bagging up your goods you slap him on the shoulder, smile and say - 'its business yes' and offer your hand? and smile. He invariably smiles back and shakes your hand. I did it all the time and never had a bad experience. Ladies also remember to dress conservatively - cover shoulders and no short skirts/shorts.

There is one shop in particular, a wedding clothes shop that also sells pillows, across from a all natural remedies place. Both shops are amazing, if i can find out their names i will be sure to tell you. Watch out for many stall owners that pull you into their shops and try to thrust items on to you. I was offered a chess set and told to \"take it, take it, you pay later\". To any tourist just beware about this, however haggle haggle haggle, i got someone down from 10000 Dhm to 3200 dhm! When buying the traditional slippers go else where as in the souks it's just cheap plastic they use not leather. Also i would not buy the food from stalls if i were you, a word to the wise."

The key to haggling in Morocco is definitely walking away - this is when prices really drop. i didn't have a lot of cash to spend on this trip, and i wasn't fussed about not making a purchased but this had the accidental affect of me spending less than i expected! I found that i was getting products for about half the initial asking price. If you're a particular good haggler I imagine that you could get items for even less!i found that vendors next to Jeema el fna square gave the least discounts, the souk closes between 8-9 in the evening, but some vendors do get grumpy at around this time (me and my friend were a bit surprised at the level of rudeness). i think the best time to get a bargain is either first in the morning when vendors are looking for the first sale of the day, or towards the evening when vendors need a sale.I also walked round the Dyer's souk, Copper souk, and the instrument souk with my guide book, the guide book definitely helped and i don't think i could have done it without the book."

Well the first thing to say about the souks is be careful you are not run over by scooters, motor bike riders or cyclists, they are all bloody mad. It seems that those using motorised transport have to have crash helmets. Some wear them properly, some back to front and the majority hang them from the handlebars. Walk on the right hand side and you maybe ok.Once into the souks have fun the stalls sell everything, if you go down some of the alleys you can buy live chickens then have it killed and plucked all in under 9 minutes. They also have larger beasts as well. Never be under any illusions stall holders are there for one thing only, to make a profit. Rest assured they will rip you off if you let them. Read all the background on bargaining you want but a good rule of thumb I was given by a local was ask what the price is. Then offer 10% and never pay more than half the asking price. Be prepared to walk away. An example from personal experience, I saw a nice silver bracelet, price 1500 dirham, offered 150 and was nearly thrown out out the shop, but I wasn't the guy wanted a sale. We finally settled on 500 and then I walked away. I still reckoned I was paying to much.Beware of Henna ladies in the main square they have no scruples. They grabbed my wife's hand and started drawing patterns. We protested and then they had the cheek to try to charge us 300 dirham. They operate in two's while you are arguing with one the other is trying to pick your pocket from behind so beware. It's great fun though keep a sense of humour smile and be prepared to walk away.The main square at night is just madness. People everywhere. Food stalls of all kinds. People selling everything you could imagine. All round a great experience."

After an hour of wandering we had seen enough and headed out to the open air. This is where it really got scary for me with my phobia of snakes, this wasn't going to end well, they were everywhere, once they started sounding their bugles the snakes seemed to rise from the floor in all directions, at this point we did a vanishing act to the nearest taxi back to the hotel. The Medina is not our kind of place, and is not for the faint hearted, but I could see why its such a draw for the tourists. A must visit in Marrakesh, even if it's not up your street!!!"

It is a literal labyrinth where once you enter, if you are not careful, you may not find your way back out. They are absolutely fascinating, bustling with activity, colorful and full of fragrances, smells, that will capture and entice you. There is an area where you see the artisans working and in this area, the skill trades are grouped per area. So there is an area for making babouches (the famous moroccan slippers), an area for making leather bags, an area for making iron-wrought chandeliers, an area for making shoes etc... It's quite interesting to watch the artisans working in very closed and cramped, dimly lit quarters, banging away at their trade. Then there are tiny squares where you can escape and have a wonderful mint tea! Some of them have a roof-top terrace overlooking the rooves of the medina. An absolute must if you can find these caf\u00e9s. One in particular is the Caf\u00e9 des Epices. Their roof-top terrace is amazing! As for the artisan work in the souks, it's really worth buying whatever grabs you as you won't find such quality at such prices (bargaining is a must) anywhere outside Morocco! You will bring home stuff you will really enjoy wearing or using!"

However, we went back on the last day of our stay (7th day) and felt much more at ease there as we had acclimatised to the madness and craziness of Marrakech. Looked at scarves on one stall, he wanted 400 dirhams for a pashmina which was way too much and each time we went to leave he would come down a little but not enough. Eventually we got tired of the bargaining process and left the shop, only to have him come running after us a few mins later agreeing to our original offer of 150 dirhams, which on reflection, was not that cheap after all. A lot of the shops had fixed prices for things and would not come down. We bought a wooden box in the souk in Essaouira for 50 dirhams, a similar smaller box in Marrakech souk was a fixed price of 200 dirhams!We went down many small back streets where the locals obviously shopped but had to keep an eye out for the motorbikes which were driven at crazy speeds weaving in and out of people. Lots of beggars particularly in the evening, women with babies/young children and cripples which was a bit upsetting at first but unfortunately one became immune to the sight after a while."

We bought a few things at around 1/3 of the initial asking price, 2 belts for 220dm (one was reversible, so worth twice as much he said...), a sturdy tea tray and some glasses for 200 - too much at about half initial asking - my girlfriends purchase, she gives in too easily... Then in one lamp shop I tried to play hardball, which didn't go down well. Oddly, I'd say it's the seemingly most cheery, affable, middle aged blokes that you want to avoid. He started at something like 1400dm (saying this was the price for nice English people, Americans would be made to pay over 2000) for a poorly made brass lamp with bits of tinted glass that he was saying we're jewels. We didn't really want the lamp, but they are often very insistent that you offer a price. So I thought of the kind of price I wouldn't mind paying in tk maxx and then dropped it a bit. 60dm I said, expecting to probably be made to triple it and walk away with a piece of scrap metal. His face dropped, he squared his shoulders. \"How much?\" He asked several times with the same response. Then he told us to get out of his shop, ripping the lamp out of my hands (which they will make you hold with nowhere to put down so you can't leave).The sights of the square are polarising, fascinating but inexcusably cruel.Probably the best bits were getting to look down on the square from a cafe (particularly at night - there's a good cafe atop a hotel, just a couple of doors down from the post office) It's definitely worth going, just go with the frame of mind that it's like a casino, the house always wins, but if you're having fun then it's probably worth it. (And don't take any photos of the henna girls in full burkas, they really don't like it.)"

I think as a rule of thumb be prepared to pay maybe a third of what the \"decent\" vendors charge you and if the number sounds extreme trust me it IS and offer them 10-20% of what they asked. Other than that the souks are great, I got argan oil, rugs, clothes, jewelry leather goods, spices and of course a Hamman \"Moroccan Bath\" and it was pure bliss.

On the whole, there wasn't too much of the hassle that can be a feature of such markets, but if you feel uncomfortable with haggling, a few stalls do advertise fixed prices. You might also try the government-managed artisan market just a little way north of Jemmah El Fn, on the boulevard leading to the new town.

We visited one of the palaces and decided to take a walk through the Souk. We were in no hurry so could take our time. We found the layout OK, lots of side alleys but overall quite easy to get around. This may be peculiar to me (I refuse to have a SAT NAV) as I seem to be able to get around wherever I go. If in doubt my suggestion is simply look up. Often there are small signs to the main square and if there you can get anywhere in Marrakech.

Shoe shop where an hilarious shopkeeper tried to charge \u00a390 for a pair of \"Adidas\" trainers - now not sure about the product but they were good quality. The chap didn't want to let us go but we walked away in the shoes for around \u00a322 which we were happy with. Then ushered to a herb shop where prices were misrepresented and we spent about \u00a3100 but we did get lots of very good stuff. But best of the best that day was a huge saving on tours to the Atlas Mountains at about \u00a318 each and a Sahara desert tour for two days at \u00a345 each. A bargain. Official guides should cost around \u00a320 but doubt they will tell you where to buy much cheaper tours than the hotel they work for. So advise is to pay attention and be firm but polite. "

Once alone with some knowledge of Arabic, 2nd trip 2 of us, and the final trip 3 of us with one of our guys fluent in French. Now the first thing you need to know about any souk, this is not a hustle free zone and every action taken by you in a souk will generate a reaction by the locals. There are good, bad, and plain weird smells. The sights are good but there will be crowds and people trying to hustle you for money or to buy something. Survival tips: Shopping: You will need good bargaining skills, whatever they offer as a price drop it down by 50% and then negotiate and you might agree on something that works out to be a 20-40% discount. Be prepared to walk away when negotiations are slow. Have an idea and plan of what you need before going into the souk as this is not a place to browse and make up your mind.Navigation: This place is a maze and therefore download the map to your iphone or android device. Enable GPS so you know your location on this map. Set a insertion and extraction point if going in separate groups. Never pull a paper map out as that is setting you up as a target for hustlers. (worse case scenario: if lost, tired, frustrated, battery low, map on phone has failed to load, and want to find your way out, fine a bazaar staff member and negotiate a price with him, usually 50-100 dirham for a guided path to the taxi stand or main square.Food: The food market looks great and smells great, the slow cooked lamb dish is a must :) The orange juice for 4 dirham is great as well. Skip the salad and focus on cooked food.Chill Zones from the insanity: There are many roof top bars that can provide an escape from the chaos. (Le Salama is one of the great restaurants here)Attitude: Being polite here works with some people so first approach is be polite. Words like (La_Shukran, Non merci) should do the trick. Next level is the tough look into the eyes and say(Bas/khalas, assez, s'en aller), followed by Ma Salam ,au revoir). The above in Arabic and French should save you. Words are (No thanks, enough/finished/go away, goodbye).Warnings: If you fear snakes then once you hear the snake songs with flutes etc You are in the zone usually in the main square where the food stalls are. Monkeys are here as well. The trick they use here is a snake around the neck and then ask for money to take it off and you might get a photo with it or selfie if you are comfortable around it. Theft: Not a issue as the Marrakech people police this themselves and we saw a man grab a ladies bag only to have a screaming lady and a mob of 40-70 chasing him and catching him. The police got to him quite quick before the mob went crazy.Conclusion: Is it worth the trip into the souk, yes if you can handle the hustlers and hustle them yourself. You will find good deals. If the above tips scare you and lots of people around you is uncomfortable then stay in the main square instead of heading into the deep with the narrow streets etc A guide may be useful if you want to go deep into the maze."

FOR EVERYTHING (not food).I purchased Moroccan tagine spices for pennies. Bracelets for the teenagers which were about 30p each. There's a lot of counterfeit goods. With very blond hair I attracted some attention from locals. The local children follow you around trying to direct you to their uncles various stalls. They are totally harmless and we did not feel threatened in any way.After several hours perusing and observing, the Call to prayer came over the speakers. Locals dessert their stalls and go to pray. It's then deserted. Very surreal. We found a restaurant that was not exactly wonderful, but ok.Wished we waited as on exiting it seemed the square had become a delightful food market. This happens about 6pm. Stalls serving every Moroccan delicacy you can imagine. My nose was alight with the smells etc but my belly was already full to the brim.You have to see this place to believe it. It was filmed in Sex in the City 2 when Carrie met Aiden in apparently Abu Dhabi. Worth the trip."

If you can, go with a guide - they are a complete maze and it would be very easy to get lost and not see all the different areas if you weren't familiar with it.One thing to be aware of is the aggressiveness and insistence of the traders themselves, who will shout and pull at you to demonstrate their wares and can make you feel incredibly uncomfortable (especially as a woman). Go in with a set budget and an idea of what you want to buy and you will have a much more satisfying time. If you can, ask a local/staff from your hotel/etc. for guide prices for different items, so you know you're not being ripped off."

Most of all, this square... is not a square. It is a living thing; and a chaotic one as well. And that's why it is so amazing! Together with the several streets that end and start in El Fna, this is the heart of Marrakech, and where many Morrocans do business, meet, talk, or simply wonder around.Tourists just pop by, take photos, and try to get good bargains, which of course is not possible with such experienced local salesman. This is a place that will stretch your senses to new limits, while your brain will try to capture - with little success - the thounsands of rich details that unfold before you in this never-ending movie. If you spend 1 hour here, it'll feel like you're there for 4 hours; if you walkabout for 4 hours, you'll get unexpectedly exhausted as if you'd been walking all day.I guess the best way to experience El Fna is to live it up. Relax, while standing or seating there in the middle of the crowd. Let all those colours, smells, sounds, tastes and movements, grab you deep inside. Don't try to make sense of it; instead, let your emotions, spirit and imagination run free. Go with the flow. Don't resist El Fna, and you'll enjoy it more."

Shopkeepers did pester us of course, but to be honest, not as much as we expected and usually polite \"No, thank you\" was enough to stop them. Good advice to anyone shopping at the souks - please go to a \"normal\" shop with price tags (like the government one near the big square or a hypermarket Al Mazar Mall in the new town) to check the regular prices so you don't get ripped off."

If you like being approached by people carrying fresh produce, eagles, monkeys or even snakes who offer cheap photo ops, creative henna drawings on your body and simple snacks then this place is for you. The market is the busiest part of Marrakech and has many things to see and do. First, this place is quite big. In the main square there are food vendors, henna artists, musicians, snake charmers, monkeys, etc. Outside of the main square are smaller alleys that lead to a more underground shopping area where there are spice, jewelry and clothing stands for you to check out. If you are a younger traveler who is travelling by yourself or with some friends on a vacation, I highly suggest staying at one of the hostel's adjacent or in the market. For those who travel with families, there are wonderful hotel options on the outskirts of the market. Oh and most of these hotel options are AMAZING (ate dinner one night at one of the hotels near the mosque). As for the market, if you get tired of being heckled for tips for this and that and want to get out of Marrakech, take a desert excursion. There are anywhere from 1 day - 2 weeks options for going to the beautiful Sahara desert. In my opinion this is a must if you to Morocco. For a starting point in Morocco, Marrakech is a prime location for an exotic destination. FYI beware of pick pockets and anyone who asks for a lot of dirhams (Moroccan currency) always bargain for purchases and transportation for cheaper prices."

Haggling doesn't always work but when the stall or shop owner is stood between you and the door, you have to be wary of what you say. At night, the narrow streets, poor lighting, and men loitering around makes it an uneasy environment to be in.

There are thousands of people here, all the time. It's very noisy as there are street dancers, acrobats, musicians, snake charmers and traders all vying for attention. One thing I would stress is that under no circumstances should you perpetuate the animal attractions by buying into them. There are monkeys on chains in nappies and baby clothes and you can pay to hold one or have your photo taken. DO NOT DO IT. It's just cruel. Same for the horse and carriages, some horses are emaciated and have scars from being whipped. Again, don't get in one. If nobody got in one or bought into it they would no longer be there. You can buy turtles and iguanas readily to 'put in your hand luggage'. These are kept in tiny crates and one I saw was trapped by its paw with its head through the bars until I told the trader to release it. It's fun, don't get me wrong and I'm sure it's a cultural thing but just don't do it. It should be illegal, it's definitely immoral. As for stalls, you can buy anything here very cheaply. The best place to be is on a rooftop so you get a good view and some breeze. It's very hot. You will be offered anything you want, mobile phones, bubble machines, sunglasses, watches etc. It's an experience you want forget and I didn't get an upset tummy at all, just take normal precautions with food, drinks and ice.

Lots of things, Leather bags, pottery, lamps, rugs, spices, herbal medicine......They all start with the price 250MAD which to be honest is expensive \u00a320...if you are going to marrakech you dont want to be paying england prices for their products you want to feel like to grabbed a bargin.Dont feel bad to give them a silly price, if you convert it into pounds you will tell yourself \"Oh \u00a39/10 is great for this product but thats in england remember your in Morocco! and even if they sell it to you for \u00a35 they are still making a profit. Our strategy was to decide a price that we wanted to pay for it and went in straight with \"how much\" they say 250 MAD then I say \"il give you 100 MAD take it or leave it.....Put it this way my sister got a real leather bag for \u00a38 If they think your price is silly they will not sell it to you but next door they have the same thing so you will get what you want for the price you want.Its all about money there, if you take pictures they want money, Many of mine were done in secret...if you give 10 MAD they ask for 20 (never happy) taking pictures with the monkeys and snakes will cost you ....But word of caution to animal lovers you will go home stressed seeing the monkeys on leads with dirty baby nappies on, snakes are stolen from the wild and locked up in these small drums, they are desensitised with all the pollution and eventually die or they kill them....The monkeys are also stolen from the mountains and beaten so they know how to perform!! broke my heart....Refused to take a picture or even look in amazement because its so cruel.Be prepared for children (4/5/6) years of age coming up and selling things, another thing that was heartbreaking to see, you just felt so sorry for them (just looked at them and thought of my kids).Everyone is nice to you until they get your money then they don't care (literally). Found the shops around the square cheaper than the souks and its fixed price which was nice after a day haggling....Fresh orange juice is a must.....Seeing the square at night is amazing and the souks and shops are still open so if you dont want to trudge around in the heat and do something else everything is still there at night, much cooler and pleasant.Enjoy"

We found the shop keepers friendly and not too aggressive in their selling technique. We'd visited other places in North Africa and found nodes to be very persistent, this certainly is not the case in Marrakech. It's very easy to by disoriented while wandering around the Souk, but there are plenty of signs redirecting you back to the big square. Once back there you do have to run the gauntlet of snake charmers and Berbers all wanting to relieve you of your money in return for a photograph. The central cafe affords great views over the square and is a great place to people watch. Overall a great place to visit either day or night."

That night we heard of several similar experiences from the other guests at the Riad where we were staying. One couple were lead to a quieter area and foreably split up the husband was driven to the local ATM and told if he didn't pay 400 dirham he would not be taken back to his wife..fortunately it all worked out .. We believe that this is only a small element most people we have met have been no problem. However we were approached this morning and offered a tour of the tannery again we politely but firmly declined and that was that.. Please don't let this put u off just be careful and avoid quite areas with no foot traffic"

            "review": "This is Marrakech. Not that many people will actually read this review due to the vast number which are uploaded daily, but here are some musings... This place defines Marrakech. From the tanneries which produce leather used in the bags sold here, to the families in the Atlas Mountains making wooden camels for sale around the Djemma el-Fna, the souks are the epicentre of Marrakechi life.You can buy practically anything here, from motorcycles to carpets, cheap souvenirs (lamps and tagines) to spices and Moroccan dress. Haggling is a must -- inspect the quality and point out any defects (use your mobile phone light to illuminate the item properly -- shops have deliberate subjective lighting), using multi-buy discounts, 'student discounts', 'Ramadan discounts' (where applicable) etc. to get your price. If the seller is really hesitant on a price you're coming close to what the real value should be, but push as low as you can. Don't have mercy. These guys are often really nice but they buy the gear for a pittance and can make a profit on relatively low-value sales. You will naturally be 'hassled' (as some have called it) when walking through the souks -- if you aren't interested just ignore them or say 'non, merci' -- they will take notice and leave you alone. Not their fault, they just want money and need to survive. They certainly work harder for their sale than many Western shopkeepers! Also, make sure the item you get wrapped up is the item you actually chose (sometimes they can swap items behind your back to give you a cheaper/damaged alternative). Always ask for a bag and wrapping service -- it should be free (if not, haggle to get it free!). Some sellers make the goods themselves (in the really deep parts of the souks (again, the deeper you go in, the better it gets)) but most don't. Many sellers purchase used tools and wood shavings to put on their stand so it looks like they make the products themselves -- but its unlikely. Sometimes you can pay more for the theatre of buying (I love it, personally!) but you don't need to. Watch out for motorbikes (walk on the right) and don't touch any Moroccan women -- that's a no no! Also, keep cash secure and if you're carrying a mobile phone, put it in your pocket and shove your hand in there so no one can walk past and pull it out. Don't accept the services of any souk guides -- they won't be free and will take you to their friends' stalls (where they get commission) and its unlikely you want to spend hours looking at carpets all day (wasting sellers' time can also result in aggressiveness, as it would do in Europe!) which will usually cost hundreds of pounds and aren't British Airways- or Royal Air Maroc-friendly. You wouldn't have a guide to go shopping in the UK, so don't take one here. They will end up spoiling your day with high prices (you can't haggle with shopkeepers if a guide brings you somewhere because the seller will know that he has to pay commission to the guide and will hike up prices even more). If you're lost, just ask a shopkeeper (not someone waiting around outside shops) -- the older, the better. You will find your way back to the Djemaa el-Fna eventually. No one dies in the souks...Enjoy the souks and go with an open mind. Haggling and trying to get the most money is part of their culture and it's something I love about Morocco. If you want shopping to be the same as it is in Europe, don't go on holiday to Africa! Alternatively, if you just can't handle the haggle, head to Ensemble Artisanal -- the Marrakechi version of a traditional department store. It's government-sponsored, has fixed prices where the producer gets paid directly, sells goods of a (generally) far higher quality (and those which are more expensive than the souks), and can be found opposite the Cyber Parc."

The souk is worth a visit we found orientating ourselves by the cafe de France helped. Any thing north of the market is a souk we headed for the Museum of Marrakech this takes u through the heart of the souks.

Enquiring of stall holders \"La Place?\" seemed to get us back on track.

They are absolutely beautiful and great to visit once. Anymore than once or twice and it can get irritating. The souks range from things like leather bags, shisha's, scarves, tea sets, knives, jewelry, clothing and tangines. It's absolutely massive as well. Every stall you walk past will have someone trying to drag you into their shop. For some, no thank you is not enough just push past them and keep going. Some can be pretty grabby and in your face. Just keep telling them no thank you. Every single one will tell you that it's the best quality, \"its not from china\", and for you they will do the best price. Depending on how busy it is will depend on the price. They will look at how you are dressed and decide a price. They are there to rip you off. We went into one stall to get four scarves and they tried to charge us 1060 dirham. Another stall tried to charge us 900 dirham for one scarf. A local would pay about 15 (if that). They will tell you it's cashmere or real silk. ITS NOT TRUE. The majority is fake and cheaper versions. They will tell you their jewelery, teapots and other metal based products are real silver. It's not. It's pressed metal. If you are finding they are charging you over the odds and won't come down low enough for you just go to the cafflour store (about 30 minutes from the medina) it's got a lot better quality stuff at a much lower price. For example the teapots in the souks will be approx 300 - 600 dirham for a large one. In the store you will get it for over half that. However, the store is fixed priced and you may come across a stall that is willing to do it cheaper. It's also one that you can use rather than just being for display. If they tell you that you can use them - they cant. In the souks the majority of the teapots are for display only. There job is to rip you off and they will say anything to make a sale. However, remember, that you don't half to buy anything you don't want to buy. It's a great one of experience, however, it can be a little much. I would avoid foods and spices there too."

There are numerous souks within the Medina of Marrakesh, and as many reviewers have commented, it is extremely easy to get lost in this labyrinth of a place.My advice is either go with a official guide or ask store owners (esp the ones who are just getting on with their lives and not hassling you to go to their shop). You should take caution when people (esp younger teens) volunteer you the direction to a landmark or offer to take you there. Out of experience, they may be leading you to somewhere like the tannery where you then get hassled to pay, or just straight out ask for money after taking you to your destination. Obviously not all people have this sort of motifs but just be aware who you are getting directions from. It is a busy place and there are absolutely tons to see and buy there, the alleyways also produce some great photos day and night. It is a must visit when in Marrakesh."

If you don't really, really want to buy something don't offer a price. This will infuriate them and they may kick you out of their stall. Be completely sure that you want to buy something before starting to haggle but don't have your heart set on it if you aren't willing to hand out the cash. If you ask how much somethings costs they'll most likely say \"how much do you want to pay?\" Don't answer this. It's a trap. Make them tell you their price and if it's way too high, walk away.

The market is the biggest I have ever experienced and covers just about every purchasable commodity known to man from leather products to metalware, from home produce to fabrics the choice is endless. This is a showcase of how the Moroccan culture existed so many years ago when every household exhibited its wares for sale, be they lush carpets, or a few tomatoes!The dimly lit alleyways contain a multitude of sellers and their products, organised thankfully for the tourists into sections - so you get all the clothing shops in one area, metal goods in another, very convenient, but that is the only tidy element of the whole market. What hits you first is the smell, be it over ripe vegetables, freshly tanned leather or the local population who do not seem to have taken a shower for months! Next are the infernal motorbikes that want to occupy the same space as pedestrians - their presence is an intrusion into an otherwise pleasant walk back into history.So after the punishing, sickly aromas and nightmare incidents with the motorbikes your next obstacle are the shifty eyed traders, who latch upon any eye to eye contact, or reason to start a conversation within an microsecond of you noticing them - they have been eying you up since you turned into the alleyway!If you are wanting a product and are prepared to haggle start very, very low and enjoy the fun. If you are not wanting to haggle don't even bother to appear interested as the traders will not let you go without showing you their entire shop - a painful experience!Next - don't get lost. The place is massive and can make you uneasy when you drift into areas where there are few tourists. Begging is rife and so is the constant offers to guide you for money. My advice is use one of the official guides - for a modest fee he will lead you where you want to go and explain the background to each section and most importantly the history of the place. He will also advise on prices and how to haggle - he will even do it for you if you ask. Of course he will introduce you to his friends and backers, but at least there is an element of security attached."

We passed metal workers, tin bangers, leather workers and fabric/wool dyers.We visited a man who carves wood on a manual lathe that he turns with his feet. He was amazing and we purchased wooden keepsakes including a hand carved domino set.We also visited a huge shop that was filled to the brim with Berber crafts. This included vases, mirrors, lanterns, bowls, jewellery, etc. The shop was two floors and things were piled on top of each other, hung on every inch of the walls and most of the floor. Our last stop was to meet a man who explained the process for dying wool and silk. He showed us brilliant colours from saffron, poppies, indigo, lavender and more. The people were friendly and yes sometimes bordering pushy. But we felt their passion for their crafts and didn't mind supporting them with purchases during their slow period. The souks can be overwhelming given the sheer number of booths, stalls with unknown food items and the many people. But if you want to mingle with the locals and see all that the craftsmen have to offer it is certainly worth experiencing."

It seemed like what the shopkeeper originally offered was 1/2 what the price should be. Be prepared to state your price, ask for the lowest price and if not what you want walk away. Usually, the person will give you the price. There are sections in the souks for fruits and vegetables, clothing, spices, wooden items, lanterns and restaurants. The people here work hard and recycle or reuse all the time. Scooters race through the souks so always walk close to the wall on the right side. The souks are truly the heartbeat of Morocco. The smells, sights, and sounds are so unique. I would advise hiring a guide for half day and he will help you with landmarks to maneuver through the souks. When I go home to the United States, it will not be an adventure shopping like it is here. Plus, the enormous fruits and vegetables and meat won't be as fresh or delicious."

My wife and I were lucky to be assigned to Marrakesh in the 1970s in the Peace Corps, and lived in the medina about a 10 minute walk from Souk Al Summarine, the main tourist souk tourists see. We've been back many times since, and honestly, it hasn't changed that much. It really is a different world. Don't worry about getting lost if you go without a guide. You will. So what. Eventually you'll find your way out, and get back to your hotel or riyad. Enjoy the people. Marrakshis have been selling to foreigners in their souks for about 1,000 years, so don't worry about getting a \"fair price\" for things. There isn't such a thing. Figure out your walkaway price for something you want, and let that be it. If you walk, you walk. You won't get a \"local\" price for anything, and why should you? You're not a local. Get over it. Have fun in the souk, enjoy the sights, ask as many questions as the merchants will answer, and treasure your time in one of the truly unique places in the world, even though you didn't discover it nor escape from other tourists who are also there. You're lucky to be there. If you pay a few more dirhams than you think locals might pay for the same thing, who cares. If you truly enjoy and appreciate the experience, without being gushy, you'll have a great time."

Initial asking price is always very high and will come down depending on the amount of time you have to \"play the game\" and how well natured you are.As with so many of these things either party can be offended if the other is disrespectful.One good tip I can give is - Don't handle the merchandise if you do not intend to buy it, unless you are specifically invited by the seller/vendor.

The souks (market side streets) are a labyrinth of stalls and people - I won't say harassing, but - incessantly insisting you buy from their stall.. This isn't as bad as it sounds however THE MOST IMPORTANT THING we could suggest is DO NOT go too far in to the souks. We found ourselves inevitably lost and there were young local teenagers trying to get us to go this way and that, without realising it we were stuck god only knows where and surrounded by them all cajoling us this way and that.. My mum made a joke to one of the boys saying \"Oh, not you again\" and laughed and he cut her hand with a knife and said \"Bet you're sorry now!\" And this was by far terrifying as we near on ran away trying to find our way out. I am NOT trying to deter people from seeing this amazing, amazing place, however warning people of the dangers of straying too far. This has not deterred us from the fascinating sights but we will definitely be a lot more wary and try not to let this spoil the rest of our stay. I do really recommend Marrakech, it is such a beautifully interesting place and the culture is so different to our own (we're from London). It is an insightful place, but at all times try and keep a sense of humour to the heckles you will receive and try to keep calm in situations which may seem a little scary.

Sometimes you win some and you lose some :) the sellers will be your best friend at one moment and abuse you the next but its all in fun and part of the game so roll with it! I recommend for women to not be on their own and even better to have a male with you or a guide. Be respectful and cover your shouldres and knees. Try not to say WOW to everything you see or show too much interest as you will be bombarded!!! Have small notes and change with you and keep in seperate smaller and larger bundles and if you have a set price for an item you wish to buy once you reach your set price and the seller pushes for more you can say this is all I have and have the amount you set in a seperate bundle and thats all you show so its a wise thing to walk in with an idea of what you wish to buy and the amount you wish to spend so you have the money ready. Do not pay more than 6dirum for a large 1litre bottle of water and its hot in Marrakesh so drink up and shopping in the souk is hard and thirsty work and you can be lost for hours exploring in this spectacular place!!(although in saying that alot of it is shaded from the sun) FYI the square outside the souks comes alive at night with many restaurants and snake charmers and music."

Barter for everything and dont be shy go in at 10% of the asking price and know what you want to pay and take your time getting there---its eventually fun.

The best stuff is on the second floor, where they proudly showed me the difference between the cheap tagines, tiles and tea pots, versus what they sell.

For those wanting their senses to be brought to life, this is for you. The scents of spices and perfumes in the bazaar mixed with smells of food and raw meat at butchers stalls. The colours of the wares take your eye before the buzz of a moped reminds you to look out for the kamikaze riders. A polite shake of the head and a firm No Thank you is normally enough but show a little interest in something (even a glance or point) and the salesman will be on to you. Best prices late afternoon and barter for everything."

An enjoyable and interesting way to spend a few hours if you follow a few tips a) dress appropriately and respectfully by ladies covering shoulders b) best to go early in the morning or after 5pm when it is cooler, c) stay in pairs, d) always haggle, as a general rule the final cost is usually half of the first price quoted to you. e) walk fast if you do not want to be hassled/approached f) good idea to walk around quickly first to get an idea for what items are more unusual compared to some products which are repeated all over. f) they will take Euros or Pounds or US Dollars as well as local currency, some traders preferred it, so be sure of your exchange rates."

I'm having difficulty coming up with something that hadn't already been said before to be honest!The smells? Are unique & pleasant & it can be fun trying to guess what spice has the strongest smell.Colourful? My goodness yes! Every colour under the rainbow!Noise? Pretty loud when everyone around you is haggling, trying to reduce the cost; then you've got the stall owners trying to make you buy from them rather than from Abdul next door!Yes, I agree - if you do it right the price came come done to 30% of the starting price but as each person selling doesn't respond to the same technique, I have no tips for you here! You can look serious so it is thought you won't give an inch OR you can involve humour in your quest... Doesn't seem to matter - so no big surprise.I was a little disappointed to read some females felt uncomfortable with the advances of the local men but perhaps it would be best to go view / shop in the morning when it is cooler? Wear something sensible to cover up - remember compared to local women the British ladies are I clone to show more flesh than locals, so can you really blame the very odd 1 or 2 for approaching?All in all the Marrakech Souk is a great adventure. A great time to envelope yourself in the culture of the country - but remember you will always be a very obvious tourist and the sellers have years of experience at their job .... We on the other hand are not adept at haggling (hence the laugh). The r's no doubt you could get everyone on your present it's sorted - my recommendation Is take some time out - do a little bit at a time rather than hours! No sane person could come away without feeling just a little bit stressed!!! Enjoy!"

All the stuff are negotiable, nothing has a fixed price. It's easy to not get lost if you ask for the Jemma el Fna or just have a good orientation. My advice is, as hard as it is, just take a walk arround the streets, do not buy anything. Leave the shopping for the second, third day. That way you will have the experience, as small as it is, to know how much they are willing to let at the price, how good the products are, if you will find something better and so on. All my shopping was left for the last day, the 7th, and I think that I bought some good procuts at good prices. You will find stores that say they have fixed prices, they are negotiable too, but it's good to go inside, that way you will see if the prices are smaller or higher that the other souks. I bought a dress from a souk that had a fixed price, and didn't want to negotiate, at a smaller price than what I managed to negotiate at a different souk a little higher than this one. So just be patience, you will find the same product anywhere, there are not so many hand made products as you think."

The variety of goods included spices, nuts, fruit, local beauty/health products, kaftans, rugs, jewellery, souvenirs etc. You MUST haggle otherwise you'll get ripped off. But don't start the process unless you're really serious about buying as it can get difficult to extract yourself from it once started. The length of time you need to visit the souk of course depends on how much you want to buy (as you'll need time to look and haggle). We just went to potter around and an hour was enough."

Although we realised we might get a bit of attention, we did not realise the extent of it. We travelled to Marrakesh on an organised day day with around 20 people in the group, made up of couples and other groups of girls. We aren't sure why, but we seemed to be singled out by the men in the souks. Maybe because of our hair colour, or because there is only 2 of use. Many men would shout to us and sometimes use inappropriate language and grab/touch us, even though we were in a large group. We were covered up wearing t-shirts and trousers. These 'events' have been going on whenever we leave the hotel making us almost scared to leave the pool. Having spoken to others on holiday in Agadir, no one else has got this unwanted attention, the only difference being they have been with their boyfriends. Marrakesh is beautiful and definitely worth a vist, although temperatures hit 42 yesterday. The souk is amazing and full of life. My only suggestion would be not to travel by yourself her as a solo girl traveller. Hate to say this as I have travelled solo in other parts of the world, but I definitely felt uncomfortable. I hope this doesn't put anyone off as morocco/marrakesh is a beautiful country/city to visit and definitely one to tick off the bucket list. The hotel we are staying in is amazing and I will definitely be writting a excellent review once back home."

In the distance you could see the famous Atlas Mountain Range. Then entering the Market Square was another special moment. One of the many unusual experiences, was watching a Snake Charmer plying his unique influence to the delight of all the many spectators. As I was moving away, a young Moroccan boy asked me to go with him into the Souk and meet his Mother and Family who would give me a SPECIAL price - just for me, on anything they sold! He also advised me to NEGOTIATE the price! I selected a beautiful sarong style dress to take home to my Dear wife. After walking away refusing to buy because of the ridiculous asking price the third time in my negotiation, the young boy ran after me with THE lowest price that was accepted! It was all in good taste . They and I enjoyed the negotiation with good humor. I spent many hours walking around being amazed at the variety of things to buy. I also enjoyed quaffing their famous Mint Tea..This is a visit not to be missed."

I arrived in the afternoon which was great because it gave me an hour or so to get well acquainted before the sun set. the market is laden with snake charmers and entertainers, lots of shopping and local foods. I was warned very strictly to be superbly vigilant especially as a female alone. naturally i discarded this advise and delved deep into the heart of the souk. Whilst the sun is up, I felt extremely safe, but when darkness started to set it, it was a different ball game all together. I was harassed by local entertainers who surrounded me intimidating me for money, and then got approached by a man who tried to lure me into a little store down \"the stairs\" to show me an ancient dark Moroccan magic! Nonetheless, had this not happened to me, Marrakesh would not be on my list of define return cities! This market is like no other. As a women solo traveler, I suggest get your bearings in order before running into a market. Also be cautious but not so cautious that you become a tourist! Carry small change so you can get rid of people who surround you. dress conservatively. and just take it in for what it is.... a fantasy!"

One of the things to see in Marrakech however the caveats are that only tourists shop there, prices post haggle are not spectacular if visiting from London, the range of products being sold is not extensive and is very much produced with the visitor in mind. The result is that there are lots of leather bags, shiny teapots and tajine pottery items for sale. It's not bad to walk through and if I hadn't done it I would do again but once you've walked for 200m you start getting a sense of deja vu."

The souks are interesting and a maze but there are just too many locals trying to talk you into going to things like the tanneries or trying to 'help' give you directions. They don't seem to understand that you just want to wander around to take in the sights smells (and occasionally get lost).If approached say NO THANK YOU or NON MERCI firmly - DO NOT GET ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION as they will follow you and tell you the way and then expect a tip of around 10 dirham (about 75p). Sometimes they deliberately tell you the wrong direction (this happened to us). The older ones seem more helpful and do not generally expect a tip. Best tip is not to take much money.Watch the tanneries - we went in and then later told to pay 150 dirham - claimed a sign above where we entered said admission price - of course you don't notice this. We were fortunate as we only had 40 dirham in our pockets - its a good way to negotiate. Our guide was not happy - said this was nothing but still took it.All in all I think this sort of behaviour spoils the experience - if you live live to tell the tale and are not knocked over by the multitude of motorbikes, cycles, donkey carts etc all going far too fast through very narrow alleyways."

            "review": "How to bargain in the souks in Marrakech. After a short stay in Marrakech recently and a few salutary lessons learned I want to pass on a few tips which would have been helpful to me had I known them before I visited the souks. - if you are new to Marrakech don't buy anything on the first day until you have had a chance to compare prices- a visit to the Centre Artisanal in the Kasbar is very helpful. It is the medina's closest thing to a department store and has a vast array of goods at fixed prices. Prices will be less in the souks but at least a visit to the Centre Artisanal tells you the most you should be paying.- if you have a guide, even one arranged for you by your hotel or riad, remember that, as happens the world over, your guide will be taking you to stores that will pay him a commission. Do not assume these store owners are reliable. They want to sell something to you for as much as possible, even it is with a smile and a cup of mint tea and the endorsement of your guide.- a general rule of thumb is that the higher the price, the greater the discount you can achieve through bargaining. For example, you might get an item with an asking price of US$300 down to US150. But you might only get 10 or 15% discount on an item with an asking price of US$10.- often the asking price does not start out at 100% of the \"real\" asking price. It might be 400 or 500% or more. For example, a shop owner may tell you a pot is US$500; a more realistic starting price should be US$150 and you should get it for US$75.- Westerners attribute value to something that is \"old\" - Marrakech retailers do not. However, they will tell you an item is old to make it appear more valuable to the Western customer. Sometimes old means it's been in the shop a few years. Having said this, some more upmarket galleries will carry old items made by named craftsmen that will have a higher value.- if you are not sure if you have reached the shop/souk owner's bottom price, walk away. He will come after you if he is prepared to take a bit less.- A good deal is when the seller and the purchaser are both happy but it is made more difficult when you are coming from a more affluent community and would normally expect to pay more. Use the pointers above to try to pay what is fair."

We had so many different experiences I will share just two with you.1) i love working with wood so when i was walking through the souks and saw a lathe i was keen to see more. So i looked about for the owner he turned up and then got to work. It was a hand driven lathe and he held the chisels with his hand and his feet. It was fantastic to see. His English was really poor and my French was worse but we used sign language to communicate. We found out that it was his granddads stall them his dads and now he works there. He also made my wife and i a wooden charm on his lathe and would not take any money for it. i could have watched him work all day.2) my wife wanted a leather and silk hand bag (and one as a pressy) that she saw on one of the stalls so i set to work haggling for it the price started at 650DH. I said this was far to much and was only willing to pay 200DH we went back and forward with him going down and me going up then him staying the same and me asking for more stuff. after about 10 minutes i walked away as i could not get him down any further. We walk about 500m from the stall when i felt a tap on my shoulder and it was the stall owner he wanted to talk we haggled for an other 5 minutes and i got the bags with matching silk scarf's for 450DH. (We later saw them in the hotel for 465DH each) this is just two of the many things that happened to us.top tips go in the evening as there is more of an atmosphere and it is a little cooler, haggle for EVERYTHING. and have fun.Also if you dont like strong smell take a hanky with some Vickes on it as some of the smells are really bad."

He gave us a tour of the souks at night with an emphasis on food. He spoke of some of the foods during Ramadan and also a food mothers make as a special treat for their children. It was wonderful and he made it for me by putting together different nuts and dates and a small baked cookie. Not only did he put it together but he then paid for it. I brought this to work and it was big hit. This man spoke so clearly and was funny and charming ,interesting and spoke from his heart about how people feel about various things in Morocco.

Everything in Marrakesh can be bought for less than what they offer. By the end of my visit, I started telling the shop owners that they should give me a sensible price as I know the value of things. I then said I would make one offer only and if I walked out, my next offer would be LOWER than the first. This worked pretty well, as they always want to make a sale.It gets boring doing all the bargaining, and takes way longer than it needs to."

The shop keepers are good-natured and take 'Non merci. Plus tard, peut etre' for an answer quite happily. The bargains to be had can also fantastic - we bought a typically Moroccan leather pouffe for the equivalent of about \u00a328 and, as chance would have it, the Sunday Paper on our return had the identical one advertised for \u00a3130.As well as all the tourist stuff, the fringes of the souk remain 'local' and the residents buy their fish, meat and vegetables there too. I was surprised how relatively clean it all is as well. The modeds are a hazard though.Fantastic place - the heart of the city."

I made sure that when buying jewellery I selected one stall and bought a number of items thus getting the best deal. I also stayed away from dusty, unkept stalls and tried to look for what I thought was better quality and there certainly is a range. Be careful when buying leather that the dye doesn't come off, we were very particular with our leather poufs, spending a lot of time checking stitching, leather etc I was very keen to buy a lantern but to date haven't seen the right one, again different metals and different qualities.

The rules are simple - if you don't want something, politely say no. Smile, laugh and enjoy the banter, but don't be upset that they may want to encourage you into their shop for another bargain. If you do like it, as for their best price and then offer a quarter of what they respond (provided you are willing to pay that!). They will laugh and ask you to make an honest offer having reduced their offer by 10%. Come up by 10% and then walk away when they refuse. If they can sell at that price they will offer for you to return to the store and try to raise the price. Keep firm with your offer and walk away. They will not sell at a loss and you will find the same products in the souk elsewhere if your offer is too low. We brought huge amounts of bargains using this method and on only one deal did we walk away with nothing brought. You come away translating the value to what you would have paid in UK and they watch you leave knowing they have got you to pay more than they could have sold it to a local!

            "review": "Watch Out! Marrakech is no tourist paradise and can be dangerous!. I was nearly robbed or worse, about 10 days ago, in Marrakech. Ironically, it was the same scenario my husband had tried to warn me about before I left (I never got around to opening that link). I wandered around a corner of the souks, not far from the Marrakech Museum, and had lunch at a table in the middle of a busy (with the locals) area, a narrow corner. The lunch was amazing. A local young man, exceptionally tall and thin with a sort of weird mohalk-like blondish-dyed hair style, talked me into seeing the wool dyer, and when I showed no interest in buying scarves from his buddy, he suggested he show me \"the tannery\" and I agreed. He stayed far ahead of me and I found myself running to keep him in sight. After a while I had gone pretty far, all through a residential area, with a few people out and about, and I started coming to my senses. When we reached \"the tannery\", it was not, it was a deserted construction site, I did not go in. He and his buddy, who had materialized there, did not accept the tip I had had ready to give him and insisted on more, so I gave him what I had handy and I quickly turned around and got as far as quickly as I could. Yes, I know it was foolish to follow a stranger anywhere. I had just figured he would want a tip, which I was willing to do. This was a close call.Also, I want to tell people that I did not find any bargains there in the Marrakech souks. A few shops would sell day to day items at the local prices, but mostly they charge the tourists at least double, which isn't terrible, but after a while the wallet is empty. The merchants started out asking for 4 times what locals tell me they would pay for the same item, and you can't get them to come down much farther. After a while, I quit trying to buy anything - the scarves are just \"Pashima\" which means nothing; probably rayon, made in China. A great place to buy things - the only one- was the Artesan Center, located near the Cyber Park. I was very pleased with the prices and the quality of the various leather goods and clothing I purchased there. However, the jewelry store was just the same as everywhere else, including Essouira - very little actual silver, sterling or even 800, to be found. The prices on the few sterling items I found were the same as the US, as they wont really negotiate on these. Most of the metal is silver colored but completely devoid of any silver stamps, although they would always try to fake it and show some kind of tiny imperfection and claim that was the stamp.The air pollution in Marrakech was dreadful. It has to be very unhealthy (I came down with bronchitis, as had the young lady we were visiting who lives there). You just want to spit out the awful air, and it is hard to accept breathing in that pollution, but you have no choice.As an older woman, I was not harassed as much as my daughter and her friend, but every moment outside for them was a trial. They were constantly harassed. There are many many young men out on the streets with little or nothing to do. They were targets. It was a little better for them when I was with them. Taxi rides were variable. We depended on taxis and took them several times a day. We experienced everything - friendly drivers who actually used the meters who circled the area to increase the fare, or towards the end mysteriously bumped up the fare on the machine - they can do that - so a meter really is besides the point. And negotiation is a pain. The drill is that you signal a cab, they pull over, you tell them where you want to go, and if they agree you get in the cab. You then pay them what they should be paid, which ranges from about 10 to 25 Dh. Mostly we paid 20 which was about 5-10 Dh overpayment, but reasonable and fair for us. Not much to see in Marrakech. The cyberpark is interesting if you are in a larger group or not female, but the air is very polluted.We went to Marrakech for the purpose of visiting someone; I cannot understand why anyone would actually go there without a compelling personal reason. I really feel for the King - he has his hands full in that city, although there were tons of tourists, even in mid-March, which was mostly cold and dreary, so perhaps no improvements are needed to attract tourists. We really liked the riad in the Medina where we stayed - I have reviewed it, with high praise. And we were glad to stay with a very hospitable family for a few nights.We spent a weekend in Essouira, which has a beautiful beach and coastline. The kinds of fish caught there are interesting. I already warned of the restaurants on the pier - we had the worst \"meal\" imaginable there, at a very high cost. The prepared fish in the square Jamal Al Fna, in Marrakech, is just wonderful, and a tenth of the price. I highly recommend going to that square for dinner, although the proprietors use their hands when they serve you your food. They touch everything. Yes, I have a touch of the diarrhea and so did my daughter, and it is pretty common for the residents, too.Good luck and feel free to ask me any questions you might have."

It was very lively with music, dancing, snake charmers, monkeys, very interesting food choices and plenty of shopping. We did not eat in this area since we were headed to a restaurant. While some of the food looked good, some of it was bizarre - a family was gathered around a table eating out of a boiled sheep's head (wool still attached). There were many vendors selling beautiful dried fruit and spices. The souk booths sold leather goods, scarves, moroocan slippers and various other items. The two cautions that I have are the little children begging you to buy their trinkets. Just like other areas of the world, once you buy something it starts a feeding frenzy! The other caution would be the women who do the henna tattoos. While they do a wonderful job , they will just grab your arm and start drawing then demand payment - very pushy. While the souks push their wares, they were not as bad as I thought they would be. If you are a fan of watching old Tarzan movies you will feel like you are on the movie set if you visit at night. In the day it is much different. Most visitors are there for the souks and there is not the dancing and music. You can still find a snake charmer or two. You definitely want to visit if you find yourself in Marakech."

A guide is worth it if you can afford it - not to expensive but avoid hiring guide on street go through reputable company. We stayed at Sofitel Hotel and although it was just 15 mins walk we had to run the gauntlet of people offering to show us where to go (on average 6 times) Do not trust them ! If you don't what them to lead you they will point you in the wrong direction - revenge! If you do allow them to show you they will take you the long way round and demand anything from 5 euro upwards. Many will also take you to a Berber shop were you will be sat down offered tea and give a very hard sell. I say this as it was our first time in Marrakech and the maps and street are a nightmare almost impossible to navigate effectively. The best way to navigate is to use the largest mosque as a beacon - the wood structure on top points straight Mecca and to the Souks main square. Watch the taxis to they will always attempt to charge more- find out from local what is reasonable and refuse to budge. When it comes to shopping start at the state run co-op ( quality is good and prices very fair) not far from the Souk that gives you a good idea of the right price to pay then you can go and barter with confidence in Souk.Best tactic I found was to start at a good/fair price often a third of what they start at and just stick there hold you nerve and you often do the deal( although the smile is not always there afterwards!) The street food is very reasonable and good just avoid the salads and non bottled water and I found no tummy issues."

It's a good idea to check out a fixed price shop like the ensemble des artisans first to get an idea what the going rates are.Although everyone was keen to make a sale, most people were good humoured and not overly persistent. Don't ask the price unless you are considering a purchase though, and always decide what the max you want to pay is before you start bargaining. If the seller won't come down to your max price, walk away, and they may well come after you with the price you want. It's sometimes hard to work out what you should pay, I didn't want to be ripped off but I didn't always want to drive too hard a bargain, as it didn't seem fair (especially for hand made crafts). It can easily take a day to walk across the souk by the time you have been shown around a spice shop, given mint tea in a carpet shop, had lunch, admired some oddities (like scorpions in a jar), got a bit lost, bought some crafts, and then found your way out.They do have signs that direct you back to the main square, and people will give directions, or show you out for a tip.

You will be aggressively hassled by every single merchant you pass. They will try to charge you 5-10 times what they're actually willing to sell for. They will try to body-block you when you try to walk away. If you stop to admire an item, be prepared for a hard-sell. You will be told off by snake charmers & henna ladies if you decline their services, and ripped off if you accept. \"Guides\" will accost you and follow you around, then demand a fee.Trying to negotiate a fair price down from an eight-fold ripoff is a charade that doesn't amuse me. Neither does being groped and harassed by an aggressive merchant. I hated that they cornered me into rudeness - a smile and a \"no thank you\" won't cut it. You need to walk fast and keep a \"piss off\" attitude if you want to get rid of these guys. I don't recommend Marrakech to anyone. Spend a day there if you really need to see it. Then move on. The rest of the country is great."

Basically the stall holders are very down to earth and similar to stall holders at the Barras - if you take a similarly down to earth and cheery cheeky attitude they are very sweet. Prices are not particularly cheap unless you go to the manufacturers, however, and the one third rule is correct. Get your price from them, then offer a third and let them take it from there. The price will probably change another few times without you having to say anything. Another tip is not to take much money as saying you will return later improves the price also, especially if you actually turn up!  As for the horror stories about people being led up alleys and forced to buy carpets - that is simply the way Berbers do business - I spent this afternoon drinking about three hundred cups of tea and in many cases did not buy anything at all. You need to make your budget very clear to get away with this, however, they are simply very focussed on doing business with you and extremely good at it.So my tip of the day is - don't march about being flash with your expensive stuff or get snotty with people and they will respond very positively - and don't assume everyone that tries to get your attention is trying to force you to do anything - they just love doing business."

The one in Marrakech is even busier. Here you'll see a lot of artisan workshops as well as regular stores. Craftsmen make and sell their goods right there. As soon as you look, they know that you are interested and ask you to come into their stores. It was fun in the beginning to look at sth and start bargaining. At least for me it got to be stressful pretty fast. I had the impression that everyone wanted to cheat me out of my money. Be careful! The prices you'll get quoted (and do ask them for a quote first!) are about double of what they'll let the item go for. Sometimes, especially if you don't seem overly keen on buying what you are looking at, you'll end up paying even less than half. I had seen a small caftan I wanted to get for my 3-year old niece. It was offered at 300 MAD. I bargained it down to 130 but still didn't buy. The next day I saw it at a different place. Same 300; this time I started right away with 100 but walked away. That person followed me and I did end up paying the 100 MAD (roughly \u20ac9 or $12). I still am not sure if I should feel victorious or if I got cheated regardless of my bargaining skills ;-)At any rate, it is just too much work to have to negotiate everything you want to buy. ---- In order not to get lost in all those little streets, try to come back to the main one and go from there.

Marrakech Experience 31st Jan to 7th Feb 2014Accommodation \u2013 Riad Catalina please see separate entry.Eating out Al Bahriya in Gueliz 75 Bis Av. Moulay Rachid | Gu\u00e9liz, Marrakech, Morocco We got there a bit early at 12 noon and it would appear that they were still preparing some of the main dishes so we ended up with two large fish platters (fried) for 110 dirham (\u00a38.46) this was very good value and along with the olives bread and sauces a nice meal. By 12.30 though the restaurant was nearly full so timing is of the essence and there was some very nice looking seafood on the menu.We didn\u2019t go back as for us there was not a lot else in Gueliz to attract us back and we spent the rest of the time in the old city. Jemaa el Fna SquareFood Stalls:At night there are numerous stalls all selling much the same thing \u2013 Tajines, Tanjia\u2019s and kebabs of various types and sizes along with bread, chips and olives. The quality of these with us having eaten at four or five was much the same for each one and the prices again are similar.For an idea on prices on one occasion we had two mixed kebabs, one aubergine side dish, one chips and water for 150 dirham (\u00a311.53).Tip: try to make sure you do the ordering otherwise they will say you want this, that etc and you end up with more food than you want and of course at a higher cost although still at good value. Surrounding restaurantsSituated on the outskirts of the square there are restaurants/cafes which on occasion turned out to be better quality and cheaper than the food stalls.One in particular was \u201cSquare food\u201d (north side of the square) where on our last day we had a good meal for 125 Dirham consisting of a beef Tajine and Tanjia and a vegetable couscous Tajine. We wish we had found this one before as we would have eaten there more.Le Grand Balcon Du Cafe Glacier (south side of the square) to the left of the post office building.We did not eat here but the prices were good and the menu similar to many of the other places. The main attraction of this cafe is the view over the square and we sat there people watching while enjoying a drink.Something special?Dar Essalam (left hand side of the road walking away from the square) on 170 Rue Riad Zitoun (East side of the square)Despite having a popular guide book which mentioned this restaurant we managed to come across it by accident as we were souking around lunch time and were invited in to have a look around. Once in we were sold!This is a 17th century mansion and was just amazing! The food was more expensive than elsewhere (two Tajines plus water 270 dirham or \u00a320) but it was good and the surroundings were quite something retaining the historical grandeur of high society living). Have a look if nothing else as they are quite happy for you to look around and there is no pressure to eat there.MoneyYou can readily change money at the airport upon arrival or at any of the banks or exchanges in the town all of them gave a similar and what we considered to be a good rate. Hotels will charge a commission so are not quite as good but not far of.WaterBottled only and the price ranged from 6 to 15 dirham for a large bottle, we found the cheapest places to be the restaurants at the edges of the square or one of the little shops as opposed to the juice and food stalls, some of whom will try it on hence the 15 dirham price.Things to seeJemaa el Fna SquareSnake charmers, monkeys, Berbers etc in the square = mainly there during the dayTip: The Le Grand Balcon Du Cafe Glacier is an excellent place to film/photo the snake charmers, monkeys etc from a safe distance if you are not sure re the snakes etc and if you do not want the hassle of their taking a photo of you then asking for 200 dirham (\u00a316) I gave him a lot less explaining that that\u2019s all I had.Music etc at nightHistorical places (or at least the ones we managed to get around to)Saadian tombs (10 dirham entry) \u2013 I wasn\u2019t too bothered about this but am glad that I did Bab Agnaou Ornate gateBahia Palace (10 dirham entry) do this first before Badi Badi Palace (10 dirham entry)Marrakech museum (60 dirham entry including Ben Youssef Medersa) very few exhibits but worth seeing as a palace in its own rightBen Youssef Medersa a religious school (unused now) this was our favourite out of all of them.Wouldnt bother with \u2013 Menara Gardens a bit disappointing reallyWatch out!My wife was subject to the theft of her cardigan which thankfully was an old one. A woman approached her and slipped a gold coloured bracelet on her wrist which undoubtedly acted as a distraction whilst the item of clothing which was draped over her shoulder bag was taken.Henna \u2013 another guest at our Riad had her hand taken hold of by one of the women in the square and before she could do anything they squirted some henna onto her hand asking for money to make it into a design.

I have been to many Arabic cities and Marrakech is by far the worst of all of them. It exists only to take as much money from tourists as possible. Everyone us trying to get your money, one way or another. The old town areas are filthy, no attempt to clean up anything. I understand completely the plight of most of the folk who have to live there in such squalor, but the tourist authorities have done nothing to try to make the place at all appealing. The very few tourist spots, old palaces, Majorelle Gardens, etc, are OK to see, but nothing extraordinary that you won't already have seen elsewhere. The Saadian Tombs are a complete waste of time to see and virtually impossible to find. The worst thing is the attitude of the locals in the tourist areas who are determined to harass and pester you to get what they can. Souk owners are only interested in ripping you off, especially the more \"up market\" shops. We were asked to pay nearly \u00a3400 for three very average kaftans!!! Eventually found some the same for \u00a310 each after a haggle.It is a dangerous place too, as are many cities of course, but there are plenty of bag-snatchers waiting on the pavements to grab your bag and jump onto the pillion seat of their mate's waiting moped to make a quick escape. It happened to us almost right outside the hotel, which was in a smart area too. Take care, don't walk anywhere after dusk, take a cab, and haggle with the cab driver before you get in. About 20-30 dirhams should get you anywhere you want to go, but they'll demand 50 dirhams and swear to you that this is the official tariff, it isn't. Despite their \"cool, hip\" reputation, I would not book accommodation in a Riad either. These are mainly in the middle if the old Medina area, and whilst the Riad might be OK inside, it's location certainly won't be. No taxis go in the tiny alleyways at night, so you'd be on your own in a potentially threatening environment. I'd definitely stay in a good hotel outside the old town walls and get a five minute cab ride wherever you want to go.Overall, I can't see why anyone would ever want to go to Marrakech, other than as a warm and sunny winter trip, but if you do, just stay in the hotel!"

A pair of lamps selling for 1000 dirhams can be haggled down to half price and most people would be pleased with that. We got them for 200 dirhams after a wretched amount of time haggling.

Get a map, wear comfortable shoes, keep your eyes and ear open, motorbikes go really fast down the packed narrow alleyways... learn one word..la = means no and be assertive and confident... Dont get your cameras out and keep money separate... if you want to take photographs sit upon the terraces around the square..you will find lots of Europeans up there with same idea best way to watch the square. Dont be pulled into people putting monkeys/snakes on your shoulders then demanding money for it... dont make eye contact...or the henna tattooists try to start putting it on your hand and then charge ... saying that its a good idea to get a recommended guide to see the things you want to otherwise its so hard to find them... ensure guide doesn't take you to shops or pharmacy's for you to buy from ..waste of a day and money... food is lovely and its an experience you just need to do your homework before you go...enjoy"

When you first visit the Souk it can be a bit daunting. packed narrow alleyways with motor scooters whizzing by and still the occasional donkey cart while the shop keepers try to tempt you into their shop. My Riad advised that it's best to start bartering at about 25% of what the shopkeeper asks and go up to 45% to 60%. Don't be intimidated by the bartering and have fun with the shop keepers, they are not offended by your bids and, while they are trying to make a living they are also aware that they themselves are a tourist attraction and are, for the most part, genuinely trying to give you a holiday experience. be friendly and enjoy it but if you really don't like the price simply walk out of the shop. you'll most likely be called back and given the price you wanted as long as it's not too daft. Always try and think what you would pay for something back home and roughly convert it in your head if you can. It probably takes a couple of hours to get comfortable with the bartering idea for those who come from a fixed price shopping environment but once you dive in it really is great fun and the shopkeepers are very nice people. You are also completely safe. Much more so than in any major European tourist shopping area such as London or Barcelona for example. The only thing you have to worry about is spending too much money."

Maps are useless in the souks. You will get lost at least once. However, I really like the place somehow and its bargaining culture. I have got some advices based on my own experiences:1) It is important to be serious. It is better to avoid eye contact. 3) Don`t be naive. Say \"la\"(no) if someone wants your money. If a kid wants your icecream or your money and you give him what he wants (because you are a nice person) don't forget there will be other kids around you who demand money from you. By giving them money, we only encourage the beggers. 4) Don`t forget to bargain. Keep in mind: They triple the price. Agree a price before buying anything. If the shopkeeper tries to sell something for 200 dirhem, don`t be shy to offer 50 dirhem for it. At first he will say \"No. It is not possible. Are you kidding me?...\" Don`t be aggresive. Try to be a friend of this shopkeeper and find common topics to talk about. Bargaining is a social activity. Theatrics are all part of the game. There are some tactics. You may say \"It is not worth it...\" And the best tactic is not to buy if he doesn`t sell it for 50 dirhem. You can act like you feel sorry. When you leave, he will probably stop you and sell it for 50 dirhem. If he doesn`t sell it for 50, you can try to buy it for 70 dirhem in an another shop. You should bare in mind that there are other shops selling the same thing.5) They can be quite agressive if they can`t sell what they want. Be aware."

We travel alot with work and thought we were wordly wise. This was an eye opener. Myself and my boyfriend went with my mother and her partner who have been before. You must embrace the culture and remember it is nothing like home. Take more money than you budget for as nothing comes without a cost. There are beggers and lots of people that follow you. Lots of helpful people or so they seem till they expect you to pay them for directing you or taking you somewhere. We did find some locals to come across quite aggressive or confontational if you did not give them what they wanted. This is quite intimidating. Be prepared and agree a price before doing anything. Everywhere accepts Euros but Dihrams are used more used so I would recommend taking them. Be careful of the donkey carts, motorcycles and bicycles that come up behind and next to you. It can be daunting."

            "review": "Travellers Warning for Soukites. The Berber Carpet StoryAnyone who knows me will probably be aware that I am not much of a traveller; my sort of holiday is a week in Cornwall or a weekend\u2019s folk festival. In fact if you used both hands to count the number of times that I have flown overseas for a holiday, you would have numerous spare digits.It came as a bit of a surprise then a couple of weeks ago when we found ourselves in a travel agent booking a holiday to Marrakech!Before I go any further, I have to say that bit was the most amazing holiday I think I have ever had (and one of the cheapest!), the place the people the food the hotel \u2013 just everything was brilliant, apart from\u2026. Well, here is the story;We had quite a busy week as we had arranged to go on various tours, all of which were stunning, but on the Saturday we had a free day. I very much wanted to visit the old City on our own and explore the Souks (these are the name for the almost medieval markets that they have) \u2013 we had a brief glimpse of them earlier in the week with a guide, but did not have much time to actually shop in them. It\u2019s almost impossible to describe these Souks, they are huge and once you are in them they are a complete maze. The only thing you can see is, if you look upwards, the sky but all around are small market stalls, mostly only about 3m wide but some up to 4m high selling all sorts of stuff; Shoes, lamps, clothing, household goods, paintings, ceramics, craft ware, food, textiles carpets and loads and loads of stuff. It\u2019s crowded, noisy and although the walkways are only about six feet wide, hundreds of motorbikes and mopeds speed through constantly as well as donkey carts. You are constantly being beckoned by the stall-holders, in a very friendly way and not all that intimidating.Mostly it is quite amusing; they seem to have learned a few \u2018English\u2019 phrases like \u2018Asda Price\u2019 and \u2018BOG Off\u2019 and \u2018Ali Bongo\u2019!There is a great sense of fun, but underneath, these guys are all very professional sales people and if you show just one moments weakness, they have you. I have been in retailing all of my life and I have never seen such slick professional operations like these. Show any interest in any item on any stall and you will almost certainly end up buying it and, hard a negotiator as you may think you are, they are better, much better. It\u2019s all they do all day and they are truly experts at it. Never underestimate them. Most are illiterate but don\u2019t confuse ignorance with lack of intelligence \u2013 these people are very smart, very smart indeed.So, we decide to have a go in the Souks. That is, I decided we would have a go in the Souks, Julie was not too keen. Thing is with Julie is that she is a bit wiser than me and she also knows my capabilities and, more importantly, my limitations much better than I do.So, promising not to get us lost or robbed, we got ourselves swallowed up in the labyrinth of the Souks, firmly holding hands. All was well for half an hour or so, in fact we stopped off at one stall and Julie bought a really nice silver lamp and negotiated a fair price for it too (I was quite impressed actually) and we carried on. Needless to say that soon we were hopelessly lost. I would seriously advise that anyone who does this in the future to take a compass with them, it is completely disorientating, impossible to describe, you just have to be there.We seemed to have had no choice but to plod on hoping for a break in the stalls or a \u2018way out\u2019 sign. Eventually we came to what appeared to be the end, or at least the outskirts of the Souk, but we had no Idea where we were. The Old Town is vast and we could have been literally anywhere within its 12 miles of its walled city. However, one of the very last stallholders caught our attention and offered us, what we thought at the time, to be a life line. He said \u201cAre you looking for the Tanneries?\u201dWell, were weren\u2019t, but he went on to say that we had timed it just right as this was the day of the monthly auction, and it was a good place to visit and this was the day to do it. He gave us some simple directions and sent us on our way. Julie, I think was glad to be out of the Souks, and I thought that if we had a good starting point, we could probably find our way back to the square (we did have a tourist map). So off we went, following the directions we had been given. After walking for about five minutes, not at all sure if we were going the right way when the guy who gave us directions suddenly came up behind us and told us again where we should be going. We again thanked him and were just about to start off again when a young lad came up to our \u2018friend\u2019 and they shook hands and exchanged a greeting. Our \u2018friend\u2019 then said that this lad was his cousin and was going that way anyway and would show us the way. Now, I expected that this would cost us a couple of Dirams, but at that stage I was quite happy to pay whatever it took. At this stage, no alarm bells were ringing in my head.So, this very personable young man started to lead us off into the unknown. At first it was quite entertaining and he was practicing his English on us and pointing out various things on the way, such as a real Berber bakery, and telling us of the differences between a Berber bakery, an Arab one and a Jewish one \u2013 all good stuff, he also explained something that we had noticed elsewhere on the city walls, a crudely painted grid. It was apparently used for their elections. However, as we walked we seemed to be getting into seedier and more run down areas and he was talking less and less. We were now starting to get a little worried. We were walking miles from any tourist area, we had not seen another European face for ages, and the environment was becoming more and more hostile, narrow alleyways and very run down houses and dark enclosing passageways. Then, when all that was on our minds was how we were going to defend ourselves from the impending ambush, we walked out into quite an open street.It was still very run down and shabby, but at least we had somewhere to run if it came to the worst! Also, our guide seemed to reanimate himself and started showing us cow hides and camel skins drying on walls. We began to think we were just being paranoid (at least I did), and we carried on following our little helper. Suddenly we came to a gap in the wall and he announced that we had arrived.We were greeted by a very nice chap in a white coat who introduced himself as the manager of the tannery. I looked around to thank our little helper, but he had gone. I did think it strange that he did not ask for money for bringing us here, but again, no alarm bells went off.After issuing us with sprigs of mint to act as gas masks, we were given a fascinating tour of the tannery. It was like something you would expect to see in the 12th century. Pits full of either diluted \u2018pigeon poop\u2019, lime and wheat flour to tan the hides. We were told that the wool shaved off the hides was exchanged by the Berbers in the High Atlas mountains for \u2018Pigeon Poop\u2019 and after tanning the hides were dyed with saffron, cobalt, ochre etc. to give them their colours. The tannery was staffed entirely by men, whilst the women wove carpets and rugs. We were also told that the staff was either Berbers or Arabs. The Berber\u2019s only tanned Cow and Camel and the Arabs only tanned Goat and Sheep. All very interesting stuff really, and the smell was not too bad at all. Our friendly guide was stressing all the time that the women were making carpets in a co-operative \u2013 the significance of this was not apparent at the time. Our guide then took us out of the tannery the way we came in and walked us up the street, ostensibly to show us some completed dyed skins drying over walls, whereupon he \u2018bumped into\u2019 another one of his mates who he informed us, would show us about the carpets.Again, no money was asked for the tour \u2013 bells had started to ring by now.You have to understand that we were aliens lost in the outskirts of a very big city; we could not speak their language and were completely at their mercy relying entirely on their goodwill and good nature. We felt extremely vulnerable.We were then ushered through a small corridor into a large room. I had expected to see women working at carpet looms, but no, not at all.The room was about 40\u2019 x 20\u2019 and was hung from floor to ceiling with very expensive looking carpets/rugs. There were neatly folded plies of rugs all along one side of the room. It has to be admitted that they were a stunning display, oozing both quality and cost. No windows or openings apart from the doorway we came in, just rugs. At the far end of the room facing the entrance was a small two seater banquette in front of which was a low table and to the side a small chair. We were \u2018invited\u2019 to sit down.We sat down.Our \u2018host\u2019, dressed in a traditional brown Islamic thobe sat on the chair and called his assistant into the room. He then told us that it was the polite thing to accept a glass of mint tea with him and he sent his assistant off to get some, whilst he explained that he was a Berber, and Berber people were very polite and friendly, not like the Arab people who were miserable and bad tempered, and, indeed, he seemed on the face of it to be friendly, but we could both detect an undercurrent of aggression behind his smiling countenance. It was more than a little disturbing. He was asking the usual introductory questions \u2013 where are you from? What are your names? - How do you like Morocco? Etc. till the mint tea eventually came, brought by his assistant who then went and stood in the doorway with his hands on his hips, completely blocking our only exit. Our anxiety levels were increasing by the minute. Our courtesy bus back to the hotel was due and it was obvious that we were going to miss it which didn\u2019t help our situation at all.Our host then told us that he was going to show us some rugs. We tried to politely tell him that we did not want and could not afford a carpet or rug, but he said that he just wanted to show us the different types that are made in the High Atlas Mountains by his people. We don\u2019t need to buy anything but if, after looking we do, he will do us a very good price, and if we don\u2019t, we all leave as friends. We had no choice but to view his carpets, so we resigned ourselves to the inevitable.He called upon his assistant to unfold a selection of rugs of various sizes and colours whilst he explained the history and symbolism of each one and how each one was made and where it was made. Again, I have to say that these items were truly magnificent, things of real beauty, but we just did not want one, had no-where to put one and could not afford one and couldn\u2019t fit it in our luggage for the return journey even if we could.Eventually, after having shown us about twenty different rugs and they were piled up in front of us, one upon another, he asked us what we thought. We once again tried to explain that we had not come out to buy a rug/can\u2019t afford/no room etc. but we were desperately trying to be firm but diplomatic. He said that they now had a little game \u2013 we had to choose which ones we liked and didn\u2019t like \u2013 don\u2019t worry about cost, just let him know which ones we liked. However, we had to do by saying \u2018Loxian\u2019 if we didn\u2019t like the rug or \u2018Desrie\u2019 if we did. So we started this ridiculous charade but we both realised that we could not say \u2018Loxian\u2019 to all of them, we felt threatened enough as it was without insulting the guy, so we ended up with two that we said \u2018Desrie\u2019 to. But we then made it absolutely clear that we did not have room for rugs of this size. After a slightly ill-tempered exchange, he said he wold show us some smaller rugs.Whilst his assistant was folding up the rugs that we said we didn\u2019t like, we noticed that he had a knife tucked into his sock!So he started showing us smaller rugs and we again said that they were too big. So, with a little ill grace, he started showing us some small rugs and we had to go through the whole farce again, \u2018Loxian\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Desrie\u2019 etc. until we ended up with just a choice of two small rugs and one large rug, both of which were stunning it must be said, but we simply did not want any of them. He asked us to choose which of the two small rugs we preferred, I looked at Julie and said that basically, I don\u2019t think we are likely to get out of here without buying something so it was best to choose the one we preferred. So we settled on a red one. The other one as removed and on the floor there now remained the large rug and the small one \u2013 neither of which we wanted.He now said that he would give us a price for both rugs in English pounds despite our protestations that we did not want either of them. Drawing a notepad from where I know not, he thought for a few moments and then wrote \u00a3700.00 and circled it.Julie and I just looked at each other \u2013 both of us thinking the same thing. We were trapped in an enclosed room with a smiling crocodile asking for \u00a3700.00 and a man guarding the door with a knife down his sock, and how the hell did we get ourselves in this dreadful situation?We once again tried to explain that there was no-where in our house for a large rug \u2013 he was very insistent that it was for us, great value, took five months to make, but eventually conceded that we could not buy the big rug. This left the small one.\u201cYou need to pay me \u00a3200.00\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have \u00a3200.00\u201d we said.The atmosphere in the room which was already very cold turned icy \u2013 \u201cHow much would you pay then?\u201dNow, I had some money concealed in my back pocket, but Julie had her handbag with her and it was obvious that it contained her purse so we could not plead that we had no money on us. So I told him that we had very little cash on us so the best we could do would be fifty pounds. I was hoping in a way that he would just throw us out and we could escape unharmed. However, he became quite animated and aggressive. He started almost shouting that it took a girl a whole month to make it and would we work for a month for fifty pounds. Julie saw that the situation was getting out of control and said that she may have more than fifty pounds on her, how much would it have to be \u2018best price\u2019.He stared at us for a while and said \u00a3170.00. Julie said that she did not have \u00a3170.00. \u201cWell how much have you got then\u201dFortunately, we were given some very good advice at the hotel \u2013 don\u2019t take any more money into the city than you think you will need. Morocco has a closed currency and it is not permitted to take Dirams in or out of the country so we were advised to just change as much sterling into Dirams as we needed each day.Julie took her purse out of her handbag and counted up how much she had \u2013 it was 1250.00 Dirams \u2013 just less than \u00a3100.00. \u201cThat\u2019s just not enough\u201d he was not happy \u201cYou can pay the rest in English Pounds\u201d \u2013 Julie explained that she had no other money, English or other in her purse. He then, believe it or not, said that she must have English money in her purse and made us empty the entire contents of the purse \u2013 there was no more money. He then points to me \u2013 \u201cYOU must have some money\u201d \u2013 I said that Julie carried all of our money and turned my trouser side pockets inside out to show him that the only thing I had in them was a packet of mints.\u201cWell\u201d, he said to Julie \u201cYou have a credit card - you can pay with that\u201d Julie put her foot firmly down on that one saying that no matter what happened she was not going to use her debit card \u2013 surprisingly, he didn\u2019t seem to push that as hard as I would have expected him to \u2013 on reflection I think it may have had something to do with traceability.He then suggested that he would take the cash that we had as a deposit and meet us tomorrow in the square with the rug and we could pay him the balance then. Quick thinking Julie said that we were going back to England that night and would not be able to do that.The thought then struck us that we had missed our courtesy bus back to the hotel and would need money for a taxi \u2013 we told him this and he said don\u2019t worry about your taxi money! We didn\u2019t know what to make of that.The room went quiet for a while; there was Julie and I sitting together, our \u2018host\u2019 sitting alongside of us, the guy with the knife was blocking the doorway and 1250.00 Dirams sitting on the table in front of us.Suddenly he got up, collected all the cash and walked out of the room with is henchman saying that he would be back in a few minutes, leaving Julie and I alone asking each other what the hell we had done to deserve this.We could hear a furious row going on in the corridor but after a short time they both came back in. Our \u2018host\u2019 sat down with us again and folded up the money but fifty Dirams back on the table, meanwhile \u2018mac the knife\u2019 was folding and rolling up the rug which he wrapped into a neat and compact parcel. \u201cI\u2019ll take your money for the rug, but you will need this back\u201d he said pointing to the fifty Diram note. \u201cThat won\u2019t be enough for a taxi\u201d I said.It turns out the money was not for a taxi. It was to pay the guy who had shown us around the tannery who was waiting outside. However, the \u2018proper\u2019 amount to pay him was 150 Dirams. We were told to tell the tannery guy that he had taken all our money, but we were also to tell him that we paid only 900 Dirams for the rug as if we didn\u2019t he would be looking to our host for commission as well. As for the taxi, we were told just to get a taxi to our hotel and pay when we got there!We were ushered out of the building with our rug in a black plastic carrier bag, the tannery guy was waiting and gave us directions back to the square and asked for his fee \u2013 I gave him the 50 Diram note and he went quite mad. I tried to explain why we had no more money, but he did not seem to want to listen so we just walked away.Amazingly expressive language is Berber \u2013 I just wish I knew exactly what it was that he was calling me as we retreated.Our first feelings and thoughts as we left were relief and some joy that we were at last \u2018free\u2019. In fact we joked a little about it for a short while as we walked but slowly the realisation of the way we had been manipulated and the dangers that we put ourselves into began to dawn on us, and we were still no-where near the square that we were looking for. So, feeling very vulnerable, lost and pretty wretched, a very young lad pushing his bike walked passed us. He could have been no more than seven or eight, \u201cHello Lady\u201d he said to Julie \u201cYou English?\u201d It was so nice to see a friendly smiling face and the innocence of this child was quite charming. He made all of the usual enquiries about where we were from and how did we like Marrakech and introduced himself as Mustafa. He walked with us a short way and asked if we were looking for Jemaa el-Fnaa Square, we said we were and he said we were going the right way but to follow the alley way to the right as we went. We thanked him and continued.Five minutes later he was back at our side, \u201cNo, not that way, follow me\u201d \u2013 so, have very little option, but feeling confident, we followed Mustapha through back streets and alleyways till we came to a small square in which one of the exits had been closed. Mustapha\u2019s big brother then approached us \u201cYou looking for the square? \u2013 This way has been closed, but we will show you another way\u201d \u2013 Oh Jesus \u2013 here we go again.Knowing that we were being taken as mugs and knowing that we were once again putting ourselves at risk, what choice did we have? We were completely lost, so, with serious misgivings, we followed Mustapha and his brother for about fifteen minutes through some of the most threatening looking alleys and streets. The pair of them eventually stopped and faced us \u2013 here we go I thought.\u201cOK\u201d said big brother \u201cMustapha will take you the rest of the way, but you need to pay him\u201d \u2013 I was expecting this so I had transferred 20 Dirams from my back pocket to my front pocket in anticipation. I gave him the 20 Diram note and he stated quite firmly that 20 Dirams was nothing \u2013 he wanted more than that, he couldn\u2019t give his brother 20 Dirams, and went off on a rant. I snatched the note back out of his hands and said that if it was nothing I would have it back. (I was feeling pretty pissed off by now as you might imagine) he took the note back off me and walked away without another word.Mustapha was still there and beckoned us to follow him which we did.Within five minutes we reached our destination and was about to walk off when Mustapha started pulling my sleeve. \u201cYou must pay me\u201d He insisted \u2013 I said that I had already paid his brother and was not going to pay twice. Now he started screaming and shouting at me so, with the square in sight, Julie and I just walked off and left him to it. We headed for a caf\u00e9 to get a coffee and try to comprehend what we had been through.We were in shock. I mean real shock \u2013 not just shocked. The enormity of our potential danger crept up on us slowly at first but was very real and affected us both very much.On reflection we think we were marked from the word go, and everything that we went through was a carefully contrived plot. The guy who suggested the tannery must have phoned his pal to meet us. Phoned ahead to the tannery manager, and then arranged for Mustapha to pick us up and meet his brother. We were like fish in a barrel. Obvious targets really, European, me with an expensive camera round my neck, Julie with a very expensive handbag \u2013 I suppose we were asking for it, but such a choreographed slick operation was the last thing we expected. It did colour our attitude to the Marrakechi people for a couple of days I can tell you.We did manage to get a later courtesy bus back to the hotel in the end.As for the rug \u2013 well, its lying in a corner of the bedroom on the floor unwrapped \u2013 like some malevolent reminder of one of the most dreadful experiences of our lives."

Not only did we have a wonderful time, we met some friendly shop keepers and had a great shopping experience. The souk was filled with a multitude of colours, sounds, people and wonderful things to buy. You have to be strong and say \u201cNo\u201d when the vendors try to get you to purchase their items. The first day we walked through the souk on our own to get a feel for the place. The second day, our hotel guide took us to some amazing places that we probably wouldn\u2019t have seen without him. We weren\u2019t really there to buy anything special, but when I saw this beautiful five foot turquoise and brown vase, I had to stop and ask about the price. Our first purchase was at this amazing store called \u201cLa Porte D\u2019or\u201d (115 Souk, Semmarine). We smiled when we saw so many photos of very famous movie stars hanging on the walls. They all had shopped in the store (Tom Cruise, Sharon Stone, Will Smith, etc.). Hakim, our sales person was very friendly and spoke very good English. He made you feel welcome in the shop but didn\u2019t pressure into buying anything. We wanted to buy the huge vase, but you know that feeling of being in another country and not knowing if you gave them thousands of dollars, would you ever see your items. We bought two vases from La Porte D\u2019or with the assurance that they would be delivered right to our door in London. Our next amazing store was \u201cEthno Art Gallery\u201d (19/21 Souk Elkebir Semmarine) which wasn\u2019t too far from the first store. Our salesman, Hassani, was also very helpful, friendly and spoke great English. We also purchased two beautiful vases from his store. True to their word, all four vases arrived safe and sound right to our front door in London much to my delight. My husband and I are extremely pleased with the quality of the workmanship in the vases and can\u2019t thank the shop keepers enough for their helpful insights into our purchasing experience. So if you are planning a trip to Marrakech, make sure you stop at La Porte D\u2019or and Ethno Art Gallery and check out their amazing merchandise. Cheers from London."

The most important thing to remember when you enter the souk is that you are going into a shop and that the traders will try to get you to buy.That said, with a few sensible precautions, (See my longer review under Medina of Marrakech for some effective tips on handling the traders.) you can have great fun, take great photographs and not spend very much.Dressing modestly, avoiding eye contact and ignoring the \"hellos\" allow you to move through the narrow alleyways unmolested. You have to be aware of the donkey carts, hand barrows, scooters and cycles coming up behind you and avoid crowds and tour groups which are seen as easy pickings.Best attractions for us were the dyers' souk, the lantern souk, watching men use foot lathes to turn wood, the displays of jewellery and watching the shopkeepers ply their wares."

Although a very large crossroads, the crowds were so thick that hardly anyone was moving. I'm 99% certain this was engineered, as there seemed to be a couple of lads with motorbikes they were wheeling very slowly through the crowd who were causing the blockage.Anyway, I assumed it was to pickpocket people so kept tight hold of my possessions as I entered the thick crowd. My wife and our two female travel companions did the same. As I moved slowly forward, nothing happened to me, but all the ladies immediately came under sustained sexual assault, with aggressive groping hands grabbing them all over their breasts and genital areas. Be sure, we're not taking gently squeezing - this was aggressive ramming of hands between legs and around breasts. The crowd was so thick it was impossible for them to stop it and you can imagine how scary the whole experience was.As soon as we got through the crowd they told me what happened but I couldn't do anything about it, as all the people who did this had melted back into the crowds. We were all left feeling scared and angry by this horrible situation.I will never go back to Marrakech on the back of this experience and will advice anyone who asks me to avoid the place. If you do go, be very aware of the busy crowds and know that it's not just pickpockets out there"

We went into the Souks several times during our 14 day stay in Marrakech but found it fun bartering wth the locals but there were hundreds of stalls all selling the same products (How do they all make a living considering the number of them). It was an experience in many ways & an eye opener as you have to be very streetwise or you will definately be conned. There were all sorts of different smells some pleasant & some not.The downside was the local traders attitude towards their animals. We witnesed Donkeys & Horses that were forced to carry or pull excessive loads & many were obviously not fed or watered properly.One Donkey had mucas dripping from its eyes & this is unnacceptable in these times, their poverty is no excuse but what seems so strange is that their animals are part of their tools of their trade. so why dont they look after them, they would if it was their car!!!!.Anyone out there who can help them, please do so when visiting Marrakech, what should be such an experience is tarnished by their total lack of respect for these animals."

The place smells, it is dirty, there are way too many sales guys, and it is huge. In case you get lost. there are plenty of helpers that could show you a way out and then start asking for money. Please note that $1-2 would not satisfy them, they will be following you unless you strongly send them away, after which you have a high chances to be cursed in multiple languages. IMHO visiting souks for more than 10-15 mins, just to get a general sense, is just a waste of time."

Its customary to haggle, so never pay the first price. Western, young ladies beware you will be admired and called after even accompanied. It's not the polite British way to ignore people but it's best to. (Unless you're interested of course - then Bob's your uncle.) Look out for the cobras of the snake charmers, the water men in traditional dress, the belly dancers, henna tattooists, musicians and monkey man. Don't be surprised if you go into a shop to be offered the traditional Moroccan mint tea, hospitable as they are you WILL be harassed into buying.

You will. Many of the areas have their speciality - ironworks, spice, leather, wool etc but this enables you to see items being made. There is some sensitivity to the taking of photographs so it is polite to ask if you are taking anything more than a general scene. If you want close-ups of anyone working then payment of about 20dirhams should also be offered - and will usually be accepted. There are a few scallwags around who will try to tell you everything is closed and lead you elsewhere where they will be paid for bringing you. Ignore them. Sometimes people will tell you \"It's closed\" but they may be telling you somewhere is a dead end... or they may be suggesting that you go with them instead. However most people are incredibly honest and show great humour so it is better to trust them than not.

Although we said no, they still followed us for awhile but soon gave up. We were also approached by several women trying to grab our hands to decorate them with henna tattoos, but a firm 'no thank you' and they left us alone. There is a lot of hustle & bustle in the souk which might not suit everybody as it can be a culture shock for some, but it's all part of it's charm. Shop around before you buy, always barter and be assertive."

As anyone who's been to Istanbul's Grand Bazaar will know, much of the gold will be glitter, and there is a numbing sameness to a lot of the stuff on offer. Still, if you spend a little time researching what you want, you will find wonderful people selling beautiful things for very little. We stared at rainbow-coloured miles of barbouches and bought not a one; goggled at enough lamps to fill a palace and couldn't decide. But we haggled for a carpet and got the seller--a tough, humorous teenager of great charm--down to our price. And at the lovely walk-in cubicles (56&103 Kissariat Lossta,between Souk el Kebir andSouk Attarine) run by jewelry dealer and maker Abdellatif Bellawi and his kindly and attentive son, I chose a range of gorgeous Berber and Toureg beads and had a bracelet made for me. The walls here are coated in enough pendants, beads (glass, mixed silver, amber, coral, turquoise, plastic and more) to delight the pickiest, and there are antique beads at good prices too. As for the rest, it's the atmosphere--the bars of sun filtering down, the amusing exchanges with the shopkeepers, the whiffs of cumin and sage, the dodge-em-car-like interaction with donkeys, bicycles, motorcyles and fellow pedestrians--that forms such a key part of Marrakech. This is a city, after all, built on a palmerie at the culmination of a great African trade route, and the souks are all about trade. Plunge in and forget the guides."

I had never previously holidayed outside of Europe so this holiday was my first time on the African continent. I'm a 19 year old female and was traveling with my mother. There are thousands of things I could comment on, but I'm just going to keep it simple with pro's and cons.PositiveThe food! It was beautiful! I have now a new found love for mint tea. Made with the fresh mint tea leaves, it really hits the spot after a long day in the sun.The heat! Just lush! Even though we traveled in mid October it was still toasty, it was in the 30 degree range every day. It stayed warm into the night, which meant you could still comfortably explore after sunset or sit on the hotel balcony and watch the city busy life by night.The history of Morocco was also incredibly interesting. If you have the chance to get a tour, i would definitely recommend it! A lot of the mosques are also beautiful, and the sound of the horn or bell or whatever it is calling them to prayer is great.NegativesThe people. As a young female I did have quite a few situations that made me very uncomfortable. I'm not going to stereotype, but a lot of the middle-aged men made inappropriate comments or would stand just too close. I think they need to appreciate the need for personal space. It got to the stage that even though it was high 30 degrees I still felt the need to wear long sleeved tops and full length trousers just to feel less exposed to there gaze.The hagglers. I know this is what the Medina is famous for but after a while it just became annoying. People constantly asking for money for cheap tat and following you for an hour until you give in, is not my idea of a holiday. And as a lot of the other reviews have said the objects are often ridiculously priced to begin with, I would recommend halving their offer and you will have a more reasonable price.The animals. The donkeys that were overloaded with good and struggling to stand was a sore sight to see. They all seemed to have problems such as overgrown teeth, patches of fur missing. One even had an incredibly bad limp, which was worsened by the owner kicking the donkeys leg whenever it slowed down. The malnourished cats were also everywhere. Little kittens looked more like rats, and were often kicked or trodden on by people walking in the street.So they were just a few of the things I experienced during my stay! Overall I did enjoy the Medina and surrounding area of Marrakesh simply for the experience, however it's not a place I will be visiting again in a hurry, especially traveling as just two women. I have rated it as a 2 out of five. *Also I would recommended using a toilet before leaving your hotel, as there are very few toilet facilities whilst you are walking around."

I learned a quick lesson as I first walked out as a woman grabbed me and wanted to show me her henna tattoos. I was not ready for this but she insisted on a sample be given me which turned out to be painting my whole hand, and of course she expected payment, and of course she asked much more than is what is normally paid. That was awkward as I had not learned yet to give a firm no, anything less than that can bring a bit of trouble. First rule, be nice but do not be afraid to say no. Second rule, it is ok to accept tea but know this is a bit of a hospitality trap also, so if you are just looking and not ready to buy anything walk away from a tea offer. There is so much to see, and many temptations to look, ask questions, and possibly buy something; however, it is wise to be a bit careful. The prices are inflated as people expect haggling. If you have no idea what something is worth then it could be more expensive than what is a fair price. It is wise if you want to buy jewelry for example to know something about jewelry, because it is difficult to know what is authentic Berber, what is real silver, what is a true antique, etc., if you do not know before hand. There is an abundance of goods, hand crafted furniture, lamps, leather goods, spices, cooking pots (tajine), carpets, art, and so on to choose from. Still it would be good to do a bit of research on what you will find there prior to shopping, and have some idea of what to look for in quality and what is a fair price. It is fun, it is safe, but it is good advice to be polite but be ready to give many firm 'no' responses, as the souk is an active and competitive market. Also to note: you may be asked for money to use a public toilette."

We wandered unguided for about 3 hours in and out of the souk never feeling threatened but occasionally a little turned around. If you do get too lost look for a tour guide with a group and ask them, they will give you accurate directions. Obviously you need to haggle for most all prices and be weary of quality and construction if you're buying big items. We bought our carpets and blankets outside the city and got a better deal. There was one carpet shop near an entrance to the souk from square, it was across from a cafe. The shop looked nice and we had an honest conversation with the owner who used to live in Orlando and work at Epcot Morocco. Lastly we would rate the Istanbul grand bazaar above this.

They use pets to attract children I.e a tortoise outside one souk distracted my son and while he was looking at it the stall holder works on parents, he got distracted by a chameleon and birds of pry outside other stalls. Therefore as parents they distract the child and when you come up against your child being keen on something and the hard bargaining of the stall holders , it may cost you! It is fascinating and inspiring but a lot of tat too. Probably best to buy things elsewhere as there is better quality and lower prices out with the main market. It is a Definately must see visit, you will get lost. But don't worry you are never too far from the main square. Haggle for everything I have been starting my haggling at about a quarter of their 1st offer and paying around a third of what they initially ask for. Don't be scared to walk away or appear rude as they will chase you and offer you a better price if you do this."

We took all the warnings seriously about being modestly dressed and being mindful that we were two women on our own. But from the minute we stepped out of our Riad to the minute we returned we were hassled and it wasn't the usual people trying to attract our attention to sell us their goods (that we could deal with) it was the vulgar, sexual and threatening behaviour that we were exposed to. I have to say that nothing would possess me to return to this place. Even when we were in the company of a male friend who kindly walked us to our Riad from the taxi, we were exposed to more harassment - I can not understand this behavior - this is supposed to be a Muslim country where the women are respected when respectable, well someone has forgetten to tell the men in and around the Medina.It is such a shame as we also met some lovely helpful people, both male and female, but all I have taken away from this trip is bad memories!"

There are fewer tourists about for the hawkers and touts to grab. This is especially true in the narrow lanes of the Souks and the old town. It only took two or three shouts of Ali Babar to get me annoyed and by the time the fourth trader had tried to pull me into his hop I walked away. I found the tanneries to be particularly bad with a desperation in the sellers that made be both hacked-off and sad... Do not let this put you off. The mountains are majestic and glower over the city. There is true and deep history in the city which is well worth seeing and is an interesting mix of Arabic, Moorish and African influences and with a cold wind coming off the mountains remember to take a warm jacket.

Yes they pester you, yes they can be pushy but at the end of the day they are all trying to make a living and bartering is great fun, and if your price is too low they just ask you to leave their shop then as you leave they follow you and ask you to offer just a little more. As long as you dont pay anymore than you are happy paying then you have your bargain and they are happy.Never accept the first price they give you if they start at 400 dirhams you start at 80 or 100 and usually end up at about 120 if you hold your ground. If they want too much then just go on to the next one there are so many to choose from just dont be intimidated.One word of caution if you get out a map and appear lost you will have any amount of offers to show you the way best not to follow them as it always seems they are just being helpful but it always ends up in a request for money. Should you be lost just ask a woman or ask in a shop or if you keep walking you usually end up in the square. It is certainly an experience I shall never forget and yes I came home with some fabulous curtain tie backs, a shisha pipe and lots more.

You may think you can spot a bargain, but these guys have been doing this for generations, it's in their blood. Just be prepared to walk away from something, even if you really want it, as more than likely you'll see the exact same item 10 feet down the road. Only ever be prepared to pay what you think it's worth, not what they tell you they need. 5) An open mind. You WILL be hassled and as stressful as it can be, if you allow it, it will also be huge fun and massively rewarding and gratifying, especially when you do get that awesome bargain you came for. 6) A good sense of direction. This place, although not geographically vast, is a rabbit warren of 100's of little streets and alleyways that all look the same. Either take a guide or use an offline travel app that allows you to follow a gps signal so you can always see where you are and therefore need to be.

Head in there and prepared to shop, chat, banter, eat, drink, bargain, laugh, get lost, rediscover, get lost again, find again and until you either come out somewhere you know or get tired and ask directions, but ONLY ask a shop owner, NOT one of the kids in the streets as they will expect money and may take you to a families or friends shop first.Be aware but go have fun and bargain hard."

However, the touts are the most aggressive I have seen anywhere (and I have lived in the Middle East and SW Asia last 6 years so I know aggressive touts when I see them). They crowd you, sometimes patting down your pockets or back pack. Best way to get your price, like in any souk, is to declare a bottom line then walk away. If your price is OK they will call you back, even if what you offer is 1/2 their \"best and final.\" There are a number of restaurants who all have signs saying \"Terrasse Panoramique\" which they indeed have. Menus are mostly similar, not bad food and decent values. Just be careful in the souk. The number and variety of things on offer is staggering. Have fun!"

We were sure to carry a map with us everywhere we went (our Riad gave us a few on arrival) and these definitely saved us a couple of times (eventually - they're not the easiest things to read)! There are so many similar stalls that even if you think you'll remember the way back, in practice you'll easily mistake one stall for another you passed earlier, thus leaving you increasingly lost the further you walk!The Manager at our Riad did say if you're completely lost then the best thing to do is find a little boy to direct you to where you want to be, but bear in mind you'll have to give him 5 - 10 dirhams. We'd heard a few horror stories about being lead places so managed to avoid having to ask anyone! Be aware though, the moment you look lost a lot of people will start talking to you, offering to take you places (usually to the square) and you have to be quite firm when telling them that you don't need any help, as they'll just continue walking alongside you.So it can be a hectic place, with a lot of people pouncing on you trying to sell you things/direct you places as soon as you stop, but as long as you prepare yourself for that and remain relaxed then it is a fantastic experience to explore the wonders of the souk and to allow your senses to soak up all the different sights, sounds and smells. It would seem like you can also pick up some great bargains but sadly we simply didn't have the patience for it. Haggling isn't really my thing, I'm not blessed with the gift of patience and if an item takes longer than 10 minutes and an awful lot of chat to buy at a reasonable price then I'll rapidly lose all interest. My friends were the same, and whilst we had great plans of securing a bargain leather handbag and jacket, we all found that actually we couldn't really be bothered. On the other hand some people love the idea of a good haggle, in which case this place would be heaven! But whether you buy anything or not, it is most definitely worth a visit (or 5!)."

Throughout the Medina there are also Mosque, Hammam and Riad so it's not just shopping in the central part of Old Marrakech. If you get lost just ask for La Place and you'll get directions to the main square. This is where the tour buses drop off, horse drawn carriages await, and also the only place where we saw tourists get ripped off - by snake charmers, monkey men, henna ladies etc. Ask your holiday rep for the going rates for photos before you go. Or with a zoom lens you can take any pics you like from the rooftop cafes all around the square - and no blackmail from toothless vagabonds.Marrakech - I love it, another visit beckons I feel."

I have read some really ridiculous negative reviewers recently about the souks; I think the majority of people visit Marrakech for this crazy experience! Yes there's lots of shops, yes the people are keen for a sell but you have to be strong and be aware of costs so you don't get ripped off. The souks are an incredible maze with various areas and when you find the mini-squares at various points, you can find caf\u00e9s to eat and drink (some with terraces).Ultimately, yes you get charged more as a tourist; Moroccans need the money!!! The whole point is haggling - make sure you know what you want going in and how much things cost when converting into your own currency. If you have your eye on a particular item but the price is too high, walk away! We did that several times and you'll be surprised at how the price suddenly drops as they want to make a sale. We never buy things on holiday but the souks had plenty of interesting items and we bought some bowls, tagines and cushions for good deals.This is common sense but don't necessarily buy everything at the front end of the souk as obviously all tourists start there. Work your way into the maze and then you'll find the better offers as people need the money.Happy bargain hunting!"

Though you should definitely expect to be harassed extra if you are a woman, you'll likely meet your share of persistent shopkeepers whether you're a man or woman. If you're from a western country, you probably won't get used to it by the end of your stay.Like: Sheer mayhem. The kaleidoscope of colors makes for great eye-candy even if you don't want to buy anything. I strongly recommend thinking hard what you might be interested in buying before visiting, because it will make it easier to breeze by hundreds of shops without attracting the attention of every shopkeeper. The smells in the spices world are intense. We found the shoemaking souk and ironworking world fascinating but they are easy to miss among the souks selling imported goods.Walking through the souks is tiring but being in Morocco is often tiring, generally speaking. The souks are probably part of the reason you would want to visit Marrakech, though, so they are definitely a must-visit. Knowing some of the history behind them will greatly enhance your visit."

I understand the haggling system but if all you want to purchase is a bottle of coke I would rather pay a fixed price than haggle and then feel ripped off. At times a hawker would run from his stall and physically drag me or, more often my wife, into his stall and when we said we were not interested they often became aggressive. However if you do purchase something they are very polite and well give you clear directions of how to get to your next destination. Beware the Souk is like a maze and very easy to loose your way. It is possible to hire a guide but beware as they often just take you to stalls that they have an interest in. I feel that the Souk in Fez is much better"

The hustle and bustle is amazing, there is so much to see and you can shop till you drop with some good deals to be had so long as you choose carefully and are prepared to haggle. My advice is to always be prepared to walk away if negotiations reach an impasse as the vendor will usually come down in price a bit more, if not try another shop.Beware of buying fresh dates and nuts as there are mice running about all over the piles of produce,( if you didn't already know, mice urinate continually as they go as they do not have a bladder!) so think carefully before eating anything uncooked.In the main square there are numerous stalls with snake charmers etc, if they want to put one of the snakes around your neck for a photo, beware because they will then ask you for money, usually quite a high sum too! Having said that the overall experience is brilliant and you will want to visit again, we never managed to return at night but have been told that it is an even better experience then as all the food stalls come out."

We went on an organised trip through our hotel. It was middle of august so unbearably hot, no air conditioning on the coach, so after a 20 minute trip we were already soaked.The souks is not for the faint hearted, there were some awful smells, eg sewage aromas, motorcycles coming from all angles, constant harrassment to buy things, and the men just stared at the girls. We did enjoy some haggling though and got a table cloth at a bargain price. Dont be afraid to haggle, they expect it. There was a bar in the middle of the market where you can get a cold drink, but i would not advise to eat anything from the stalls, unless you want a bad case of the runs !!. We returned again this April, but just my husband and i went this time and had a more leisurely look around without the heat and was more enjoyable, but i would not recommend taking young children here,it would be too much for them.

We felt very safe there even when we got completely lost but it's best for women to cover up as its extremely traditional and you will stand out a mile if you are in skimpy clothes. You are never far from the main square and taxis so no need to panic if you do get lost just follow the signs? You can haggle as hard as you like, they love it and will give you a good lesson in bartering, one man even tried to sell us a stray kitten!

It was very interesting and brilliant to see things we probably would not have seen without a rep but very tiring. We were told by our rep you cannot access the Souks without a rep born in Morocco (not sure how true this is) however we were glad we went with a tour guide as we would have definatley got lost due to the winding streets and alleys, they all looked the same and one blended into another. The only disappointment was the pharmacy as we had no choice but to visit, we felt the products were forces on us and we spent at least 1-2 hrs there. We also visited a bakery which we were charged as we took a photo. We were not told this before entering but Moroccan people are very offended if a photo is taken with no payment. Surprisingly every stall was different and they had endless choice of clothes, housewares, gifts, souvenirs etc. After walking through the Souks we did stop at a cafe nr the market where we was provided with one free drink, the view from the roof seating was amazing especially when we went back ourselves in the evening. The market itself was quite repetitive and we were pestered a lot by women and children selling. Be careful not to give them your hand - they ask to look at jewellrey and tattoos then before you know it they henna you and don't let you go until you pay. One thing we were recommended and I would definatley say to try is their orange juice (believe it or not) it was amazing. I would definatley recommend the souks however if you have the option to go later in the day I would say would be better do to the intense heat."

There are miles upon miles of alleyways in the souks so if you are a good walker and don't mind - shortly after setting off and inevitably taking a mix of right turns here and left turns there - having absolutely no idea where you are, then no problem! We thoroughly enjoyed being in the thick of the souks on our very first morning in Marrakech - the sights, sounds and smells are absolutely fantastic!... but I do have to say that they can be of bit overwhelming: you do have to wisen up very quickly to the fact that there are plenty of locals in there wanting to 'be helpful' and, um, 'show you the way', or invite you to 'just come and have a look'... What happens in fact is that the friendly local is luring you into a shop of sorts - the favourite being the ubiquitous carpet shop located deep inside a building - and before you've actually realised that that is exactly what's happened, you have been sat down and given mint tea and... carpet after carpet is being unrolled in front of you and the hard-seller is talking non-stop, leading to his asking you, fairly quicklly, what you like most and, clearly most importantly, how much you're prepared to pay! It's difficult to get away but away you must get, that's for sure because it would take a split second for you to be sucked into a purchase you really don't want. The one thing to avoid doing is to answer the hard-seller when he asks you how much you'd be prepared to pay for an item you've been shown because the moment you've uttered a figure, you've as good as sealed the purchase in the eyes of the seller! So if you don't want to find yourself in a very awkward spot, keep schtum and get out!I had looked forward to buying a few items in the souks during my visit - some spices, herbal soaps, a little tagine maybe, a teapot for mint tea, a couple of bits of jewelry, etc., but at the end of the day, because it's utterly impossible to browse at leisure due to the fact that the sellers are incredibly pushy (and won't hesitate to block your way out of their shop/stall space until you've bought something), I gave up and came home with practically nothing!Having said all that, I certainly do not regret spending a lot of time in the souks - the experience was great and, the next time I am in Marrakech, I'll be able to draw on the wisdom I have just acquired... (and be firm with those sellers and just say 'NO NO NO')!"

The Souks are very smelly as a result of all the leather but when purchasing, the shop owners assured us the smell would pass with time and usage. Unfortunately this is not the case, and infact, the bags have started to decompose - a complete and utter waste of money. DO NOT BUY THE LEATHER FROM THE SOUKS!

However, after 10 minutes you realise that by and large they are all selling the same mass produced merchandise aimed at tourists. You can get stuff cheap if you barter, but beware, if you can get it cheap, it is generally very poor quality. The vendors are mostly all good humoured and friendly and wont pester you if you say \"no thank you\" or \"I have already bought one of those\". We found that they are not willing to barter on the better quality items and a few of them will take offence if you try to barter them down too low. Take a good look around and check the quality before you buy. We found better items and sometimes a little cheaper or the same price outside the Souk. If you are buying lamps, go to the Jewish quarter where they are sometimes making them. They are not willing to barter but you get a much better product. Be careful buying herbs and spices. It sounds very cheap until they start bagging it up and weighing it!"

Whichever way you looked, there was something going on. Everything from snake charmers to bare knuckle fighters in the square through to an overwhelming array of goods for sale in the souk itself. You could easily get lost, it's so big, but it's divided into sections, carpets, metals, lanterns, spices and so on so that helped with getting your bearings. The stall holders were friendly but all mastered the knack of effectively 'trapping' you in a corner of their stall and doing their utmost to make you buy....even if you didn't want to. Our English culture is one of browsing, picking up and putting down, going from shop to shop until we find something we may want to buy,,,,but here in Marrakech it felt like running the gauntlet as we ended up not wanting to stop and look for fear of being hassled yet again. Of course, this is the way shopping is done here but it felt like a strain rather than a pleasure after a while. Definitely worth a visit but one of those 'once seen never forgotten' excursions that we personally wouldn't want to repeat. We did enjoy it but it was exhausting."

The souks are a complete maze and there is so much more to see than you would expect, so hiring a guide so you can see everything is advisable.Make sure you haggle! We ended up spending a small fortune in a chemist shop in the souks buying Argan oil and spices. We did ask our guide once we left the shop if we should have bargained and he said not so much in the proper shops in the souks, but always at the market stalls. You will be asked by almost every single stall owner you pass to have a look at what they're offering, which can get a bit of a pain, but they don't take offense if you just ignore them and walk past.If you are a woman, I would strongly suggest covering your arms and at least down to your knees. I had long trousers on and a vest top with a shirt underneath (it wasn't overwhelmingly hot as most of the souks are in the shade) but a lot of other tourists were wearing inappropriately short shorts and low cut strappy tops. This offends a lot of the older Moroccan men, and it will attract unwanted attention from the younger ones - they make no effort to hide the fact they're staring at your chest and I often felt uncomfortable.However long you are in Marrakesh for, you should definitely visit the souks - you won't have experienced Morocco until you have, and there are some really nice items to buy!"

Just one comment, everyone expects to be paid of EVERYTHING here.....if its to take you back to the square if you think you are lost, or to get his brother to take you to the tannery etc - TIP - keep loose change in your pocket, when you get to where ever you want to be dont wait for them to tell you how much they want, shake their hand and put the coins in their hand at the same time, be polite and thank then them walk away.

Everywhere something is going on, whether you are intrigued by what's being sold, chatting with the stall holders or just looking around at the marvellous buildings and architecture ( loosely used ) that makes the place so interesting. Every turn there's something new and a multitude of photo opportunities. Just be mindful to be respectful about what you point the camera at. The maize of alleyways, every now and then opens out onto a 'square' with the expectant over attentive sales pitches never really taking off. The locals care about this place and they care about its future. They do talk to you and want you to visit their own little patch but never aggressively and always with a smile. Indeed I had many conversations with them, firstly to state I wasn't French ( as they all seemed to presume ) and then to chat about all manner of subjects, not just come to my stall. They were just great to spend time with. Spend half a day just mulling around the souks, pick up a few bargains and lose yourself in so much Marrakech history."

For most of us used to the western way of shopping i.e. the price is on the tag and we pay up without question, shopping expeditions in places like the souk in Marrakech can be a daunting, and for some even a fearful, experience. If you understand a few things about the culture, there is nothing to fear and lots of fun and bargains to be had.In Ireland we will quite happily nod to strangers on the street in greeting and if someone bids us the time of day, we would consider it rude not to respond. In Morocco, everyone with something to sell will be bidding you the time of day or talking at you in some way. If you are truly not interested in what they have to sell, do NOT catch their eye or respond!!! To them, this shows interest and the opportunity to start the process of selling you their wares. To shoppers not used to this and trying to get away, it can be scary and often puts them off venturing further.In my experience, if one ignored the first attempt to get your attention (very hard for us well brought up westerners who speak when spoken to!!!) you were not pursued. The minute you looked at them though, you were fair game and they started telling you what 'good price' they had 'specially for you' !! If you are interested, then the fun begins. As a rule of thumb, offer one third of what they are asking and don't pay more than half - and enjoy the banter in the process. Most people enter the souk in Marrakech from Jemaa el Fna square and so, naturally, the first hundred yards or so is very touristy in content and likely to be more expensive. It is also much more crowded. Brave this crowd and push your way on into the souk and suddenly you will find that it is not crowded at all and you can walk and browse with ease. Do also venture right into the heart of it where the metal workers and the carpet dyers have their own sections of the souk and you will see real artisans at work. Also, if you ask where you might find something, don't be frightened when the guy says 'I'll take you there' and speeds off in front of you and you follow and find yourself in a warren of twists and turns and wonder if you will ever be seen again. He is probably bringing you to his 'brother, cousin, uncle....' who has just what you want! We were looking for a particular lamp and were involved in such an expedition but we got exactly what we were looking for and an adventure as well. Our 'guide' then led us back to Jemaa el Fna.

Taxi fare was 20DIR.Went there around 8ish at night and it was overly populated with lots of locals and tourists. We had to make sure we stayed together due to the large crowd buzzing around. It was a warm night.Looked around the souvenir shops on the square but decided not to go into the souks for we were worried we may get lost. Just stayed on the outside for a few hours and returned back to our hotel by the horse carriage which cost us 200DIR.We were told that during the day...there would be different stalls around and that it does differ from the night atmosphere. Worth the visit for the experience."

They will all shout \"hello\" and some become hostile if you ignore them - don't they know you've heard this 25 times in the last 10 minutes are are now deaf to it? Some of the goods on sale are interesting but the stalls are certainly repetitive, and the general attitude of the stallholders makes for an unpleasant experience. If you get lost they will try to misdirect you for financial gain, and you can have two people practically point you back to the square in opposite directions almost at the same time. Another favourite is \"this way is closed\" - perhaps one of Marrakech's top lies. I know everyone finds tourists annoying, but they could at least have some basic respect for another human being. In 35 other countries inc south east Asia, never so much have I felt eyed as a wallet on legs, and never so much have I been stalked by people wanting my money.So I disliked the souks, but at the same time they are a cultural experience, just not one I'd care to repeat again. Far worse than their equivalents in Dubai and Istanbul. Pretend you are deaf or cannot speak English of French and you'll get through them relatively unscathed."

When you reach to the square you could not not miss them.From day to night, lots of lively lives, Hugh collections of local products.You can easily get lost in there and enjoy the differences of being in Morocco style of lives.There are mixed feelings of Souks. If you only liked fixed prices, Souks can be heel to you. You need to bargain, a lot. For most people, it is very uncomfortable way to get items they like. Best thing to do is look around more, asking prices buy in the e B2B d of the trip. That gives more time to used to the Moroccan way and know roughly how much they ask at the first place.If you like bargain, congratulations, you can get reasonable prices for items you like to pay and do not feel like have been ripped off. There are many things I liked but many times I felt they were very pushy so I did not want to even go in their shops. Best time going to Souks is mornings. I found they did not do very much hard sales. I walked in 3 different shops. A wooden boxes shop, A lantern shop , A ceramic shop and A jewellery shop. I bought a box with flower patterns on for 80dh(Asking price was 180dh) 2 aluminum lanterns for 220dh(asking price was 380dh) ceramic ingredient bowls were fixed prices, 10dh/each. 1 mixed silver with other material bangle for120dh(asking price was 350dh)From here, you could guessed how overpriced the Souks are. And we were advised by riad owner, do not pay the prices they ask for and bargain down to half price at least.I understand it is annoying they should just have fixed prices, but for things you like a lot you probably have to go through all these unfairness.Don't bother with those high prices jewellery shops. They measure by grams and tell you they are all silver.charge you 700dh for a little ring. But I noticed, once I said if he could find me some similar design of the ring. He went to his big collection of plastic bags for them. Well, I saw people selling this type of rings in Europe. The shop owner does not put them in a cheap plastic bags and if they are very expensive, he won't treat them like a market items. So be carefully with jewellery shopping.About carpets, not very much experience. But there are many tricks to make you buy. So even I like them so much,I dare to try.If Souks owner ask where you are from, try not to answer, the prices depending on that too.Try to think how much you would lime to pay at home and don't be shy by offering your ideal prices.:)I really hope, tripadvisor having more people comment and write reviews of general ideas in Morocco. That will help a lot for tourists to make their holidays easier."

The noise, the crowds, the smells and the constant haggling for price make for an amazing adventure. Contrary to another preconception it's a very safe place with the locals eager to maintain their friendly reputation. We have two small children who we were worried about losing in the crowds but never for their actual safety. It's impossible to explain the place without having experienced it yourself but as first timers I would highly recommend a getting a local guide. Finding a good one can be tricky as they rapudly descend upon you once you arrive at the medina. They'll have badges around their necks and claim to be registered government approved guides.....whether that's true or not, finding someone with good English that can show you around the first time is well worth the time you'll waste trying to work it out yourself. These guides however are all \"affiliated\" with various shops in the Souk and will take you to several as part of the tour. You'll feel a bit railroaded but the best idea is to go with it and only buy if you want to. We found an elderly gent with extremely good English (says he was an interpreter on the set of Lawrence of Arabia back in 1962) and French. His name is Aziz and his number when calling from Marrakech is 0610778628. For 250drm for 4 hours is a good way to get your bearings for a subsequent \"unassisted\" visit. Haggling is essential in the Souks and no transaction occurs without it. Feel free to be as bold as you like. You'll be met with a smile and even a chuckle if you're being too tough but you'll never hurt their feelings so give it a shot!One of the very rare real life experiences left for less extreme travellers and I highly recommend visiting both during the day and in the evening when the night markets begin to come alive."

Don't ask the price of anything unless you are really interested as they take that a real interest and see a sale and it's even harder.My top tip is not to buy anything on the first day - I had decided that before I went but of course it was quite difficult to achieve, and I ended up spending money on things that I'm not sure what they are now! So if you want to get out of a situation then be very nice, very polite, put your hand on your heart and bow slightly and say perhaps you'll think about it and leave nicely and be persistent in a nice way and it will be fine.And don't get enticed to see the tanning area, it's not very nice and they will want money for showing you around. We did of course, despite having decided we didn't want to. Being brought up British does mean you don't like to be rude and it's hard in the face of persistence.But it is fun, even if you leave and realise some of the things they sold aren't really that good, but then some are.

I had been out for almost 6 hours in the heat at this point and I did not follow my own advice and got angry. Very angry! It was funny after, but not at the time.

BUT my husband did not get angry...just me...got some good yelling out of my system over that. Silly, but it happens. You do not need a guide- we met people who did this, seemed silly.

Fascinating place, with real artisans and craftsmen selling their wares in many of the stands. Smile and they will smile back.

The smells alternate between great and horrific. The colors and textures are wild. Be prepared to get lost. Be strong so you don't buy a bunch of junk you don't need. Know what you want before you go in. Be prepared to bargain, bargain and bargain some more. Nothing is priced. The prices stated, when you ask, change depending on how much money the seller thinks you have. Immediately state a price that is about 1/4 the price they start with. We tried to end up at half the initial price. Do not assume that anyone is telling you the truth about what they're selling. Don't follow anyone who offers to lead you anywhere. Don't pay anyone money to lead you anywhere. You have to have a bit of a tough skin in the souk. Don't get cajoled into buying things and don't fall for any scams. One day was particularly difficult. I was called names by a young man who wanted to lead us to his father's wool dying shop. When I politely but firmly refused, he let out a slew of nasty comments that I refuse to repeat here. Many had to do with the fact that I was American. That said, we bought some lovely leather babouches (traditional Moroccan leather slippers), a handmade Berber rug and a traditional lamp. I really think that the Souk in Marrakech is an experience everyone should have. Just go prepared (a kind of mental body armor is in order here)."

I really enjoyed walking around the souks, talking to stall owners and looking around at the items on sale. You do sort of find though that once you've seen about 10 shops, you've seen them all. Lots of football shirts, polo's, headphones, jewellery, pashminas and kaftans everywhere you turn! I found if you speak a little french and lean the arabic phrase \"la choukran\" if you are not interested, they usually just smile and leave you be. Lots of bargains to be had but you have to work for it, barter the price. Try the delicious orange juice in the square! Look both ways in the square, lots of scooters around and everybody drives a little crazy in Marrakech! I'd steer clear of the snake charmers and the monkey entertainers, they try to charge you to take pictures. I found a lot of children following me and begging for money as well which was a little distressing. We didnt see it at night but I have been told that night time in the main square and the souks is the best time to go, lots of food and performers! Be prepared to get lost, but enjoy it and look around! You might find people claiming that they're from your hotel and are taking you on a tour or that they work at your hotel and its their day off. These people are illegal tour guides, just after your money and will try and get you in their friends shops. Dont fall for it!"

Do not go in a shop/stall unless you are serious about buying something, they will come out to entice you in and if you do enter you may as well empty your wallet then. Also beware the ladies who thrust a cheap bangle (or anything else) in your hand. Try giving it back - you can't and they will want a Euro/10 Dirhams for it (again, what's a quid for a bangle) and you will get tears and the story of their dying relatives. Go on, give her a quid! The many Fatimas who try to tattoo you are a different story..... You'll get endless offers of hashish, usually by young men offering you flyers for hammams as a cover, it is technically illegal. Don't be offended if you are anti drugs, it's their culture and their country, but if you do want some hash don't buy it from them. Wait 'till a stallholder asks if you want any because it will be under his counter, not up a dark alley with a couple of swarthy youths. And there's plenty of that on offer too!

You get hassled to varying degrees by stall holders, the worst seemed to be the perfume shops and spice stalls. Very few of the stores have marked prices, so the price of the same item varies enormously. One of my friends saw some bowls she liked, 40MAD in one store with price tickets. She was later asked for 200MAD for the same item and eventually bought them for 20MAD each. Shop around until you find the best price and start your offer at a third (33%) of that and expect to pay about half (50%). Don't be intimidated, be prepared to say no and walk away (this often gets you the best price).If you don't want a leather footstool, pointy toed slippers, argan oil or saffron, don't ask the price, it will cost you at least 15 minutes of your holiday. There are no official guides in the Souks, just scammers after a tip, or directing you to a store that pays them commision and the commision will be included in the price you pay. Having said all that, the Souks can be fun. Some of the stall holders do have some good banter, you may find a real bargain and they offer an escape from the sun.P.S. If you don't know what saffron looks like, or smells like, don't buy it. Morocco is one of the worlds leading producers, but you can end up with the worlds most expensive turmeric, if you don't know what you are looking for. If the price is too good to be true, it's because it's too good to be true."

Traders constantly speak to you willing you into their stores and try and engage you in the bartering activity. It's very enjoyable for the first few days but does understandably get tiresome if you're in Marrakech for more than a week."

The souk is a maze of alleys and vendors all selling the same thing - bags, pots, jewellry, scarfs, sandals, spices - but that is exactly what you would expect. Yes, it is very easy to get lost, but look up and you will see signs back to the main square so just follow them and eventually you will get back to civilisation. You must barter - whatever the price is they quote, go in with your initial bid at just under half. And be prepared to walk away, even if they get agressive, sad or make you feel guilty! We bought some small pots, the ones 'on show' were Safi branded which is supposed to be a good quality ceramic. We pointed out the colours we wanted, the vendor got the pots for us and wrapped them up - when we opened the package at home, the pots were not branded so much poorer quality - but hey, we paid \u00a33 for each, so what do you expect. But maybe just watch what they actually put in the bag! I found some of the vendors a bit agressive in their way that they tried to stop you to come into their shop, and you do have to be prepared for every vendor to try to entice you in, so it does get a bit tiring after a while saying constantly no thank you, but that is all part of the fun! Seek out the bargains - leather bags are definately at the top of the list, as are the scarfs. If you do find yourself wandering out of the souk into unfamiliar streets, be prepared if you are truly lost and someone helps you find your way back to pay a tip. Go there and enjoy the experience! It has to be done."

We probably paid over the odds for a few things we bought, but it is a really interesting experience. Once you've spent money, it is interesting to talk to the shopkeepers. Bear in mind they'll want to take you to see their friends' shops. Don't buy Argan Oil, much cheaper in the supermarket and probably better quality/not fake! We found a Carrefour by Place de la Liberte that had cosmetic oil for 54 dirhams in a metal container (recommended). Also, don't be embarrassed about offering really low - it is a bit of a game really. The first price offered is ridiculous, then they often offer you a lower quality item to explain why the one offered is better. Stick to your guns and go up slow, there's no rush here. As others have mentioned, there were a lot of motor bikes and offers of guides. Just say no, unless you have a place you are desperate to go. I am female and didn't dress that sensibly, but didn't get hassled. My main piece of advice is don't go in after sunset - you'll stick out and WILL be hassled."

An elegant young man whisked us inside and into a back room lined with rows of jars. What followed was pure theatre - very enjoyable if viewed as entertainment. Spices, qualities, mixtures and uses were explained with no hard sell. The Moroccan Maestro read our body language and facial expressions like a 'pro'. He homed in. He weighed out a few modestly-priced spices before innocently enquiring if we needed any saffron, which we all know is more expensive than gold. He showed us his top-quality saffron, put a couple of strands in a glass of water, invited us to note the colour, smell and taste the aroma. It was certainly the real thing. He closed the door and lowered his voice. Just between him and us he could sell us some at a very special price. He confirmed that there are a lot of rouges cheating tourists by selling orange-coloured fibres for inflated prices, and even advised us to take great care. Wasn't it lucky that we had found his shop!Needless to say by this stage we were completely taken in by his charm and knowledge of the complex world of Moroccan spices. We bought two packs each for about \u00a310. What can I say! Take my advice; if you enjoy theatre, then you'll love the show. But if you want genuine saffron, wait till you get home and buy it from a supermarket."

This maze of narrow little backstreets are lined with shops that spill out onto the street and owners trying to get everyone that passes in to look around with such sayings as \"Asda price\" and \"Cheap as chips\" and as soon as you pick something up for a better look or even just lean closer to see something better they start the hard sell.Don't be intimidated into buying something you don't want and don't just pay the first price they ask for something you do. Most of the stuff is junk but sometimes you can see something nice for a souvenir. I saw a box of granite eggs and had a look through for a good one without flaws, straight away the shop owner was on me asking for 150 dirham, the rete of exchange at the hotel was about 12.50 to the \u00a3 at the time so he was asking \u00a312.50. I put it down, laughed and walked away, he followed me for about 50 yards trying to get me to buy it dropping his price to 100 dirhams. I still said no so he asked me how much I would pay, I said 50 and he agreed. A huge difference and he would not of sold it if he was loosing money, so my advice is don't be afraid of dropping your offer to 25 or 33% of the asking price, you can always up your offer but if you go in with 75% of the asking price and the merchant agrees you can't drop down lower and once a price is agreed they see it as a contract and will get upset if you then back out of the purchase."

If you need to ask somebody, look for a policeman (there are plenty of them all about centre). If you want to buy anything in the souks, there is a new store just opposite the Saadian Tombs. Everything in here is fixed price, you pick them up & take them to a till. No hassle !! They have everything so head here first, decide what you want & make note of the price.

There are some ace bargains to be had but learn the art of haggling before trying your luck on more expensive items and if you feel comfortable, ask advice from your hotel/Riad about estimate prices! Be prepared to be asked to come into every shop you walk past and learn to be assertive, especially if you're a woman because the men are extremely intrusive with their language and their staring at you, even if you are with a man.

You can always show a friendly shopkeeper your map and he will tell you where you are and point the way out. He may also take you to his relatives?? around the corner to see something different. We were taken to the Dyers souk and bought two silk scarves. Haggle lots they really do enjoy it."

            "review": "I'll Make You Democratic Price. The souks were a winding maze of tiny shops that were fascinating. Many of the shops sell the same items - you have to look really closely to find unique things. Beware, if you stop to look or ask the prices, you MUST bargain, it's part of the game. Get your game face on and go do it, it's a lot of fun, but be prepared to keep your word, that's necessary in this culture. Also be prepared to walk away if the price isn't right. more often than not, they will chase you down.Tourists, keep your money and valuables close to you - a money belt is best. The souks are very crowded and often you must get against the wall to let motorbikes pass. Do not allow young people to \"help\" you find anything - you are expected to tip them for this. If you need any help, ask a shopkeeper. Also watch for \"faux guides\", Moroccans who will lead you around the souks (to their favorite shopkeepers, who give them a kickback) and often will not let you loose until you pay what they demand. The police are on the lookout for these faux guides. My husband is a latino and was often mistaken for Moroccan - he was stopped by the police twice because they thought he was a faux guide!You can get AWESOME stuff at these souks for a very fair price. Don't be afraid to negotiate, it is expected.Also, beware of the henna artists. My daughter wanted a henna tattoo, and the artist just grabbed my arm and started on one for me and also did the same for my husband. We ended up having to pay her for 3 tattoos. Stay far away from them while they are working on someone else!Be sure to eat in the restaurant tents at night in the main square. It's a delight! The whole souk experiences was a sensory overload! It was very much fun and definitely 2 days was enough!"

They will chase you around the square and harass you until you buy or dine with them otherwise they will swear and curse at you until you are no longer visible. There are millions of thieves even young children who will skilfully rob you blind all over the city but particularly more in a souk due to the lay out and small confined spaces. If you really want to visit the souks use a tour guide or local if you know one as this makes it easier.The city in general is very racist and the airport is no exception. you will be man handled and if you are generally not fair skinned you will be harassed and asked multiple questions about your own and parents places of birth even though they have your British passport in their hand! You also cannot use dirhams in the duty free and cannot take more than 1000dh passed security. On a lighter note there is no liquid monitoring so you can leave without worrying about a clear bag or 100ml.The sight seeing bus tour is a very good and cheap way to get around as the taxis smell tourist and triple the price so always agree a fare before getting in. Bus drivers are very friendly and will help you as much as they can even stopping away from a stop to take you closer to your destination - they are a real credit to the city and the buses are very regular about every 15 mins.Always try to buy from a supermarket or somewhere that has prices displayed as they will hike up prices and short change you. Always also check your change as there is alot of ripping tourists off.The only place that I have anything good to say about is my hotel and the staff who went above and beyond to help when I had my bag stolen in a souk. they drove me to a police station, translated and ensured I was watered and helped me cancel my cards and that I felt safe etc. The hotel suite Novotel is a real gem and the staff have the kindest hearts. The manager is a lovely man as is the hotel driver who helped me beyond words can describe."

A gentleman shoved a pastry in my hand, said it was free, forced me to try it and then asked for 50DH we gave 60 because we had no change and then tried walking away without giving us change! In hindsight I should have refused the pastry and then at the least bartered the price but never mind!If you want to go in the Souks you really need a guide.

I also walked into a market where people are buying ans selling sheep/ goat skins - a most interesting experience.What we didn't like;While the merchants definitely are more relaxed, there are still a lot of hustling going on. We are prepared for this. What we didn't like is that too many of them came too close physically that is decidedly un-nerving.

A huge open square, a confusing maze of narrow alleys lined with traders winding on for ever, bordered by cafes to sit & watch, rooftop terraces to get the best views of the sunset & have mint tea. Brush up on your French & sadly be prepared for calls like \u201clovely jubly\u201d, \u201dcheap as chips\u201d, \u201cbetter than M&S\u201d\u2026.. we Brits have a lot to answer for in spoiling such destinations! Beware of offers of help as they may result in a demand for a fee of 100 MAD; although that is only \u00a310 they may have led you a merry dance to get to somewhere that was only a minute from where you were stood. We got caught but having loudly refused we were immediately left alone; shame they lived up to the bad rep.HAVE THE FRESHLY SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE! Every stall sells it at the same price 40p/4 MAD, pick one and make it your regular and you will get a lovely welcome and possibly a free drink. You can buy water in the small shops to the right of the square for \u00a31 a litre.If you get there around 5pm you will witness the transformation from empty space to packed, covered street food market, traders with their wares spread out on a mat, henna or fortune tellers sitting on low stools and the ubiquitous snake charmers appear. As dusk falls the hub bub of buskers/social music gatherings, applause for the acrobats & the general hum of diners talking fills the air.Do not be afraid to eat at the street food stalls; personally I would rather see what is being done to my food than go to a caf\u00e9/restaurant where the kitchen could be doing goodness knows what. Also, everything is either blistering hot in a tagine \u00a34.50/45 MAD that continues to bubble when brought to the table, or barbecued on a raging grill; we nor anyone we spoke to had any upset tummies and it is so worth the experience. We tried everything too; even the \u201csoup\u201d & dates deal for \u00a30.50/5 MAD the locals seem to always opt for; sort of vegetable with chick peas. There was also a huge crowd at the stalls with boiled egg rolls!?!?Barter the price for your henna & have the black one as the brown does not last. I got one up my ankle for 50 MAD. Beware the ladies \u201cgifting\u201d you a flower on your hand as you walk by; they will demand a payment & keep complimenting you & hennaring until you remove your hand.Take the horse & carriage for 150 MAD \u00a315 for a \u201ctour\u201d of the Old & new town. Most of the drivers do not speak any English so you will only get to converse if you know any French/Arabic.If you are near the SOUK KAFE the 100 MAD/\u00a310 set menu is worth it on a lovely rooftop terrace. It is within sight of the square but you can easily get lost in the alleyways \u2013 we got a taxi there & back for \u00a310 which was over the odds but worth the safety.Sadly, there is a McDonalds (new town, milk shake \u00a31.50/15 MAD) and a KFC; reluctantly, although we did not eat there, the latter which is by the entrance to the Medina, had a great 3 pces chicken meal deal \u00a33.50/35 MAD compared to the \u00bc fried chicken & chips \u00a34.50/45 MAD we ate in the street market!This is a dry country; they do not drink alcohol, so you will only get coffee, tea & soft drinks in any public areas. Alcohol is served inside some establishments & at Hotels. This even includes open terraces of cafes/restaurants so you have to sit at an inside table!"

Beside the more \"touristy\" shops you will find mazing art galleries and antique shops all worth a visit. We took a small risk (after all it was our first time in a new town) and just went wit the flow: if somebody asked us to visit a shop we just followed him, even in the back alleys! And we ended up in corners that we'd never find with a proper tour or just staying on the main alley. We saw abandoned backyards, incredible spices shops, stinky meat stalls, colorful fruit, had dozen of mint tea cups in tiny shops (don't ask yourself if the glasses are clean...better not to know!) and smoked pipe with a nice guy who just wanted to chat. In a word: just get lost and enjoy! If you manage, find the olives souk and stock up: they are the best ever! Watch out for silver: we bough some real and very nice pieces but one bracelet was not silver at all :-(Bargain for everything (it's true you should offer one third of the first price) and don't think you can outsmart them:: they will always get the best deal, but that's how it should be!"

MARRAKECH - Jamma el fna (Main Square)Visited 5 times dsuring the day and at evening times, whilst on a two week stay in Marrakech in May 2013.Firstly let me dispel some of the nonsense we heard about hassle in this place. Whether you are walking the main square or scouring the souks, day or night, a simple no thank you, to any vendor / performer, need be said only once in order to be left alone. You are NOT harrassed at all.. The only nuisance / danger seems to come from the small moped / motor bikes being ridden in and around the square including the narrow alleys of the souks, but they seem skilled in the art of avoiding you (just).At 10 am the main square is fairly quiet / just coming alive, so you can amble around in comfort and at leisure with uninterrupted views.There are a very few snake charmers and guys with monkeys on a chains etc around, but again no hassle.Basically if you show no interest in them then they show no interest in you, and frankly if it were not for moronic tourists showing an interest, then the guys would have no reason to be there. So perhaps ask yourself do you really want to look and thereby encourage such barbaric displays? (And I am most definitely not an animal\u2019s rights supporter / fanatic). The souks are a typical Arabic / African experience, (but genuinely, the least hassle we have ever experienced anywhere on our travels around this continent and elsewhere). Once you enter the labyrinth of shops / stalls that is the souks, then it is very easy to get disorientated / lost, but there is nothing scary in this.There are some rudimentary (mainly overhead) signs that will help you get back to the main square or a particular named bab ( gate ) of the Medina and from there you can easily get a cab or walk back to your pick up point / hotel.From around 5pm onwards the square transforms into even more of a jamboree atmosphere and an outdoor food fest as portrayed by Jamie Oliver in one of his TV food programmes starts setting up and the square really begins to fill and to buzz.Do try the freshly squeezed orange juice at one of the many stalls day or night (clean and very tasty /refreshing (4 MAD) Do also try the snails at 5 MAD (0.35p) for a small bowl.(Different to escargot in garlic butter, but quite tasty).Apart from taking coffee at cafes around the sides of the square to watch the world go by, we had an ok snack / meal in a cafe in one of the side streets.We also ate a meal at stall 118. The food was ok and very cheap and we had no ill effects.We got a bit of hassle as he tried to rack up the bill at the end of our meal, but I stuck to my guns and only paid the original price, so be warned.In spite of the images portrayed by Jamie Oliver, I would seriously doubt the authenticity of about 98% of the food stalls.The more we went back, the more we realised thata) there are not as many food stalls as we expected, and they do not 'fill the entire square'.b) The food stalls looked and were very much all of the same and quite reminiscent of vendors you might find in any UK seaside town, with menus and prices with pictures.My wife had a skewer / kebab meal and I had a beef tagine and both were prepared from scratch within 45 minutes of the stall having been wheeled out into position and included time lighting of the charcoal ( so how the hell it was a genuine slow cooked tagline is beyond me ?)We also tasted a bit of sheep\u2019s tongue, provided to us by another diner who lives in UK, but is of Moroccan origin and was having his once a year treat of a full sheep\u2019s head.Whilst eating our meals at the stall I saw commercially labelled catering size pre prepared sauce mixtures being transferred from plastic containers into metal pots. There were even plenty of baskets of Eenglish chips being fried in square deep fat fryer baskets. So once again, Morroccon authenticity ? Margate or Marrakech ? decide for yourself, An enjoyable experience for us nonetheless, but, sorry Jamie, about as genuine as a nine bob note I\u2019m afraid.Verdict? Definitely worth a visit in order to tick the box, but in reality, a bit overrated in terms of size, vibrancy and authentic cuisine. No need to return thank you."

However it just isn't possible to follow directions because there are rarely street signs and the maps give you at best a rough idea of where you are ... so we did what I guess all tourists do, we got lost and stopped off where we found things that interested us. It can get annoying to be hassled all the time to see things and to be approached etc, but you have to remember that you're in a poor country and these are people who are working hard to earn a living. OK you can't talk to everyone who says hello, but I found that once finding something of interest and stopping to talk with a vendor, if you take the time to chat, smile and engage with the locals, they were very warm and interesting, charming people. I could write for a long time about the people we met, the fascinating labourinthine shops we saw and the beauty of some of the local crafts and antiques on show. It's really amazing and frustrating in turns .... but if you haven't yet been, then you really must"

Here is a general pricing guideline. First, you will have to bargain. As a general rule, the very first price they offer you is not the price you have to pay. Great negotiators can get the price down 50% but if you can get the price down 30% from what they offered, you have done well. Enjoy Marrakech."

Beware that you will be expected to pay for any pictures taking with snake charmers, monkey trainers, etc. They will simply walk up to you and place a snake around your neck. If you're not interested, immediately say NO or else, you'll be in for a ride.Also, beware that some of the locals will attempt to direct you to places and serve as an unofficial tour guide. They are very friendly and adamant. Be prepared to say No thank you numerous times and simply don't engage them. Just walk away.We were in this area for several hours. You could easily get lost.

The best thing about the souks,in my view, is that you can be pretty sure that most things on sale are made in Morocco rather than China.A rabbit warren would be an easily navigated highway compared to these narrow twisty lanes, but when you get over the shock and accept that you will get hopelessly lost you can enjoy lokking at the vast amount of goods on sale. I got a very strong well made leather belt for \u00a38 after my wife haggled well. It was fun as the trader had a sense of humour.Roughly divided into areas of leatherwork, art, metalwork etc the souks are not easy to navigate and you are sure to pass the same shops several times.But - the shopping experience is all but ruined by the constant flow of nutters on mopeds who come at you from all angles. There is legitimate traffic in the form of donkey drawn carts, hand carts and the occasional van in addition to hordes of people but the moped riders add nothing but fear and must surely affect trade. This has been a trip advisor topic since 2009 and I cant understand why the authorities allow it. None of the mopeds are registered so presumably there is no test or insurance requirement and the souks are not so big that they cant be driven around or walked through.Just be aware therefore and keep safe whilst enjoying an essential and iconic feature of this fascinating city."

My wife tells me that the cosmetic argan oil is the real deal, and the shop can be relied upon to sell good quality products. Many of the tour guides are accused of sending tourists to 'Berber markets' where they are overcharged, or, worst still, sold fake products.OK, how to find the shop.The address is First Floor, Galerie Essalam, Avenue Prince Moulay Racchid. Avenue Prince Moulay Racchid is the second street to the left of the Post Office in the Djemaa El Fna.At the other end of Avenue Prince Moulay Racchid is the Grand Hotel Tazi.Before you reach the Grand Hotel Tazi there is a shop on the corner of the street called Solo.Just before Solo is the entrance to Galerie Essalam. It has only Arabic signage.Above the entrance to Galerie Essalam is a projecting window.Remember the shop is on the first floor of a tiny shopping mall.I hope the photos will help you to find this place. It is well worth paying a visit. I had a bad cold for weeks and my airways were cleared with the help of the essential oils obtained from Herboristerie Firdaous."

You do not survive there if you do not bargain to buy something or just to call a taxi :) My shopping tip: 1. choose what do you have interest to buy2. have a price in your mind (half price)3. when been asked, tell your offer (don't be shy)4. they don't accept5. turn your back6. they come to you and acceptIt is a tiring shopping way but that is their reality, their way to make business.Even with just 5 days in Marrekech we went to sleep at Desert of Sahra and rode a camel!!!! 2 days 1 night. If you do not mind to travel all day (stopping for lunch, touristic points, toilet, views), ride a camel for 1 and half hour, sleep in tents under a beautiful sky, watch a stunning sunrise, have a typical Berber dinner, sing and dance ...

Beware of over-tipping the water sellers (men with big, tasselled hats!) when having a photo done; we fell victim to this! Have some loose change and small notes to hand - not a 200 Dirham note only, like we did!! And the snake charmers will plague you in the same way, but are a must-see/do. My hubby hates snakes, but was 'charmed' into having one placed round his neck for a photo! The souk is so atmospheric, and seems never-ending. Each 'stall' is a cavernous, dimly-lit Aladdin's cave of sparkling slippers, or rich-smelling leather - to name but two goods. Donkey carts shoulder their way through the throng, transporting all sorts of goods - and watch out for scooters zipping past you all the time. Visit the Koran school - exquisite carvings and engravings there. I think one should pace one's experience of the souk, otherwise it can be over-whelming. We kept going back for short, sharp spurts of shopping. For a hassle-free experience,Centre Artisanal is a one-stop huge department store selling everything, but apparently there is a more authentic shopping experience at the smaller Ensemble Artisanal; these places are government controlled, and sell authentic Moroccan goods at a slightly higher price, but with no haggling to worry about.

We were somewhat anxious about venturing into the labyrinth of the souk and could not have been more pleasantly surprised both by how friendly it was and how easy it was to get around. That said, it is important to have your own map as asking for directions can land you with a persistent 'guide' demanding to be paid. But any hotel map will be adequate, and there are plenty of signposts to the Jemaa el Fna if you need to re-orient. We found that the best approach was to be smiling, friendly and firm ourselves, and then the stallholders were smiling, friendly and reasonable in return. It's definitely best not to spend too long wasting a stallholder's time, but if you are genuinely interested in something they are pleasant to deal with. Bargaining needs a degree of nerve, but we found that if we started at 20% of their initial price we could almost always end up paying under 40% and sometimes considerably less. Everything should be bargained for unless it is edible, we were told. So if you are buying spices regard the price as more or less fixed. Don't fall for the 'this is best quality' spiel as you will get it everywhere for everything - but at the same time do be aware that quality varies from stall to stall, even if the item (shoes, say) looks initially the same. So make your own inspection and be prepared to pay more or less accordingly.Above all, enjoy it! It's great fun!"

Some shout aggresively 'It's Closed!' while you walk in the souks innocently trying to enjoy your holiday.One chap continually mimicked me by repeating the words 'No Thank you' in a sarcastic manner. In one of the shops, the shopkeeper got aggressive when we bartered him down from 315D to 215D (Approx \u00a319) for a small wooden guitar and small drum (Not cheap) and then preceeded to tell me to 'Have a nice life' in an angry cursing manner whilst shoving the bagged items into me. He also mentioned that he had to get food for his family and felt that the price was too low.I realise that there is poverty in Marrakech, but there's no reason to totally disrespect the tourists. I have travelled pretty well and never felt this way. In Bangkok I needed to be on my guard for scams but I never had the abuse I received in the Souks. I feel some (not all) of the locals just expect the tourists to give money out freely and that we maybe have an endless supply cash."

Most vendors will leave you alone if you are firm in your 'non, merci'. As for haggling, the rule of thumb is to offer a third of the opening price and be prepared to walk away. However if you want to buy, and the seller wants to sell, the end price should keep both parties happy.Always bring cash,the smaller denomination the better.

You can find everything there, even things that you don't really need for an accessible price. They will show you everything that they have, and they're really sympathetic in general. They'll offer you tea as well, but always ask if it's for free, otherwise they'll try to charge 20MAD ( around 2 euros) for that. It may sound cheap for you, but there you can buy a few things with this money and get tea for free. You also be careful because they will always try to get more money from you once you're a foreigner. Once you're in Morocco you have to bargain even for a coke, so you'd better do it inside the souk as well if you don't wanna get ripped off. Things there are extremely cheap for you if you're European or North-American, but don't let them fool you. At first they'll say that something costs 100 MAD (e.g.), but you might be able to get it for less than half of the price if you bargain right.They're really friendly, but there will probably appear some guys trying to guide somewhere, either to see how they produce leather or something else, it's something really interesting to see, but don't forget that they will charge you for showing you around and guiding you. Don't give them over 20 MAD, no matter if they ask, they won't hurt you, so just say you don't have much money and walk away.There are pickpockets everywhere, even though I didn't see any when I was in Morocco you should be careful. Like a friend of mine said \"Be afraid of pickpockets in Europe and of being cheated on in Morocco\" hahahah"

When you step out of your hotel room, you WILL GET LOST. Young morrocan boys will jump on you to offer to lead you anywhere you need to go. They will say they are not guides, it is a gift, but when you get to your destination, they will demand money. Best thing to do is negotiate a price for them to take you to wherever you want to go BEFORE you make another step. The guides are very pushy and you must be firm. We had this one guide 17years old, very sweet, he invited us to his home and the family was very hospitable. The next day while he was working for us he disappeared. Showed up 4 hrs later at our hotel and said he was arrested for following tourists and had to pay 200 to get out and demanded that I pay for it. When i refused he got pretty nasty. You can't really avoid having a guide, but make sure you set boundaries. The souks are magical, you can spend days on end browsing, and there are no set prices. When you ask how much something is, the vendors will give you an opening offer. Usually it is at least 3 times more than they are willing to accept for it. Haggling is the name of the game. But you are better off haggling in Tijuana. :)"

One place one should definitely visit is the souks (the market) in the old median of Marrakech. If you are a tourist no doubt you shall stand out and be prepared to be called and pulled in to their shops and be sold anything from shoes and handbags to small animals, when the owners offer a price, half it automatically and then negotiate, you will have to push but you will neg the person down if not they will rob you blind. One thing you must make sure that if you are going to take a picture be prepared to pay for it and at times it can work out expensive. Do try the food in the stalls, we tried a few but the one that stood out was stall number one named Chez Aicha, the food was unbelievable and service was even better and cheap. Do also try the Mint tea although if you do not have a sweet tooth ask for the sugar to be put on the side. And finally do go the panoramic restaurant and get a terrace view and enjoy the circus of the souks come to life and watch the stalls being set up, a truly unbelievable experience,"

Prepare yourself to be badgered by stallholders, but accept that this is what they do for a living - it's a competitive place for them.

It's how things are done and i guarantee, it'll be all smiles and handshakes when you eventually agree your price.The metalworker's souk is particularly incredible - have a good look at everything being done in there. be aware that tanned camel leather bags do not smell nice inside, so make sure you smell things thoroughly before buying!There are signs throughout the souk, directing you back to Jemaa el Fna square - a perfect place to start and end, with bars, restaurants and space!"

Can I be bothered when the start price is so high.I tried the tactic of offering a price beforehand, then got a lecture about the quality and uniqueness of the goods?Actually, they're not unique, I can find the same stuff in little morrocco, Goldman road, and its cheaper with no haggling.Yes... it IS cheaper in London. Some leather bags, are clearly not leather, only a few mind. The argan oils in the souks are suspect.Visit the first 8 outlets, and basically repeat it 100 times, and thats the souks with motorbikes constantly streaming through, clogging up the walkways and polluting to the extent your throat soon itches.Don't bother following the signs that lead you back to the square, we did, the signs stopped, we hit a crossfayre and ended up in some residential squalour. Dont ask for directions, some send you some way, some another, usually it's to where they have a vested business interest.Summary;- Far too expensive, Too much motorised traffic, Once youve been past the first 50 yards... it pretty much repeats.Portabella road/Goldman Road is much much better..... and come to that, so is any medium sized boot sale.Very dissapointed."

In brief it is an assault on your senses in every way imaginable!At every turn you will find somebody offering to be your unofficial guide, they earn a commission from any purchases you make and may well persuasively request a tip too, just remember they are only trying to eek out a living and feed their families. A firm \"no, thank you\" sends them on their way. If you are not confident about this arrange an official guide with your accommodation and they will keep the others at bay.You will need to be keen on haggling, the Moroccans selling here thrive on the banter and will come up with a ridiculous initial price, divide it by ten and start from there and be clear in what you are willing to pay in your own mind. Walk away if you cannot get there! What you will find is a treasure trove of handmade crafts from skilled artisans, from leather and textile, woodwork, metalwork, ceramics and jewellery. Items that cost a fraction of the price compared with what you would pay back home. Quality varies so inspect your prospective purchase thoroughly.Brace yourself and get stuck in!"

Marrakech Souk \u2013 Off-putting.I was really looking forward to visiting Marrakech purely for the purpose of its famous souks, exchanged cash in anticipation and was prepared to go back home with all the useless things, which I didn\u2019t need at all, like tagines, pashminas, lanterns, anything really which I thought would take my fancy. I\u2019ve done my fair share of haggling and banter in Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt and really was not scared of chatting to shop and stall keepers, because it\u2019s all about warm memories for me, feel-good-factor, not only bargain prices, there is nothing I was desperate to buy. Then it used to be great fun. This time it happened to be quite the opposite experience apart from two small but nice exceptions.We arrived in Medina fairly early in the morning, decided not to hire a guide and off we went on to our adventure bypassing snake charmers and monkey keepers on Jemaa el Fna. It was not that busy, we walked into a few shops, but reaction from shop assistants was most of the time indifferent, i.e they could not be bothered to even get up from their chairs, very strong vibe of unfriendliness in the air. If we started talking, information given to us was hardly trustworthy (their favourite trick - to prove that item was genuine, all of them liked to lit up a lighter and try and test with a fire leather or jewellery to prove that the item was genuine, not convincing at all), or if we got to a stage of haggling and did not agree on the price, shop assistants were getting abusive. Most of the shops were full of goods of very poor quality. Very quickly it was obvious that we were regarded nothing but walking cash dispensers or nuisance at best, I did not feel welcome at all, my enthusiasm has died very quickly as after a couple of incidents we really did not feel like walking into any of the shops. We walked into one Berber jewellery shop, looked around, did not see anything that we liked, were going to go away when a shop assistant took us to an underground floor in the shop opposite on the empty street. There was nothing there which we liked either and in less than a couple of minutes we went upstairs only to meet four men standing in the doorway.After that we were just wandering around when a young guy from a cosmetics\u2019 shop started talking to us and invited us to test some of their creams. While he was telling us about argan oil I was admiring beautiful ceiling of an old building, it looked hundreds years old. On our way out when we thanked him, he gave me a handmade ceramic hard skin remover. I did not want to be rude and refuse to take it, so started searching for some change, but he categorically refused to take it. When we were just about to walk out from the souks area into somewhere unknown, a group of kids and a few men rushed to us indicating that it was not a good idea to do so and pointing out in direction of the souks area. They did not pester us or asked for money, they simply wanted to help.We also went on a trip to Ourika Valley, Atlas Mountains, but, frankly, had very similar experience as the first part of walking route was going through numerous shops and cafes with very similar \u2018burning lighters\u2019, shouting and generally rip-off attitude.Our last encounter on the same note was in the airport toilet. After having used it I simply wanted to be helpful and pointed out to a woman, who was standing by the doors pestering people for money and chatting to another woman, that there was no toilet paper there. You should have seen bloodthirsty glare in her eyes when she happily replied:\u201dFinished\u201d. I rest my case.Nowadays, back home, we can buy everything we want and need really, at the prices we like and can always go back if a problem occurs. I hope, those shop-keepers, who work in Medina, read reviews on TA and will realise that their hostility is not doing themselves a favour as not only it puts people off from spending their money, but also creates quite negative image. Economy is not brilliant wide-spread, but it does not mean that we all should become vultures."

There are some lovely shopkeepers- and I love the Moroccan people generally- but oh wow there are some nasty ones too. It can become exhausting and we gave up in the end and bought little. One particularly nasty scene was when my husband tried to buy a metal (not silver) water bottle holder. The vendor wanted 150 dirhams. My husband offered 60 dirhams. The vendor shouted at us all down the busy street \"you bloody tourist you want something for nothing you insult me you insult my family\" Wow- very unpleasant stuff. Or often the vendor will refuse your offer and then chase you down the street saying \"ok,ok\" which means you trudge back to his shop to buy it (after having talked yourself out of it by then. The streets are a maze of alleyways. The souk covers 19km I believe. You are guaranteed to get lost, and we met several very distressed Europeans who simply did not know where to go.  Please do not accept the \"help\" of the young boys on every alleyway- they will often send you in the wrong direction and/or demand money. Do ask a respectable looking shopkeeper. And of course take a map. the mosques can be helpful landmarks, but often cant be seen from within the high walls if the souk. We were helped several times by shopkeepers (we chose the friendly looking ones), and they were happy to help and didn't demand money. Marrakech souk was just not how I thought it would be.

It can be very over powering at first, but you soon get used to saying 'no thank you'. You can get some excellent bargains; however, be prepared to haggle as the stall holders will generally start at an exceptionally high price. I would recommend halving whatever price they say and work up from there. They all love a good haggle! There are so many different goods to buy. You just need to make sure that you have enough room in your suitcase to fit everything! The best time to go is in the morning when it is quieter. Towards late afternoon and evening it gets extremely busy."

To be honest the more I read on TA the less I was looking forward to our first trip thereHere is a summary of our tripImmigration very slow, try and get to front of queueChanged money at the airport. decent rate and the more you change the better the rate is. Work out what you should get before exchange as queue can be long and service very quickOur Riad pick up was waiting for us. Its not easy to find these Riads so I would strongly suggest you get a pick up organized by hotel so that you get dropped off in correct place. They wont be able to drive to the door so there may be a 5-10 walk in if you are staying in the Medina so best to have driver walk to Raid with youBooked 3 nights at Raid. Fantastic, my full review is on T.A.Arrived quite late so had Moroccan banquet first night in Raid. Lots of food and mostly nice. Very disappointed in Tajine, little did I know!Sunday & MondayWalked into the souks, around spice market, shopping, shopping shopping stopping for coffees, drinks and snacks, Museum of Photography, into the Jewish quarter, around the square, the tombs and generally getting a feel of the place. Surprisingly I loved it, in fact we all loved itYes the traders try to get you into their shopsYes the touts will try and take you off to their brothers shopYes people will want to be your guideYes what ever you pay the taxi driver/guide will not be enough but hey.... that is the game.Welcome to Marrakech.You have a choice go with the flow and enjoy or fight against it and go madIn the Spice market we had a fella say \"is it me you are looking for\" and all ended up singing Lionel Richie together. He then charmingly led us into his shop where we willingly sat for 10 mins while he explained some of the mysteries away. There was no pressure to buy and most of us didn't. He enjoyed our company and vice versa. We left all smilingTaxi's we never negioated price just got in (like a local) We were told by our Riad owner 20D for small taxi and 50 for large was more than enough. Small taxi's only take 3 people. When we got out we gave 20 or 50D Every time they asked for more. Every time they got a pat on the back and a smile but no more money. This worked perfectly. If you dont want a guide say no and then ignore them they will soon get the messageIf you have nothing to do then go on an adventure with them, you will probably end up in a Berber shop or at the tanneries but you will have probably seen some new things on the way. May not cost you anything but maybe you part with 20D who cares. Keep plenty of small notes as they will not have changeWe ended up at the tanneries on one such adventure. You are given a bunch of mint on entering for the smell. Didnt really smell when we were there but pet goat was eager to eat my mint. I didnt find the tanneries very interesting as I was expecting to see colorful vats of dye but we were taken to the rooftop to get some great pictures. Then lead into a small Berber shop which looked difficult to escape from. By this time I was ready to leave so quickly praised the quality of the goods and the friendliness of the Moroccan people but sadly explained we were leaving the next day and had spent all of our money. He understood fully and we were quickly on our way with a smile and a pat on the backTuesdayHad driver/guide for the day \u00a380 Five of us in big car but he turned out to be pretty useless and only interested in his mobile phoneTrip to Tues. Berber market. Mainly food and veg and house stuff for local people, not particularly interesting. Then into mountains where we had a guide (compulsory we were told!) for 100D wanted 200D. Led to small waterfall, not Niagra but quite enjoyed walk in fresh airThen taken to friends restaurant for \"good food very cheap\" it turned out to be a tourist trap 150D per head for the usual tajine etc. we decided to just a have a drink. They weren't happy, neither was our driver. On the way back we asked to stop at Berber market again and ate in \"5 star Berber restaurant\" in the back of market. Cost 70D with bread for 5 of us. was pipping hot and the best tajine we had while we were there. Driver not happy but hey....You will get hassled quite persistently in the market by men selling jewelry to support their 6 kids and family. Its cheap junk at high pricesWednesday and ThursdayEssaouria. Told if we want a driver who isn't drunk and a bus with brakes only use CTM. We did. 3 hours with toilet stop. Good comfortable rideStayed one night but would have been happy to chill out for 3 nights hereFridaySpent day wandering around Marrakech, shopping, getting lost, finding cafes chatting. Did Jardin Marjorelle. Compact, quite pleasant if you have an hour to spare. Would go early or late to avoid crowds. Had pretty average massage at Easy Spa in the Medina. Changed from 2 hours to 1 hour on arrival. 270D p.hSaturdayPlanned to go to La Mamounia but were told not smart enough to get in so went to Jewish cemertary. Hello on Saturday!Wandered around and just had our last taste of everything Moroccan before we left for the airport with a contented smiles on our faces planning our next trip. 2 night in Marrakech, 3 nights in Essaoura and then maybe go to FezWeather... Very lucky, fantastic the whole timePeople...Friendly as long as you dont try and photography them. Smile and have a joke with them they will love it. Even if they dont understand what you are staying they respond well to a smile and a jokeShopping...Get a feel of the prices and quality before you start to buy. Bargain hard if you want to buy. Everything I bought was made out of of various metals. I liked the bowls buckets etc.... The first bucket I bought \"very old\" 200D wobbly legs. Liked it so much I bought a second somewhere else 140D and much better quality. Small bowl asking around 400D bought for 70DEating... We all agreed most of the local food we had was tasteless, bland and often not hot. I did persevere with the Tajines and had 5 from markets, main square to high end restaurants. Where do they put all those spices, fruit and nuts we wanted to know as they were not in any food we had. Meat mostly tough and chewy. Pastries not too bad. Orange juice very good but watch no added waterRecommend...Cafe Arabe, Cafe Nero and Marrakech Dejeune had very good meals in allSleeping Marrakech....Riad Dar Dialkoum. Excellent, full review on T.AEssaouria.... La Grand Large. Cost nothing, great location, clean friendly, good brekkie on roof terraceWorst things.. Bland food. And if you are a animal lover some of the donkeys are hard to look at. I did yell at one guy beating his with a big stick, did nothing! I personally didnt like the Al Jemaa el Fna. It was good for a drink and people watching but all the food we had there was pretty tasteless and I found the crowds annoying. Hated the poor chained monkeys, some not treated well. My friend however loved the ambianceBest things.... interacting with locals. Had loads of fun in the Souks laughing and joking with the traders. Orange juice and Essaouria. Go and have fun"

Most sellers are super friendly and you might even get small freebies once the deal is closed. Don't say no to mint tea if offered after a purchase. The best conversation and tea we've had (in Morocco) was with Abdul in his small shop next to Marrakech Museum - even shop keepers from other stalls smelled the brew and asked for a glass! We also loved our experiences in two different spice/herb etc shops. Knowledgeable and friendly owners explained the different products to us. We left the shops very happy with heavy bags."

Having looked at all the great reviews about Marrakesh I was very excited. However we left after only 2 days as we were groped and sexually harassed by the local men about 10 times, and had only been walking to museums and around the souks for about 3 hours in total. I should also note that we were both extremely covered up (down to floor skirt, baggy t-shirt, cardigan and scarf wrapped around body as well), as we have lived in Muslims countries before and are respectful of their dress codes. The place itself is amazing, the food is great and the envirnment was beautiful. It was such a shame that it was ruined by explicit phrases being yelled at us, groups of men following us down alleyways and forcefully groping us. Apparently this is because white women (due to the media) are seen as 'loose' and if you are without a man you aren't anyone's 'property' and so are free game in their eyes. But, as I said it's a great place so either travel with a man or a guide as I have been told they will not touch you if you are accompanied."

One of the major problems is that there is just too much to take in and so much to see you do not actually seen any individual item - it gets lost - but perhaps that is just me.The sellers will hassle you but it is generally all harmless and friendly. You have to haggle to buy and you should not pay more than about 30-40% of the price they first ask for. If you cant get them low enough just politely walk away and they will chase you with a better price. Also try several stalls for the same thing as the prices can vary enormously.I normally hate shopping of any sort but the souks are an experience not to be missed.

And let's be honest, why would you want pics with a monkey in a diaper and skirt and a snake coiled around your neck, showing you off as an ignorant yokel? We did some wonderful shopping, but I feel that was only possible because we had this guide with us. When we were three women by ourselves, we were regarded as fair game, although to be honest we were not touched or threatened in any way. Just cursed at. We quickly moved on, as far as possible, when we accosted birds of prey on display - they had this dead look in their eyes. Any tourist posing next to them is encouraging this cruelty towards animals going on. Maintaining this cultural heritage should not depend on practices like this.A practical warning: It had been raining the night before our second visit and the square was exceptionally dirty.

Of course there's a hassle factor - but it's relatively mild - especially if you adopt a polite and consistent \"I'm just looking\" policy for the first few days. Everything from beautiful leatherware to rugs to beaten and hand cut lampshades - I'm not so keen on the rows of shoes, the junk trinkets and and the cheap end of the fabrics on sale but if you've an eye for genuine craftsmanship and real quality you can find it there. A few things to watch out for - first day there we were very politely invited into a Riad that was a treasure trove of Moroccan antiquities - we still can't quite work out what the place was - We weren't hassled to buy or to pay but we were let out via a different exit to the one we came in by and through a very big carpet warehouse - We were given a very sophisitcated hard sell - asking prices that were well in excess of the kind of money you would pay in Europe, and told we couldn't leave until we bought a rug - don't ever be intimidated by this kind of treatment - be polite and walk away - we've spent a fair bit of time in Morocco back in the 80's and this seemed to be a step back to that era! Another little tip about carpet prices - when we finally did buy - in the big carpet souk on the place des epices we stumbled on a shop that started at \"Moroccan\" prices - all their carpets were actually marked with another price - around 5 or six times higher which was the price they quoted when people arrived with guides - we still knocked to Moroccan prices down a little and ended up with a real bargain - but it's worth knowing that guides may well cost you dear!"

What shops were open had a range of goods from the usual tourist camels, to bags and fabrics and many of the shop owners were prepared to haggle. In general, if you half the price they start with and then rise a little then you will get your goods. Do not be afraid to walk away, and if they really want to sell it they will actually chase after you ! Most of the sellers were friendly, although there were a few who were rude and some can be a bit pushy - just be firm and carry on walking.Good bargains to be had and just a shame there werent more shops open."

If you really do not like this kind of thing then Marrakech is probably not the best destination choice for you. If you want to visit but are a little nervous, it is probably best to hire a guide who knows their way around - we managed to get one by asking the staff at our riad.It can be very off-putting when you just want to browse something on a stall, but if the salesman gets pushy just say a firm no thank you or explain that you are just looking for now. If they keep getting pushy then walk away - I'm sure what they are selling will be at another stall further on. When buying something, make sure you barter a price and if you are still not happy then politely decline and leave. Some may still try and barter with you as you leave - carry on bartering if you want, or just continue to walk away.I personally thought going to the Souk was a good but slightly intense experience - the sights, sounds and smells are a complete attack on the senses and it can be very off-putting when you have so many people trying to get you to buy their goods - but overall I enjoyed my experience.

However, what I did see in company with a guide, who no doubt, took us to anything worth seeing, during our 12 hour tour.?Possibly, I arrived with romantic or exotic visions, from tales of yester year? Anyway, for me it was a great disappointment. The so called famous square, was nothing more than a mish-mash of various stalls, selling items, which in most cases, you wouldn't give house room to. The square, plus the Souk, although bustling,and loud, also had a feel of decay. Buildings were in state of disrepair, pealing paint, crumbling walls. The people sat around the winding lanes of Souk in a state of malaise, or indifference. A few groups of men sat around with couple of snakes lying on ground, exotic? hardly. We also called at Bahia Palace, again just ok for me, the Alhambra Palace in Granada, was way above in class. Taken to a lovely restaurant, which was once a palace, of former prince or whatever. Beautiful place, pity the food didn't compare. Eight people at our table, all of them left meal half eaten.Reading back over this review, I appear to be a right miserable nark, lol I assure you that's not the case, I was just, very very disappointed, with Marrakech. I had come to Morocco, and thought you can't come here and not do Marrakech. Well you can! Passing through Agidir back to ship, I wished I had just stayed and explored this area.Again I realise a day trip may not be best, to give a true review of a place.

They tried to pass off damaged goods to me and when alterations were promised on a garment which I purchased I had to wait in the shop for two hours. All garments were wrapped for me before I arrived to collect my garments, I duly opened the wrapped garments only to found damaged clothing, stained clothing, two items were not wearable as there were damaged beyond repair.

We love getting lost in the souk, and we love shopping there. it's good to read a good guide book about haggling, don't pay a price you wouldn't dream of paying at home, and don't get too mean about it if you're a good haggler - merchants need to make a living. There are some lovely bits of the souk where you can visit the old 'foundouks', also known as 'caravanserai'. They are apartments built around a large open courtyard with verandas, where the travelling tradesmen would stay and sell their wares. Some still have huge weighing scales in them! Things I've been very happy to buy for excellent prices recently include leather messenger bags, rucksacks and briefcases; ornately pierced brass and tin lamps; fabrics in stunning striped colours; pottery; clothes; and paintings by Moroccan artists. You'll get a lot of people trying to entice you into their shops or stalls, and everyone wants to sell to you of course - be good-humoured, have a laugh, and carry on your way if you don't want to go in. Above all, just relax and enjoy it!"

Sure the guide will take you to the places they want you to see and where they'd prefer you spend your money, but you'll see so many interesting things along the way and be hassled a lot less that it doesn't really matter. This place lights up all your senses and is an outstanding experience. Keep your wits about you while walking along though as you can and will encounter all modes of transport from bicycles, donkeys with carts attached to motorbikes travelling long the very narrow lanes of the souk.

Be prepared though- as soon as u ask the price even if u are not sure if u want it- to haggle. We walked away many times and they chased us after and offered us the price we wanted. They are also very helpful in explaining everything to u which is nice. A little warning- we webt back later in the afternoon around 3pm, it was a little busier which was fine- but the sellers all appeared to be grumpier. In the moning most were happy to help and fine if you did not want to buy but by the afternoon the mood had changed- maybe under nore pressure if they were bot having a good days trade.

We wanted to buy a camel hair medium sized carpet. In the souks we saw many people purchase one like what we wanted for a few hundred US dollars (and the prices started even higher).

Maybe once is enough for some, but at least once.My advice:1) Prices are cheaper the deeper you go in the souk;2) Start bargaining around 30% of the first given price;3) Don't start bargaining for anything you don't want to actually buy...4) Shopping is easier during the daytime, but the square in front of the souk is more enjoyable at night, when all of the performers come out;5) At night, a group of food stalls open in the square. There are men that will come and try to encourage you to eat at their stalls. We ended up doing it, and it was pretty good, but I would be happy never doing it again. Just walking through the area you will be bombarded with sales pitches, people will tug on your shirt, and stand in your way to prevent you from moving forward.6) Best advice for turning down an sale of something you don't want: don't say \"no\" (it's rude and not likely to work). Look the vendor in the eye and just say \"shukran\" (thank you). They will understand, and it takes any ill feeling out of the situation."

The souk looked impossible to navigate but we plunged in and were soon having a ball - sure we got lost but it all leads back out to the square. The shopkeepers are constantly trying to entice you into their shops but were always pleasant. A smile and \"maybe later\" was all it took to pass by comfortably. We actually returned to a few of the same shops and bought more. The bargaining was always done with goodwill and ended with \"we're friends\".

Even with the expected 45% haggling room, they were still expensive. We ended up paying 2300 dirham (230 euro) which was about 500 too much. We learnt from this and when we looked a handbag, the price was again, over the top, even as a starting price. We bargained and when we didn't get the value we were prepared to pay, we walked. The proprietor came after us and came down to our price we asked which was a fair price of 210 dirham.

It takes to me 15 seconds and it's very long!My story seems to be funny at first sight but after 2 or 3 hours in souk, I really needed a break because it's a perpetual harrasment. The worst I lived in souk was a guy who jumped on me to put me a headscarf like lawrence of arabia. It's very aggressive but I was in good mood and I just told him I will not buy his scarf.The worst we lived outside the souk was a tannerie visit that end with a \"racket\" tentative of 20 dollars approx. for 5 min. of visit. (We had a guide for 4 dollars for 6 hours of visit dispatchon 2 days) A guy showed us the path to tannerie buy recommandation of an another one. The guide showed us the tannerie and drived us to a very expensive selling point. We didn't bought anything and when we went out of the shop and...surprise!....: we were drove in a small dark street were we met again the first guy who recommend us the second and the guide. They became to be very aggressive but we refused to pay (200 dirham = 20 $) and we were very close to have a really bad fight. I'm quite young (33 years old) and in good shape so they were a little bit beware and I was ready to go if it was necessary.If you are two girls imagine...So to make a summary: never follow anybody if he don't have an \" official guide card\".

You're walking into the souks to shop...and that is how the merchants see it as well.You're not there to eat or sightsee, you're there to check out the merchandise. This does NOT mean you have to buy anything you do not WANT to buy, Don't be pressured. Price compare, go back as many times as you desire before you make a purchase, if you make one at all. If you want to go just to look inside the souks you've heard so much about...go look. Take little money with you if you are the type to be easily swayed. If you see something you like, odds are it will be there another day & you can go back & get it. The merchants start high. Then it's your turn to cut that price in half or less than half. Then you will both meet somewhere in the middle. If it's a price you can live with, buy your beautiful souvenir, if not, there are many many many many MANY other merchants. Enjoy :)"

Lanterns, leather bags, shoes, tagines, teapots, cups, shisha bongs, jewellery etc. You just remember that they can come at a very good price! Don't be afraid to barter with them, they are expecting it. And don't be afraid to walk away either as there will be many more people selling the same! Watch your bags in the busy areas, i had my bag stolen by a child when it suddenly became very crowded! If you look lost for a second, someone will come over to 'help' you. They may do but at a price. They will also try to take you round the shops for commission so don't follow them. Be firm and tell them 'no thank you' or 'we know where we're going'. The people are friendly but its all driven by money so be aware. Otherwise have a lovely time shopping and haggling!"

There are excellent guide books with routes (Frommers and Top10) for the Marrakech souks but they never prepare you for the colours, smells and sounds. Prepare to be lost - there are few signs but as long as keep the view of the main mosque (Koutoubia) in your sights when in a clearing then you can find your way back to the main square. If you find you need a direction to the square ask someone working in a stall which way. Don't accept to be taken there and don't ask anyone walking around or you'll be whisked away to another souk area they are linked to.You have to stand your ground on saying no, thank you in French or Arabic but the stalls will have a ready banter. Walking away is the simplest bet - they will not leave their stalls. The rule is as soon as you touch one of their products or observe their stall then they have you hooked. So you either want something and can haggle a deal or don't want to buy ( say 'no shopping today') . If he (they're all men) invite you into his lair - whether a carpet, some spices, woodwork or jewellery - and offers you mint or herbal tea then generally it is customary/polite to accept. We've used excuse of tummy upsets to refuse.Keep your money hidden away at all times and always be prepared to walk off. If you want to haggle we always assume 30% of their starting price and work up to 50%. But this depends on the seller's day and the buyer's need. Remember there are plenty of other sellers around touting the same wares and they know this, so shop around first.There are a good few cafes around the souks (eg Terrasse des Epices) for a break. Take advantage as by returning to the main square exposes you to a different hassle. The square has many cafes - try to sit upstairs to avoid the shoe-shiners, beggars, tissue sellers etc.We would recommend you work in two's or more as it is easier for your friend or partner to pull you out."

We had an official guide to show us round, who was very good, although clearly took us to the shop he wanted us to go to (we had expected this and actually were not disappointed with it!).I would not want to put anyone off going to Marrakech as I think it is an amazing place (and we stayed at Tikkida Gardens which was a fantastic hotel with very kind, funny and attentive staff throughout the hotel). However I would like to give a warning to other women. We were 5 minutes away from our taxi when a motorcycle drove at me at speed and the driver either wrenched (or cut?) my handbag from my neck. This was done with considerable force (my back is still giving me problems a week later!) but thankfully the strap broke as the incident could have been far worse!! Also thankfully, there was not much of value in my bag! I had my bag across me (as advised) and of couse this could happen anywhere. But the nature of the souks make this so much more likely. SO ladies please be on your guard. I would advise going out in an organised trip, don't take a handbag and possibly not an expensive camera (mine was not taken but had I not had a handbag, could have been!).Otherwise, enjoy this amazing city and I hope you have more luck than I did!"

Market venders are very pushy and will try and sell all of their products to you, at first this is quite difficult to deal with as this was not something i was used to. We got caught out a couple of times when trying to leave and someone would show us the way for \"free\" (\"no charge no charge!\") and then we would be taken on a rather long walk to many different traders and when shown out of the Souks we were asked for \"a small present\" or \"something for me\". This is difficult to avoid due to language barrier and easily getting lost within the labrynth of the souks. Generally the best thing to do is not make eye contact or reply \"non merci\" firmly as we were led on a merry dance a couple of times! However in saying this some of the people are very lovely and not out to con you, The products in the souks are lovely and reasonably priced, you can get a nice leather bag for under \u00a320.00 as well as scarves, jewellery, pottery and metal work. My advice would be to go to the Souks during the day for first trip as it is not as busy and get use to the feel of it and bartering. My understanding was ask the initial price and then offer half and generally go up 10 or 20 from there. But if you feel confident haggle a little more."

These tips may help: (1) Best not to ask the price of anything you don't actually want (2) Think of the least you could get this item for at home and then halve it and use this as your maximum. (3) Never go beyond your maximum: walk away if you have to; they'll relent eventually (4) Don't look or get cross (5) If you pay over the odds (as I did often) just remember it's a 3rd world country, you're probably not breaking the bank and you're making their day. Finally, if you can find a local to tell you the value of something, say a leather bag, you're in a very strong position."

The shop owners were somewhat pushy, but not too bad, we just ignored them if we were not interested, and that usually worked. I was not good at haggling, and obviously got ripped off, as I found the same items at the fixed price shop at a lower price than what I ended up paying in the souk. So, I suggest that you try to get the price down to 30-40% of what they are initially offering.We visited the souk both of the days we stayed in Marrakech, though we did most if our shopping in the fixed price shop Centre Artisinal. The souk is great for people watching, seeing the locals go about with their business and also there are some great photo opportunities."

There is no way to navigate your way around them so if you see something you like and pass it by you might never find it again!!!The souks are so much more than what is close to the market place. The closer you get to the Museum of Marrakech, the more likely you are to find the artisan souks that don't sell but you can watch them work. Closer to the market place you get the mass produced rubbish but you will find some gems but prices can be cheap.Whilst walking around you will be shouted at, summoned and invited in. On day three of our stay we did a guided walking tour around the medina and were told by our guide to ignore the shouts and not even acknowledge them with a \"No thank you.\" It's hard but the sooner you learn to zone it all out the more pleasurable the visit will be. First thing in the morning and towards the end of the day are the best times to venture further in as the souks aren't so busy. Around 4pm though and throughout the weekend the souks were horrendously busy, especially closer to Jemaa el Fna (the main square) as all the out of towners come to stock up.It is exhausting but a spot of haggling is a must."

We went to the Souk on our first day in Marrakech and although it was meant to take only 5 minutes from our Riad to the Souk, we got terribly lost and it took us two hours to get there. There were so many alleyways, and paths that its very easy to get lost. There are alot of touts working the street who will claim to take you to various places and try and get money off you for taking you. The common line is that this area is closed, etc. We should have read the reviews more carefully before we went. We made the mistake of following a guy to the Tanneries where we were made to pay 100dh and taken to 1 leather shop which was way more expensive than shopping in the Souk. If asking for directions, make sure you only ask the shopkeepers as they will try and help you without asking for money. Unfortunately, without any real proper street names in the alleyways, they also frequently get confused. We were constantly being pointed down one direction and the next person would point us back in the opposite direction. Before you enter the souk, make sure that you can retrace your steps going in and out from the square. In the evenings, there are tents set up for food stalls. However, make sure that you give only the exact change for the food or they will take your money and refuse to give you back any change claiming its 'tips'. We found the food in the cafes/restaurants around the souk better for the equivalent price and the service to be better. But if you just want the experience of eating at the stalls, its still worth it. We finally got the hang of getting around in the Souks and how to handle the street touts and started to enjoy it more. Forewarned is forearmed and if you know what to expect, then it will be much more enjoyable. The souk is quite an amazing sight to see at night and its worth going to have a look just to see the bustle and the liveliness of marrakech."

It's a complete assault on all your senses. I have never been anywhere with just so much going in in every direction or so much colour than here; the drums, people shouting, and mopeds buzzing around never cease; the smell of bbq's, spices and the tanneries (horrible!); the fresh orange juice is the freshest ever and the street food is the best I've tasted; and the feeling of the whole place is amazing. BUT and there's always a but - everything comes at a price and that price depends on just how gullibe, stupid, charmed or wealthy you appear. Unfortunately armed with an expensive camera to capture every moment I quallified for all of the above. The locals can read you like a book and will charge for their services accordingly whether you asked for them or not. I was hassled by a friendly local, whom I recognised about 30 seconds into our improptu conversation as \"a guide\", for 300dh for taking me to the tanneries (not that I ever wanted to go in the first place) and a further 200dh for a 10 min tour of said tanneries by someone else I was handed over to - you just get sucked in. I got away with half but they weren't happy - nor was I to be honest as i felt quite intimidated. So beware as people appear genuinely very friendly when they smell money, of any quantity. Sadly, as a lone traveller, with expensive camera in hand I was a sitting duck. Would I go back? Well yes I did about four hours later, when I parted with just 6dh on things I actually wanted. \"Once bitten twice shy\" or \"A fool and his money are soon parted\" - your choice!"

If the shopkeeper refuses then say no and start to walk away. They will try and make you feel guilty, but this is part of the game. Remember - they wouldn't sell it to you if it was under cost so don't believe that line!3. Don't stress out about getting 'ripped off'. Decide how much the item is worth to you. If you get it for that price or below, who cares what others pay?!4. Say no. If you aren't interested, say no (and only the word 'no') firmly. Walk away and refuse to make eye contact. They will leave you alone.5. If you are a woman alone, wear a ring and mention in conversation that you are married. This carries a lot of weight in Marrakech - I was travelling with a girlfriend and it was amazing how fast shopkeepers back off when you casually say 'my husband wouldn't approve of that!'"

After very primitive camping and hiking for a week in the High Atlas Mountains, I was ready for a little touristy type of area. I little cafes were cute and the area was clearly for the tourist to enjoy. I love seeing individual, thriving buisnesses like this in a world full of Wal-Marts. I would advise US citizens this really is a place to feel safe in. There are cameras everywhere and there is a secret police force assigned to ensure tourist are not harrassed or robbed. (Our guide told us that the king has reserved the severest punishments for those who bother tourists in this manner.) I would have felt safe as an individual without a tag-alone. It was fun to try haggeling with the vendors. The food was simple and good. Beware though that resturant owners will harrass you to get you to their resturant and you will also be, \"funneled\" by the locals to the tanneries. Also, don't ask for directions from the local children, they will try to fleece you for alot of money and not put you in the right direction. I was concerned with safety due to the uprisings in the countries surrounding this area but it became very clear to me that the people or the government want NO part of it. The city is progressive and becomming very modern. The changes toward moderinism is very embraced by the people who seem quite laid back. Do go if you have the chance!"

You will need to haggle but this can be very rewarding - our son acquired Beat headphones for just \u00a310! The initial price will be very high so stay tough. There is so much to see that time just flies but in the end tiredness creeps in and it is best to retuern another day. The back streets of the medina can feel intimidating and poverty abounds.

Firstly, before you visit the Souk - BE PREPARED - The Souk WILL be scary; WILL be intimidating; WILL be annoying; WILL be an amazing experience - A few things to know: you will be fooled, tricked and your day won't go to plan, but if you retain your sense of humour and keep a smile on your face, you'll have a fantastic time.On entering the Souk, usually via the street (Derb Dabach) at the north of the main square (Jamaa El Fna) you'll be approached numerous times by boys and men telling you the souks are rubbish/ closed/ 'down another street etc etc) - IT's ALL UNTRUE - Ignore them or just smile and go where you want to. TIP: don't let anyone drag you off or lead you anywhere - just go where you want to. They'll even tell you streets are 'forbidden', just smile and ignore them. They just want you to go where they get paid to take you - The Tanneries, The leather Market, a shop etc . . . . Once you get used to it it's fun, go in shops, ask how much things are, talk to the shop owners, they really are funny people and real characters. And don't be afraid to say no, if it's too much, just walk away and you'll find it in another shop. There are 2 ways of approach buying things, 1) decide what you want to pay and stick to it - 2) offer a quarter of the asking price and stick to it, or a third if you really want it. Tell then you're British and you don't barter, take it or leave it - THEY'LL TAKE IT. With all that said, it is easy to get angry, especially at the end of the day, or when you get a particularly aggressive seller. I did. We got an aggressive seller and I actually lost my 'rag', so make sure you walk away or your partner takes over (like my wonderful wife did), that way you still get what you want and you don't feel so bad afterwards. As I say, keep smiling and have fun. learn from my mistake."

When it comes to price, you know it's hard here, he started at 1000Dirams (they seem to always start here), we started at 200. Met at 300, but hold your ground when you've reached a place you will not pay more for. They enjoy the game and you must too. I wanted to get a few more things like a tea-set and was taken by Mohammed to the far end of the souk (the walk on the way was amazing, it was a maze) to his cousin and we looked at some good quality teapots, trays and glasses.

These are just like you imagine from the movies - dark, narrow alleys full of exotic stuff on sale hanging in vast amounts outside mysterious interiors. In every case a shopkeeper will be sitting outside shouting at every passer-by that he has just what they are looking for and why not stop and come in. This does tend after many hours and days start to wear you down and you end up not browsing at all which is a shame. But you will go back again and again because the sights, sounds and smells are quite addictive and like nothing you have seen before."

Basically, the huge network of souks next to Jemma el Fna is an absolute must to visit, but to make it a worthwhile visit rather than a negative experience you need to keep your wits about you and not be too trusting if some helpful salesman tries to guide you to another stall where he reassures you that he has exactly what you are looking for. These salesmen, plus almost every other Morrocan that you might ask directions from, are motivated solely by the commission that is on offer if they introduce new customers to stalls/shops rather than by a desire to help a needy tourist! Other advice is never pay the asking price. They massively inflate their prices and love those Brits and other tourists who are simply too polite to barter! My advice is to go in with an offer of at least half of their price. If they let you walk out of the shop, then you know that you've beaten them down too low. A good tactic is to say that you've been offered something similar at another stall at a much lower price. The souks can be quite unpleasant as there seems to be no highway code in Marrakech about motorbikes driving quite speedily down the cobbled paths of the souks and it the polluted air inside the souks is very unpleasant and oppressive. Further details on my review under Jemma el Fna (same title). Enjoy but don't be too trusting!"

We went to the Ensemble Artisanal in the Kasbah first, which is a government run fixed price shop - this gave us a good idea of what would be fair prices for things. If you like things then ask a price, but once you engage in the haggling you won't get away without buying it!! We found that most prices settled on were about half of the original asking price. We were not hassled in the souks, (we had far worse in India!) the stall holders do engage you in conversation they want you to look at their stalls, but if you aren't intersted a simple no thanks, or Non Merci, or Laa Shokran did the trick. Only a few people tried to drape you in clothes, and put things in your hands; most stall holders seem to have realised that hassling potential customers just puts them off looking, and if they don't look they won't buy! - Many stalls just let you wander in and have a good look around, and wait for you to ask them before the fun starts! Whilst in the Souks, check out the spice souk and have a drink at Cafe de epices, seek out the dyers souk, and listen to the talk about the different dyes used, find the souk des ferroniers... Great bargains - Babouches, spices, olives, preserved lemons, Brassware and Silver. Not as cheap but great Quality,- one of the many Morrocan Lanterns; you can get cheap, but if you want a good one, then expect to pay.  Although the souks had a great choice, we'd also recommend checking out Place de Ferblantiers in the Medina for lanterns, as that is the metalworker square and they have some dfferent styles to the ones in the souks."

But people come especially for the colorful and lively souks, unquestionably the richest ones, the most diverse, the most fascinating. A thousand little crafts thrive side by side in an astonishing atmosphere. Tourism, so often criticized, has greatly favored the rediscovery of handicraft. Marrakech is also a fascinating architectural ensemble, increasingly safeguarded in the Medina, with its superb Mosques and remarkable palaces that cast a spell on the traveler with their unforgettable charm. Marrakech is also the door to South Morocco. Its atmosphere, colors and climate remind you that the desert isn't far. Nonetheless, it has a flourishing vegetation; in fact, the public parks, the gardens and fruit trees planted along the main arteries have always been perceived by the Moroccans as a challenge to drought.This imperial city appears as a gem set in the natural landscape of the surrounding High Atlas mountains."

Avoid the men with monkeys at all costs, they put the monkey on your arm and then wont take it off until you pay them silly money, always always agree a price first for everything, the women doing henna will try and draw on you without you consenting and then you again will have to pay silly money for it, one had me in a vice grip trying to draw on my hand and i hadn't said i wanted anything! The stuff in the market varies, some stalls have good quality stuff and others dont, but always bargin! Its the whole fun of the place! If you can, avoid taxis at all costs, once you are in they try and take you to their uncle or friends store instead of where you want to go, and if you refuse (like we did) they take you and drop you in the middle of nowhere! not very helpful or friendly! Also dont stray too far, always know your way back to the main square when you go exploring the square, we got lost for a good 45 mins as it was getting dark and i have to say it was the most intimidated i have ever felt! All in all its mad, they treat there animals awfully (you will see horridly skinny horses and donkeys and was disappointed to say some tourists paid for carriage rides which only makes it worse and means they continue to make the horses work to death in the awful heat), they try and scam you and rip you off at every turn but its not something i would have missed, honestly really like another world but so glad i saw it ... and then got back to the safety of the hotel pool where i stayed for the remainder of the holiday! lol! If you are a little apprehensive I would suggest going to one of the cafes on the side of the market that are on top of the buildings, that way you can sit with a drink and watch the madness unfold below, its really amazing to look down on the market square as it goes from day to night, and you feel a little safer not being in among the mayhem!"

Personally after reading reviews and having been to various other African countries such as Kenya and having explored Eygpt where we were harrassed and hassled constantly I was concerned about this experience. However it was so much friendly than any other holiday I have been on. Yes it is a very busy place and people do approach you to look in their souks, a simple smile or no thank you and they leave you alone! They were such lovely people and we even got lost twice and they helped us find our way back to the main square. Be prepared for hussle, however no-one hassled us if we said no and we were able to explore at our leisure. Of course it is very hectic and we visited mainly in the day when it was less busy. We had great fun bartering as they expect you to do and got some amazing bargins, just start to walk off and then they drop the price. As long as you are aware that there will be people approaching you, but no where near to the extend we were expecting you will have a lovely experience. Even if you just pop in to have a look at get a taste for the city its well worth it!"

At times it can be very busy with scooters racing past and the occassional donkey and cart, in what are narrow walkways and, on our last day, a small van was edging its way through the crowds which left little space - enough for people to pass in single file. Having said that there are areas that are really also very quiet. You get calls from young men asking if you are looking for the square, do you want to see the 'dyers area' etc etc and stall holders asking you to see their wares. The only hands on people were those delling scarves,.All in all a great experience, even the bartering (once you get the hang of it) is great fun,"

Lanterns, leather everything, ceramic everything, arabic bowls, spices, potions, perfumes, cooking utensils, tea sets, linen, clothes, did I say lanterns? The best part of it all is the bartering. Go in with an easy going nature, smile, joke and you will \"think\" you get a bargain. I drive a hard bargain, however when you haggling over a dollar, I tend to back down. I saw some tourists get a bit upset with the vendors, its all about attitude - if your guarded, they will be. They love to chat and and at one souk I was there for over an hour to buy a bedspread and some cushions he offered 10,000 camels if i would stay with him. What would i do with 10,000 camels? The souks are open all day but I found them best at dusk. They are busy, noisy and lots of fun. If you are a shopper you will spend hours here. If not, visit to experience the bartering. Relax and enjoy it. Take some of your local money, especially gold coins - they love it!"

I had read reviews on here and was very excited to visit it as everyone made it sound so beautiful, amazing and a crazy experience. So when i visited it the first time i was... (the only word i can use is)....... TERRIFIED. When we stepped off the bus, fake guides followed us until we told them firmly 'no thanks' which was scary.... i wanted to avoid seeing the snakes and the monkeys because I think it is cruel so we headed in the other direction to the souks. The souks were an experience as every turn you made it was another souk.... shoes.... spices..... jewellery.... so much stuff. There are cars and motorbikes zooming along side you which was daunting also. I had been warned about the henna ladies and at one point seen one aprroaching us and we ran away. Also, one of the guys with a monkey on his shoulder came up behind us and i ran away as i did not want the image of a monkey in chains in my head. i left the market thinking OH.... MY.... GOD.... Mental !! we decided to return to the market the following week and im so glad we did as we got to experience the real marrakech. We bought some amazing fake converse, jewellery and a football top. Many of the shop keepers are very friendly. Some called me lady gaga and said they loved my pale white skin. We also got chatting to a guy in an orange juice stand and he asked us to come into his stall and take a picture with him. We would have loved to have sat on a cafe and watched the world go by. All you have to remember is if you want someone to leave you alone tell them NO THANKS.... easy. they will walk away. it is honestly such an amazing experience.... its so busy and there are definately alot of smells to take in.... including spices, donkeys, horses, and sewage. Do not pass on the opportunity to visit the jemaa el fna market. I loved it the 2nd time and aslong as you get involved you will enjoy it too."

We spent 4 nights in Marrakech and had planned this 8 months in advance and done loads of research and watched many a travel programme on Marrakech.We love markets and eating the local cuisine and Travel programmes spoke so highly of the wonderful foods and markets. We polished up on our bargaining skills and approached Marrakech with an open mind.After our trip we sat down and discussed where we had been and our opinions on our trip.OverAll Experience: Was it a circus or side show?Food: Very dissapointed - not enough spices/flavour. Found the food to be very stoggy!Markets: Rip Off of the highest degree, one can only bargain so far.People: Staff at Riad were fantastic. On the street - rude and appears that the tourists are only there for their money. I was shouted at for taking a photo of the carpets in Medina!? Hands are held out for a smile? I believe that tourists should be treated with some respect as they do boost the economy and do create jobs.Transport: Be careful, a local lady shared a taxi with us and paid 4 dinah for her trip and we paid 40 for an extra kilometer?? I certainly will not forget the experience but for all the wrong reasons. Marrakech is overrated and not a place I would return to.Travel is a huge part of our lives and we have visited many cities around the world."

If your not interested in something or someone is bothering you say 'no' or 'la' (arabic for 'no') but be polite and confident, if they continue say 'no' with more force then move on. It may seem impolite but if you are firm and then ignore them they go away (it's what the locals do). Make minimal eye contact. Don't get into bartering for something unless you actually want the item. You can be there a very long time (they will make mint tea). Decide how much you are willing to pay for it then start at 1/3 of the price - it will go up. If you like it buy it - prices are cheaper than in the UK and considerably so if you barter well and the Souks are a maze you will not be able to find your way back to the same stall! Start at the Ensemble Artisanal to get an idea of the prices at the higher end it will help you when you're looking for bargains. Relax, but be confident, watch where you're going there are bikes and scooters everywhere. Don't keep all your money in the same wallet. Enjoy the experience. If it gets to much make your way back to the main square for a break (but try not to ask for directions from the locals) ask other tourists which way they came in."

I wish the salesmen would understand that hounding tourists to come into their shop actually makes tourists not want to go in there. They need to know: I want to buy something because I like what you are selling, Mr. Salesman, not because you pressured me to buy something. Friendliness and the chance to browse at my leisure will increase the chances that I will buy something, not telling me I must come in for two minutes and that looking is free, then giving me a dirty look when I don't buy anything. That said, take your time and look around at the things you want to buy. Quality varies, as do prices, so buy what ou think is well-made and is a fair price. Bargaining is expected there, so expect to pay at least 30% less than what they first quoted you. If you don't like the price you are quoted, walk away. Chances are you'll see the same item at another shop within five minutes. Have fun, and ship your purchases home from the post office in Djemaa el Fna if they don't fit in your suitcase."

From luxury goods and antiques to humble babouches. It is mainly covered, so the heat of the day can not tamper much with your desire of finding something beautiful to bring home as a memento of this magic city.I found that the vendors were not as pushy as in other places I have been, which indeed made a difference when trying just to look around.Once you have found a piece of your liking (in my case a carpet) the barging time starts and just then, they could become overbearing. Nevertheless, the experience is great and they always try to meet your expectations. Do not worry if you dont speak Arab or French, most vendors manage English, Spanish, Italian and even German!Visiting the Souks is always a nice way to enjoy the cultural heritage of each place. It shows the colors, the aromas, customs and traditions of every nation and makes you realize how wonderfully diverse we are.And yes, the beautiful kilim rug we fell in love with decorates now my living room ;)"

Laugh off their original price and offer extremely low then you can meet somewhere near the bottom/middle. They will quote tourists a much higher price than locals. Have a walk around to get a feel of what's available before buying. And I wouldn't ask for prices unless you actually want something because they will hassle you."

The Souk is a myriad of shops where you can spend hours. We Took a drink on a rooftop cafe overlooking the market square which was nice as we could watch the hustle & bustle from a safe distance . We decided to take a horse drawn carriage back to the hotel - a disaster as the driver was a maniac going too fast and whipping the horses, we paid after 500m and walked back to the hotel, real shame as it upset the children and carriages oseemed to be going a more pedestrian speed"

Wanted to buy a rug, but so many shops and unsure who we could trust among all the alleys of shops & salesmen. Our Riad owner recommended Mohammed at Aux Douria in the Souk des Tapis. 30 secs from the place des epices. After pouring us mint tea and offering the kids Coca Cola we went through his massive selection of wonderful authentic carpets - each laid out in front of us for a family preference/decision.Patient, friendly, good English...and not pushy. When the call to prayer came at 3pm he even left us with his assistant for 10 mins. Clearly some things were more important than a sale to him!When it came to bargaining we reached a good natured deal which left both him and us very happy - and I am not easy to bargain with!If you are looking for a quality carpet, rug, cushion, jilaba (Arab cloak) this is a man it is nice to do business with! Our week in Marrakech included hot air balloon, quad biking, trip to the mountains - but buying a rug from Mohammed was the standout highlight for me!"

We stayed at the Riu Tikada Dunas hotel in Agadir and as one of the excursions offered by First Choice we decided to book the Marrakech Royale excursion (about 750 Dirhams each). We were met at 7.00am at the hotel by the coach and introduced to our driver for the journey and to our guide Idris. The coach journey took approximately 3 1/2 hours (with a short 20 minute comfort break at a service station) and we arrived in Marrakech. The coach journey itself was fantastic, travelling through the Atlas Mountains and seeing some fabulous sights. On arrival in Marrakech we meet up with our local guide Jamal (both our guides were exceptionally polite and very very knowledgeable indeed). We were taken to the Bahia palace which was fascinating, the architecture was unbelievable and we spent about 1 hour there on a tour with our guide. We were then taken down the narrow back streets (we did wonder where we were being taken at one point!!) and into the most beautiful open restaurant on the top of a building with fantastic views of the Atlas Mountains. We were seated under a tented area with lovely furnishings and served a very tasty meal (plenty for everyone) please note that while your meals throughout the day are included in the price your drinks are not and i guess they are quite reasonably priced depending on what you have - coca cola about 20 Dirhams. From the meal we were taken to the Souk and spent about an hour being taken through the narrow back streets where the stalls are set up and the goods are being made. This was the most fantastic experience and it is something we will never ever forgot. The workmanship from these people is incredible. Our favourite area was the blacksmiths (the souk is divided into different areas - blacksmiths/fabrics/spices/wood turning/leather and the items for sale were unbelievable - the most unique and fantastic ornaments being produced from a single bolt!!!!! Unbelieveable. We were very glad we had our guides as we would have never have found our way out of the souk - it is an absolute maze with no signposts or anything and once you are in there YOU ARE IN THERE!!!! Once we had finished our whistle stop tour of the souk we were taken back to the square Jemaa el-fna which was filled with stalls and shops. The traffic has no rhyme or reason to it - with people, motorcycle, scooters, cars, taxis and horse drawn carriages coming at you from every angle. We had about 1 /2 hours to look round the square and at first it is quite intimidating with people trying to sell you things the second you stop to look at something (but that is what they are there for!!!). We went for a soft drink on one of the rooftop cafes in order to look down on the square - what a sight. We then met up with our guide again who once again led us through the backstreets of the souk to the most remarkable restaurant hidden in the depths of the souk - fantastic food, fantastic decor and Moroccan entertainment. Once finished the meal we were taken back to the square and this had changed beyond belief. Full restaurants had sprung up out of nowhere and the sights, sounds and smells is something that will stop with us forever. This trip organised by First Choice is fantastic value for money without a doubt and we would most definately do this again (apart from the public toilets in the square!!!!)What a place!!!!!"

In parts, they were a bit smelly, and they are crowded and there is a constant stream of scooters and horses and carts moving by , but that is surely what a visit to Marrakech is all about. There were also a lot of cats - I was a bit concerned until I realised that the cats seem to be tolerated, and while they are dirty, they seem to be fairly well fed. There are as many stalls selling stuff from China as there were selling genuine Morroccan goods. The stallholders do hassle if they see you looking, but mainly, they are charming and good natured, although they all have a tendency to grab your arm to keep you at their staff, which is a bit off putting. We found that walking away got us a better price than trying to bargain them down and sometimes we bought something we had been ambivalent about just because the price they were offering was so low!We did the one thing they advise against and walked with a (non registered) \"guide\" (a young man), away from the touristy part towards what we were told was a leather market ('only today - you get cheap leather') In hindsight, pretty stupid and as we were being taken through the maze of streets and back alleys, I was wondering if we would ever find our way out. We ended up in a place where we were given a quick lesson in how they dye leather, what plants etc they use, shown shoes, pouffes and carpets and ended up buying both shoes and a silk carpet - bargains and lovely quality (We never did find the market) Although we had to pay two boys to take us back (they seem to have their own territories and will only guide you within those - so if you want to get right back to the square, it means a couple of helpers!) it was an experience - we saw where the artisans live and work, saw kids playing in the streets and experienced a bit of Marrakech which I am sure most tourists don't see. And it only cost us about 5 dirhams each to get in and out of the central souks!If you stick to the main souks, round the square you can always find your way out again and there is enough there to satisfy most shopping needs. Overall a wonderful shopping experience and the best part of any holiday to Marrakech"

We felt they meant it as well. At no stage did we feel threatened, only welcomed. You do have to get into haggling, but this is part of the fun.Start at 40% of their initial price and you won't be far out. Don't be afraid to walk out, they will lower their price to keep you there!

Before I went, I'd heard all sorts of scare stories about how everyone tries to hard-sell, and you can't walk away without being forced to buy, etc etc.It's all nonsense!The Souk is a rambling maze of tiny winding streets and covered walkways, with some glimpses of fascinating architecture behind the stalls and down alleys.They are lined with seemingly never-ending stalls selling the expected range of goods (spices by the tonne, lamps, shades, wooden boxes of all descriptions, bags, clothes, shoes, carpets and more), with dozens of stalls all selling the same things, so there is plenty of choice and competition.Yes, if they see you looking at their wares then the stall holders will try to engage you and entice you to come and browse, and then try to sell you anything they can, but that's their livelihood for heaven's sake! And there is no obligation to buy. Ever. A firm but polite \"no\" (or maybe a few) and they will leave you alone when they realise you won't buy, all with no hard feelings (for they know very well that someone not buying today may well be in the mood to buy next time).Sure, they will try to entice you, even pleading with you to follow or good bargains, but if you don't want to go, don't go, and that's an end of the matter.Be prepared to haggle and haggle strongly, and you can get some great bargains - yes their initial price will be really high, it's the market culture to start high and haggle to an agreeable price. Respect the culture, go with the flow, and you'll be fine. And if you can't agree a price, just leave; they will either follow you and negotiate, or else leave you to go somewhere else. No problem either way.One thing to be aware of though is that the Souk is VERY windy and is like a labyrinth which means it is easy to get lost if you enter too deeply. No major problem, there are always people eager to guide you back out again - for a price (which is never mentioned up-front, and will always be more than you offer! Again, be firm when you've offered a good price).Watch for people walking along-side you and pointing things out - they expect to be paid as an unofficial \"tour guide\", but a firm indication you are not interested at the start is all you need.So all in all, just keep your wits about you (sage advise anywhere in the world), keep a note of your route, and enjoy the experience."

I recall after my first day, having started cold and alone, back in my hotel room feeling defeated by the beggars, hustlers, obnoxious kids, and all the sound and fury that is Morocco. I got myself up and went back into the fray. I had come from the US and had to buy to be a success. Over the next weeks and years I learned much about how to take it, make it, feel, and express myself and deeply enjoy my time in the soulks.1. it ain't easy. No one is immune unless you have a guide of some sort (more about this later) and even then: you are fair game. People have been passing through Marrakech for thousands of years and \"I'll come back.\" means nothing. They want you to buy and they have 100 tricks to induce you.2. hire a guide. They'll get a commission on what you buy. But he'll keep the hordes off you. Think about paying him just to guide: you will not buy. Then go back. I hired a guy for very little and found him to be friendly, helpful, and instructive.3. forget the 1/3 rule! I started bargaining on a tea silver set and it ended up going from 2000.00 US to 35.00 US! Spend time everywhere asking \"what's your best price?\" Say \"Shokran\" and you'll start to figure out at least the ball park.4. sometimes the price is the price. Many sellers know that Americans don't like bargaining and they'll give you the actual price. It happens. 5. Keep in mind they have a simple philosophy \"Why should a rich man pay the same as a poor woman?\" Makes sense to me. 6. Drink the fresh OJ: it was heaven and I still fondly recall visiting with my favorite OJ squeezer.7. tips are expected if you photo acts in the square. Have a pocket full of dirhams.8. They give money to beggars as normal for people with money in their pockets. You should too. A dirham buys a meal for a beggar. 9. If someone treats you disrespectfully RAISE your voice, if they raise theirs, RAISE yours again. But don't take it seriously: verbal combat is the national sport. 10. they will always win. After many visits I found that I could never win 100%. They always found a way to over charge me, screw up something, etc. etc. Be prepared. 11. drink it up/ eat it up. Marrakech soulks are one of the most intense public experiences on the planet. 12. watch your pockets and purses 13. I carried a compass and navigated by myself through the winding convoluted alleys and always came out fine. It's big but it's not the Sahara. 14. Marrakech prepares you for anything in Morocco.15. Essouira for some reason was the absolute opposite: very straight forward and business like. 16. you came here for the experience: enjoy. You will always remember Marrakech"

To me, it's better to just give in and wander around without worrying about where exactly you are and how to get to anywhere else in particular. Discovering all the cool things there are to buy there is lots of fun. Unexpectedly coming upon something you were looking for but never thought you'd find feels like a major triumph.The endless negotiating is tricky and takes a bit of patience and a sense of humor. These people will not take no for an answer. Whatever they have, whatever they are selling, they cannot believe that you don't really need one. It was fun playing the game of appearing uninterested even when we were interested.There were two occasions when we needed to get somewhere in particular, and needed to pass through the Medina to get to those places. Honestly, I don't know how we did it, but we did. I had to keep my girlfriend from paying too much attention to what was around us. It's hard not be distracted, not to get pulled in, with all the cool things there are - rugs and everything else. But for pure shopping, other than the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, I have never had such a great experience."

They saw a woman who was obviously a tourist and started pretty high, but I got everything down to a price I was willing to pay, (which I'm sure was still more than the items were actually worth), and I think we all came away happy. Just know that if somebody offers to show you a shop, they will expect a tip. We discovered that they will also take you into the deepest reaches of the souks and then want another tip to lead you back out. If you have the time, just find your own way out, that's what we did. The souks are a rabbit warren of streets. Most of them are divided up into categories, so you'll go through the silver section, the shoe section, the chicken section, etc. It's fun to get lost in there.It was wonderful seeing a culture so very different from ours.

You will, of course get lost and being guided back to the 'Big Square' is going to set you back a few coins, although the negotiation will start at around 100 dirham - tossers.This is the centre of shafting.

Hassan of UndertheMoroccanSun tours booked Jo and me deep in the Marrakech medina at the riad Marana. We followed our baggage porter down the street from the outskirts of the medina into the very large open plaza, several square blocks. Crossing the plaza we encountered orange and nut sellers with their carts. We could see the souks radiating out from the plaza.Our riad was on a very small street, 5-6 feet wide that was entered through part of the souks. Souks are shops in the medina. Shopkeepers constantly tried to sell us everything from clothes; to tourist junk; to handicrafts and antiques. We were initially overwhelmed, but quickly found our way around.We ventured through all of the souks scouring for trinkets for our grandchildren and a signature piece for our home. If you make an offer do not expect to walk away easily. The shop keeper will follow you trying to close the sale. We found that most items could be bought for about 20% - 25% of the shopkeeper\u2019s initial price. Be strong and haggle, haggle, haggle.As we shopped over three days we were in and around the plaza. At times it was crowded with masses of people shopping for their daily needs. Entertainers asked for small payments for their shows; snake charmers would place a small snake around your neck and take your picture. (This was definitely not for Jolene.) I bravely sat down with a viper and a king cobra for bragging rights when I returned home. There seems little reason to travel all the way to Marrakech and then miss haggling in the souks. Allow a couple of hours and a couple of days if possible. Have Fun.Dave & Jo"

We marvelled at a chap making amazing wood turning items with his big toe, haggled long and hard for leather slippers, and bought delicious fresh bread rolls for one dirham each (about 10p) and walked along eating them. Traders will call out to you and try to dodge you into their shop but it's all very good humoured and if you simply say no thank you and walk on it'll be fine. My husband had his arm grabbed by a stallholder once or twice but the (male) stallholders would not touch a woman shopper. It's easier to leave the blokes at home to be honest and shop til you drop.

Make sure to try their NOUGAT!!! The white one especially. The night life of the market is beyond amazing.Con- as many traveller comment- haggling is just almost the point of awkwardness and uncomfortable. Not just that, but the persistent pressures of buying. Dare you make the mistake of forget window shopping, but even glance a look at a merchandise in the store will the store workers start calling you over in every way possible. If you can get use to it, get by it, ignore, dont make eye contact and ALWAYS start with at least 50% off the asking price you'll find some amazing treasures."

However, some of the carpet sellers, antique and artifact sellers are in some pretty amazing riads so take a look and have them display their wares but again let them know you are not buying today. Get their card if you wish to revisit. Afterwards you can just get lost in the souk, we always found our way out. Try entering them from different spots off the square. The shops tend to get a bit repetitive evetually. Try a walk down to Bouchaib, the fixed price super store south of the square on Rue de la Kasbah to get an idea of prices before buying."

We visited at the end of October 2011 as I was enticed by the idea of the oriental souks and hoping to find a few nice bits for the house. The whole experience has left me never wanting to visit such a place again. Firstly you cannot relax even for a minute as you are constantly worrying that you may be hit by a passing motorcycle whizzing down the pedestrian areas. You can see cruelty to animals as the people there have no soul, also they are the rudest most obtuse race I have ever had the misfortune to come across. You cannot look at their stalks without being hounded and if you 'dare not buy' any of their tat you must be ready to receive verbal abuse. They were so nasty it made me scared to look at anything. They rip you off as well and cant be trusted. We were informed the Argon oil on sale there is mixed with cheap oil for tourists (as apparently we wont know any better), the spices they sell are of poor quality (you are better of buying them from tesco when you get back for a fraction of the price) and every stall pretty much sells the same tourist junk. There are few enticing places to sit and take a break as everywhere is so filthy and unhygienic its off putting and if you do dare sit you will get non stop hassle from vendors or beggars. This is my true opinion. I have traveled a lot and lived and worked in Greece so I am not small minded but this is the worst place I have ever been and I think it was the first flight I ever took back to the UK where I felt happy! I would not recommend this dump to anyone (except my worst enemy perhaps! Lol)."

He does not drag you off the street... if you like the goods and are interested then he will negotiate a good price with you. I do not feel as if I have paid more for the things that I bought from him. I was happy that I had found exactly what I was looking for, I didnt see the same styles of pouffes in the other shops within the souks. Before leaving to come to Marrakesh, we had already researched how much the cost of bags and pooufes hand made from goat leather is in the UK. Therefore, we knew what a realistic price should be.Where to find Ajib? His shop is called Merzoga Cuir, on 159, Rahba Lakdima Sidi Ishak (googlemap the road), right near to the area where Cafe Des Epices is. You will see a sign above the road for a Bureau du Change.

We got lost looking for the jewish cemetary... which is a must see. 5 little boys led us there and in return, we gave them a few coins. They waited for us and led us back. The streets lead to nowhere so have your map handy at all times. This is a culture of \"tipping\" and the people are totally appreciative. You will need to bargain for everything in the souks. I got AMAZING leather bags that would have been HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS of dollars in NYC. Paid between $30 and $55. We did get a lamp and spices as gifts. For a true experience, stay in the old city at a Riad. We ate at our Riad Armelle every night. Including breakfast AND a incredible dinner every night. Get the \"Best of Marrakech\" book.

Make sure that you are agreesive in haggling though as they have a knack of making you go 10D higher than you wanted to go!

They were pressurized into buying severly overpriced carpets. Imagine being pushed to buy something you don't want, and can't afford (as the touts are trying to sell a carpet for DH30,000!), by a few men, in an unfamiliar and tight space! Luckily my friends manage to get out of there fine, without buying anything! So beware..

Good time to go is around 3-4pm as most of the stall holders are half asleep and this means that they are not as pushy as normal. Good time for bargaining!"

Naturally, these people rely heavily on tourists buying souvenirs so they're keen for you to explore but there's nothing wrong with that. If you fancy buying something, make sure you haggle, just for the experience if nothing else and you'll definitely have a great time and most likely get some bargains too! If you decide to haggle the price of an item, be aware that you're committing to buy so you can ask prices and walk away, but not haggle and walk away.The souks are so amazingly mazey and deep that despite our best efforts we got lost everytime! That was part of the fun though and the locals are more than happy to help direct you."

Used as a marinade especially for white or oily fish and veal or chicken. Will keep refrigerated under oil for days.2. Ras el hanout: may contain the following ingredients.

We got lost, were helped through a series of alleyways and then the child demanded money - we gave him a coin and he threw it at us, swearing like a knavvy!

Make a list of what you want before you go - you can easily end up buying things you have no place for! don't be afraid to walk away - there will always, always be another seller with exactly the same thing or better, they know this, so keep that in mind when you're bartering. If they let you walk away, you'll find it somewhere else.Be brave enough to go deep into the souk as this is where the best bargains are to be had - but make sure you remember where you came from - it's so easy to get lost. We took photos of landmarks to look out for and felt like hansel and gretel!Things like black olive soap and rose otto oil that are really expensive here, are worth bargaining for out there - they cost a few pounds.Try the orange juice in the market square - the best i've ever tasted.Take straws with you in your bag, as the glasses and cans are not all that clean!We stayed at the Riad Kaiss, not far from the square - it was stunning and the staff were wonderfully polite."

            "review": "An amazing cultural and shopping experience. As you may know, the souks are basically undercover markets that sell everything from vegetables, fruit and chickens to high-quality crafts. Marrakech\u2019s souks are considered to be among the best in Morocco. The souks are divided in small areas that are specialized in a certain good or trade. There\u2019s the souk of metal workers, the souk of tailors, jewelers, wool dyers, spice merchants, carpet salesmen and so on. Walking through the souks is like walking through a magical fair of colors and sounds\u2026 Its tiny streets are full of life. Sellers try to get your attention. Some sellers try it with a smile and nice words others are more decided and try to pull you by the arm to see their goods. The souks are an amazing cultural experience that you won\u2019t forget.Sadly I must confess that I and my wife, especially her, were a bit nervous before entering this crazy world. We have been warned by others, that had visited Tunisian souks, that the souks were dangerous, that the sellers almost force you to buy things you don\u2019t want, that if you are not careful they will take to their shops, give you suspicious tea and they would make you buy what they want\u2026 Fairy tales from people with little tolerance to other people\u2019s culture and way of life. Before going I read many reviews from people who went to Marrakech\u2019s souks and I was more confident in a good experience. However it was difficult to convince my wife that nothing special would happen. That\u2019s why we were nervous. At the end we concluded that there were no reasons to be afraid. You just have to be firm by saying \u201cNo\u201d but at the same time polite to the sellers. If you are firm and polite they may insist two or three times but they will give up on you with a smile. At least that happened with me and my wife.Entrance fee: It\u2019s free! But if you want to buy any souvenir you have to take a good amount of money because there are many, many beautiful things you can buy. Bargaining is needed and it can be quite amusing. Because of my wife\u2019s nervous state of spirit we weren\u2019t in a mood to do shopping. Besides that we were in a guided tour that would take us to other places and we didn\u2019t want to walk with bags in our hands. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t buy anything. But if our mood was different and if we left the souks directly to our Riad\u2026and if I had much money, I would buy many souvenirs, especially metal handcrafts. The lamps are magnificent. And I must leave a compliment to an artisan who works with wood. Unbelievable work. He makes fantastic boxes and wooden artifacts. In his shop he has photos of him with Zidane and Leonardo Di Caprio. If you find him, please tell him I\u2019m sorry not to have returned to his shop to buy something. He was very nice, he showed us how he worked the wood and he gave my wife a small souvenir. We were thinking on returning in our last day but we didn\u2019t have the chance. Sorry! We made our souvenirs\u2019 shopping in stands close to Jemaa El-Fna, in the souks\u2019 entrance. It went well. Bargaining was a challenge but we manage to buy 6 silk scarves, a beautiful duvet for our bed and a couple of t-shirts with 400dirham discount! We paid 900. Each scarf was 160. We bought it for 100. The duvet was 400. We bought it for 300. And the t-shirts were an offer!!! I think it was a nice deal. The quality of the handicrafts is impeccable. If we bought something with the same quality in our country, Portugal, we would have to pay at least the double. How to get there: The souks are situated north of the Jemaa el Fna and finding your way around the narrow alleyways can be a bit tricky. We went with our guide. I think it\u2019s a good choice. Abdul was very helpful. He told us and explained many things about the souks. He didn\u2019t try to take us to any shop of his friends. You may find many guides to take you through the souks. Be sure of deciding how much to pay before accepting his services. After visiting the souks with a guide I advise you to go on another tour on your own. Sadly we didn\u2019t have the time to do it. After our initial nervous mood, we were very pleased with our visit to the souks and we\u2019ve decided to go there to buy some souvenirs. We\u2019ll do it the next time we visit Marrakech.In conclusion, YOU HAVE TO VISIT THE SOUKS, YOU HAVE TO FEAST YOUR EYES WITH ALL THE COLORS OF ITS STANDS, YOU HAVE TO FEAST YOUR EYES WITH ALL THE ARTISANS\u2019 TREASURES YOU\u2019LL FIND\u2026YOU\u2019LL HAVE TO LISTEN, TASTE AND FEEL IN YOUR SKIN THIS WONDERFUL AND UNFORGETABLE EXPERIENCE. WE\u2019VE LOVED IT. NO REASONS TO FEAR THE CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE. WE ALWAYS FEAR WHAT WE DON\u2019T KNOW. HAVE THE COURAGE AND TOLERANCE TO FACE THE UNKNOWN. IT\u2019S MOST LIKELY YOU\u2019LL CONCLUDE THAT MOROCCO AND ISLAMIC PEOPLE ARE VERY NICE. MA\u2019SALAAMA."

Is what you will hear alot in the souks!Personally I loved it, I didn't find the hassle was as bad as place like thailand, indonesia or even Turkey to get you to come into the shops or to buy.Yes alot of the stalls sell similar things so one shoe stall is very similar to the next and so on but there are some variations and bargains to be had.We had a great giggle with the stall holders joining in with the banter, hearing lots of fish and chips, cheaper than asda price and a few you have a nice bum!! We always kept a sense of humour and a smile on our face and got that response back.The first time we went we hired a local guide at the entrance to the sqaure for a couple of pounds to help us navigate and also saw a few demonstrations in the chemists about what the spices were for which was really interesting. I think you have to know your own mind here and if you don't want to do or see something firmly but politely say no and move on as otherwise you could find yourself drawn in to an endless display or demonstrations which would quickly become old.We bought quite alot the prices started off ludicrously high and the response we got was its not made in China, when asked if they had anything that was made in china because we quite like that stuff we got some laughs along with looks of confusion. We paid about 70 -90 dirhams for shoes, 60 for a medium sized tangine, 10 for the small roll on scented oils like amber and jasmine and I got a large hand luggage bag on wheels for 300dh which I thought was a bargain for what it was. You do have to be prepared to haggle and I did find that some stall holders seemed much more willing to reduce the price whereas some would not drop below 150dh for shoes which is double what we got them for. I think that some of the stalls may be operated on a kind of racket and the final decision isn't with the person you are speaking to sometimes so they can't go below a certain price. If you shop around you will get the price you want though.To do some serious shopping I preferred the souks in the morning as it was quieter and I found it easier to bargain but in the evenings we ventured into the beginnings of the souks for a wander around before dinner for the atmosphere. I enjoyed seeing the shoes being hand made, tasting the various cakes and fruits on offer and just having a laugh with the people. Its nice to turn a corner and find somewhere unexpected and by the end of the week I even seemed to know where I was going and find my way out which was a bonus!Definately part of the Marrakech experience."

The sights, the sounds, the smells!Be prepared to be hasseled, everyone trying to pull you in and sell to you...but that is part of what makes it so interesting. Only once was I uncomfortable and taken aback, a young woman trying to get me a henna tattoo...which ended up with henna splashed up my arm & clothes as I pulled away...other than that for the most part everyone is friendly and you just play along, bargaining and meandering through the narrow passages of souks. Definitely allow a full day...you can easily get lost with the winding alleyways and no exit in sight. Eventually you will notice it's the same items for sale over and over, many obviously playing to the tourists, however there are some beautiful items and I love that behind the souks you can find craftsmen working on welding something right in front of you.Breathe in the smells...while some not to pleasant (the animals), it's the aroma of the spices that just fills the senses and now it always reminds me of Marrakech!If you plan to shop, I suggest saving your purchases for the city stores, which are a few blocks away, yet they are regulated and no haggling necessary, but for the real experience be sure to spend some time getting lost in the souk!"

Yes, check out the Souks by all means to get an understanding of what peddling and bargaining is all about but if you are looking for serious finds then look elsewhere. Here are a few tips to probably help you understand your bargaining upper hand- (well you will never get out on top) :)1. If they clearly mark how much it will cost then that is your safest place to buy...they will not bargain that price down.2. A simple Tagine (size-2 persons meal; the ones locals use-the kind that is not painted and therefore can be used for cooking) costs anywhere from 50-75 MADs (50 if u r really good at bargaining-paying any more than 75 for a plain Tagine means you were had). 3. A hand-painted Tagine will cost anywhere from 100-120 (size 2persons meal; hand-painted and though you may serve hot food in it you may not put it on a heat source for cooking). We paid 120MAD for a Tagine fro 4 persons. 4. Remember that the cost of 1 months rent is 600 MAD. So if you are paying someone 100 MAD for a camel ride for 5 minutes he is only going to laugh at you when he reaches home. We paid 30 MAD for a 5 min ride on a horse carriage (of course, I come from India so I know all the tricks they could use). 5. NO! You DO NOT NEED A GUIDE to visit the Souk! It is just a way to fleece you!"

But not retail as we know it. This is retail stuck in medival times and is in no way theraputic. Beggars walk the narrow passages asking for some coins and the air quality is constantly lowered by the buzzing of mopeds that zoom up and down the walkways.As you walk around make sure you look into the shops. Sometimes you'll see mini shopping malls hidden away. Or you'll glimpse dusty mystical aladdins caves, full of caskets and north african carvings. There is some order to this madness however, The souks are divided up into areas dedicated to specific trades, such as metal, food, cloths and wood. Just enter and go with the flow.

We were looking to buy their famous Berber shoes and my partner made the whole experience amazing as he walked in and introduced himself as a Berber from the Sahara (they knew he was kidding around) and that he only wants and deserves original Berber shoe\u2019s and for a very good Berber price and for that reason most of the locals loved talking to him. Like I said keep talking and be like them, you will land yourself a big discount!Make sure your haggling non stop\u2026 nothing is never the price it really is, someone wanted to sell an item to us for 200 dirhams and we took it down to 50 dirhams the man refused with his dear life stood there for 10 minutes explaining why he will NEVER bring it down to that price\u2026ok\u2026 so we walked away\u2026 he called us back\u2026 agreeing on 50 dirhams\u2026 ok. So be ready to battle it out with the haggling in the souks don\u2019t be the one that loses!We went for a shopping spree and loved it, the Moroccans are wonderful and so friendly. You can never be scared walking up the emptier parts of the souks. You will find wonderful things in the souks just walk in with a smile, jolly attitude and discover it all!"

            "review": "\"I'll do you nice price\"... i wish they would!!!!. Everyone raves about the shopping experience in the souks of Marrakech... so on a recent trip to the 'red city', i was genuinely looking forward to the chance of landing some bargains. After two days i've come away with moderate disappointment.Maybe it's me, maybe my girlfriend and myself were going about it completely wrong, but the the promise of fun bartering, a bit of a challenge in landing that prized lantern at a 'cheap as chips' price tag never really materialised.On our first day we wandered through the northern section of the souks, with the idea that prices would get more expensive the nearer stalls got to Djemaa el Fna. Most of the shop keepers wanted to charge 1300 dh (approx \u00a390) for a lamp. The majority we looked at were poor quality, badly soldered, some painted gold/brass, some with cracked glass, to be honest you find much better at craft fairs back home. We tried to adopted a reasonable approach... tried to enter the bartering in a good humored manner, was respectful and realistic about the price. Instead of some firm and friendly bargaining we were met with either nonchalance and in some cases they were just plain obnoxious. Unless i was willing to part with 900dh they weren't interested. After two days of looking for decent lamp at a good price we gave up... Lamps weren't the only problem, we had similar experiences with poufs, mirrors... generally, most of the 'bargins' we were looking for. The quality was poor and the final prices ridiculous!In addition, my girlfriend (who took the advice of many of the guide books by keeping her clothing respectfully moderate and her shoulders covered with a scarf) received several derogatory comments from the Moroccan men and on one occasion we were met with a \"f@*& you\" after turning down an offer to 'look for free' in a spice shop. Offensive market traders aside, the souks were amazing to wander around. By keeping an open mind and forming a tough skin i still found the experience... the colours, the smells, the sounds, the chaos... absolutely fantastic. Just let me know the secret to haggling before i go back!!!"
