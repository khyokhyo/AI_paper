But do not be disheartened. It moves fairly quickly. It is within walking distance of the Colosseum and located in San Vito. The Hop-on-Hop-off bus also stops here."

The church was started in 432 and took 1300 years to complete. The church has many side alters where mass is said in a different language. There are also signs posted for confessions in many different languages.Each of the side alters is different and beautiful. Be sure to notice the mosaics. They are made of thousands of small pieces. Go early because a line forms to go through the security check point."

There is so much to observe from an impressive entrance, gilded ceilings, marble floors/columns, array of highly crafted statues and artworks. This is a functional church with smaller individualised chapels along the side with mass services taking place in several different langues. As there is just so much to take in a guided tour is recommended to get the full impact of the history of what is deemed the second largest church in Rome."

Once we had walked around the Church we went down to the museum, where the gentleman offered us the tour option. It was a great tour, Emanuel the guide was fantastic, if you take the tour you are able to go up on to the balcony to see the amazing mosaic. You also get to see the papal halls and hear about the rich and important history of the church. The tour cost about \u20ac5 and I would say it's the best money we spent. The church ceiling is covered with all of the first gold bought back from the Americas, it really is a sight to see. I can't rate this church and tour highly enough!!!"

I arrived early (09:30) and there was a short line of people at the entrance. 30 min later the church was packed with people and the line massive. Arriving early seems to be the right option. The place also have three other attractions, each of which have its own entrance fee. The museum is self guided but the papal rooms and the roman site under the church will be a guided tour. No signs about when the guided tour starts so you have to speak to the staff in the museum entrance to find out. Toilets (free but donation suggested) available at the church."

A place to visit over and over. 3 days are not enough. And Santa Maria Maggiore one of the main 4 Basilicas is unique (and the only one with 2 main entrances on both sides) - Security during Giubileo and not only is guaranteed. Takes sometime to get into but security first! Services also in various languages and not only during the Giubileo year. Incredible works of art! Unique. Worth more than 2 hrs a visit."

We went to Mass here on Sunday and it was awesome to see so many people in attendance from all cultures speaking different languages. One of the most interesting things to me was all of the confessionals. They're beautiful \"boxes\" the size of a wardrobe with the language spoken there listed on top. There is a red light above the window that lights up if there is a priest available for confession. The priest sits inside with the window partition open and those who wish to go to confession kneel on a kneeler just outside of the window. For some reason these were of great interest to me. LOL! There was a priest sitting in one near us and heard confession the entire time we were in Mass. In all seriousness, though, this church is a must-see. Unfortunately we missed one of the great relics here. Upon our return home my mother-in-law informed us that THE cradle of Jesus resides within the Basilica. I am so bummed that we missed that."

The church is connected to a museum (entrance fee \u20ac3) and archaelogical site (I didn't visit, but entrance fee is \u20ac5).The interior is beautiful.

I had been there before, but hadn't visited the excavations beneath the Basilica, which was well worth the extra time and money. The Basilica was built on top of a home, and that is the subject of the excavation. Some of the frescoes and floor mosaics are intact. It gives a nice insight into Roman life, probably among the upper class."

Legend has it that the Virgin Mary appeared to Pope Liberius and the patrician Giovanni Patrizio on the night of August 4, 352 telling him to build a church on the Esquiline Hill and that he would be shown where. That night it snowed and he marked the spot where the basilica now stands. And so every year on August 5, white rose petals are dropped into the sanctuary from an opening in the ceiling of Saint Mary Major to commemorate its legend. Under the high altar of the basilica is the Crypt of the Nativity with a crystal reliquary said to contain food from the Holy Crib of the nativity of Jesus Christ.Bernini is buried here under a simple marking place that so many people miss it. It simply says Bernini, he decorated the city.It is truly a spectacular basilica and one i founf myself drawn to daily. Confessions in all languages are available daily and the mass, in latin, makes you feel like you are truly blessed. If you have time i suggest you take the short tour for 5 euros, it will take you upstairs to the balcony where you can see the frescos and arches depicting the history of the church and also some ancient papal relics."

It is one of the largest churches in Rome and has a classical Roman basilica plan and the architectural form for a Roman basilica laid down by Vitruvius. Some of its columns pre-date the church which represents the dying Rome's transition from its old gods to the Christian one. It is very beautiful and should be on every visitor's MUST SEE list."

Disappointed that our visit last year did not incorporate the Sistine Chapel, we were thrilled that we got to see it this year. Truly breath taking and worth a visit to Rome just to see this. The afternoon visit to the three other Papal churches was a new trip for us and I wasn't sure what to expect but WOW, we loved it. The tour guide Georgia (Geodar81674) was the best guide we have ever had on any tour. Her enthusiasm and knowledge was top class and we were sad when the trip had finished. This is a must do tour when visiting Rome and if you think that St Peter's Basilica is the best Rome has to offer you will rethink your opinion after seeing the other three Papal churches. I cannot recommend this enough. A real must see, especially if you are lucky enough to have Geodar81674."

Well worth the effort it was beautiful and the mosaics were lovely. There's a tour up to the balcony where you get a closer look at them but otherwise you are on your own. We purchased for 2 E an information touch screen tour which was really good for the money and gave lots of interesting information as well as close ups of items. It's a working church and felt tranquil and soothing after the hectic St. Peter's and the Vatican. This was the only other church we were able to squeeze in so can't compare to others, all I can say is we were glad we went."

We could see it from our hotel and hear the bells ringing out. It was comforting knowing it was close by. The frescoes and sculptures were beautiful. There was an air of calmness and just sitting there looking at the ceiling was wonderful. You never felt that you could only stay for a short while and then leave, you could stay for as long as you wanted to. We visited this church several times the last time after a visit to the Vatican. I know the two places are totally different and of course the experiences are different but after the crowds and the size of the Vatican and it's environs it was a great relief to come back and sit in the beautiful quiet space of Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. It will always be a special place for us."

There's a very graceful stepped bell tower set off to one side of the roof; a beautiful 18th-century entryway with large, airy openings on two levels; and, at the back of the building, a broad flight of steps leading down the slope of a hill the church is on. (Santa Maria Maggiore is situated in one of the highest districts of Rome.) An odd thing about the major facade of the church is that there are two palaces flanking it, and built right into the church's body. At first I thought they were apartment buildings!The major attractions inside are the 5th-century basilica floor plan, and the richly gilded ceiling with recessed square panels, going the length of the interior. Also important are the 5th-century mosaics just below the windows, but to see them properly you need a pair of binoculars.There's also a canopy (called a tabernacle) over the main altar. It's like a smaller version of the one in St Peter's. I especially like the gold vines wrapping themselves around each column and spiralling upward. The columns down the length of the church are in straight rows and are very pure and simple. They were originally part of an ancient Roman building. In the right aisle, down near the altar, is a simple marble tomb marking where Bernini was buried. It's easy to miss; I had to ask someone.With such a lovely interior, I don't know why they filled it with ugly red 1970s-looking plastic chairs that clash with the rest of the interior! They cheapen the interior, and aren't even comfortable to sit on! I noticed that security at the entrance was very thorough. I liked that. The church also has an excellent, easy to easy-to-navigate, website."

We spent hours, and wanted to spend more time but we had a tour scheduled. It was gorgeous! I can't describe how beautiful, grand, holy it was. It was nice to look around and sit and say a prayer. It was located near our hotel so we walked past if often. I have a beautiful picture of it at night with a full moon. That evening, our group just stopped and stared.

The intricate detail inside is from floor to ceiling. As you walk round, with everyone having a respectful silence, there are individual praying areas and altars. At the back of the church stands a magnificent throne chair and marble stairs down to a big marble statue and a place to kneel and pray or sit quietly with your thoughts surrounded by marble and delicate decor.

Located on Esquiline HIll in the Monti neighborhood and one of the four papal basilicas in Rome, Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore is a most beautiful basilica. As many other posts mention, prior reading about this basilica can enhance the visit. A visit is worthwhile for many reasons. The artwork is beautiful: there are mosaics and frescoes throughout the basilica. The gilded ceiling--said to be gilded with gold from Columbus' travel to America--is spectacular. There are no crowds or lines so if your time is limited in Rome, you can leisurely appreciate the artwork. Tickets are not required and there is no entrance fee. The neighborhood is busy and there are many restaurants within a few blocks.Reading about this basilica beforehand or having a knowledgeable guide will help to fully appreciate your visit. If there were not so many other prominent destinations in Rome, this magnificent basilica might be a focus of your visit."

We were lucky enough to hear a female choir singing for a service while we were there which added to the beauty of the church.

Even lit, however, I would recommend a good written (or personal) guide, because without one, you won't have any idea what you are looking at (I didn't!), and there is no written information at the church.The Basilica is, unusually, open all day long (no long, lunch time break), and is open as early as 7 a.m. As others have mentioned, you will need to go through a security check to enter."

St. Mary Major is a beautiful basilica, and is well worth the visit.St. Mary Major is impressive for many reasons, but among the most noteworthy are the beautiful 4th century mosaics in the apse, the amazing baptistery, etc. The area around altar is most amazing, however. The altar is flanked by two ancient red columns. Walking downs below the altar, you are confronted with a fantastically lifelike sculpture of Pope Pius IX in prayer. He is facing the reliquary containing pieces of the manger from Bethlehem. Below the sculpture is the grave of St. Jerome, the 5th century saint who translated the Bible from Greek into Latin.Back on the main floor, to one side of the altar is the grave of Bernini. I was expecting that the grave of this artist, known for his sculptures all over Rome, would be ornate. It took me a while to find it since his memorial is simply inscribed into the steps.The church is beautiful, but luckily, unlike St. Peters, is not so crowded by tourists and still has the proper contemplative ambiance for prayer one expects in a basilica.This basilica should be on your list of places to visit in Rome. It is convenient to the metro, the main train station (Termini Station), and the main taxi station (all being about two blocks away)"

Remember, with most of the churches in Rome/ Vatican, you need to look at the floor, the walls AND the ceilings in order to see everything the buildings have to offer"

This is to help fellow travelers when they plan to visit this place.Its easy to reach this place. The nearest metro station is Lepanto on metro line A towards Batitstini. From the station exit its around 20 minutes walk. You could reach faster if you are not going with a baby stroller :). This place is free or no ticket required to visit this place. Therefore expect a long queue at the entrance. We went in the morning around 10AM and the queue was not too long. So I would advice to reach the place by 10am if you want to avoid any queue. Since its the entrance place for the Vetican city, so you will be greeted by many tourists guides (not sure government authorized or not) who will scare you saying the current wait time is 3-4 hours, which might be correct at the peak time. And they will ask you for few euros (40 probably) and give you entry to the Vetican city along with museum entry. We didn't bother to listen them and went straight to the entry of the Basilica and found hardly 20 minutes of wait time. There is separate place to keep the baby stroller as its not allowed inside. While returning you can book tickets for Vetican city and museum from their counters only. So if you plan to go inside Vetican city this is the place where you book the tickets. Our overall experience was really good and we would recommend this place. Our little one also liked it and she was relaxed without any tantrums. Should you have any specific queries, do write to me and i'll try my best to assist you."

One of the Rome\u2019s four patriarchal basilicas (with San Giovani in Laterano, San Paolo fuori le mura and San Pietro) is a blend of different architectural eras. It was built in the 5th century and it retains the core of the original structure, despite several additional reconstructions and the damage during the earthquake in 1348. The design of the building resembles the plan of an ancient imperial basilica with the beautiful mosaics from the 5th century in its interior."

It's definitely worth the 2 euro coin to get to hear the history of the church, the art, and the people involved (two earpieces, so you and a companion can both enjoy it).Do know that, because of this church's importance and tourist appeal there is a security checkpoint that you must pass through -- your bag will be examined. No biggie, but when you approach from most of the angles it looks like the church is closed. Enter by the tall column with the Virgin Mary on top."

We didn't feel intimidated by either the security officers, police officers or armed army personnel that were surrounding this venue - this only highlights the importance of this amazing building.The art work, skill and craftsmanship that you see inside this spectacular building will take your breath away and leave you wondering at how people were able to create such wonders when most of us struggle to decorate a room in our homes.Well worth a visit."

It has a peaceful feeling that some of the Churches seem to lack. The mosaics in the Church are beautifully done, and tell their Biblical stories well. The ceiling is a magnificent piece of work in itself, beautifully gilded with gold that was a gift from King Ferdinand of Spain, and was perhaps brought from the New World by Columbus. It's also the resting place of a Pope that did much to change the face of Rome, Sixtus V, and also contains the tomb of the renowned sculptor, Bernini. This should be high on your list of things to see in Rome."

Like myself, you my well wonder how the Catholic church, as an institution, could have veered so far apart from the life style and values that Jesus lived and advocated. But the fact is that, as a church of State, it commanded immense wealth, much of it used to create breathtaking--if hugely ostentatious--art.

When we reached it, we were disappointed because it seemed it's closed and there were people sitting on the steps enjoying the sun. Then we walked further down the road and realized the entrance was on the other side! How silly. We partly blamed it because there were so many beautiful churches in Rome which have a really unassuming entrance. :PAnyways, unlike other churches, you had to go through security before entering it. So there's a bit of waiting.When we were in the church, there were not too many people. Everyone was looking at the gorgeous ceiling and paintings. Some people were praying. But we found it a little bit dark as if the lights were not on. Then we saw there were a few \"vending\" machines standing near the entrance. So basically, you could actually pay (1 euro minimum if I remember correctly) to \"turn on\" the lights. You could select to light up these three parts: A) The ceiling; B) The altar; and C) The top part of the walls near the ceiling. So we did all three. It's quite amazing when the lights were on because you could see the details more clearly and people were quite happy when they saw that. It's a little bit magical! It's a very lovely church with many graceful paintings. Don't miss it! It's a definitely must see place in Rome."

Since long ago, he has been moved to a more protected and contained, if you will thoroughly cornered, environment. We do this to protect him from a society no longer able to allow further intimacy with such an important work. Moses has his horns because a translation was made in error by a revered saint. The horns have wildly different symbolic nuances depending on one's point of departure.Eve is spoken of as if she came from the side of Adam because a translation chose \"from the side of\" rather than an equally valid and more threateningly enpowering option of \"alongside\". Symbolism is so important. Moses' chiseled face, some say, may reflect his creator's own frustration and anger with not being allowed to finish the whole tombstone memorial as projected. Who knows?What we do know is that another major leader from one society has been transformed to great heights once again, despite the ongoing unresolved tensions between the two. Moses as simultaneous great hero and outsider reflects Michelangelo in so many ways. Many revere the artist despite his personal values and choices, which in many ways might easily have condemned him save for his vast talents and utility.It's to everyone's credit that both Moses and his creator have found their way into our minds and hearts. Santa Maira Maggiore's a great basilica for yet another reason: its major role as a symbolic bastion for the disenfranchised or other we tend to ignore or overlook."

Usually at lunch time it is not crowded and I had the chance to walk around and be amazed at its quite discrete sumptuousness which I was not expecting. Like St. Peter's church, the more important they are, the more discrete in their richness they seem to be. It's a huge church which easily invites us to sit and think."

When we arrived, we decided to take the inexpensive tour. The few pass\u00e9 st of the basilica that we saw were interesting, particularly the mosaics on the old facade of the church, but what was available to see was limited. The limitation was exacerbated by the fact that the guides took Italian speakers and English speakers together as a single group, so when the guide was speaking in one language, people who spoke the other language were left to stand around, and it really was not possible to explore on your own. Finally, a word of warning: While on the portico to view the mosaics, don't touch the wire running along the edge of the facade. My teenage son learned the hard way that it is electrified."

Our guide was a very well informed and articulate young man who gave us a lot of information and answered questions well. Do go and experience this place."

Thankfully, it was only a 5 min walk from my hotel and it is also extremely close to Termini station. If you are on the other side of Rome there is a taxi stand right on the side of the basilica. Absolutely beautiful mosaics, enormous, and rarely has any lines! The entire basilica is protected by fencing around so you cannot just use any entrance. Go to the Piazza di Santa Maria Maggiore (opposite of the Piazza on Via Cavour) and there you will find the security entrance. There are many, many churches in Rome but this is one of the most beautiful. Plenty of priests line the sides waiting to hear confessions and it will say on the door what languages they speak."

Towards the top it does get small and so if you're claustrophobic this maybe isn't for you, but my god are the views amazing! If you're planning on seeing the Sistine chapel, DONT go o. The free Sunday, you will be queuing for well over 90 minutes and then inside its too busy to really appreciate anything, just pay the \u20ac16 and enjoy!"

So carry light to avoid any inconvenience. entrance is free. come when the sky is clear to that the light can provide greater details esp the mosaicsOn my last day i asked my tour guide besides St peter's what was her favourite church to visit, she recommended St john lateran adn St Mary Major while this St mary Major was her favourite. and boy was she right.The Basilica is the first dedicated Virgin Mary. It beautiful with the mixture of styles and eras from medieval mosaics, to baroque and high renaissance chapels. The Sforza Chapel on the left had beautiful painted murals and we managed to a Mass take placed. My favourite was the highly detailed mosaics near the High Altar from the 5th and 11th century. the syle and details very similar to those seen in Istanbul and these are one of the oldest images of Mary and has many old testament scenes.the silver urn containtin the crib of Jesus was also a highlight. Overall it was beautiful church and very few visitors for quiet afternoon visit"

Like all of the major basilicas, armed guards were searching entrants. It only took a few minutes to get through the small security line. The exterior of Maggiore had a distinct clocktower, but was otherwise not extravagant. Dating back to the 5th century, the Maggiore is the largest church in Rome dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The mosaic paintings along the sides survive from the 5th century. Its 16th-century coffered ceiling is said to be gilded with gold initially brought by Christopher Columbus and presented by Ferdinand and Isabella to the Spanish pope.Below the High Altar is the Crypt of the Nativity, which includes a reliquary said to contain part of the Holy Crib carried to Rome by Christian refugees during the Muslim conquest of the Holy Land in the 7th century. Another attraction at Maggiore is the famous icon of the Virgin Mary known as Salus Populi Romani (Health of the Roman People), believed by some to have been painted by St. Luke the Evangelist, although most scholars date it to the 13th century. Bernini the sculptor is entombed at Maggiore.All of the churches in Rome are free to enter. Most include a tour guide listening station that for 2 euro will give 2 listeners 10-15 minutes of commentary including the history and significance of each church. I highly recommend these. Maggiore had a small gift shop, but it had noticeably less Mary-focused merchandise than the other major basilicas had of their respective apostles, which was disappointing."

You should either take the orange line and get out at the Station \"Vittorio Emmanuele'', and when you leave the trains at the exit just follow the direction - piazza Santa Maria Maggiore and when you come out from the underground than just follow the road ahead and in 3 minutes time you are there. If you are coming from Termini Station, at the building of Termini after you leave it at the main exit, if you turn on the left and then again on the left there is a shop called \"Coin\" - just take the road in front of the Coin going down and in 5 minutes time you are there. If you are in Rome do not miss the chance to see this awesome church - going inside is free, therefore do not give anyone any kind of money !!!!!!They have got some amazing fifth century mosaic and noteworthy is the Crypt of the Nativity or Bethlehem Crypt, with a crystal reliquary designed by Giuseppe Valadier said to contain wood from the Holy Crib of the nativity of Jesus Christ. It is also the burial place of Saint Jerome, the 4th-century Doctor of the Church who translated the Bible into the Latin language (the Vulgate). Also Saint Ignatius of Loyola celebrated his first Mass as a priest here on 25 December 1538.It is also UNESCO World Heritage Site."

Founded in the fifth century, the building has undergone modifications and additions dating through the eighteen century. It has the tallest tower of Rome and is known for its mosaics, gold gilding and frescoes. The side chapels also contain impressive artwork. A visit is worth your time and admission is free."

This is one of the four major papal basilicas of Rome (St Peter, St John Lateran, St Paul outside the Walls being the other three) and is a must do for pilgrims. It's just a very short way from Stazione TerminiLike all of the four papal basilicas and like a lot of other buildings this is actually an extra-territorial part of the Vatican City (despite being nowhere near it) and not technically Italian soil. The fifth century mosaics are lovely but you must walk round the church and view it from the Piazza dell' Esquilino to get the full effect.This Basicila has other titles too. It may be called by some St Mary Major it's also called the Basilica of Our Lady of the Snows. and the Pontifical Liberian Basilica. Why Liberian? It was built by or in the time of Pope LiberiusWhy Our Lady of the Snows? Legend says, again during the time of Pope Liberius, that a wealthy roman couple built a church on the spot where, in the height of summer, August 5th, it snowed as a sign from the virgin to build a church in her honour. Hence, our Lady of the Snows. And hence, despite little historical foundation for this legend, the title feast of this awesome building is 5th August.Anyway, the old Romanesque structure survives if you can see through the baroque confections. Original and restored mosaics mingle and the ancient Icon of Our Lady Health of the Roman PeopleThis Basilica is worth a visit for the building, and for Pilgrims it has spiritual significance.But you MUST especially if you like early Christian mosaics, see the Basilica of Santa Prassede nearly across the road."

Don't forget to look up at the ceiling outside on the porch - gorgeous.This, like many smaller churches, has no entrance fee and rarely has a line to get in.

It took 431 years for theologians to decide that she was both a virgin and the mother of Jesus/God, but once a council decided that this was so, it was possible for churches to be dedicated to her. This one has the general form of a Roman civic building (a basilica) with a higher central aisle (nave) and lower aisles, leaving room for windows in the upper part of the nave. A basilica often had identical columns leading to one or more semicircular end points of the nave. Churches usually had only one end point (the apse) so that people would focus on the altar that stands there. The evocation of imperial Rome was no accident, because the Roman Catholic Church gradually took over the administration of Rome as the senators moved out of town to their country estates while the administration of the city slowly disintegrated. (No surprise, since by then the capital of the Roman Empire had moved east to what's now Istanbul.) S. Maria Maggiore added to other early churches the sober, noble-looking forms of the Roman Empire and also added the earliest known imagery of the Virgin Mary's story, in permanent mosaic (small squares of colored stone and glass) over the arch leading to the apse. Then, along the walls above the columns, the sponsors commissioned scenes from the Bible, with some Old Testament scenes chosen to foretell episodes of the New Testament. Later, in the 12th century, other artists added images of the Virgin and Jesus enthroned in heaven (in the apse), and in the 16th century, side chapels were added for the burial of prominent churchmen and to provide additional spaces for worship. During much of the church's history, it became a place for burial of prominent people, primarily churchmen. One can see tombs of various dates in the middle ages and Renaissance and later periods. If you have binoculars or opera glasses, bring them along on your visit so as to have a better view of the mosaics, especially those on the arch and in the nave. They are not always easy to see, as the windows are fairly small and don't admit a great deal of light."

Below the altar is a reliquary containing wood believed to be from the cradle of Christ which is looked upon by a large statue of Pope Pius IX who was known to come here to pray before it. There is a small museum below the church that is well worth the few euros it costs to get in. Many papal vestments. A cross made from fragments of the true cross. Relics of St. Luke and St. Matthew the writers of two of the books of the gospel. I would highly recommend a visit to the museum, but check hours to time your visit."

I would avoid the cafes on the square though, overpriced (EUR 10 for a glass of house wine!) and you can find better food a short walk down Via Merulana"

The Basilica is located at 34 Piazza del Esquilino, some five blocks southwest of Stazione Termini.The Basilica is within Italian territory and not the territory of the Vatican City State.The original architecture of Santa Maria Maggiore was classical and traditionally Roman perhaps to convey the idea that Santa Maria Maggiore represented old imperial Rome as well as its Christian future.The interior of the Basilica contains precious mosaics such as the triumphal arch and a nave mosaic from the story of Moses.Under the high altar of the basilica is the Crypt of the Nativity or Bethlehem Crypt, with a crystal reliquary said to contain wood from the Holy Crib of the nativity of Jesus Christ.Here is the burial place of Saint Jerome, the 4th-century Doctor of the Church who translated the Bible into the Latin language.Just outside the Sistine Chapel is the tomb of Gianlorenzo Bernini and his family."

You will hear Roman people proudly boast this church as one of the most beautiful in Rome, the most beautiful as well as the oldest among the ones dedicated to Maria, the one with the most beautiful mosaics in Rome. All the above is to push you to visit this \u201cpapal\u201d basilica, the one where apparently current pope Francis went first, just after his election, to pray.This monument is clearly a must. What impressed me more:- The two majestic chapels in the transetto, at the sides of the presbytery, especially the one named \u201cLoggia del Sacramento\u201d, located on your right looking at the altar. Just look at the extremely high, richly frescoed, bright and beautiful dome above the chapel.- The gilded paneled ceilings of the main nave, said to have been manufactured utilizing the first gold shipped from South America to Europe in XVI century, donated to the Pope by the Spanish royals.- The mosaics, obviously - There are three groups of mosaics: the ones in the vault of the apse, behind the altar, old and majestic, with clear byzantine influence, showing Maria\u2019s Assumption to the heaven, sitting beside Christ \u2013 The ones in the walls along the main nave, smaller, located below the windows, not appreciable from a distance; some of them were destroyed by raising humidity in the walls of the church, and were replaced by frescoes \u2013 The ones in the \u201cLoggia delle Benedizioni\u201d (Blessings\u2019 Loggia), above the main entrance, the only ones you can see close by; you will have access there with a guided tour (that I would definitely advise to join); interesting the difference between the mosaics at the upper level, in byzantine style depicting scenes from the Bible, and those in the level below, which already reflect the influence of Giotto, depicting scenes of everyday life.- The same guided tour to the Loggia delle Benedizioni will show you the helicoidal stairs which sparked the fame of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the creator of the S. Peter Square world-famous colonnade, who is buried in this church. It seems that this is the first stairs built and functioning without central support.- In the museum below the church, don\u2019t miss the beautiful marble statues of the first Nativity scene ever crafted, by Arnolfo di Cambio in XIII century (as the first Nativity ever was created by Saint Francis, live, a few decades earlier)."

We were also taken in a room where there was a baptismal font and told that that was where Constantinople, the first Christian Roman Emperor had been baptized. That one had me scratching my head as I thought Constantinople had been pretty much on his death bed before becoming a Christian, even though his mother, now called St. Helen, was a strong believer and brought back many artifacts from the Holy Land."

We came back another afernoon and there were no barricades and everything was open. The only thing I didn't like was that for the mosaics to be illuminated, you had to pay a euro and then the lights were only on for a couple of minutes.

The mosaics depict the story of a popes dream of snow falling in Rome and how the basilica came to be. There are also a spiral staircase that's carved into the wall and the four guardian angels in marbel and gold.The only negative of the tour was the fact that the guide spoke limited English so I think we missed some of her detailed descriptions. But that's typical English tourists expecting everyone to speak our language! The basilica itself is gorgeous inside. Typically Italian in design it is so ornate and the detailing on statues is just amazing."

Admission is free daily 7:00-19:00. There is a fee for Museum admission 3E and the archaeological zone for 5E but neither were recommended by the tour book. Interior is really spectacular with amazing mosaics and tombs of Sixtus V and Bernini."

If you have a few hours to spare before you catch a coach or train from the Termini please visit this beautiful Basilica.It is not on the scale of St Peters but impressive enough. The guards are quite strict on dress code so do make sure the lady has her shoulders covered and the gentlemen has shorts to the knees. There is packing fabric which you can borrow at the door but not very comfortable in warm weather. The church itself has an amazing ceiling and wonderful artwork. At the alter there is displayed the Manger which Christ was laid-how it came there I am not sure. This is a church not to be missed when visiting Rome."

We spent a week in Italy and toured a lot of churches - this would be in my top 3 or 4 and earns a \"don't miss\" recommendation (after St Peter's, and St Mark's in Venice)."

The liturgical services begin at 10AM and you experience the ritual of the priests and other male church figures in a procession from a chapel at the rear of the church up the aisle toward the apse - incense burning - and an all male choir echoing trough the space - really a nice way to see it."

Coming at it from the Roma Termini Train Station side (the west, I believe), it was quite an awesome sight, an unexpected one, considering that seemingly out of nowhere is this marvelous Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Perhaps in centuries past, this Church held a commanding view from all around it, but modern times with all its development took some of that away. Nevertheless, it is a breathtaking sight to behold. Because we saw no tourists or people milling around, we first thought it was closed to the public that day but we soon found out that we had to go to the other side to enter it. The interior was quite impressive with its ornate ceiling, its mosaic details, Biblical scenes depicted intricately, the high altar with its gilded top/dome, the steps below leading to a commanding figure of a kneeling Pope Pius IX (I believe it was Pius the 9th) before the manger of Jesus, with a few benches for pilgrims to pray and an area on the side to write one's petitions. The mosaic depicting the Coronation of the Virgin Mary is just beautiful. Some of the images and scenes depicted in the different areas were so finely done that it was hard to believe they were mosaics. A beautiful, beautiful Church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin and worth a visit."

It's a Papal Basilica, construction began in 435 AD which makes it a thousand years older than St Peters Basilica. While St Peters is very impressive for it size beauty, Santa Maria Maggiore is no less beautiful but on more intimate/human scale without the massive crowds of St Peters and there is no waiting in line for admittance. If you visit you may be asked to cover bare shoulders and knees before entering, so dress modestly. Pictures allowed no flash."

The ancient roman house had running water and it is still running - go figure! Amazing and worth the stop - especially in summer when it's so cool underground.

During Mass times, they usually have benches/chairs set up. As you sit, you can admire the early medieval mosaics high up near the windows along the nave. These tell various biblical stories in colorful and vivid scenes. Notice the beautiful mosaic floor, too, in colored marble. The sculptor Bernini, whose work you see all over Rome (St. Theresa in Ecstasy, the colonnade of St. Peter's), is buried at the front, just to the right of the altar rail. (Look for an inscription on the floor.)"

I'd recommend just going in and being prayerful at your own pace. There's a lovely giftshop in back with helpful attendants.

Pope Sixtus III built it to commemorate this decision.Certainly, the atmosphere that generated the council gave rise also the mosaics that adorn the interior of the dedication: \"whatever the precise connection was between council and church it is clear that the planners of the decoration belong to a period of concentrated debates on nature and status of the Virgin and incarnate Christ.\" The magnificent mosaics of the nave and triumphal arch, seen as \"milestones in the depiction\" of the Virgin, depict scenes of her life and that of Christ, but also scenes from the Old Testament: Moses striking the Red Sea, and Egyptians drowning in the Red Sea."

Santa Maria Maggiore is an easy church to visit, as it's near the Termini station and metro stop, and a walk through on your own won't last more than half an hour. It's a really awe-inspiring church with a lot of history, and different architecture styles...but the main reason to visit Santa Maria Maggiore is just to see how beautiful it is. It's easy to just visit Santa Maria Maggiore, walk in, walk around and soak up the scenery. It's a massive church, and there is so much artwork, so much gold leaf, and so many little side chapels and cupolas and things to see at every turn, you can simply enjoy the view and that's that. Santa Maria Maggiore was built at the top of Cispius, the highest part of the Esquiline hill, which is the highest of the seven hills of Rome. The medieval bell tower of the basilica is also the tallest in Rome, at 75 meters.The Basilica is open daily from 7am to 6:45pm. You can easily reach the basilica via the Metro lines A or B at Termini train station. It's only a 5-10 minute walk from there. And it's free! Top tip - when you have finished go 20 meters around the corner to see the outstanding mosaics at Santa prassede this is also free!"

If not, see the interior of Santa Maria Maggiore, and just visit the outside plaza of St. Peter's Basicila. Just as magnificent in its interior as St. Peter, though smaller in size. But no large crowds and somewhat disturbing speeches from tour guides. (loud especially those from Mainland China. Why can't these tour guides speak softer? ). No long lines waiting to get in. Plenty of time to take photos without including other people's head or their back. Always cool inside when outside is very very hot."

A 15 minute stroll SW from Termini Station, this is one of the earliest churches named for Mary in Rome, started in the 430s by Pope Sixtus III, just after the Council of Ephesus defined Mary's role as 'The Mother of God'. Marian mosaics reflect many scenes from Mary's involvement with the ministry of Jesus in the New Testament. The Borghese Chapel (left transcept) the ancient painting called'Salvation of the People of Rome' (for saving the people from the plague). Tradition holds that this painting dates back to apostolic times, was painted by St. Luke from life, on wood from a table in Mary's Nazareth home. Opposite the left transcept is the 'Sistine Chapel' dedicated to Pope Sixtus V (hence the name Sistine) with many great works of art. And then of course there is the Crypt of the Nativity, with a crystal reliquary containing sycamore wood said to be from the manger of Christ. And the guilded roof, is also a centrepiece of the structure, with gold donated from America (primarily Mexico and Peru) by King Philip of Spain. Seven Popes are buried here. St. Jerome is buried here, who translated the Bible in the late fourth century from the original Greek and Hebrew into the Latin 'Vulgate' (vulgate means 'everyday language' in Latin, which was true at the time. Bernini, artist and sculptor behind St. Peter's Square, and Pauline Bonaparte - younger sister of Napoleon are also buried at Sta. Maria Maggiore. A magnificent - major - Church for all these reasons. Take the guided tour for a great experience. Gift shop and bookstore. Many restaurants and souvenir shops surround the Basilica. And don't forget the beautiful church of Santa Pressede 2 blocks NE, a feast of Romano-Byzantine art, and Santa Pudenziana, the hiding place of St. Peter when he was in Rome, 2-3 blocks S of Santa Maria Maggiore. Check respective websites for opening days and hours for these smaller but very important churches. Enjoy!"

This is a beautiful Brasilia, large, awe inspiring, amazing architecture, and so uncrowded compAred to St. Peter's. Make a point to visit here."

I thought that it was a large neglected, abandoned church. The front & back entrances were filled with vendors. Heavy steel gates surrounded the entrances. I could not see any sign that identified the edifice. Therefore, Be Sure to go Only when the basilica is open! As the picture shows, the interior is absolutely gorgeous! And HUGE, befitting to a basilica. But the vendors and the graffiti remain on the outside, as is throughout Rome. Shameful, a pity."

The facade has a very welcoming entrance with a statue of Mary holding the Infant Jesus a'top. The Bell Tower is the tallest in Rome, standing at 75 meters.Almost as interesting is the cathedral's back, showing the 2 domes and it forces half the traffic in Rome to go around it.If you just step inside, it looks like a big empty rectangle - with coffered, golden ceiling and an Italian marble floor. However, this time I walked to the front and on the right entered the side chapel with the 2 huge white marble statues of 2 Popes. On the left side is the Borghese Chapel, and down the stairs is a statue of a Pope kneeling, praying.Brian, from Perth. W. Australia."

Inside it has a fine gold coffered ceiling, a long column-flanked nave and inlaid marble floor. An interesting chapel ceiling in Byzantine style, too. Its relic, in a chamber slightly below floor level, is a plank from the manger that the infant Christ was laid in in Bethlehem. When we visited, a nun and her convent-girl charges began singing in beautiful harmony at the sanctuary gate. Sublime."

First- if you are looking for one of the oldest depictions of Mary and Jesus that was used as the model for the Middle Ages enter the Church and go to the left hand side of the altar and gaze upon it as many artists have done so. There's no pictures allowed so you can also get a post card if you want a better snap. The Museum downstairs was also very cool to see for Vatican relics- it's about 45 minutes to go through the whole thing. After all that- sit in the main area of the Church and just look up. I've always been a fan of Renaissance history and that means familiarizing oneself with the Borgias- one of Rome's more notorious families for nepotism- the top of the ceiling is covered in New World Gold and the Borgia bull coat of arms. You realize you are looking at the ceiling as the Borgia family may have once awed at it. As an American you realize these were the many riches that Spanish and Italian explorers were rushing to bring back home. Unfortunately it also came back at the cost of many Native Americans losing their lives or coming into slavery as a result to mine for the gold."

It is the largest of the Marian churches and features a wide variety of architectural structures and design, reaching back to the 5th century. The resting place of a handful of Popes as well as Gian Lorenzo Bernini can also be seen here. Opening hours are 7.30-6.45pm every day (as of March 2015).The exterior of the church is very interesting. You can see a two-tiered Baroque facade, nice portico and a medieval period tower you can see was built during the 12th century and is the tallest in Rome at 70 metres. Behind the church, in the area known as Piazza dell'Esquilino, there is an Egyptian obelisk erected here in 1587 and two church domes. Within Santa Maria Maggiore there is quite a lot to see that is interesting. The nave is massive, featuring a lovely marble patterned floor, inner walls lined with mosaic and frescos cycles and a coffered and gilded ceiling. Its nice from a size and appearance perspective. At the front of the nave is a nice canopied high altar an open crypt where you see the figure of the kneeling pope praying to a holy relic believed to be a piece of wood from the crib used by baby Jesus at the moment of Nativity in Bethlehem. This is a beautiful open crypt that you can enter and see. Do give some time to the remarkable Byzantine mosaic in the apse as well. While many of the nave mosaics are from the 5th century, this was added in the 12th century. You can find Bernini's tomb marker on the right side of the crypt and canopy on the floor. The side aisle chapels were mostly added during the Renaissance and Baroque periods. They are highly decorative and impressive representations of these architectural styles. These are where you'll find tombs of important Popes as well. In the end, Santa Maria Maggiore is a church that we are alway quite impressed with. While being an important church it is overshadowed by the likes of St. Peter's (Vatican City) St. John's in Laterano and those containing masterpieces by Michelangelo, Bernini and Caravaggio in the more centrally located area of the city. This is probably a good thing as it means smaller crowds when you visit this wonderful basilica in Rome. Note: Located in the Termini district, Santa Maria Maggiore is actually one of several very good church visits you can make in this area of the city along along with nearby Santa Prassede, Santa Maria degli Angeli and Santa Maria della Vittoria. This is a great way to spend 1/2 day for those who enjoy church visits."

There is a bouncer-type guy at the door enforcing this, so better to just comply! Also, there is a fountain in the piazza outside so you can refill water. There is a small gift shop underneath the church that had some nice stuff too. The church is very close to St. John Lateran and walking between the two would make for an enjoyable visit."

There was no fee for entry and that was a nice surprise, and the amazing level of detail that was included in the construction of this building was truly impressive. The area that the Basillica is located in is not particularly a destination as it seems more residential (not dangerous, just not very scenic either). From the outside this is a building that is showing the expected wear of an inner city building with environmental wear and tear, though inside is the truly impressive surprise."

According to our guide from RomeInLimo (which I would also recommend) when Columbus returned from America he brought a lot of gold back that he gave to the queen of Spain. She gave a lot of that gold to the pope who then had it used to do the ceiling in this basilica. The result is absolutely stunning.This was really an unexpected delight on our trip to Rome."

Priests will take confessions in various languages, so come here if you wish to make your confessions! In common with other Rome churches, watch out for beggars at the church entrances, although the churches are free to enter, they will try and get money from you!"

It's mosaics and multi surfaced marble interior are breathtaking, and with some further exterior mosaic work on the front face it is essential to visit. My favourite aspect of a visit (and I've been many times) is the ambient holy atmosphere. It exudes a warm welcome to all comers and you may be lucky enough to witness as we were, an informal choral rehearsal by a visiting choir group in one of the many side chapels of the Basilica. One of the many roads leading away from the Basilica, Via Panisperna, is a beautiful street which dips and rises twice as it takes you to the the back of Trajan's Market. I would recommend a walk along this street either to or from the Basilica."

It is situated within the old section of Rome and dedicated to the mother of you know who. Unlike the other 3 Vatican churches, the Holy door is situated on the left, which is important to know, so that pilgrims end up touching the right door. Failing that, their wish will not come true. The interior is stunning as you would expect and a couple of former Popes are interned within. More of interest to me, is that Bernini, the great artist is also buried here, very near the altar. Ensure that you dress modestly and ignore the beggars that tend to congregate outside.The ambience of the basilica is very positive and this would be high on my list of places to visit."

Located on the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore, this is the only papal basilica in Rome to retain its original structure, and one of the earliest churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It is also one of only four major basilicas and is a church of legend; it is said to house pieces of wood brought to Rome from from the crib of Jesus' nativity. Over the years, many popes have made many modifications, of course--chapels, facades, the museum, and other tributes--but this is essentially the cathedral that has occupied the Esquiline hill since the middle of the sixth century. The scope of the frescoes and oils, the sculptures and mosaics, and the architecture (itself a sculpture) is impossible to describe. Perhaps, like all things of immeasurable beauty, that is as it should be. It is captured in a feeling. Do not exclude this from a list of places to visit while in Rome. Become a child and see it with your child's eyes and heart. NOTE: There is a fee for the museum, not for the basilica proper."

Please don't do what some disrespectful visitors were doing and actually enter the service and take photos! There's a side chapel on the right hand side which has the most beautiful ceiling, the art is wonderful and just seems to lead you up to heaven - go and look up at it to see what I mean. There's also a sunken area on the way down to the crypt and accessed by stairs. Within this area is supposedly some of the remains of the crib that Jesus was actually born in. Whether this is true or not I don't know but the atmosphere down there as well as the fact that you could be looking at the actual crib is pretty special.

It is the center of the Marianist Society and holds what is thought to be the oldest marianist symbol in the world, a 12th century mosaic of the madonna and child.

Started in the 5th century and showing all the signs of the different times work was done on it. Beautiful both on the outside and inside. NOT St. Peters but worth a detour. Don't have to spend hours in here. 20-30 minutes is just fine but well worth it and lots of streets around it to walk, dine, have some gelato or great Espresso, indoors or outdoors. Attention NON-SMOKERS, they have ashtrays on outdoor caf\u00e9 tables...HA"

For serious art-lovers..... --and anybody with patient good will can become a serious art-lover: so plan a little extra-time for your visit of this outstanding sight (don't have to enlarge on its tremendous riches) and take a guided tour of the loggia delle benedizioni and adjacent rooms, most importantly Bernini's winding stair--and of the excavations underneath the present church. The late 13th c. mosaics in the loggia, although heavily restored, in instructive and entertaining fashion supplement your knowledge of Roman painting (and musivic art) of the period. Then there are a few sumptious vestments in the sacristy, but above all, Bernini's engineering feat of a winding stair without central support! It is impressive in its plain, but outstanding craftsmanship. The excavations offer a glimpse into the Roman period 'pre-history' of the present, 5th c. building, including rich marble panelling, fresco paintings, and a fascinating collection of Roman roof tiles with imperial monopoly stamps right down to and including Theodoric! Not to forget: our guides were great, both knowledgeable and gracious (it might help you to have a smattering of Italian...)."

The Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore is the cathedral dedicated to the Virgin Mary (Santa Maria Maggiore = St. Mary the Major, the Holy Mother) It is one of the oldest churches in all of Christendom. It is one of 4 Papal Basilicas, i.e. the Pope is the Rector (notice the Papal Throne on the high altar?) the burial place of Bernini, the burial place of 2 popes and the family church, and crypt, of the Borghese's. The ceiling is covered in gold brought by Christopher Columbus from the New World back to Spain, then donated by Queen Isabella to the church. To this day architectural students travel from around the world to study Michelangelo's chapel and Bernini's spiral staircase. Perhaps it's most important relic, located in the attached museum, is the actual manger of Jesus Christ. This Cathedral was the first place Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict and Pope Francis visited upon becoming Pope. This is one of the most amazing Cathedral's on the planet and equal in importance to St Peter's."

Since we had saved a little time on our itinerary at one of our previous destinations, we decided to take a peek inside Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Once inside, we were met with an enormous church with a long nave culminating with a large triumphal arch. Inside the church, there are many extremely important artworks as well as the burial places of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, numerous Popes, and Saint Jerome, who was responsible for the 4th Century translation of the Bible into Latin. All in all, the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore is filled with history and, at worst, worth a short visit when in Rome."

It's also one of the best sights you can see for free.Do yourself a favor - go more than once. Breathe in the air of the impressive main hall, and marvel at all of the wonders inside. Also, make sure to take a moment and visit the final resting place of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, whose famous statues make the Borghese Gallery come alive. Not to mention, several popes are also interred here (like Pope Pius V, whose bones are quite visible).Really, take the time to visit this place at a leisurely pace, and feel like you're part of something that's been here since around 431 AD."

In 16th century the \"Sistine Chapel\" was build by Domenico Fontana and later F. Ponzo designed the Pauline Borghese Chapel in the beautiful baroque style. The church is the place of the tomb of Bernini, Italy's most important baroque sculptor and architect. Many visitors find this basilica more beautiful than St. Peter's in Vatican.

It took a while but we window-shopped along the busy Via Merluna and were at the Basilica in a reasonable amount of time.In front of the church is a small piazza with a fountain. Like others, we filled up water bottles here. This church is another with beautiful mosaics. Many are devoted to Mary. The Nave mosaics beautifully depict the life of Moses. Also in the church are the tombs of Sixtus V and Bernini. Having seen so much of Bernini's work in the Borghese Gallery the day before, it was rewarding to see his tomb.Behind the church is a more sizeable piazza which contains an obelisk. This is one of 13 Egyptian obelisks in the city.Before our visit here and at a very short distance away, we stopped to see the wonderful mosaics at the Church of Santa Prassede. And, after our visit, we walked towards the Colosseum, stopping enroute to see the St. Peter in Chains Church."

Holy Saint Mary Church - Must Visit !Basilica of Santa Maria MaggioreSanta Maria Maggiore is one of the four Patriarchal Basilicas of Rome. Its construction was ordered by Pope Liberio who \u2013 they say \u2013 on August 5th 356 saw the Virgin Mary in his dreams. She indicated him where to construct the church through a snow fall that happened on the Esquilino Hill (this is the reason why the church is also called by the second name of Saint Mary \u201cad Nives\u201d, of the Snows). It seems, however, that the actual Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica was built under Sisto III who erected it and dedicated it to Mary\u2019s motherhood, just after the Council of Efeso in 431. One needs to notice that since the times of the late empire the Esquilino Hill had hosted a small temple dedicated to Giunone Luncina protectors of births, to whom matronal feasts were dedicated. Internally, in spite of the various interventions, the church has maintained the 3 aisles of the V century, separated by 40 monolithic marble and granite columns. In 1288 Niccolo IV ordered the construction of the transept. Alessandro VI (1254-1261) decided the building of the central aisle\u2019s ceiling, for which \u2013 according to what the tradition says - materials arrived directly from the New World because of the Spanish origins of the Pope.The bell tower with its pyramid-shaped point dates 1300, and with its 75 metres it\u2019s the tallest in Rome. In 1500 the side chapels were added."

Maria degli Angeli, built on cross-section plan, with awesome organs and fantastic acoustic. After that visit a Basilica Papale Santa Maria Maggiore which gives you a feeling that a church cannot be more beautiful than this one. And then - visit Pantheon - the most gracious ancient church I ever saw, with open cupole and drops of rain falling inside and being drained by almost 2 thousand old drainage system!!! It is just a perfect gem of architecture!!! After you admire them all - visit St. Peter's Basilica in Citta del Vaticano to be finally amazed by its beauty and glory, superior to all previously mentioned 3 churches. When I recall Rome I cannot stop from recalling all these churches in just such sequence and would love to visit Rome once again and to see all of them once again in the same sentence, but each of them 3 times longer...."

Like many Roman churches, the exterior architecture is Renaissance with Baroque interior detail added later. This one is a bit unusual in that is has a flat ceiling nave (reflecting its original construction in late Roman times) and fairly small apse with two large domed chapels on either side. The Sistine one can be visited, the other must be viewed from outside unless you are praying. There are also several other chapels and a small crypt with a gorgeous reliquary from the nineteenth century. Rather than go into two much detail here, I suggest googling this on the web to get a full appreciation.If you don't want to wait in a line to get into St. Peters, this church combined with some of the other great Roman churches would be an adequate substitute. Unfortunately, I did not have time to visit the fee portions - including the loggia and Bernini staircase - but hope to do so in the future."

If its peak season visit this Cathedral and skip the lines elsewhere. There is no fee or pressure to donate here but you can light a candle or drop an offering in the boxes if you wish.

A red light on top of each booth let's you know if it is in use or not. There are several smaller rooms on either side where some kind of service may be in session. There are guard(s) there who may choose not to let you in depending on their mood. They don't take kindly to exposed feet/shoulders/legs. This is a place worth seeing, and is a stop on most of the hop-on, hop-off tours. We probably saw everything you want to see in an hour, but individual desire/taste could keep you there longer."

Unfortunately, the small panels are high up and details are hard to make out if you don't bring along binoculars. The 13th century mosaics of the apse (modeled after 5th century originals) executed by Jacopo Torriti) however, are easily viewed and present a stunning and moving image of \"The Crowning of the Virgin.\" The church is very close to Termini station and is a gem."

It is large and imposing, as so many Roman churches are. It oozes history, as so many Roman churches do. It drips art, as so many Roman churches do. But, you have them all together here in one of the four key basilicas in the city. The facade stands proud beyond its large piazza, whilst sporting the highest campanile in the city; the coffered nave ceiling is encrusted with the first gold back from the Americas; the apse mosaics sparkle still despite their age, inserted only around 100 years after Constantine allowed Christianity headroom in the Empire; while it also boasts its very own and colourful Sistine Chapel. The paintings high up above the nave arcades are quite hard to see - unless you go on the tour of the loggia (nominal charge) where not only can you peer through at them from the roof, but you get to see the magnificent C13 mosaics above the portico as well as other parts of the basilica not usually seen. Add it to your list. See the exterior by night too - breathtaking."

The Basilica is strong and impressive. Once inside you need to prepare yourself for a massive explosion of Catholic showmanship! The ceiling is covered in the first gold brought from the New World, there are mosaics that are mind-blowing and sculptures that stop you in your step.

This puts you at the side where you enter (you can go down Via Cavour, but you'll have to go to the Gioberti side to enter and the Basilica takes up a whole city block). After seeing S.M.M., take 20 minutes for a mostly downhill walk to see another of the four major basilicas of Rome, San Giovanni in Laterano. As you exit on to the plaza outside of S.M.M. you will see two streets going downhill away from you, one to the left and one to the right. Take the one to the right, Via Merulana. An easy walk and plenty of sidewalk cafes. You will run right into San Giovanni. After your visit there, you can walk downhill again away from the front of the Basilica and turn right on the first street and find yourself at the Metro Station next to Coin department store (so you don't have to walk uphill back to Termini)."

Since it appears that all churches in Rome have outdoor water fountains, we decided to see if this nondescript church we'd passed so many times had one to.We were shocked to see armed carbineri in front of the church. What could they possibly be guarding? We found the expected water fountain, and decided that we needed to go inside. Again, more armed carbineri greeted us when we entered.Wow! When Columbus made his most successful voyage to the Carribbean, he brought back a huge quantity of gold. Much of it was used to decorate the inside of the basilica. I stood for several minutes in awe just looking at hundreds, perhaps thousands, and beautiful paintings and tile work created over a 500 year period. A security guard named Luigi saw me, heard me speaking American English to my wife, and asked if I would like to tour. Of course, we accepted. For the next hour, we went through sections of the basilica that I do not believe are usually seen by the public, but Luigi assured us that we were not violating any restrictions.I would suggest adding this basilica to your itinerary in Rome. It certainly does not have the same panache or fame as other landmarks, but it is worth the trouble. I would go online and read a brief history of the church and its artwork, so you will not be as overwhelmed as I was when I first entered the building."

While they finished their lunch, I decided to go and have a look. On a Sat. afternoon, who would have guessed that when I peaked in the back door, I would find this church packed with a congregation of totally involved people, singing and joining in with the most fantastic music! I returned to the caf\u00e9, reluctant to leave, but the music drew me back. I took a photo and now believe it was the pope sitting at the front! Fabulous worship experience."

            "review": "on a treasure hunt, a find so rare. Walking on the lazy lanes of Rome, we got side tracked almost as if by purpose and through maze of seedy lanes reached the awe inspiring sight of Santa Maria De Maggiore. Santa Maria Maggiore is one of the four Patriarchal Basilicas of Rome.It is said that the construction was ordered by Pope Liberio who on August 5th 356 saw the Virgin Mary in his dreams. The intricate and grand interior retains its original 5th-century structure, despite the basilica having been much altered over the centuries. The nave floor is a fine example of 12th-century Cosmati paving. Ferdinand Fuga's 1741 facade is baroque, as is much of the sumptuous interior. The ceiling by Sangallo is gilded and said to be the first gold bought from the new world, given by Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. The basilica has one of the most beautiful 5th-century mosaics in the triumphal arch and nave, depicting Old Testament scenes. The altar itself is a porphyry sarcophagus, which is said to contain the relics of St Matthew and other martyrs. A plaque to the right of the altar marks the spot where Gian Lorenzo Bernini and his father Pietro are buried. Steps lead down to the confessio (a crypt in which relics are placed), where a statue of Pope Pius IX kneels before a reliquary containing a fragment of Jesus' manger.The sumptuously decorated Cappella Sistina, last on the right, was built by Domenico Fontana in the 16th century and contains the tombs of Popes Sixtus V and Pius V.This is one place where religion and art come together into a holy union whereby one is transfixed by the sheer grandeur of the art and its opulence, wealth, and ability to mesmerise the audience in to a spiritual stupor. One needs a lot of time to explore this basilica in its entirely, and most of all to absorb the beauty of it all. This was one of our best finds in Rome. "

A view down the nave with the stately row of columns on each side is magnificent. The ceiling consisting of sunken regular panels is very impressive.

This is where remnants of wood from the cradle of Jesus Christ are displayed underneath the altar."

The apse mosaics here, as well as those on the preceding arches (which are very detailed), are breathtaking. On the apse, Christ and the Virgin are enthroned, surrounded by colorful winged angels, with a complex curving vine growing around them. Definitely a \"must see\" when in Rome, and a place that you really need to see multiple times to fully appreciate. And, I always love the story about how the basilica came to be, with a miraculous snowfall in August, 352 C.E."

The first time was on the day we arrived because it was about a 10 minute walk away from our hotel, Hotel Aberdeen, and also because it was my mother's favorite place to sit around when she stayed in a refugee camp in Rome 30 years ago. Unfortunately the famous stairs at the back of the basilica are now closed off (probably because so many bums kept sleeping on it), but the inside is more fun anyway! The other two visits were for mass.They perform smaller masses in the Borghese Chapel in the afternoon and mornings (up until 9 or 10 o'clock, then they have masses in the nave). For the smaller masses, the nuns do most of the singing (they sound like angels) and all of the other fellow church goers participate in the mass; as for the larger masses, the clergy members do all of the singing in Latin (very haunting!) and a bishop takes care of all the speaking parts.We went to the mass for Assumption Day, and there were flowers everywhere along the altar; it was very beautiful!The 13th century mosaics on the apse and the Triumphal Arch are absolutely gorgeous and very well preserved.Underneath the high altar is a very famous reliquary called the \"crypt of the nativity,\" and it is said to contain wood from the crib of Jesus Christ. Regardless of whether or not you believe that is really true, the reliquary is beautiful, and the area underneath the altar is also where St. Jerome is buried.Also, if you walk around to the right of the high altar, on the floor near the raised platform you will see an engraved stone memorializing the tomb of Gianlorenzo Bernini; never would have thought he would be buried here!There is a quaint little gift shop and bathrooms on the right side of the basilica, as well as an underground museum founded by Pope John Paul II in 2001. You have to buy tickets to get into the museum, but they are not expensive and it is worth it because it is kept very cold and contains Roman artifacts that were discovered beneath the basilica in the 18th century in addition to many lovely altar pieces, paintings, and other religious items from the 16th to 19th centuries.This was my favorite basilica in all of Rome; I highly recommend visiting."

On first glance, Santa Maria Maggiore may look like another church, but it's actually very unique and significant.Firstly, it's technically property of the Vatican, although it's located outside the Vatican. It has special diplomatic status, a bit like an embassy.It's one of only four major papal basilicas in the world, so it's a big deal in the Catholic world.I was lucky enough to partake in mass here, so it was a special visit for me. It was nice to see that it's a real, functioning place of worship with everyday Romans attending mass.Some may find Santa Maria Maggiore not as ornate as St Peters, however it's still quite grand, with some amazing artworks. It has some really remarkable stuff that the casual visitor might not realise, like wood from the crib of baby Jesus. A tour may be valuable if you haven't done a bit of research beforehand.There's a strict dress code, although staff do hand out plastic ponchos to cover shoulders, legs etc.I thought this was an amazing place without the crowds of some other attractions."

A large main Hall with stately columns, marble inlay flooring,an arched and painted ceiling and a handsome altar. But its the side rooms that are truly fabulous.

Then there is the ceiling, with its lovely golden roses, made from the first gold from South America to reach Spain. The Emperor made a gift of this gold to the Spanish Pope, Roderigo Borgia. The central rose (not gold) is decorated with his coat of arms. There are many side chapels decorated with gorgeous works of art, which also adorn the body of the church .

(It took that long for church leaders to decide that yes, she was really the virgin mother of Christ.) It has the form of a Roman basilica (civic building) with a nave separated by columns from the side aisles, because dignity and authority under divine protection were associated with this architectural form in ancient times. It has been imitated many times since, albeit usually in smaller size. There are mosaics of the 5th century along the nave walls and on the arch framing the apse. Those in the nave show Old Testament subjects that Christians related to aspects of their newish religion. Later mosaics decorate the apse itself. Around 1600 two chapels were added near the apse end, containing lavish sculptures and altarpieces and other artworks. The one problem here is that the mosaics are hard to see because the nave windows are small and do not admit much light. If you look in any survey book in art history, you will see at least one of the mosaics illustrated."

Mass was going on in some of the smaller chapels. There are old time free standing confessionals and priests ready to hear confession. There is an area where a piece of the manger is on display. Many visitors (myself included) commented that the area where the manger is on display felt very sacred. Below the church, there are guided tour (for a small fee) that show a house that the church was built on top of. It is very interesting, and we all enjoyed seeing what remained of this Roman home. If you are wearing shorter shorts/skirt and have bare arms, the guards will provide a free paper shawl to wrap on shoulders or waist. This was one of my favorites places in Italy. There is no charge for admission and photography was permitted even though the signs posted said it wasn't."

It was a cloudy day and we didn't see anything. We did get a chance to go again on the day of our departure. Cloudless day and full sunshine but still no point on the ground.

The mosaics--both the older, Early Christian nave mosaics and the \"newer\" Torritti mosaics in the apse--are extraordinary. I particularly love the museum, where you can see a reliquary with the hair of the Virgin Mary (!) and Arnolfo di Cambio's presepio or manger scene."

While my friend and I were in the church there was a service going on in one of the chapels and when the choir started to sing there was something inherently beautiful of being in such a truly stunning church while listening to a choir. It left me absolutely in awe. And whether you are religious or not, its hard not feel the spirit while listening. Overall though a truly lovely church."

With its papal tombs, Baroque interior, 5th century mosaics, amazing paving, 12th-13th century \"Madonna and Child\" above the altar, a bell tower in the Romanesque style, a sense of the sacred is assured."

Intricate frescoes, beautiful statues, chapels for saints and impressive architecture. We took the train from termini and walked to the basilica which is located on a busy intersection. The main altar within the church is impressive as well as the labyrinth right below the altar which has a huge life size marble carving of the pope in a prayerful pose. Architecturally satisfying and spiritually fulfilling this is a beautiful church for mother Mary. Apparently the only church in Rome outside the vatican walls that is managed by the Vatican -and it is well maintained.There is a small gift shop at the side exit from the church where I purchased some beautiful gifts/ momentos ."

We went to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore on a recommendation from the front desk of our hotel as a church for mass on Sunday. But in addition to mass (this is an active church), we were treated to the most beautiful church we saw during our trip to Rome, Florence, and Venice.It is only a short walk from either the Repubblica or Termini red metro stops, and even closer to the Cavour blue metro stop.You will want to reserve at least a half hour to appreciate the artwork and architecture and the side library that this church has to offer. I don't want to over-sell it, but this church is beautiful. It is not as big as the Duomo in Florence, but it is every bit a magnificent inside.I do not know if there is a cost to enter (there probably is), but we did not have to pay since we went for mass on Sunday"

After you climb a wide staircase, you'll see on your right a statue of Philip the 4th, former King of Spain. Like most churches, there is no admission fee to get in. Once you pass the big door, you'll see a majestic church with a big central nave and two side naves separates by columns. On the sides there are some chapels. In one of them they were celebrating a mass and no pictures were allowed. It is a quite humbling experience to visit such a beautiful church. There are very old mosaics and beautiful paintings with religious subjects. There is art from its construction, centuries ago, to more modern one, like a museum where new art is regularly added without removing the old one. This church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, so most of the art is about her. Each pope added something either modifying the existing structure or either building a new part. The golden ceiling was added later for instance. The central altar is raised and on the bottom floor there is a statue of a pope praying in front of what is said to contain a relic of the wood of the crib where Jesus was born. There is really a lot to see to be described in a review, so I suggest you spend more than an hour here."

The Santa Maria Maggiore \"basilica\" is surely something huge and astonishingly full of treasures showing all the layers of history that went through it, but what I definitely find the best gems of the church are the wonderful, very old mosaics \u2013 of the Fifth century! - at which you can take a glance from the pictures here on this site, either the ones up the two full sides of the main nave or the ones on the wall above the altar, on the triumphal arch (these ones even better!).About it, I feel to give everybody two tips to better appreciate the visit: 1) before all, obviously take your time to look at them carefully because there are depicted, with astonishing skill, many stories form the Bible and there are among the firsts on the world relating to the Virgin Mary!2) remember, before going to Santa Maria Maggiore, to put together a good bunch of coins, if I\u2019m not wrong the 1 Euro size, because the lights to enlighten the mosaics aren\u2019t free! And unfortunately they do not last long, so if you want admire them with calm, you have to put several. Your luck could be being inside with other intersted tourists, such as it happened to me, so when I finished my money, I could exploit other people coins! This is also comfortable because the coin - machine is at the other end of the nave, near the entrance, so then you have almost to run if you want fully use the coins you spend!Eventually it\u2019s also worth a look the central floor, a very ancient and well preserved medieval art craft."

It is filled with great decorative arts like chalices, vestments, architectural draws and the like. Well worth the 3 euro price of admission."

In the nave, there are mosaics that are considered the world's oldest and best preserved. There is a large silver urn that is purportedly containing manger fragments. To the right of the area where the manger fragments are located is Bernini's tomb. I expected it to be quite elaborate but it is a tile on the floor that is engraved. He invented the look of Baroque and laid out St. Peter's Square, designed the fountains in the Piazza Navona and the sculpture of St. Teresa in Ecstasy to name a few. This basilica is near the Termini station. Be sure and go to Santa Prassede which is very nearby. This church does not close during the afternoon."

We were, however, very disappointed with the tour of the Loggia costing 5 Euros each. We wanted to take the archeological tour but we were told that we should take it after the Loggia tour. We therefore assumed the one ticket covered both. It doesn't. The guide, Francisco (?), spoke very softly and I could not understand most of what he said. When I made a special effort to stand close and listen all I heard were corny jokes about pay me more to open these doors or where is my volunteer to open a door. I learnt nothing from this guide and the only thing of real interest was seeing the staircase designed by Bernini.When we heard that this same guide was going to lead the archeological tour we decided to skip it.Very disappointing."

From Rome\u2019s Termini fronting Via Giovanni Giolitti, take either Via D. Manin or Via Gioberti and walk 5 to 10 minutes to The Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. You will be greeted by a piazza dominated by a water fountain and a column of the Virgin Mary. It rained really hard on the day I visited this church and the sun was just coming out behind the clouds that November morning. For me taking pictures of the wet piazza was a bonus using the fountain and column as props. The Santa Maria Maggiore is right in front and you will think that it is just another church fa\u00e7ade. The exterior is unassuming but lo and behold, the interior of the church is awesome and really beautiful. The design and architecture of the interior is pleasing to the eyes. Check the details of the ceiling and even the flooring and imagine the labour of love done by the artisans to make the Santa Maria Maggiore interior really amazing. I sat on a bench at a quiet corner and just enjoyed looking at the shadows of the columns (the sunlight was coming from the other side) in contrast to the lights on the upper walls and ceiling showing their intricate design. Be sure to bring your camera and if you like details, at least 2 hours of your time will be spent taking pictures and at the same time saying wow!"

The floor of Santa Maria are all these unique tiles where no two designs are repeated."

The Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore is one of the seven pilgrimage churches in Rome, and a major basilica belonging to the Vatican, and therefore is not in Italy itself. On the piazza in front is the largest column in Rome taken from the temple to Constantine. Built originally in the 4th century, it has been enlarged and enriched many times over the centuries. There is much to see here: 5th century mosaics, its own Sistine Chapel, relics, and a triumphal baldacchino. Among the many treasures is a precious icon that reputedly saved the city from the plague. The golden ceiling is said to be a gift from Fernando and Isabel of Spain from their New World conquest's gold. Another MUST to see."

A relative had told us that there was a beautiful church just a short walk from Termini station, and when we arrived at Santa Maria Maggiore, we were pleasantly surprised by what we found.The exterior is very impressive, but inside it was another story completely. The floors, walls and ceilings were beautifully decorated, and there were stunning mosaics on display. During our visit, a ceremony of some sort started, and we were treated to a wonderfully traditional procession of priests, and some beautiful Latin plainsong. The whole of the ceremony appeared to be in Latin, but we didn't stay long.A definite must if you're near Termini!"

Not too far from the famous sights, this Basilica is somewhat of an understatement on the exterior, but reviewing the history, it housed the popes for a good period of time and was the main seat of the Catholic Church while the Vatican palaces were being restored and created. It is fitting that the interior is really outstanding, though perhaps not as impressive as the Vatican. Still, you can tell there was a lot of time and money spent on detail and the Basilica does not disappoint.The \"wood\" of the crib for Jesus is found here (though I find it hard to believe that this is the real thing). It is impressively displayed and there is a very nice painting of Mary and the Baby Jesus here. If you spend a few minutes really looking around, you will see that the detail of this Basilica is really impressive. Take a look at the detail of the flat ceiling and the alter. All of it is done with incredible attention to detail.There is also a sealed door for the holy year that occurs every 25 years. In all, it is worth a side trip if you are in the area. Photos are allowed in all but a few locations within the church. This would also be a great place to celebrate Christmas Mass."

There was barriers up on one side and it was only the next day that we realised it is open from the other side. Check opening times and the small tourist shops beside it are very good and prices are very reasonable. Inside is just breathtaking there is so much to see and take in. I would suggest giving yourself at least 2 hours to look and see everything. A beautiful basilica. This is another basilica that you dont hear too much about but is amazing. We found the best way to find all these amazing churches / basilicas was walking around rome. Everything is within walking distance and at the end of the day when your tired just hop on a bus or metro to take you back. Dec 2013"

The beautiful 5th century mosaics are some of the oldest representations of Mary in Rome. The 16th century coffered ceiling is magnificent.

It doesn't take long to see the highlights of this wonderful church, a church that, according to tradition, was placed here because the Virgin Mary told the pope and a wealthy Roman to construct a church in her honor on the spot where snow appeared--in August, A.D. 358. Don't miss the two sumptuous chapels across from one another or the huge baptismal font. You can rent audio guides for a complete tour."

My quick stop turned into two hours. In comparison this is quite small but the main room is flanked on the left by about 4 seperate alter rooms. Three of which had services conducted on the Wednesday I was there. There were a lot of tour groups but most of them are small groups. There was a choir singing when I arrived and it added to the experience. Whilst I was there three other groups arrived and I was treated to singing by Spanish, Malaysian and English groups.Set aside at least half an hour, photos are allowed except in two areas which are clearly marked. The gift shop is not expensive and the people are not pushy, they are happy for you to browse. Toilets are extremely clean and free. There is a museum and a history of popes and relics for additional fee but again its clearly marked."

But if you want a little bit more than just a walk around, go towards the bathrooms and the gift shop, there is a stair going down and you can buy extra tours there. There is a museum; there is a tour of the balcony upfront (we did this one and really worth it just to see the mosaics on the facade) and there is the archeological site underneat the Basilica (that we also did). That one is a most if you are a fan of history. There are artifacts so unbelievable there and in such pristine condition, it's mind blowing. Really recommend this tour!"

It's encased in glass and gold and is behind a glass window down a short flight of stairs. Some people doubt that it's authentic, but I believe that it is. This church is definitely worth seeing."

It is worth visiting as the prices are very reasonable, although the owner seemed annoyed when I asked him if I could possibly have a few extra bags for gifts! He eventually gave me 3!!!!!!

F when we were here - wherever it snowed was to be the place of the Basillica they were planning. He shared his dream with the Pope and later that day when it actually snowed, they raced over to the hill and the Pope drew the outline of the foundation in the snow."

Of course Roma is plenty of things that anyone must see, but I often receive the same question from colleagues coming from abroad: \"I've one day, what should I see in Roma?\"And my answer always include Santa Maria Maggiore. It is close to the Fori Imperiali area, so close to the Colosseum and is the most beautiful church in Rome, full of treasures collected in the fifteen centuries of its stories."

It's gorgeously ornate, but difficult to navigate in some respects, and we weren't allowed in the chapel with the famous Madonna icon. We searched in vain for Bernini's tomb, and had to queue for his stairs. All in all, while magnificent in its own right, it was the least impressive of the four papal basilicas, and by far the least user friendly."

If you can push beyond that and find some of the quieter spaces (or better yet make an early-morning visit) you will get a better sense of the reverence that the church is meant to invoke. A significant number of popes made SMM the location of their tombs. There are multiple reasons (devotion and beauty among them) and it is worth it to look past the crowds to reach back in order to find these reasons. Really worth a visit if you are a pilgrim or not, but please try to go very early before the press of people."

But what is even more beautiful is the Mini Sistine Chapel that exists in the church. Furthermore, it's spiritual relic is the manger that the baby Jesus laid in in Bethlehem. It is powerful to descend into the chamber and pray in front of it. Finally, it holds what is widely regarded as the truest interpretation of the Virgin Mary, and is where Pope Francis went to pray the day after he was sworn in as Pope.

Not because of any personal religious connection, but because of some stunning art work on the windows, walls, and ceiling, the vast emptiness in the middle section (the church having no benches makes it very easy to walk around without being disturbed, and give you ample time to check out the ceiling), and to salute one of the greatest sculptors in history: Bernini. I was actually amazed with how little attention is paid to the grave of the great Bernini, with not a single soul (or tour group) knowing, noticing, or taking the time to look for the simple, marble gravestone on the right side of the large center-tomb that houses one of the most influential and visually present artists in Rome. The church itself doesn't help the cause either: a mere two slanted, wooden church benches protect the marble step from unknowing people wandering onto it. While you're for the other grandeur of the church, take a second to salute the master."

Like all major Churches, this one too had an ornate ceiling.I had read an article listing four major churches of Rome and Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore was on it, plus this one was a five minute walk from our Hotel. Still we left it to our last day and we slotted it as first thing in the morning. Walked around the church which thankfully wasn't too packed with tourists, even fed some pigeons on the steps outside. No visit in Rome should be complete without a visit to this church."

No crowds AT ALL! which gave you much more time to observe and enjoy the beautiful architecture, mosaics, amazingly crafted statues and artwork at your own pace and really take in the beauty of this place. Best to go around noon/afternoon as there tends to be mass in the mornings so is very quiet after lunch, and best of all, its free! however donations can be made around the church and i did not hesitate in giving a few coins to see such a beautiful place, and the silver crate that supposedly holds fragments of the manger of Jesus!"

It's difficult to visit Rome and not hear his name mentioned. For someone so well known, his tomb is surprisingly modest. Set into the stair, it is to the right of the stairs going up to the altar. Whenever I'm in Rome I stop at the florist on one of the streets nearby and get flowers to lay on his tomb, a small thing to do to thank a man who so enriched the city of Rome."

The Council declared Mary the Mother of God and when Sixtus III became Pope he decided to build the Church of St. Mary Major to honor her. The present church evolved through the ages and was made larger and more beautiful. The front fa\u00e7ade was the work of Fernando Fuga and was created in 1741. It has a portico of five arcades on the lower story and three arches in the upper loggia. On top of the fa\u00e7ade there are statues showing Popes, St. Charles Borromeo and the Blessed Nicholas Albergati. Over all are the figures of the Madonna and Child. The bell tower was Romanesque and built in the 14th century, and now is the tallest bell tower in Rome, with a pyramidal spire and with a height of 75 meters. The belfry contains five bells. In front of the church is a tall marble Corinthian column which Pope Paul V had transferred from the Basilica of Constantine located near the Colosseum. An elegant fountain was placed at its base. The fa\u00e7ade of the apse at the back of the church was the work of Carlos Rainaldi.The interior has three naves and the central nave has a coffered ceiling in gilt wood designed by Giuliano Sangallo in 1450. It is flanked by large monolithic columns with Ionic capitals. Over these one finds 36 mosaics from the 5th century that show Biblical scenes. The floor has a Cosmatesque pavement donated by the Roman nobleman Scoto Paparone and his son in 1288. The floor was designed by the marble masters of the Cosmati family in the thirteenth century. At the end of the nave there is a triumphal arch and the central portion has a mosaic showing the Savior on His Throne. Below the triumphal arch there is a baldaquin which was the work of Fernando Fuga. It is located over the main altar.The upper part of the apse has a mosaic created by Jaime Torreti in 1295. It represents the Triumph of Mary. Jesus crowns Mary, both sitting on the throne. Beside them are many angels and saints watching the scene. The Sistine Chapel was the work of Domingo Fontana in the second half of the 16th century. It is named for Pope Sixtus V. It is in the shape of a Greek cross that is topped with a cupola decorated with frescoes. The central altar has a gilded bronze tabernacle held up by four angels and this was the work of Giovanni Battista Ricci. There are also the tombs of Sixtus V and his predecessor Pius V. The Confession is the reliquary crypt which lies before the main altar, and this was constructed by Virginio Vespignani by order of Pope Pius IX to contain the sacred relic of the Holy Crib. The crystal reliquary, shaped like a crib, contains pieces of ancient wood which tradition holds to be part of the manger where the Baby Jesus was laid. Portugal donated the reliquary which was designed by Giuseppe Valadier. The statue of Pius IX, the Pope of the Immaculate Conception, was sculpted by Ignazio Jacometti and placed in the crypt by Leo XIII."

If your not Catholic you may wanna do some reading so you have a clue of whats going on. (Catholics: the Kyrie and Gloria sung ! Non-catholics: thats two significant parts of the sunday catholic service). Catholic or not, go - the place is awesome - see the side altars too. I think Bernini's buried here (how fitting !) but I couldn't find the tomb. A few blocks from Termini, in an otherwise largely uninteresting neighborhood (uninteresting for Rome, pretty cool for anywehere else !!), but worthg the detour."

I would DEFINITELY Recommend starting at some of the \"Smaller\" Cathedrals ( AKA Basilica) and working your way up through these before making your visit to St Peters Basilica. These are ALL SPECTACULAR in their Own Right, with Incredible Sculptures, Frescoes, Paintings and History to EACH of these. However, if you go to St. Peters INITIALLY, it is of such a Different Scale, that Others, such as Santa Maria Maggoria might be more difficult to fully appreciate. This, as well as Santa Maria in Trastavere, are Really Spectacular, and Really Should try to seem them EARLIER!!! (Also, Potentially Much Less Busy with Visitors).Thanks.Jim N in Bellevue"

They are housed in a very ornate silver urn under the main alter. The church is free to enter but you must have appropriate attire and be respectful.Bernini (architect of St. Peter's, Trevi Fountain and other Rome treasures) is buried beside the alter in this church as well.

Its 18th-century exterior conceals one of the best-preserved Byzantine interiors in the city.Standing on the site of a site of a temple to the goddess Cybele, with the first church being built in the early 400s. Santa Maria Maggiore still retains its ancient layout, but most of the exterior dates from the 18th century with the only visible exterior part of the Early Christian basilica a short length of the clerestory wall, seen from Via dell'Esquilino. Origjnally, the church had an amazing position on the summit of the Esquiline Hill, but this has changed due to the growth of the city. The 5th-century mosaics on either side of the nave depict scenes from the Old Testament and alone are worth the visit. This was the first large-scale cycle of Biblical scenes in Rome. The left-hand side has scenes of Abraham, Jacob and Isaac; the right-hand side has scenes of Moses and Joshua. The amazing golden mosaics of the triumphal arch are also from the 5th century and depict scenes from the early life of Christ. The Athenian marble columns supporting the nave are the oldest parts of the church - they either come from the first basilica or from an antique Roman building. However, the shafts were reworked and the old capitals and bases were replaced during a restoration of the 18th century.A museum below the church contains Roman remains that were found here in the 18th century, including a section of Roman road, a mosaic pavement, two wells, a series of arches and narrow passages cut into the bedrock."

This Basilica is absolutely beautiful, once you visit it your never forget it , its beauty will stick with you forever, as will the legend attached to this church- the legend of the snow-in 356 the virgin appeared to pope Liberius and told him to build a church on a site to be marked by the fall of snow. Even though it was August snow fell on the Esquiline, and so plans were made to build a church on the spot. The miracle is celebrate each year on 5th aug when showers of white rose petals fall down on the congregation representing the snow.The 5C mosaics in the nave and on the chancel arch are amazing- they show scenes from the old and new testament.Everything about this basilica is stunning put it on your \"to do list\" making sure you don't miss out the underground museum here, its worth it."

There were many, many beautiful artworks - in particular the mosaics of the Virgin Mary, created in 1295 - but what struck me most was how this church felt so loved. We saw many churches in Rome, but this, along with Sagre Cuore di Gesu on Via Marsala, was one of my favourites."

As it ls located outside of main tourists routes you will not find crowds of tourists here and can enjoy the interior in peace.

At the same place tourists are wondering around, while in a side chapel a feew local people attending on a mass, at the same time a man goes to confession, while one of the main chapel is under instauration. I couldn't believe that these things work together and a church can function that much as a modern, common place for anybody.Around you at the same time you can find beautifull environment and on the top a little part of the holy cradle."

I have never seen a Church like this before, and this was probably the next best thing to St Peter's Basilica (bearing in mind it was shut on the day of our visit to the Vatican). The Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore is an extremely beautiful Church, while being very ornate. There is not a single corner that does not hold something fascinating for one to look at. You could spend ages in this Church - it has so many side Chapels and altars. We stayed for Mass which was something else also!"

In fact, it can be rather dark inside, making photography somewhat of a challenge. The altar is ornate and beautiful, especially for visitors from the States where our Churches more often than not, resemble gymnasiums. Something else to consider is the other-worldy heat if one visits in the summer time. There is no air-conditioning, nor did we see any fans.

We confessed our \"venial\" sins by kneeling before a confessional and a priest would lower the iron rod he held and tap us on the head for absolution! The church steps unfortunately on the back side are no longer open to public, but still a sight to see. Go inside and experience more spiritual splendor and note how it is always filled with visitors from all over the world, and rightfully so!"

There is something in this Basilica which is very difficult to pinpoint which attracts me like a magnet. It may be the serenity or the majestic splendour of this huge place of worship and work of art that moves my steps towards it and that makes me book a Hotel in the area.We went for five days to Rome in August this summer and stayed in this area . Via Cavour is alive morning and night during siesta time it is slow but at all other times it is lively. It is a pleasant promenade every so often we stop for a cappuccino or a cold bottle of water . There are also all kinds of restaurants Asian,Italian, French and Indian. A favourite of my husband is a restaurant/ pub called Marconi and situated in Via Prasede ,one of the side streets, close to the Basilica. Here my husband's favourite dish is sausages and sauerkraut. The square as most other squares in Rome seems to be the meeting place of everything from adolescents , Hop on Hop off buses , Taxis ,old people ,beggars, actually quite a lot of them, and tourists.I really do not know exactly what people look for when on holiday but as far as I am concerned I like to relax watch the hassle and bustle of the people,the life of the place Personally I get a kick out of observing the little old ladies who still care about their appearance and yet manage to look their age. Once we went during the winter season and I marvelled at their fur clothes. They looked warm and elegant and I said in my heart of hearts \"Oh poor animals \"what people do in order to look chic always surprises me oh well one of those things very few people dare correct ! they are old people after all and environmentalists were not a la mode when they bought those fury coats and jackets so they are excused. Nevertheless observing the people strolling in their streets to go most probably to some place is a simple cheap occupation to be taken up by the holiday maker if it strikes one's fancy. Piazza Maggiore is a typical Italian square and provides entertainment that does not cost any money.This is a part of Rome which I make it a point to visit and never tire of it. Buon viaggio!"

Before the shrines in Lourdes, Fatima, or Mexico City, this was one of the most popular and important Marian churches in the world. At Christmas and Easter, the stations for the day were not at St. Peter's, not at St. John Lateran, but at the ancient \"Liberian Basilica.\" The facade is unique with the arches on the bottom and top. At night, the view is stunning as you can see the light hitting the mosaics that are behind the top layer of arches. The interior, although imposing, has a very elegant simplicity. It doesn't feel cold like St. Paul's Outside the Walls or as overwhelming as St. Peter's. It goes without saying to see the old mosaics on the apse. The chapels are sublime, but at the time, I unfortunately could not make it to the other Sistine Chapel. I did make it to an early morning mass at the Borghese chapel though, and there was nothing quite like it that I found anywhere else in Rome."

It is easy to get to from the Metro and it was much less crowded than St. Peter's so it had a more reverent atmosphere. One disappointing note: the Sacra Culla (sacred crib) had been removed for restoration and was unavailale for viewiing. There is a mseum/crypt downstairs. (You have to go out a side entrance to enter the crypt) It does charge a small fee, but is bright and has some nice pieces."

When I was there, there was a fascinating exhibit about Galileo (dispite the fact that the Church excommunicated him). This basilica has a very unusual and important solar and lunar clock that maps out days, astrologic periods, eclipses, etc. via two strategicallly placed holes in the walls. Really, I would put this at the top of a short list of places to visit in Rome...and there are no lines to stand in or crowds to fight."

There's a lovely crown on display there."

My second favorite church of Rome. Often singing masses are held in the side chapel to the left of the altar at different hours, a unique experience."

We hurried inside to see a packed church, with clouds of incense rising into the sunlight of the clerestory windows, acres of dazzling gold everywhere, as the Mass was beginning. It was accompanied by trumpets and a large choir of beautiful voices. All of this is not a surprise when one realizes this is the Pope's church, and so every effort is made to create a goose-bump inducing spectacle that moves the mind and spirit."

The gilded wood ceiling is a bit over the top, whether or not you believe the gold is from Columbus. But the attitude of the Vatican guards (this is extraterritorial zone) telling you not to sit on the steps, not to take pictures, not to show off your knees, and asking you to put in coins to light up the mosaics is, well, irritating. It's hard to see the simplicity of the early church under later--and present day-- excess."

Several Papal robes but then comes the biggies, the writing arms of St Luke and St Matthew, a cross with wood from the true cross, thorns believed to be from the crown which christ wore, the clothing of St Thomas of Canterbury but there is so much more and its well worth it. I highly recommend this to any student of history and art or just any if the Christian faithful. Well worth your time and the few euro price tag."

While not one of our very favorite churches in Rome, we do enjoy visits to Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. The fascade is nice on both the front and back of this church and there is enough inside of interest, making this a worthy stop if you are in search of Rome's best churches during your visit. We like the large nave area, not for the ceiling, which is ornate but similar to what you can find elsewhere in Rome. We like the wall paintings that line the Nave near the roof. Unfortunately, our last visit was early in the morning before the sun was shining through well enough so the wall paintings were a bit difficult to see. We also like the facade at the back of the church with the many statues mounted at top, similar but on smaller scale to what you'll see at the San Giovanni at Laterno. Here you can also see very impressive 5th century nave mosaics. The Triumphal arch, in particular, is quite beautiful. However, our favorite area is the Cappella Sistina, where you find the beautiful marbled crypt area with the praying pope statue, looking over the Holy Crib relic encased just in front of the statue. This is a touching, beautiful and memorable scene you can take home with you after leaving Rome. In addition to visiting Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, you should make the extra time to walk across the small piazza onto Via di Santa Prassede to visit the superb Santa Prassede church, one of our very favorites in Rome, just 2-3 minutes walk from Santa Maria Maggiore. Combined they make an excellent combination of churches in Rome. Overall, Santa Maria Maggiore is not one of our very favorite churches in Rome but its good enough to include on your 'to see' list if you visiting Rome with church visits on your mind."

Inside, the ceiling is gilded with some of the first gold brought from the Americas. As in so many Roman churches, especially the big ones, the interior is richly decorated with marble, frescoes and precious art. You could spend a good amount of time exploring the side chapels or sitting quietly in the massive nave. The mosaics above the altar are remnants from the earlier church on the site and date from the 4th century.Tip: after your visit, walk two blocks to S.

It is an example of the churches built by the early Christians after their faith was recognized by the emperor Constantine in the 4th century. The layout, with its tall nave(central aisle) and side aisles, and the clerestory windows rising above the side aisles, and the semicircular apse at the altar end, would become the basic format used by Christian churches in the west for close to 1500 years.  The mosaics near the altar and around the windows and on the nave walls are all original to the 5th century. The more flamboyant decorations=== frescoes and ornate sculpture---are later additions, mostly from the baroque period (17th century) Well worth a visit. The size of these early churches is impressive. In visiting this church, you can get a sense of what old St. Peters basilica looked like before Pope Julius II tore it down to start building what is the St. Peters we see today."

If it isn't, peer through the gates and see as much as you can."

This Basilica doesn't appear to be in many guidebooks...and you may have already been to a number of churches in Rome or the Vatican, but this one is truly beautiful. located not too far away from the Termini station, there are guards on the door checking dress code. Their big thing here is shoulders. Any shoulders on display will not be tolerated, however the good thing is that they do provide a small basket of shawls for those people who need them.Once inside the church there seems to always be some sort of service going on, either in the main body of the church, or in one of the smaller (but still fairly big) side chapels. The services are very beautiful and worth stopping to listener take part in one....just don't take pictures.The church itself is very richly decorated, lots of gold, and vast statues, however due to the sheer size of the church, they don't look out of place. The main church dates from the 5th centuryasdo many of the mosaics, so even if you don't enjoy churches that must, this is a place to see for the history alone.

The stone carvings in the cathedral are exquisite and you will never forget them. And the stunning details that surprise you around each corner or over unexpected pits.Worth putting on your list of to dos.Doesn't matter if you do it before or after St Peter's because it is totally different and equally compelling."

On entrance you are overwhelmed by the size. The ceiling is beautifully carved. The side chapels are small churches in themselves and the mosaic of the coronation of the virgin from the 13th century is in the apse. Just below the main altar lies the crypt containing what is said to be a relic of the nativity crib."

            "review": "We saw new priests being ordained - nice!. We were in Rome in 2004, but did not go to many of the churches other than Saint Peter's Basilica. This church was a must-see on our list for this trip. The reason we wanted to see it was that the famous architect Bernini is buried there. This church is one of 7 pilgrimage basilicas in the world & was founded in 432 AD. We heard the bells ringing & decided to go see what was going on. To our surprise 4 new priests were being ordained. We watched the whole ceremony. The new priests had to lie prone face down on the floor for quite some time, then they each went over to the Cardinal & words were spoken & they kissed his ring. Then near the end of the ceremony each of the new priests were presented with their new vestments by fellow priests who helped them put them on. Very moving. We are so glad we got there in time to observe this sacred event. Unfortunately, my camera battery had died & I did not get any pictures. This is a really beautiful & special church.Nearby is the Church of Santa Prassede which has some very nice mosaics. Be aware that they close this church at lunch time."

I wouldn't have found it if I wasn't staying at a hotel in the area. The entrance is round the back from Cavour, the exterior is rich in detail."
