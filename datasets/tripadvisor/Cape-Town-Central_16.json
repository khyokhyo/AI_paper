Take your pick, find a seat and enjoy. In between your grazing you can wander around the design and craft shops and stalls selling unusual upmarket goods from local artists and artisans. Not easy to park nearby as it is very busy but you can get here easily by taxi or buses from the centre, including the myCiti bus 261.My favourite purchase today was tuna biltong. I bought it to take home but doubt that I will be disciplined enough not to eat it all before I leave!"

There are lots of unusual stalls with interesting goodies and the food market was just on another level! Such a great selection of foods ranging from banting to vegan to oriental to baked goods. Everything that we tasted was delicious and well-priced. Well worth a visit."

Bring cash as it is easier to draw it elsewhere than here. Some stalls also use Snapscan but not all! The car attendants are overbearing, so try to park in one of the off road areas if you can, we parked way up in one of the side streets in front of a house and our car was safe. Come early as the parking really gets crazy later in the morning, also try not to go there on the first Saturday of the month as it gets extra busy! If you do not like crowds then avoid this market and rather come during the week, there will be less to see but it will be nice and quiet!"

Great place for local handicrafts also some brands & China imports (mainly in the shops), locals are in the market stall areas with high end lovely items. Go in hungry as there are so many amazing food choices, cheap and freshly made, breads, Asian, Italian, fresh oysters, cakes, fruit smoothies and much much more. Very crowded on Saturday when we visited, but the atmosphere is everything a community market should be. The buskers are delightful and fill your heart with music as you amble from place to place.Don't miss the coffee blenders or the chocolate factory .... Taste & but."

It was lovely and we wish we had more time to sample all the eats.My only concern is the parking. There are a number of vagrants trying to convince you to park in their spaces. One wanted R20 for a street parking! I refused but then moved my car as I was scared he would damage it in revenge.Street patrol men were fantastic and suggested safe and convenient off road parking in a college opposite the market for R10. I was incredibly grateful."

After having Coffee and Breakfast in a nice Cafe (forgot the name) we chanced upon a Local Chocolate manufacturing and selling company called CocoaFair. They sell delectable chocolates and chocolate related products at a very affordable prices. On inquiring further we were told that they actually import cocoa beans from Panama and manufacture everything from scratch. You can see the actual process of transforming chocolates from the coco beans in front of you.It also houses some of the best restaurants wherein the tables need to be booked 6 months prior to your visit. Sadly, we got to know about them pretty late and couldn't get any reservations. There were some nice shops selling beautiful stuff that were worth buying."

You can grab a coffee or glass of bubbly to enjoy while you peruse all of the food options or shop for local goods.Don't miss Cocoafair on the ground floor of the silo - you can't miss the smell of their incredible chocolate and once you taste some samples, you'll surely want some to bring home. The food stalls had tons of options - wood-fired pizzas, incredible looking burgers, kebabs, fresh fruits, handmade ice cream... I could go on and on. Its definitely a popular spot but not nearly as crammed as Borough Market in London.Parking is tough - I recommend taking Uber instead."

This old Biscuit Mill offers nice small shops in one place to stroll around looking for souvenirs of better quality than in the market at the center. You avoid hawkers and can have a chat with the people in the shops. It is a nice environment to be in. If you go around the neighbourhood, Woodstock you will find something more exciting than mainstream shopping att Waterfront. There are designer shops and places with edge."

The food selection is on par with London's Borough Market and the food offerings were amazing (thin crust pizza, breakfast in a pan, belgian waffles, shashuka, wagyu beef burgers, gourmet hotdogs, coffee, crepes, sushi, asian dim sum, korean food). We wished we could eat them all. Takeaway food offerings such as cheese, biltong, coffee beans were also available. Shopping wise - the leather crafts, home wares, gourmet chocolates, jewellery were amazing. I am particularly impressed with the quality of the leather goods here at affordable prices (if you look hard enough some vendors also offer personalisation of the leather goods and if you stay long enough you can request for a custom made item).

Go on a Saturday when the Neighbour Goods market is on - the food and choices are astounding. In the Biscuit Mill itself you'll find the famous Taste Kitchen - but beware you have to book months in advance to get a table! The Pot Luck Club is s bit better with a waiting list of a few weeks. Don't despair, the shopping and coffee shops will happily entertain you"

There are also shops selling clothes and craft goods that must be open all week and also restaurants and live music. It is fun and vibrant and you can easily spend half a day here. I believe you can get to it by bus but it is easy by car too. There are pretty well organised guys who will find you a parking space and look after your car. It seems to work ok and only costs a pound or so and seems safe. One of the top restaurants in town is here too."

Why don't we have something so magical? I don't understand.First - it is only on Saturday! So you have to get there! Plenty of local street parking.Second - you see all of the pop up tables and chairs magically appear if you get there early.Thirdly - as the crowds start forming and the food starts being cooked you will think you are in a food orgy and be very happy.I saw GIANT pans of paella cooking in the open air, stalls of fresh mushrooms that you can take away fresh or purchase as a kabob cooked over a fire.A wood stove in the back of a truck to cook fresh pizza - made to order. I had the fresh oysters from the Atlantic Ocean from Mother Shuckers Oysters! Served with a champagne shooter. OH DIVEN!Plates piled high of Mediterranean cuisine!, Fresh sushi next to an Eggs Benedict station, next to a flower stall, next to a pastry seller, beside a mile high meatball sandwich vendor and the smells are all just making your mouth to want more!I saw fresh cinnamon sticks as long as your arm! All different colors of fresh local honeys. Buckets of freshly cured olives and stalls of bread that you just wanted to take home! Oh my! I am hungry just thinking of the glorious bounty!Do put this on your must do list if you are a foodie and plan to eat a few meals that will last you for the entire day.There are also many local vendors near by selling hand made shoes, stone carved birds, horn items, and sunglasses! A little bit for any local or traveler! Don't miss this and get there early!I also ate the day before in the SAME - OLD BISCUIT MILL building at the Pot Luck Restaurant.

Then he pestered us for 10min demanding that we must pay him and when we refused he cursed us and walked away which was really unpleasant. Think they need to come up with something more fair and regulated.

Prepare yourself to be there for several hours because there is so much to eat, drink, listen, and see; it is a truly incredible local experience for a visitor. If you are a coffee lover, I definitely will recommend you to start your day having a delicious cup of coffee at Espresso Lab Microroasters (it is is yummy and the staff is super friendly). If you would like to shop high quality artisan products, mainly made locally, please visit Saucisse Boutique Deli, this is a lovely family own deli and they truly have fantastic products including olives, chili sauces, marmalades, to name a few.

If you'd like to \"shop\", visit during the week. Otherwise it's just a trendy spot to gather for cocktails in a dodgy area. We decided to walk to an outside spot for coffee ( long lines inside). There was a nice coffee shop not far away. The entire area is very dodgy, after leaving the coffee shop a group of youths tried to steal our backpacks, we yelled and fought them off and some locals driving by stopped their cars in the road, one wonderful women drove us out of this area. If you feel the need to go, take a taxi direct to/from the entrance!"

We shopped in all the shops and bought some fun souvenirs. A safari inspired pillow cover (easier to stuff in a suitcase then the whole pillow) from Art Lab a digital print shop with wonderful images for sale from stickers to wall art and everything in between.

Don't make the mistake of eating before coming, as you will immediately regret not being able to take full advantage of all the gastronomical delights that await you. Also, don't forget to bring a tote bag - plastic bags are nonexistant!"

Open on Saturdays from 09h00 \u2013 14h00. Parking is in the street or at the school opposite the street (accessed by the street south of the market). One will find clean toilets and one ATM where one can withdraw cash.The food market offers a plethora of interesting food and drink for sale with live entertainment. Seating is provided. A d\u00e9cor and clothing market provides artistic flair, plus there are several shops at the Biscuit Mill with further shopping options. It is a very busy market, arrive as early as you can, take cash, keep a seat for your fellow diners and leave. The crowds are a bit too much. Don\u2019t take a pram, wheelchair or pet.Ideal for buying a good loaf at bread to enjoy at home. Tourists love this market."

We very much enjoyed the diversity and also the atmosphere you can encounter there. It is ideal to spent a morning or even the whole day just strolling through the grounds looking for little gems which, I am certain, can always be found. It is also a great place to meet up with friends and have a nice chat over some incredible food although the fried chili that I ate was a bit too spicy ;) It can get very crowded, especially on the weekends, but this only goes to show how extremely popular the Old Biscuit Mill is - and justly so!"

I have visited the Old biscuit mill twice in the recent two months, as I was new to the city, a few friends recommended me to this well-known market. When you walk into the market, you are immediately drawn to the lovely scent of coffee from the pop-up cafes, as you walk into the market's courtyard, you are exposed to so much scents that will make your mouth water. The live music and laughter from the visitors invites you to go further. Inside market, from waffles to dim sum, pizzas to kimchi, you will witness food around the world made fresh in front of you, wines from the finest vineyards, fresh ingredients to stock up your kitchen. It is unquestionably the foodie heaven.Pros: Tons of amazing food that will spoil your senses. If you are looking for rare ingredient to experiment in the kitchen this is the place to find them. (I have found plantain, truffles, fresh duck...) Cons: The area is heavily gentrified, the exact same food item at different market will cost a lot more here. Parking on street is difficult to find, nearest on-street parking from blocks away will cost you a good R20. Beware of pickpockets, as this is perhaps the busiest place to be on a Sat.Tip: Bring cash, draw cash ahead before going to the market, the only StandardBank ATM on site is always busy with queues like it's China. Download snapscan if you want to avoid taking too much cash. If you don't want to get there early, then try not to drive, take public transport, I mean Uber."

This market is upscale and is clearly targeted for a certain type of audience, a large number of whom are tourists. This food is a little on the pricier side but includes rare and artisanal foods that are all very delicious. We ate everything from veggie sandwiches and springbok jerky to artisanal bread and pizza. However, one should keep in mind the type of market Old Biscuit Mill aims to be and who this space welcomes and who it excludes.

Whilst visiting Cape Town regularly, only recently I became aware of the area of Woodstock, just east of the city centre, developing as the trendy place of this metropolis. This former (and still) mainly industrial area is rapidly upgrading, with trendy shops, restaurants and cafes going there.Old Biscuit Mill is the focal point of the area. It is indeed a lovely and very tasteful upgrade of this old industrial complex. Being the first, it has attracted a nice selection of outlets. Really worth a visit. But ... very much at risk being overrated. I had a look at the Test Kitchen restaurant, a place where in the meantime you have to book 6 months in advance. At least it did not look spectacular, nothing like similarly reputed establishments I know in Europe. But, the chef's philosophy is very interesting, it seems his success is well deserved.Most of Albert Road still is industrial, as a whole the area is nothing I would expect from a vibrant upcoming hotspot. But property prices go high, so maybe in a year all will be different."

I can imagine many tourist liking it: afterall it is cosmopolitan, energetic, young, vibrant and, in places, very vegetarian, vegan and Eco-friendly. But I find this very exclusive for a market that is located on the border of Woodstock, a neighborhood that is very inclusive but also becoming quite a place to visit.I went with my three young daughters and the shops were not very attractive for any of us. They were more like boutiques than market stalls. There was only one part set up like stalls and I would feel more comfortable shopping there. There were practically no attractions or play area for kids....so that takes care of that as a family venue.The tent with the food stalls wee the most refreshing part. It was very crowded and you had to wait for a place to open up on the bench. Still, this was the part my children enjoyed the most. people talked to them and merchants were very nice. It felt like a market....which was gravelly lacking in the other parts of the market. We are regular visitors at the Oranjezicht City Farm Market on Saturdays and I was hoping we would find another alternative. But the Old Biscuit Mill does not come close. Here kids cannot play and run around and the whole thing seem set up for tourists to get a feel of \"home away from home\". I will probably return but definitely not with kids and only when I'm in the mood to rub noses with tourists."

Food is accompanied by live music and a number of beer/wine stalls. With the food, you are really \"spoiled for choice\" and I think I could happily have eaten the food from any of the stalls.One drawback is that it is incredibly crowded, it is well out of Cape Town and parking is hard to come by. Better to take a taxi: driver tried to charge us ZAR 70 on way back but should only be ZAR 50 - should really have insisted on the meter! The other drawback is that because it is so crowded, it is very difficult to find a place to sit at one of the long, informal benches along the middle of the halls. It would probably work OK if everyone just got their food and looked for space, but of course what happens is that one person in each group nabs spaces for their entire group so what spaces there are are taken by \"saved\" places. (Sorry, just a small moan about life in general!)We were told that it finishes at 1pm, but was still going strong after 2pm. We went to this market last time we were in Cape Town (2 years ago) and would certainly go again."

You can take a tour of the chocolate making process from beginning to end in their shop. Definitely arrive early to the Neighbourgoods market and try to find the hidden parking lots around the market because it is a shady area and I was glad to be in a group of 5 people walking back to our car.

The jazz band playing when we arrived was great, as were some kids with buckets just outside the entrance. Walking through the two food courts was extremely difficult, for two reasons. First there are tons of people and everyone is trying to look at the food stalls on both sides as they walk making it quite congested. Second, is that i couldn't decided what food i wanted everything looks and smells amazing!!! I ended up trying several tasters that were out there, but did buy a waffle with bacon inside it, and also a chicken kebab, the green chili sauce was so good. Both the waffle and kebab were excellent, tried 3 different smoothies between us and all were great. I especially liked the lemon and mint. I got a red velvet cupcake from the queen of tarts and it was nearly perfect. We had a great time walking around down there for about 2 hours.

However, this is a formula repeated in many places I have visited to a greater or lesser extent that it even feels at times like a franchise but maybe that's just globalisation for you.

Of course, this is very much not all of the greatness that Cape Town offers and you could easily feel when you visit that you are in a corner of California dumped onto a pretty poor (though perhaps up-and-coming) neighbourhood. Whether you love that or have mixed feelings about it is up to you, though personally I hope that this place retains its feeling of being part of the community, not a separate enclave it.

We were keen to visit the Old Biscuit Mill on the only Saturday we were in Cape Town, and followed the advice of other travellers and arrived early (and hungry). At 9am it wasn't too crowded and that gave us an opportunity to look at the food stalls, where all the produce is beautifully presented. We picked up juice, coffee and some pastries to keep us going while we decided what we wanted for bruch an hour or so later.By 10am, it was filling up, so we just perched wherever we could, asked other people to shuffle up a bit so that we could sit together (which they happily did) and just soaked up the atmosphere. The vibe is great, people are chatting and catching up with friends, stallholders are explaining their food to potential buyers, kids are everywhere, there's live music playing - just fantastic.Although we stuffed ourselves full, and took cake home for later in the day, we would have loved to stay in Cape Town longer to do it all over again! If you, like me, love food, then this is a 'must' on your itinerary. Australians will find the prices very reasonable, and the choices are extensive.The shops at the Market are also excellent - I bought lots of Christmas gifts while I was there, and was impressed with the quality and price. In particular, it was great to find goods that were not mass-produced. Yes, you pay a little more than you would at a roadside stall, but this was more like a 'Handmade' market in Australia, where the person you are buying from is the person who has made the bag/jewellery/clothes.As for transport, we had a car for a couple of days during our stay, so drove to the Markets and parked on Albert Road. We just did what the locals do, and paid R20 ($2) to a guy on the street to watch the car - this is a normal practice in South Africa and we did it a lot without any issues."

The Old Biscuit Mill is only open on Saturdays, and I highly recommend building an itinerary around this. You don't need too much time to get the full experience, 2-3 hours is plenty of time to eat and shop. The amount of food options is overwhelming and there are some great craft and jewelry finds from local vendors. Definitely go with an empty stomach and a full wallet!"

It's in gentrified Woodstock, which is a 15-min taxi ride from central Cape Town. It reminds me of Shoreditch or Spitalfields Market in London. The ceramics, in particular, are very stylish and reasonably-priced. There's also a fabulous coffee shop and roastery. Woodstock is not the most salubrious of areas, but you can see how and why it's the coolest neighbourhood in Cape Town. Shopping within the Old Biscuit Mill complex is safe as there are security guards at the entrance. Definitely worth a mooch. Wished we'd been there on a Sat when there's a lively market."

This time (was over Christmas season) it seemed to be even more busy than before but my daughter is older (6yrs) and handled the experience with enthusiasm. The last time I went she was 3yrs old and hated the crowds and made it very uncomfortable for us. I don't recommend you take babies and toddler with.Food is excellent, loads of taste samples. I don't recommend buying crafts - leave it to the tourists. The highlight is the food halls. Food halls, cocktails, mocktails, asian and fusion, sweets, waffles, paella, craft beers, freshly opened coconuts where you can drink the milk with a straw, schwarmas, sushi, the frying dutchman (loved his name),fresh produce, fudge,.... all jammed into a small space.If you enjoy crowds... then a definite place to visit!There is an ATM onsite, but there are always long queues. A couple should bring about R500 if they want to try and buy a few things. Very Very easy to spend money here!Parking is insane, so best to find one of those annoying guys trying to sell off free parking 2 blocks away. (R20) I do recommend telling these guys that you will pay them on your return if your car is safe and unscratched. Technically it is free parking but the crazed guys take there spots rather seriously and they are willing to let you pay later if you stand your ground politely. There are some small stores with nice arty vibes you can pop in on your walk to the buscuit mill. There is also a weird little diner/bar hidden along your walk. The area is not the gratest but on the days of the market the area seems safe and viby because of the many tourists and visitors and has a completely different atmosphere."

The Neighbourhood Goods market operates at the Old Biscuit Mill between 9am - 2pm on Saturdays only so we planned a half day around this, and we were so glad we did! The Old Biscuit Mill houses many wonderful restaurants (needing months in advance bookings, FYI) and many shops. The best part is the sheer number of local producers, be it in wine, fashion, or food. There's a ton of local designers to view and shop, and prices are very reasonable. There's also a lot of beer, wine and food choices so come hungry, for breakfast or for lunch. Parking is terrible but you'll be able to find a spot along the street if you come early. And do come early, when we got there by 10am everything was already in full swing, the streets were already clogged with cars and we had to park one street over. The place is not that large, and it gets really, really crowded, so come prepared for that too."

Don't have breakfast and head straight here ready to eat and drink and take in the sights and sounds,(for Londoners it reminds me a bit of a Borough Market in Shorditch!)"

Man showed sparking spot in road, very polite and told us not to leave a thing valuable on show in car and lock in boot/ trunk, gave him small tip for his helpfulness and keeping eye on car. Place was buzzing when we went on a Saturday morning in December. lots of stalls and shops could have purchased lots but have to carry them home on plane. Oh forgot some places will ship large items for you direct to your home. Food well to much to explain just loads of all types of stalls / tables / types being cooked hot / cold ,drinks of all types and sizes , even free samples !!! Spent a good two hours looking around stall and shops we found had very friendly staff.. Just make sure infusing own transport take care and go early.. !!!"

Well you don't have to go very far, The Old biscuit Mill will take you on an international cuisine experience whilst doing this amongst tourists from all over the world. There's too much to choose from. You only difficulty would be finding a seat to eat all these treats. There is local craft beers, cocktails at 10am is quite the experience at the Old Biscuit Mill. Not to mention the Test Kitchen,SA's No 1 resturant is in the same area and they have a delightful poached egg and salmon on offer at the market itself. You will find trendy little stores inbetween, and enough of an atmosphere to believe you in any other country and still have the Cape Vibe and amazing friendliness. Its a must for me as a local and the summers are divine. Can't wait for my next visit...been eyeing the oysters and champagne."

We however drove, and had to park along a busy side alley. There are numerous food vendors selling produce and food. If you do purchase food - you may want to get there early - otherwise you will have to eat standing up - as seating places are limited. If that doesn't grab your fancy - there are some quirky shops selling local goods.We had lunch at the Pot Luck Club (see my review) - which sits atop the old biscuit mill. The views from this establishment are stunning! This is a nice attraction - however it gets quite busy and is a tourist mecca. There are some nice shops outside - along the road as well. If you are planning a visit - get there early"

They don't have only a food market of course, but lots of shops with clothes, art&design stuff etc. as well.

Come on a Saturday Morning and join the masses for food and shopping stalls at the Old Biscuit Mill. Great atmosphere, great food, quirky stalls and shops. However, it has become so popular, that you might want to go somewhere else on a Saturday morning for the food (e.g. one of the numerous markets in the area, e.g. Hout Bay Harbour Market, Slow Food Market in Stellenbosch etc.) and come to stroll around the great quirky shops on a weekday! If you are limited on time (which most Cape Town visitors are - just too much do to and see) and can only make it to one weekend market this is a good choice, but a bit too busy and popular for my liking. Personally I liked the Hout Bay Habour Market better. Sort of the same, but a bit less crowded, a bit more locals with food, shopping stalls and atmosphere being en par with this place."

The mill has been converted into shops and design studios with a deli, wine shop, coffee shop and some great clothing shops. These alone are worth a visit and the fountain in the main square will keep the kids fascinated. Try the coffee at the micro espresso bar. Great coffee and even better service from the staff. The market was mainly a foodie market with every type of food from sushi to steak! Reasonably priced too. Grab a bite to eat and a glass of wine and watch the people. Or get there early to avoid the crowds and have breakfast and feel superior that you have a prime table! \u263a"

As soon as we got out of the car, we were swallowed up in a crowd. Maybe if it were less chaotic it would be more enjoyable but I found the busyness oppressive. On the plus side, there is a great selection of fresh food in the market section and lots of interesting things to buy for the home. I would probably come here to shop for home decor if I actually lived in Cape Town.I would say that this is a place better enjoyed by couples rather than families and one of the few lauded places that I would say to give a miss if you have young kids with you."

This is not really a market where you come and buy produce to take home, or where you come looking for artsy souvenirs. Yes, there are a couple of stalls selling clothes, shoes, one selling flowers, one selling veggies. And there are a couple of small stores around the \"market square\" (including a great photografic store). The main reason to come however are the many many stalls selling food and drinks. Come hungry ! You can pretty much eat or drink everything, from fresh oysters with a glass of bubbly (lovely and very cheap - at least for swiss standards), via paella, bretzels, hot dogs, tarte flamb\u00e8, belgian craft beer, lovely local wine, chinese dim sum and much more.The atmosphere at the market is very relaxed and its a fantastic place for people watching.

The food hall is just filled with food from all over the word, all seemingly excellent standard. Paella, sushi, all kinds of beer, cheeses, fruit and veg, all kinds of amazing cakes and buns. We ended up opting for a very tasty gourmet burger with some pear champagne with pomegranate seeds from another stall. We were sadly too full for dessert after that but got a selection of macaroons to take away which we ate later on Camp's Bay beach :-). It has a great atmosphere, very crowded but just buzzing, and food is eaten at big long communal tables. There are also a good selection of craft shops, wine, art, jewellery, furniture etc. We only wished we'd gotten there a bit earlier than we did to enjoy it for longer."

The vibe is just energetic and you almost feel like, even though everyone is strangers, you belong. There is different food choices and different values, and amazing smoothies and coffee and wine options. Everything looks so delicious you just want to buy buy buy.The last time we were here was after the two ocean's, and we bought some yummy food to get our energy levels back up!What is great about this market is that you can either spend like 3hours here, or pop buy for a quick visit, buy some yummy food and drive somewhere scenic for a picnic."

Overall the mill does not deliver to the expectations that I would expect from a food niched destination for the following reasons;Many of the stalls are staffed by learners/ helpers which effects the consistancy of food delivery. Whilst there is an amazimg variety available I get the impression that everything is priced/ margined to the max resulting in my opinion on a pretty expensive Saturday morning out for brekky! Very little change for R500 drawn at the local ATM is expensive for 2 people! R15 bucks for a 500 ml bottle of water is unreasonable. This in itself will not phase me if the culinary experience matched Meinhard's in Vancouver or for that matter Giovanni's in Greepoint. The coffee machine broke down( and if any barrista had to look at the condition of the machine he would refuse to operate it). Cape Town is perceived to be SA's premium coffe destination- so this oversight is really not up to speed. Yes, the breads and the fresh fruit and range of goods are impressive. HOWEVER my takout perception is that the mill is punching above its weight at the moment. I will not be going back in a hurry."

If you're in Cape Town on a Saturday, then The Old Biscuit Mill is a MUST! On Saturdays from 9am-2pm, the old mill fills with local restauranteurs and businesses. Think of a smorgasbord of delicious flavors from all over the world. Everything from Indian, to Greek to Chinese to Cape Malay...wines, beers, fresh juices, pastries, the list goes on. You could easily spend the whole time here eating, all the food is locally sourced and made and worth the 10 minute cab ride from the city center. The food vendors take cash only but there's an ATM onsite too. Highly recommend trying the potato latke with slow roasted lamb, the homemade fudge guy and the Indian curries booth. In addition to the amazing food, a lot of local designers come in on Saturdays as well in order to sell their designs. They have jewelry, bags, wallets, belts, luggage, clothes, shoes, etc. Very boutiquey type stuff that they sell for a lot cheaper at the market versus in the big stores on Long Street. You save money by buying the item at the Biscuit Mill versus buying the same item in the stores on Long Street. Great for going alone or with a big group. The Biscuit Mill is also open throughout the week but the food vendors and the boutique designer stalls are only there on Saturdays. MUST DO...especially for great people watching :)"

The biggest issue with the place is trying to decide what to eat. There are so many amazing food stalls that choosing just one (or even two) things is overwhelming. However, once you've made your selection, going outside to enjoy it in the sunshine makes for an absolutely divine way to spend the day. There are also drinks available, so doing a little Saturday afternoon day drinking outside is something I will definitely put on my agenda for my next trip to Cape Town. Absolute gem!"

In this nicely located food market with space to sit and enjoy your food you will have a hard time to decide how to fill the limited space your stomach offers. Add to this the design market with beautiful, though pricey, hand crafted items and two hours will have passed before you know it."

The best way to get there on a Saturday is by cab, or if you have to park, use the parking at the College opposite.

Freshness.The atmosphere is fabulous, too much to sample from the genuine French, cheeses by the mile, pastries, other foreign cuisines, jams and bottled heavenly fruits, the list goes on and on. Certainly can while away an hour or two quite happily.Parking is a pain unless you are either early or lucky, but it's fun and lively and a great Saturday start. Enjoy !"

It would seem however that the food market is the key to this attraction's success. The decor / craft shops mostly felt the same - same style of product etc. The staff inside the decor shops were disinterested and glued to their phones. Some didn't even look up when we walked in and greeted them. No one tried to make a sale. The few food establishments that were open midweek were however very friendly. Would only therefore recommend this as a must do if in Cape Town on extended stay and only on a Saturday."

I had read about in the guide book but didn't have it down to see. Thank heavens, Zakkie di!Vendors set up their food, drinks, samples of fruit, cheeses, and fresh foods, like a super market all under this one roof. What an experience to walk around and see the various kinds of food! There were so many ethnic foods to try as well, and it was a fun morning.It was great to meet the locals as well and a few college students. We had some crepes with eggs and ham rolled up, fresh squeezed o.j, coffee and just soaked up the atmosphere.It was chilly and rainy that day but we loved it! I think many people may miss this but they should put in on the things to do while in Cape Town. What a treat!"

I went to see the Old Biscuit Mill on a weekday and I found it very relaxing. There are a couple of shops and one or too restaurants. The popular one is supposed to be very good but they were full. The next place was mediocre and wasn't doing much business at all. The espresso bar looks really good but I did not like the espresso so that was a downer. The wineshop is excellent, they sell many many wines that I know of or heard of that are great, Other shops there are all part of the same setting, semi arty which is fun but after one or two hours you'll have seen enough. I recommend visiting only if you happen to be in the area, don't go out of your way to see the Old Biscuit Mill on a weekday."

It's worth it just to come here for breakfast. It seems every nationality is represented in the food halls, with people preparing mouth-watering fresh food in front of you. You can slurp an oyster and sip champagne at a long table next to people eating Bratwurst sausage or Belgian chocolate tarts. It's buzzy, busy and friendly. But you MUST get there early if you want to find a parking spot. We went twice, around 8.30am, and it was already humming."

As the latter was rated the 49th best restaurant in the world and the best in Africa, I tried my luck at a booking but as could be expected, the restaurant was booked till mid July for dinner. The market had the most wonderful food with a variety and a difference. The market is busy and space is limited to move. Leave the pram outside. Inside is a great vibe. The arts and crafts are local and delightfully there are no Chinese cheap imports so regularly found at markets in South Africa as such goods are being dumped in South Africa. Enjoy!"

We missed the Saturday Neighbourgoods market (www.neighbourgoodsmarket.co.za), but you still have an excellent choice of eateries: Saucisse Boutique deli, The Test Kitchen and The Pot Luck Club \u2013 you need to book! We liked the \u2018Plush Props\u2019 store, which had wooden plates we spotted in many Franschhoek restaurants.Worth a visit to this place, if you wish to find that something extra above the standard souvenir shacks in Waterfront/Bay Harbour area. There are many creative/advertising agencies based around here so the look and feel is more chic!"

The Biscuit Mill is super fun and vibey on a Saturday with amazingly tantalizing food to choose from for brunch/ lunch or to snack on. Be warned if you have food allergies p, e.g. gluten intolerant. There is very little for you to choose from and the place is so rammed with other hungry people, that very few have the patience for you to ponder what to do; they'll either elbow you out the way, steal your seat, or shrug and move on to the next, seemingly more interesting person behind you in the queue."

There are 2 areas next to one another that sell food for breakfast / lunch, this can be eaten on tables provided in the area of the foods stalls. Great for chatting to other people visiting. There are also items to take home eg olives breads cakes etc etc, all looked amazing. There are also stalls / shops to visit selling all manner of items, clothes, sunglasses, home items, African goods and much more. Late morning a jazz band played in the courtyard, a great pan to chill and enjoy. A must for Cape Town visitors or locals."

The food markets are full with a variety of choice from a great steak sandwich, a selection of omelettes, local craft beers, cheeses, confectionery, sushi, flatbreads and pizzas.I found the whole experience both great value for money and great fun.There are also some great shops and restaurants in the mill... We had a quick drink and a pizza but take a walk around the courtyard and you will find a great art studio, a stunning patisserie shop and a great wine merchant with lots of choice.The beauty of this really is that male or female, young or old, tourist or local, you have something for everyone....Loved it and if you are reading this as a tourist then it's a safe, inexpensive and excellent way to spend a few hours on a Saturday,"

We went here to go to Test Kitchen and then came back on Saturday when the Neighborhood Food Market opened at 9 and ate breakfast there. make sure to go when it opens cause it gets super crowded and is truly a treat. Then we stayed fro a few hours to shop the unique stores, many of which showcase designers that are also available at SAM on Bree street. Was an excellent day, with live music, beer, shopping food and a great vibe. When I return to CT this will be the first place I go back to."

By the time you've finished your artisan breakfast the crowd will be in action, but you'll feel relaxed and ready for the day."

Well almost everything coz their prices are so affordable. My dessert choice. The lady who sells cake! Carrot cake slice for only 20 rands! Ooh so good.. And she make sthe best chai latte in cpt! The secret she told me , was that she mixes her own chai spices, I wrote the recipe somewhere and I lost it! Must ask her again next time I'm there.If u are a non alcohol drinker like me, there's a ladywith a rooibos tea (cold) stand , it is the most refreshing drink ever!

Do you feel like champagne and oysters for breakfast? no problem. How about an amazing rosti with smoked salmon, poached egg and hollandaise sauce? sure! Bagels, biltong, dumplings, fudge, freshly brewed coffee, HUGE fresh paninis with every topping under the sun, jams, olives, cheese, pastries, fresh juices & smoothies, fresh flowers, organic produce... the list goes on! Everything is made with the highest quality and freshest of ingredients. It's one of those places where you could spend all day. Go for breakfast, stay for lunch and leave with a bunch of ingredients that could see you through afternoon tea and dinner. My tip would be to get there as the market opens at 9am, as by 10am it is already packed liked sardines! Also make sure you take a walk through the suburb of Woodstock, there's great vintage and furniture stores."

The best part was being in the atmosphere sharing long tables with strangers and buying local produce from the growers... yummy chorizo, cakes and olive jams etc. The shops selling clothes and art were a bit pricey and we didn't see anything at caught our eye.

The highlight is, however, the enormous food/ fresh produce hall with interesting and delicious foods and desserts, beers and wines.

Included in the selection were 2 chickens the size of small turkeys, Karoo lamb, which is almost on a par with Welsh lamb,some excellent steaks, and the best veal chops that I have tasted in many years.

OBM has evolved over the past 3 years, from a small neighbourhood market to the most hip, see-and-be-seen Saturday morning pilgrimage worshiped by locals & travelers! Has it become a tourist trap? Local residents like myself will argues YES - over priced food, artisan produce and fashion. Avoid the market after 9:30am if you get claustrophobic among crowds, because you will feel like you are in a sardine can.That being said, it is still a great one-stop market experience to showcase Cape Town's glory. OBM's restored mill adds to its rustic charm, the vendors there have the highest quality produce, preserves, meats, fish, you name it. Come people-watching and mingle with a diverse crowd, beer gardens are a summer-hit and its a guaranteed good time. Enjoy with a pinch of salt, as OBM's price tag does limit itself to a certain demographic of visitors."

People who visit are young adults, and university students, but folks come with their young kids and parents too.Bring cash, R100-R200 there's only one ATM - which wasn't working when I was there.Must Eat - prices average R35 per meal and R15 per coffee/hot choc and R30 per smoothie: - Grilled Mushrooms (try the pink oyster)- Fresh Smoothies (try the peanut-butter smoothie)- Organic coffee and chocolate (try the \"hot-cold\" hot choc and the Sumatra coffee)- Home-made ice-cream (try the banana flavour)It gets very crowded, so try to be there at 10h00 on a Saturday - it's not open on a Sunday. You'll struggle to find a place to sit and eat and many people actually just sit on the floor outside, which is totally acceptable at the OBM. Soft-close is at 12h00, you really don't want to be there after that, stalls close off soon after."

A year round market (not just for tourists) housing local men's and ladies fashion, children's quirky gifts and there are shops that are open 6 days a week (pottery, decor, gifts, clothing) when the market is not on. There are a couple of award winning restaurants, book to be sure for a table. Parking is available during the week in the Mill but not on a Saturday. Taxi;s are available just outside, if you are a visitor be sure to get a licensed one or a fixed price. Please be careful with your bags as during peak times it can attract pick pockets (sadly!)..

Bear in mind that to have your african experience you will have to ignore the real african street children who sat wtaching you drink your organic coffee. In a nutshell this is the fakest place on earth. it is ridiculous. Yummy mummy hell"

Restaurants/Food: We walked around to sample the food - we found all the vendors to be extremely friendly and willing to allow one to taste the food before buying. I highly recommend skipping breakfast because the variety of food is incredibly tasty! Everything from dips, crepes, paella, fine wines, beers, ciders .......

Some things are priced very well, so you CAN get some good deals! Beware of tourist prices though. Enjoy!"

My daughter lived in Cape Town for six months and raved about this place and so when we went over to visit here, this was one of the first places she took us too. The mill and shops are open every day, but the best part (the food stalls) are only open on Saturdays to about 2pm so this is when people go.Parking can be a problem, but there are of course car guards everywhere to help you find a spot on the nearby streets. We went on 2 consecutive Saturdays. In fact, I made a night-time 10 and a half hour power drive from Bloemfontein just to get back in time to go to the Old Biscuit Mill one last time before flying home. Go early to avoid the big crowds and to secure a spot to sit. No matter what kind of food you like, you will find something satisfying here."

I don't think I will ever get tired of visiting this foodie heaven. Generally we tend to get there very early to avoid the crowds and enjoy the market before the crowds flock in. My personal foodie journey through the market starts with an Origin coffee,fruit salad and yoghurt from the smoothie stall and then a smoothie as well as whatever else tickles my fancy. One generally cannot leave with a little take-away something too! On this trip to the market my cousin and I shared a most delicious seafood paella as well as the mushroom kebab!!!! Soooo good. We did try the sangria too and this time my take-away treat was something very different. It wasn't from the actual food stalls but from one of the little shops at the Mill. I took home some \"ginger-beered\" flavored Wilson's toffees and a puffnut sweet. You don't find those puffnut sweets in the supermarkets anymore. The market is a fantastic place for people watching while you explore different types of cuisines and treats. It does get super crowded so I would recommend getting there at about 8:45 or heading there at about 1:30. Enjoy!"

The are a lot of different food vendors with local, homemade, creative offerings - for a Foodie, the experience is awesome. However, I would not go back if food was not a focus - the rest of the place is fairly pretencious, expensive, full of \"beautiful people\", and generally not terribly interesting. We did not feel that the place was over-crowded, but we did have to leave by 11am - maybe it gets jampacked later in the day. We are already looking forward to going back (probably many times) and will spend a lot more time exploring the food section - and we will make sure to go hungryIn summary, Old Biscuit Mill is brilliant for food but weak for everything else..."

Drive closer to 375( the house address) and it was easy to find closer parking in a small lot. For R10. That's lekkarThe place was busy before 10:30 but it was such a lively crowd. And food. Lots of food to choose from. I want to make note of the smoothie stand that sold pomegranate juice. Best tasting juice forR80 1 ltr. Was worth it. The pizza although too early to eat for me looked divine. And I went for the omelette station. Mmmm delicious. Finding a seat may be tricky but it was all amazing and we are heading back next Sat. The fruits and veggies were a little bit more costly than i have bought at other markets. Great food. And I will check out the shopping on my return visit. I could spend my day here. I agree.

There is a huge food hall with fresh produce, selling everything from wraps, oysters, hams, sandwiches, fruits, smoothies, breads and dips. Absolutely everything and plenty of opportunity for free tasting. The chocolate shop is worth a visit for some unusual tasting chocolate. I also did the chocolate tour, a 1 on 1 tour with the manager, which was excellent and their ice cream is to die for.It's a very busy place so keep your valuables safe and secure in case of pickpockets.

We also picked up some delicious custard pies for later. There are also some great custom & vintage furniture stalls, handicraft shops, and accessory boutiques. The Old Biscuit Mill is a great place where the locals flock on Saturdays. We had a rental car, and we found parking on a side street. Located in an old repurposed mill, visitors can be a little nervous about the sketchy neighborhood, but it is perfectly safe with hundreds of market-goers milling about on Saturday as mentioned in a previous review.

We had quiet a walk to the mill but we were with friends and it was daylight so wasn't an issue.It is very busy and probably not such a great place for small kids, especially in the food section.

At first I was concerned about the area being a bit dodgy, but I've actually found it to be just fine. Although Saturdays at the market are busy, there is lots of parking on the nearby side streets. There are also lots of local people milling about the side streets, eager to direct you to a parking lot and charge you a small fee (e.g. R10) to look after your car."

A fun band was playing outside, and belly dancers performing. The food stalls were producing wonderful smells, which made choosing from all the wonderful foods and drinks that were on display, really difficult . Got a stuffed pita which was yummy, but had to stand and walk to eat it, as there was no seating by the time we got there. It was fun shopping with all the vendors there too. A must see for a Cape Town visit!"

The Old Biscuit Mill has a weekly food market on a Saturday morning from 9 to 1 - get htere early as it fills up and it is nicer to be seated than standing as you chomp on your rosti/ dim sum/ oysters....we had freshly squeezed juice, fine patisserie and good coffee as well as rostis with salmon and poached eggs and dim sum(fried alas, not steamed) We bought fresh asparagus and strawberries and if one had a limitless capacity we could have had pizza and oysters and espetada and so much more... pretty people, families, serene people... lovely."

Great alternative if you are looking for something different to the normal shopping centre experience ( Waterfront , Canal Walk , Cavendish etc). Stalls offer organic and homemade goodies and good alternative experience if you have 2 - 3 hours. Visit early as at 11 am , very , very busy. Try to go at 8am. Whilst there , visit the Good Hope Butchery which is close by for a great Chicken Tikka for only R17."

Meat, biltong (jerkey) which is delicious. Organic vegetables, chocolate. Coffees and long tables to sit at and eat your food. Wines to taste and buy by the glass, beer to taste and buy by the glass, inside the \"shed\" but be sure to get there when they open. 9 a.m. I think. Arrive late and it is a glorious crush of people's tasting, trying, seeing friends and just generally having a good time. They have a couple of restaurants outside fo the \"shed\", a wonderful coffee roastery, all sorts of fun things to see and to do. Too many to mention. Don't miss the opportunity of seeing the Biscuit Mill if you are in Cape Town on a Saturday morning."

Otherwise it becomes a slow moving human conveyor belt (fire hazard deluxe) that one has no choice but o get caught up in as the throngs of people move through the small passageways between the stalls. There is some good produce, and some yummy breakfasts to be had, but in my mind is overrated and not worth it unless you make a quick in and out, and where's the fun in that when you've come to a Saturday morning market?"

The clothing and housewares section is to your left when you enter the main gate, and the food and drinks are to your right. The shopping was fun with a few good finds in some of the shops that carry vintage goods... but the food market was INCREDIBLE! We stopped first and grabbed a drink at the Brewers Union stall. This is locally made beer, and actually they now have a tapas style restaurant in the city. Once in the main food area you're hit with a sea of color and smell. There are one after one booths of fresh produce, local cheese, artisan meats, juices, oysters, sausage... you name it! We ate our way through and then brought bags of food back to the hotel to finish off over the next few days. The scene is fun and lively. There are large communal tables to join and enjoy the snacks you just picked up. It's just a great way to spend a Saturday."

The shops were interesting but there were only a few of them. I think I was done in about an hour and then had to find a taxi back to my hotel (the security guards were of no help and I ended up having to call a taxi to come pick me up). Glad I went but really wish there was more to see."

The Neighbor Goods Market at Old Biscuit Mill is a great place to spend a Saturday morning, having brunch - treating your taste buds to some exquisite, sensory overloading tastes. It is every Saturday morning from 9h00 - 14h00. It's just a short drive from the city center. The atmosphere are warm and vibrant. The market serves fresh and locally produced, regional organic foods, hand-made cheeses, olives, home-made salami, sushi, tacos, crepes, smoothies, wine & luxury beers. I specially enjoyed the pomegranate smoothies and lamb & tuna burgers! There are plenty of large communal tables where you can enjoy your treats, unwrap your new purchases or just enjoy a bit of people-watching. Live music, the fresh flowers and herbs add to a vibrant atmosphere. There are also little shops selling, beads, jewelry, clothes etc. A ATM bank machine for drawing money are conveniently located. An excellent way to spend a Saturday morning!"
