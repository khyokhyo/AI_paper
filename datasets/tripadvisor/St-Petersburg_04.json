Being on a schedule, our RS guide was able to provide a comprehensive tour and explanation of the highlights of this fabulous collection of art. If you're doing this on your own, you could easily spend a few days here. Housed in a separate building across the square, is the equally wonderful Impressionists collection which has a tremendous number of works by Picasso, Matisse, and others.Only negative was the understaffed main cafe in the Hermitage where it took seemingly forever to get through line to choose a salad or sandwich. I think the smaller \"internet cafe\" had the same offerings and has quicker service."

The VAST sums of money spent on the Winter Palace and the Hermitage were deliberately designed to flaunt the wealth of the Romanov tsars: In doing so the grand rooms of the five linked by bridges buildings were filled with almost obscene amounts of treasures - mostly imported from Europe.Highlights must include the parquet floors, the chandeliers, amber, mirrors and furniture with pride of place going to the Renaissance paintings that included two da Vincis and 20 Rembrandts.Our three hour tour covered only a few of the 150 or so rooms and, amazingly, what we saw was the reconstructed version after the major fire in 1873 had destroyed so much of the vast interior. Clever Communists had saved the Hermitage from destruction during the Revolution and have since helped turn it into one of the biggest and richest tourist centres in the world.."

Take the 600 Rouble Ticket and the Audio Guide.. Tickets available on Vending Machines too at the entrance so no lines for tickets. Just tender exact amount. Like 1200 ( 1000 + 100 + 100 ) for two people.Dont buy tickets for students/child below 18 years. Carry either a photocopy of the Passport or the Original.. There is a separate counter for issuance of tickets for such Free Tickets in the Building."

It is so large and right now so much art is being moved about and into new and interim facilities that a guide is a good investment. Much of what we wanted to see had moved across the square and we would have not found it.The museum offers a behind the scenes tour, I would skip it. I have done this in other museums and it was great. Here it 25 minutes away and most of the really interesting stuff is in gas sealed rooms with solid doors so you see some minor items."

            "review": "Impossible Dream - Awake to Beauty beyond comprehension. So many reviews. Is it possible to provide a more compelling review. We visited with a private guide and gained entrance through the rear door, therefore no waiting. The guide knew of our interest in the hereditary succession of czars and rulers, so we spent a great deal of time with the portraits. This enabled a better understanding of the successions and the brutality of some of the czars in getting rid of opponents. But surely that was common in the times of royalty in any fiefdom. The guide then took us to the masterpieces of the museum, including the gold peacock and an overview of the famous paintings. To think that two Leonardo Da Vinci paintings are exhibited is quite astounding, with the Louvre in Paris, being the only other public museum to have more than one LDV.We were totally exhausted after three hours and could no longer absorb any more of the beauty and majesty of the museumJust looking at the floors, ceilings, walls, and lighting was enough to gauge the enormous cost and effort in building such an edifice.A must visit for any visitor to Russia, and I would add, it should be a must for anyone's bucket list."

In fact I enjoyed the structure as much or more than the art itself. Definitely spend several hours there preferably with a group for early (or after hour) admission to avoid the crowds. Prebooked tickets will avoid hours waiting in line especially in summer."

And, it was so wildly overcrowded, I would have walked out if I had not had my own personal guide. Imagine those palatial, over-decorated rooms you see in the pictures with 1500 people crowded in and more arriving every minute. This was like a super-gigantic NYC subway car at rush hour. Honestly, no kidding, this is NOT a place for claustrophobes. I made a choice in advance that I am so glad I did. I hired a guide for me alone. I debated about the group guide for a mere six people. But it was money well-spent to have my own personal guide. Truly, would you go into the jungle without a guide? It was like that. She knew where a place to sit was, a window to cool off next to, in the oppressive heat of bodies crammed together, which cloak room was fastest. Now she knew a lot about the art, too, but OMG so much of being there was about navigating through the crush. She even got me into a room with fewer (I said fewer, not few) people and you can look at a superb Lucas Cranach while you are there. Btw, she also did the lining up for tickets and so on, but I'm not even counting that. I went on a Tuesday, not too early, but before noon. I asked if there were ever a less crowded time, heavy snow, January, midweek?The answer was no, definitely not. This was standard. I paid $100. for the guide and she was worth every cent."

We had a tour guide (note:not a DOCENT) who led a \"speed-date\" overview with occasional stops to soak in the grandeur of rooms and the masters (Rembrandt & Rennaisance). Across the palace square is the museum which houses the Impressionists & post-Impressionists (only recently opened). BTW; the architecture inside this building is modern & eclectic with clean WC!Despite the crowds, everything seemed reasonable & orderly."

Hermitage is a truly masterpiece. There are so many unique exhibits there, so you won't have enough time ever to see them all properly, even if you go (like me) there almost every week. The most important for me there,that's not just a museum with priceless art pieces, that was a Winter Palace for Russians Emperors. The whole neighborhood awakens in you Imperial spirit. If you don't have much time, just try to go through and see the interiors and the most outstanding masterpieces and don't forget to have a look to the ceilings and flooring, as both sometimes not less incredible than art and sculpture. If you want to see unique incredible art and how people lived time ago with great sense of taste, you must visit Hermitage... Actually you just must anyway :)"

There is so much to explore here that you want to allow plenty of time.The architecture is just as inspiring as the displays. We didn't take a guide as we only had 3.5 hours to get around and that was not long enough. It was a very long walk and totally worth it, if you get the chance to see it all then do. I am going back in December to see the other half!!!The displays are over 3 floors, there are lifts at different points in the building though central stairs were magnificent to walk up. It can get very busy any noisy with the groups however there are so many rooms you should be able to work around them. There is a late night on Wednesday's that is supposed to be quieterThe cloakroom was a bit of a melee and the staff not particularly helpful especially not in English, so if you can avoid taking extra bags or coats then you can avoid the cloakroom.This was ranked in the top 10 museums in the world by National Geographic and I totally agree!"

We were in a group with a wonderfully knowledgeable guide for which we were grateful, but it was very crowded and actually you do not get to spend a lot of time in any rooms. The two Leonardo's were sublime little paintings and you can really look at them quite close. But in all you would need days to see anything in real depth. The impressionist collection is now held in another building within General Staff Headquarters across the Palace Square but we ran out of energy to take this on. Leaving and Getting your coats and bags can be a bun fight as numerous groups seem to do so at once. You have to see these buildings and maybe concentrate on just some of the art work."

I spent around 3 hours visiting the museum with no hope of seeing even what was exhibited. I got a good feel of the splendour that existed at the time of Catherine and a very strong desire to return to St Petersburg. We studied a guide before our visit and decided to view the \"Russian Culture\" exhibitions, as we have previously visited the British Museum (3) and the Louvre (2). We also viewed the \"Palace Interiors\" and much art displayed on the 1st floor. A visit to the Hermitage Museum and Winter Palace is a must when visiting St Petersburg, preferably spread over 2 days, if you can."

First of all, we spent four amazing hours exploring it and managed to see some 20% of it, barely scratching the surface of the magnificence that is the Hermitage. Tickets can be purchased at the automated machines located in the inner courtyard, right before the \"individual entrance\" sign. That means no cue!! After purchase, pass to the right of the gigantic cue waiting to buy a ticket and enter, strolling :) Get a book guide or audio and a free map of the place, we kinda got lost a few times. The palace itself is a wonder beyond comparison, the Louvres being a pale shadow, both in elegance and richness. If you're an art fan, they have dedicated section and hallways split by school (French, Flemish and so on). If you're into archaeology and history like myself, head to the ground floor section on Roman, Greek, Assyrian, pre-Roman, Egyptian - it's amazing. Top floor house some Japanese, Indian relics as well. We followed a book guide and went through some must see rooms, ballrooms, the church!, apartments, library, the malachite room (wow), Alexander's hall and so on, i can write a book on this. Pay attention to the thrones rooms (there are two), the general first floor architecture and elegance, and forget about time. I think anyone who hasn't seen this wonder should make it a priority. Oh, and there is that golden mechanical peacock clock that gets everybody gapping in awe."

            "review": "In a word, WOW\u263a. The full name is State Hermitage Museum, and consists of six buildings in the main museum complex: Winter Palace, Small/Old/New Hermitage, and Hermitage Theatre. All are open to the public, but foreign visitors pay substantially more than nationals. Entrance is, however, free the first Thursday of each month. The museum complex is closed Mondays. The main museum, Hermitage, is one of the largest and oldest in the world, founded in 1764 by Catherine the Great as a private museum, which has been open to the public since 1852\u2014a century before my birth.\u263a Some sources cite Hermitage as the world\u2019s second largest. With the world\u2019s largest collection of paintings, Hermitage has more than 3 million objects. It\u2019s said that if you spend three minutes admiring each object, you\u2019d be here for 14 years! Classical and Egyptian antiquities, jewelry, prehistoric art, exquisite porcelain, and sculptures populate rooms with 25-foot ceilings. Each room is dedicated to regions of art, such as paintings by Dutch masters, Italian/Greek sculptures, and an amazing coin collection that dates to the crusades and medieval times. There\u2019s far too much in this must-see museum to describe in a brief review, so I recommend visiting the museum\u2019s website and find the \u2018360 degree\u2019 feature. This allows anyone at no cost to view individual rooms\u2014without people gawking at these exquisite art objects. The only detraction I found was the hordes of people, as seen in some of the accompanying photos. I recommend a guided tour and arriving as soon as it opens. First visit the main Hermitage building, then Winter Palace, which has fewer visitors in the afternoon. A full day can be spent in each. Day? Make that a week!"

A guide will ensure you at least see all the great works. If you are determined to go alone there are maps available. You will have to check in your coat and bag in the chaotic cloakrooms.

I was told the free day is usually a mad house, especially in the busy, summer months but also that the crowds start to die down in October when I was there. I debated just paying to go on a different day since I don't do well with crowds but I ultimately decided to brave the crowds and get there early. The courtyard opened at 10am and the museum opened at 10:30am. I was in line at 9:40 and I was towards the front. I had my free ticket, coat checked, and was in the museum by 10:41. I happened to see the line outside around noon and it was insane... winding through the plaza. So if you decide to go on a free day, definitely make sure to get there early! From June to September I'd probably consider going on a different day.The museum is spectacular and particularly so because it's a palace. I did visit Tsarskoye Selo but if you don't have enough time for that day trip then the Hermitage itself is a nice palace experience. Do note that there is a separate second building, the General Staff Building, that houses the Hermitage's contemporary and 19th-20th century collection including Monet, Manet, Van Gogh, Degas, Picasso, Matisse, etc. It's the large yellow curved building across from the palace. There weren't many people inside so I imagine not many people knew about it. However, if you like impressionist or post-impressionist art, don't miss it."

We were lucky in 2014 as we did not know about it. Before leaving the museum, we decided to enjoy one last time the gorgeous golden pavilion with garden, which hosts this beautiful piece, and walked into a crowd starting to assemble. We admired this remarkable machinery at work--one of these moments when one is filled with wonder at the incredible artistry and mechanical genius.

We had a private guide who took us around for over 6 hours and showed us the highlights of this vast museum..which is really in 4 separate attached palaces. He was a great docent sharing his knowledge of the art. I don't really see how an individual by themself could possibly take it all in. We saw many large tour groups who had 20-40 people trying hear what their guides were saying. We went a second time paying $300 each for the tour of the diamond room and the good rooms. These are very limited tours, but to say it was overwhelming is to put it mildly. My advice here is to only do the diamond room (it has a lot of gold tin it). The gold room is more of a history of the Russian people thru the gold jewelry they created over the centuries. It was also overwhelming..but after 45 intense minutes with the diamonds, we had a hard time focusing for another 45 minutes with the gold. You cannot move thru these rooms at your own pace. You have an English speaking guide and a Russuan guide and the whole tour was the Russian speaking and then the English speaker translating. We felt rushed..but it was so worth it.After this tour we were already in the Hermitage so our guide took us to see the Rembrandts. We returned to the museum on Sunday night to see the ballet Swan Lake in Catherine's theatre. Very nice performance. Try to stay in St Petersburg for several days and especially spend a whole day at the Hermitage with a private guide. You will learn so much if you do it this way."

            "review": "Possibly the Finest Art Museum in the World. This is another St Petersburg attraction where we were well aware that crowds and lines would be a problem so we booked a private tour with local Alla tours and had a no wait no line entry. Our guide also managed the speed of our tour to let pushy loud groups past and keep us in a fairly quiet relaxed window. This is a little more expensive but again is well worth it to maximize your museum time. Our guide also said the collection is so big that if you spent just 30 seconds looking at each exhibit it would take 15 years to see the museum so accept that you're not going to see everything. There is a very nice multi floor museum plan map that you can get in several languages that can assist you in seeing what collections are a priority for you. In our case our guide took us directly to what we wanted to see. Shortly after Catherine the Great had her husband killed and took power she began to rapidly advance Russia. Other European capitals had centuries of head start in collecting state art collections. If Russia was to be a great empire it was great to win battles, extend territory and sign treaties. But she would need great palaces, culture and art to be like other European capitals. There was no time to pick individual paintings so she bought every collection available and now here they are for us to see. This is one of the finest art museums in the world and if you want to maximize your museum time I strongly recommend a private tour operator like Alla tours."

            "review": "Absolutely Grand. The Hermitage Museum is an absolutely grand place to visit in St. Petersburg. It is a museum of art and culture and is over 200 hundred years old. It was Catherine the Great who started the museum in the 18th century. Her collection is impressive. She had over four thousand paintings, and a great collection of coins, medals, books, furniture, mirrors, vases, ceramic items and drawings etc. The Hermitage Museum is located along Palace Embankment.There is so much to see \u2013 that it will probably take you more than one visit to see everything. The museum items are actually housed in six beautiful buildings. Our guide said that there were over three million items in the museum. This museum is extremely popular \u2013 and so you have to get used to the crowds. I would recommend that you go in a group \u2013 as groups have priority and are allowed entry earlier than the official opening time.There is a grand staircase that leads up to the upper floor. As you climb up, you will be amazed by the ornate decorations. Each room seemed even more grandiose than the previous one. I was amazed by everything I saw. There was a lot of prehistoric art. There was also art from Italy, Holland, UK, Egypt, Germany, France, Switzerland, Russia, Spain etc. There were Impressionist paintings too. Catherine\u2019s rooms were simply stunning in every respect. They were awesome. The opening hours are 10.30 am to 18.00. On Wednesdays and Fridays the museum closes at 9pm. Entrance fees for each adult is 600 Rubles (equivalent to GBP 7.50 Aug 2016). School children, students and pensioners pay half. There is free entry to all on the first Thursday of every month.Photography is allowed - but you cannot use the flash.You should plan to spend an entire day in The Hermitage. You will love it."

Differently from other great museums, where the objects are by far the main attraction, it is the Winter Palace that dominates the experience of visiting this amazing collection. In some of the rooms you can easily imagine grand balls, state receptions, intrigues, etc.. The collection is world class in almost every aspect it covers. Be prepared to share this wonderful experience with hordes of other visitors. You can only hope that they get something out of it, as much as you will.Plan your visit in advance using the helpful virtual visit in the website, and do not even think that you can see it all in a day or two. Buy tickets on the web to avoid very long lines at ticket office. Two days consecutive ticket is a good option for most people."

My itinerary was the following (numbers correlate to rooms):198-->189, 333-->327, 204-->229-->254-->244 (with all the intermediate rooms you will come across inbetween), 109-->128Actually you can witness the whole european history in this museum and with only 600 rubles.

The Museum and Palace were beautiful, huge and full of arts. If you wanna enjoy ALL of arts and exhibitions inside, I recommend you to spend 2-3 days in this museum so you can slowly appreciate them. BUT if you have only one day or half day in this HUGE museum, I recommend you to take a look at the information about all exhibitions and choose what you REALLY want to see, then go for it. You can also use the ticket for Hermitage to enter the General Staff Building at the opposite side of the square for free. The art and exhibition there were quite modern and easier to understand, and I enjoyed it more than in Hermitage. Tips: Book the ticket via the internet before hand so you don't have to wait in line for the ticket in front of the museum. And book it in the Russian Page not the English one because the ticket will be cheaper!! Ask the staff at the hostel or hotel to help you deal with this!"

The building itself was very nice but it had been built as a residence and had no natural flow. Therefor you were forced to fight you way into a room and try to view the displays and then fight your way back through the same small door. To get to Russia you have to have a visa and to get a visa you have to get background check by Russia. It cost my wife and me $500 each to get the visa after filling out a 6 page form. Russia knows more about me now than the FBI. I mentioned this to our guide and she said the US does the same to Russians wanting to visit America. One of her questions on the US form was \"Have you engaged in prostitution within the last 10 years?\""

This is one of those amazing experiences....the buildings themselves are impressive, stunning floors, ceilings, staircases and doors.....and then there is the amazing contents of priceless art and artifacts....a must see when in this beautiful city. We bought a two day ticket online and in advance....definitely better than queuing up, but be warned the two days must be done consecutively and there are no pass outs given. You can however move from one building to the other....but only once per day. This is quite restrictive as you cannot take food or water into the buildings (must be left in a locker inside the entrance after going through the security check). There is a coffee shop/caf\u00e9 inside but you may be a long way from this facility depending on where you are and who really wants to spend their time in this amazing place sitting drinking coffee?! Suggest having a break when moving from the Winter Palace to the General Staff Building. Our favourite section was probably The Impressionists located in the General Staff Building across the square.....they don't seem to be as strict there about water (keep it discreetly in a large handbag) and nowhere near the number of visitors....perhaps people don't know about it! Make sure you take your camera, photos are fine, just no flash, which is very fair. It is quite warm inside....wear layers so you don't feel uncomfortable.....you can't go outside and back in. Considering the number of visitors, the toilet facilities are few and far between, with long queues...even the men had to line up! One final tip...suggest you buy two separate day entry tickets and have a day or two break in between to give your senses a break, it really was quite overwhelming as there are just so many amazing sights to take in....absolutely incredible!"

If you have kids with you, after obtaining adult tickets at such a kiosk, go straight to the entrance where you'll get free admission tickets for children.

There is everything here from old masters to ancient artifacts through numerous statues, jewelry items, clothing, incredible polished stone vases, curios - you name it, the Hermitage has it! Don't miss the incredible gold peacock clock acquired by Catherine the Great - extravagent to say the least. To cap it all off the entire collection is housed in some of the architecturally and decoratively finest rooms I have ever seen.

The combination of cultural treasures and the old palace that houses them truly makes the State Hermitage Museum and Winter Palace one of the great wonders of the visual arts world. Having been twice as a visitor with only a few days each time in St. Petersburg, I have four recommendations for visitors who are only in St. Petersburg for a short period. First, do not miss this exceptional historic venue. Second, preview the venue website with care to select the rooms or collections you most wish to visit in the time available to you. You will not see everything in one visit so choose selectively. It is better to see less well and with understanding, than to risk the experience becoming a blur. Third, don't turn your visit into a marathon. You will be faced with the temptation to try to see as much as possible during your visit but walking, standing, and craning to study works above your head can be physically tiring regardless of your age and hamper your enjoyment of the experience. Prevent fatigue by planning and taking short breaks to sit down, reflect on what you have seen, and/ or visit the caf\u00e9. Fourth, research options for early admission or days and times when the museum is likely to be less crowded during your visit to St. Petersburg. There may be an additional charge, but it will be worth it to avoid the scrum of peak times."

If you are not traveling in a group, my advice is that you purchase your tickets online. This way you will have your own \"VIP\" entrance and you get to skip the line in the morning.Rooms and exhibits are really magnificent. There is so much to see. The only thing that bothered me was that they have not kept the place up very well and everywhere one looks there is some kind of weird air conditioning unit, electric work or souvenir stand. The experience does not match some of the other great museums of the world. Moreover, they have not put effort to add english language titles and texts on the exhibits. Despite some of the shortcomings, I would still recommend visiting the site and I would go back if I will had a chance."

Best to go with a tour group as they can show you the highlights, i.e. Rembrant, Pavo clock (my favourite), Michelangeo, etc. The other option is to go on their website and see what artwork you would like to see. There is a section called \"highlights\". Please be aware that not all the artwork is housed in the main area. The impressionists are in a different building and requires an additional admission fee.We spent a little over an hour there, but I think it was enough. Too much stuff to see and a bit overcrowded for me. We thought about going back on our own, but never got around to it. I think at the end of the trip, we were getting a bit tired."

The palace rooms are astonishing and worth the visit. The art is also amazing but if you are from, near, or travel to, any major US art museum, or those in the major EU nations, you can see the same artists in much better environments. Paintings were poorly hung, little thought put into what would be interesting to see next to what, lighting just awful. Plus no anti-glare glass so it was often hard to see things without standing at several different angles. The General Staff building, which contains the major Impressionist works as well as the contemporary exhibits, has recently been completely and astonishingly renovated but is half empty and the works that are displayed mostly suffered from the same issues as those noted in the Winter Palace. The contemporary works were thoughtfully curated and displayed however. On the plus side the cafe food seems to have improved, none looked \"dire,\" as reported in the Lonely Planet guide. However crowds would make the whole thing intolerable. We were there end of the summer season so were ok. And BTW, they only wind the peacock clock once a month so unless you are really lucky you can view the thing (it is pretty amazing) and a video of its antics but probably won't get to see it in action."

While its collection is vast (24 miles of exhibition space) we were somewhat disappointed. They have 2 Leonardos and several Rembrandts which were worth seeing but the collection of impressionists and post impressionists were second rate at best. The collections in the Met and MOMA are much better in our opinion Still well worth the visit but maybe not a special trip to St P if that's themain attraction for you."

Reminded me of the Vatican. Not only amazing art, but in an incredible and truly historic architectural wonder. The palace alone without the art would still be amazing, as would the art collection without the palace - but together it makes the Hermitage truly amazing . We hired a guide (my father was in a wheel chair and had kids in tow ), and would strongly recommend a private guide in any event. The crowds and tour groups in summer are overwhelming, but with a private guide we managed to see all the highlights and skip queues. Went with two children ages 4 and 9, and they enjoyed it. Want to go back in the winter, when I hear that you have the place almost to yourself compared with the summer hordes. But given how amazing this place is, it is a must see and I cannot blame the Hermitage for being so busy."

Into which has been stuffed one of the world's most prized and comprehensive collections of art and antiquities. A combination that makes the Hermitage an experience without compare in the Western world.But you probably already knew that. So my first suggestion would be to find a way to visit in the absolute nadir of tourist season. Failing that my suggestion would be to focus on experiencing the jaw-droppingly beautiful galleries and on seeing the 26th-100th most impressive objects therein - objects which most museums would be thrilled to have on display. Because the reality of the Hermitage in Summer is that you won't really be able to see and enjoy the most popular sights - instead you'll see and be part of 25 scrums surrounded by multiple tour guides all trying to talk over each other.At least that was our experience. As a cruise ship visitor to Russia we were allowed to travel 'visa-free' so long as we had a tour guide - even a 'private' tour guide would do. But (to channel Yakov Smirnoff for a moment), in Russia 'Tour take You' and our guide's insistence on taking us on a tour of the 25 largest crowds in the Hermitage was not to be diverted nor denied."

It's closed Mondays and opened from 10.30am until 6pm most days but 9pm Wednesdays and Fridays. So we decided to go later on a Wednesday evening. We hadn't booked online but we were given advice that if you go to the General Staff Building which is across the square and part of the Hermitage but for the more modern exhibitions you can buy RUB 600 combined ticket with the main museum complex saving you time buying tickets and those queues are long in the main building. There were no queues there and the Modern exhibitions - it's not just Modern Art were great, I actually preferred it to the main building as it's a much more relaxed space. Give yourself over 1.5 -2 hours for the modern building, we then went across the square and avoided the long queues waiting to buy their tickets and went straight inside. Inside you have to put any bags in a locker or you'll be stopped at security and advised to go there, so there are two lockers area - a big and a small area. The small area seemed less busy, but the lockers fill up quickly. No video was permitted. The palace is indeed opulent and there is so much to see so do give yourself enough time - 2 hours at the very least. They also sell postcards and stamps in the museum which after my trek around the city to find stamps would have been good to know beforehand. The stories of the cats is worth finding out about, we heard it before we went from our city guide. As the weather can be very changeable it's a great rainy day activity."

The rooms are elegantly furnished, a good size, and very comfortable. Every amenity you are likely to need are supplied in the hitech rooms and free wifi throughout. The staff are exceptionally helpful and the restaurants of good quality, if a little quiet when we ate in them. Would not hesitate to stay here again."

There's no need to describe it, as this has been done in many other reviews - so I'll just write about one or two practical things: First of all, the museum is astonishingly cheap to visit, if compared to some other attractions in town. You can choose between the full ticket (600 rubles) and individual buildings (300 rubles). I went for the former, but in my opinion, you really only need to see the Winter Palace, which houses most of the impressive rooms of the museum and the main pieces of art. Obviously, the default ticket they sell you is the 600 rubles version, and if you have enough time, it is definitely interesting to see the rooms of the General Staff Building (which has been renovated and features top-notch facilities)...Leaving your bags in the cloakrooms is free, as is internet access - but only for 15 minutes!"

This is, as trite as it seems, a destination not to be missed. The floors alone are works of art, and it is incredible that they are treated every year so that they are protected from the millions of people who come through. It is too bad that the place is so crowded. We got in technically before opening time through a cruise tour, and even then it was very crowded. We had a very good tour guide who knew enough to go a slightly different way so that we were the first to get to the Rembrandts and DaVincis- couldn't believe I had some time alone with these masterworks."

Nonetheless, the buildings themselves have been lovingly restored to breathtaking opulence; the artwork inside is endless. It was stunning to be led into a room chock full of Rembrandt paintings, then another room full of Reubens, another of Van Dyk. Next time, I would hire a private guide and limit the number in the tour to four people. These large tour groups don't spend nearly enough time in the museum."

Make sure to buy tickets in advance to avoid the long, long lines to get in. The entrance if you have pre-paid tickets (from their excellent website) is on a side street, not in the front of the Palace and is as painless as can be, and no wait. We had read quite a bit about the museum and seen documentaries on YouTube so we knew what we wanted to see. We still got the audio guide which while a little difficult to follow, was worth the investment (it will take you to the major attractions). At least when we visited, the museum was incredibly overcrowded with tour groups, but there are quiet corners if you seek them out. Amongst them is the beautiful church inside the Palace which was recently restored. I only wish the Hermitage would set aside a night or two a week during peak season with limited number of entries but really, there is nothing to criticize here. It's just incredible."

As we toured, I could see long lines of people outside the entrance holding umbrellas. If you only have one day, hire a guide or research what you want to see before hand."

The Heritage museum and winter palace continued the display of hidden treasures, artwork and show of wealth that early Russian Tsar families had in their days. In one way, very interesting and amazing to see, on the other a display of how inequitable the distribution of wealth was in those early days."

The online posts advised us that the best way to buy tickets is via ticket machines near the entry gates. It is OK, BUT you should have a plan B for the case wen the machines do not work. So it is fine that one of the group holds a place in the queue for the ticket desks while the other on buys the tickets via machines. Be careful that before the cash desk opening the machines neither operate!Insider tip: If you feel tired inside because of the masses, take a look to the Siberian native artwork, there is a well kept air conditioning and you could breathe freely because no crowds in that area. After this recharge you can return to the crowded other parts :)"

In general I do not like these dates because it is too crowded. When we have planned the trip I did not know about the free entrance day. But we were there and I had read that I would have to face long queues to buy the entrance in the other days anyway. The entrance for individual visitors is located in the Winter Palace, accessible from the Courtyard.The museum opens at 10 am and we have arrived at 9am. There was a long queue outside the Courtyard. At 10 am they have opened the gates and people did not respect the line. They started to run but my husband thought that it was not right. There are two entrances one of each side of the building. The left entrance is closer to the gate; so most people went to this line. Many people stuck to queue in front of us. When we saw the other line in the right side was too late to change. Even if you do not have to pay, you have to go to the ticket booth, inside the building, to get the free entrance ticket. They only allow a certain group of persons to go inside, but unlike the Catherine's Palace there is no defined period. It was a very stressful experience.If I knew, we would have done differently. My husband would stay in the line and I would stay close to the Courtyard's gates. Even in the queues inside the Courtyard, some people stuck to queue in front of us, especially Chinese people. I have read that they are not used to have queues in China but they should respect foreign costumes when travelling.Once you get the entrance ticket, before enter the museum, leave your purses/backpacks in the clock room.Inside the museum there is a Caf\u00e9 _ the sandwich is fair.The museum is so big, with so magnificent beautiful arts items and antiquities (paintings, drawings, jewelry, coins, medals, sculptures, and copies of original Vatican frescoes.) It is not possible to see all in one day. Take at least 3 to 4 hours to see the highlights, such as:The Jordan Staircase at the Winter PalaceThe Field Marshall RoomThe Small Throne RoomThe Armorial HallThe St. George HallThe Peacock Clock in Pavilion HallThe Raphael LoggiaThe Knights RoomPaintings not to be missed: Madonna with Child and Two Angels by Paolo di Giovanni FeiThe Virgin and the Child with Sts.

If you do the additional buildings with the art, you might even choose to spend 3 or 4 days depending on your level of relaxation and time available to you. Seeing these museums in a day is possible but is absolutely exhausting. If I did it again, I would have done it over 3 days, including the art gallery taking time to get a proper lunch and break/rest in between morning and afternoon."

First of all, yes, the Hermitage is crowded! you are not going to have it to yourself, however, if you come early and pre-book tickets it helps a lot. Pre-booking is a must! more expensive but worth it! you enter on the side of the building between the small hermitage and the old/grand hermitage. I got there at 10:25 and queued for about 10 mins before entering. I had pre-booked a tour later in the day of the diamond room but had failed to realise that I needed to exchange my voucher for a ticket before entering the museum. After a bit of to and from, I asked one of the guides in the main hall for help, she very kindly took over, took me through the gates, to a ticket office, skipped the line, got my ticket exchanged and got me back in on her own card. All in typically brusque Russian fashion but extremely kind of her. The tour of the diamond room was well worth it, less crowded with 9 people in the group and the guide was very knowledgeable and spoke good English. It takes a bit of planning to visit the Hermitage, decide on what you want to see before you go, plan your route and be picky, I skipped the third floor entirely for example and accept that the rooms with the famous paintings such as Rubens, Rembrandt and the Di Vinci and Michelangelo are going to be very busy, however, get there early and view them first to avoid the worst of the tour groups (most of the cruises now have early morning visits, before general admission which helps a bit) There are also less crowded parts of the museum, the general staff building was fairly empty around five o'clock (had plenty of time and space to admire the Picassos, Monets, Cezanne etc.) and the Siberian/central Asian etc sections were not at all crowded.If possible get a two-day ticket so you are not subjected to a marathon 7.5-hour visit, wear good shoes, I walked about 10 k on the day of my visit. And accept that the cafe food is pretty dire, however, the cakes are decent. Overall, I was blown away by the building itself and the opulence of the setting, the art and the history! I'll definitely go back in the future."

Be advised, the room itself isn't gold, it's just full of gold jewelry and trinkets in display cases. Of course it's personal preference, but we would have greatly preferred time to see art work by masters we know such as the impressionists. The guide hurried us thru a big room full of \"ordinary\" Rembrandts to focus on one \"masterpiece\". Can't really blame her, since there is an enormous amount to see. Also be advised that some (most?) tours will include a 30 or 45 minute stop at a gift shop after the museum. Our expected 4 hour tour was actually only 3 hours."

The Hermitage Museum is the number one place to visit while in St Petersburg.Had read beforehand that there can be long queues, but there was no queue to buy tickets or enter the Museum when we visited at the end of August and on a Saturday. Reasonable ticket price, do remember the Museum is closed on Mondays.So much to see in the museum, the art on display by painters you will only have heard of beforehand blows you away. Too much to see all in one day unless you skip some of the rooms which is not advisable. Worth stopping at the cafe for break with a nice selection of sandwiches and cakes available. The few shops also sell some nice souvenirs.We unfortunately were too tired at the end of the day to visit the General Staff building, but this should not be missed. We have a reason to go back now!"

A booked tour with a local guide,I used BEST GUIDES and was totally satisfied with them, will get you in before opening time and no long line to stand in ( over 400 people in line one hour before opening time).If you want to see either the \"Gold Room\" or the \"Jewel Room\" you must buy tickets as soon as you can after entering the Museum. I think only one tour per day in English and you must use the museum tour person that takes at least one hour to go through 4 rooms! The Museum shop is very, nice lots of amber jewelry, bring your credit card. Best Guides include price of ticket in their fee, but if you don't use a local guide and buy advance tickets there is a special entrance for those with that paper approx 200 yds to the right of the regular line."

Try to see these too!4. Prepare for the hordes. the palace is not designed as a museum. not all stairwells on the map are for the public, most are only for one level but dont go all the way up of down. the doorways are narrow and the tourgroups huge.

How can they when they are with large tour groups and limited in time?On this visit I was with a local private guide who told me about each piece of artwork. The highlight was visiting the Impressionist, Picasso and Matisse works which have been moved to another building across the square. This building was not crowded and the opportunity to view the artworkwith more leisure was so pleasurable. I believe the group tours are not including this building. I know for sure that the cruise ship excursion did not include the Impressionists.If you can visit before July or August, do so. If you can afford a private, I recommend it highly.

Inside it was one huge melee of tour groups and guides who don't wait for anyone and who can turn on each other if one of them oversteps the mark. Outside the pale green and white buildings are impressive but inside ... the phrase 'All that glitters is not gold' does NOT apply here. In St Petersburg, our guide told us, everything you see inside or out that looks like gold IS gold and the amount inside the Hermitage is staggering. As one visitor muttered 'No wonder they had a revolution'.The State Hermitage Museum consists of five buildings, one of which is the Winter Palace built in the middle of the 18th century, and it houses some 3 million objects. Unfortunately you cannot stop at any point but I would like to have lingered longer in the first throne room; decorated in red and gold it was wonderful. Don't miss the staircases, the main one in white marble, and do look up. On and on through glorious room after glorious room and along stunningly decorated corridors. My passion is ceilings but here the floors are also works of art in wonderful marquetry. Yes there are the world famous paintings, some of which are small and covered by glass, but for me it was the detail in the ornamentation of the rooms that was simply splendid. I felt almost overwhelmed by the richness of it all. There are many ornaments made from precious materials and with intricate workmanship, don't miss the Peacock Clock, and look out of a first floor window onto a garden at the same level. Rich as Croesus doesn't cover this level of wealth, rich as Midas more like.Be warned, there is virtually nowhere to sit down and you are not allowed to take drinks inside but there are cloakrooms and toilets and we passed a man selling guidebooks but be quick if you want to buy one, your guide will not stop."

We worked with a tour guide and were in within 5 minutes bypassing those who had been in line for an hour+. There's A LOT to see and the organization and flow aren't intuitive...so having a private guide to connect the history and hit the highlights was invaluable. There's a lot of walking, a lot of stairs, but worth the effort and the history. If you can time your visit for the Peacock Clock ceremony...all the better, but be prepared for the crowd."

This place has an amazing and huge collection of art but the organisation and ridiculous crowds almost ruin the entire experience. The queues during the day are min. 2hrs if you turn up and buy a ticket at the door. However, what they don't tell you is that there is a bank of ticket machines just inside the main gate where you can purchase tickets almost immediately and subsequently walk straight into the museum. Alternatively pre-book your tickets on the Internet and you will save yourself hours of unnecessary queuing. Unfortunately that is not the end of it. It was raining heavily on the day of our visit so everyone had jackets and umbrellas. Only problem is, they don't allow umbrellas and jackets into the museum so you are required to check them into the cloakroom. But with the massive crowds, it's almost a literal fight to get a space in the cloakroom which were also horribly understaffed. If you've survived so far and manage to make it into exhibition itself, you're next faced with a constant struggle against the plethora of group tours who spend more time looking at the art through their phones rather than using their actual eyes! It made for an uncomfortable viewing environment. Another note, the incredible collection of Matisse is in a completely separate building opposite the main museum which we didn't realise until an hour before it closed because the app we were recommended to download had an out of date map!My advice, pre book and go on one of the days it opens late to beat the crowds, otherwise prepare yourself for battle!"

We spent several hours and saw a lot of amazing paintings and art work with some dating BC. Amazing but a persons senses can only take in so much at once before it is overwhelming. Unless you have an area of special interests and lots of time I would invest in a private tour. If I could have stayed a week and spent 3 hours a day in this museum it would have been perfect but It still might not be enough time.

I was frustrated until I read on the internet that you can easily get each ticket for 600 Roubles($9), the price one pays if one waits in endless lines. Well, followng the advice read, I went to the Staff building entrance which is the curved building in front of the Hermitage, where you will be blown over by Kandinskys, Rubins and numerous other magnificent paintngs plus a a modern interior which is spectacular for just 600 Roubles per ticket which can be used to enter the vatrious sectors of the Hermitage. Just enter the staff building, follow the signs to the ticket windows. I did not wait more than two minutes on a very rainly day in which tons of people were waiting in line to get into the \"\"main\" section, the green colored buildings.. This entire complex is magnificent, and ,by the way, there are kiosk machines like ATM machines within the staff building which can used with a credit card to buy the tickets.

Sis and I were spared the long wait in half kilometer queue by organising private tour- just Olga the guide and Anton the driver with slick car.and us. Lovely Olga had us at the front of the queue and we were in, in just a snap of fingers. Sure the palace is full to rafters with tourists but Olga had us ducking and weaving getting to the best art in the Palace - she was walking talking art, history book just a package of detail delivered in beautiful English. If this is your once in life trip to St Petersburg it is worth saving up for a private package. . Hermitage is not to be missed, I'd rather spend more time inside than hours outside in queue. Olga said best time for visiting palaces is Winter - fewer tourists. Hmmmm I wonder why?"

Definitely buy tickets online before hand to stand in a much shorter entrance line. Photos allowed in most but not all of the rooms. The available cafes have edible food but don't plan on anything delicious. I suggest you mark off rooms on the map as you explore; it's easy to get lost in the maze of rooms and gorgeous sights to see and end up retracing your steps or missing entire sections. The coin display on the top floor is definitely worth trip, and don't miss the interior chapel of what used to be the Winter Palace."

This is probably the busiest museum in the world - it has over 20,000 visitors per day, so the only way to avoid a bun fight is to take a private evening tour when it is open to small selected groups. Be aware though that this is not cheap, but in return you will not feel claustrophobic and be overcome with the heat. There is no air conditioning in the building. However, whatever you do if on a guided tour, essential if you do not speak Russian, you will only see what the tour guide shows you, but at least you can get a flavour of the size and wealth that was Imperial Russia.Accept the restraints and it will be a memorable experience!"

            "review": "Incredible, but some things worth knowing beforehand. The quantity and size of the Hermitage is daunting, but of course it is a must, especially if you like art and architecture. Tips: 1. get there early - it was raining the day I went and still at 11 o'clock the queue stretched across the inner courtyard, by 1 or 2 I saw from the window that it stretched out across Palace square. If you can't buy online and only want the standard single entry ticket I'd recommend using the auto ticket machines to the left and right of the inner courtyard. I only had to queue for about ten minutes.2. If they are out of maps in English at the entrance, maybe for other languages too, make sure to ask for one - getting around with no map would have been a nightmare. 3. Be prepared for crowds. There are a lot of people visiting, but a little patience and you can still see what you want to see. There are big crowds around some of the old masters works, especially the two Da Vinci's. Most people just want a quick look and a photo so if you wait eventually you get a chance to study them up close.4. I downloaded the official audio guide app and bought the Hermitage General tour for 5 USD. I ended up going off tour to see other things, but it was still a good way to get around if you have a smartphone. As well as talking about significant features and art works it also gives directions. It can be used offline and you can listen to it with pictures at later date too. Just using the free map would be enough if you just want to admire rather than listen to the history.5. They weren't well advertised, at least not in English, but the temporary exhibitions are worth a look. I really enjoyed the Erte one (I had always thought he was French but he was from Russia) and the Byzantine art one."

HUGE TIP for tix on busy days: (1) either buy online and enter by special online ticketholders' gate between small hermitage (mint green) and adjacent (pale goldenrod) buildings next to the famed Winter Palace main building (Hermitage is actually 4 riverfront palaces in a row plus satellite museums such as General Staff Museum), or (2) there are two automated ticket kiosks in that same location (btw mint green and pale goldenrod adjacent palaces) that NO-ONE ever uses (very Russian -- give no signage or information, and place satellite ticket kiosks in hidden alleyway, while thousands wait in line in main square only 50 m away.....) : ) ... good luck and enjoy!!"

Don't be confused; the palace was turned into a museum and the museum itself is the palace. It's beautiful for inside and out. Remember to wear COMFORTABLE SHOES because you'll be doing a LOT of walking. And if you're going with someone, make sure to check the entry line going into the museum because there's a huge line to get tickets, but if you're just entering, there's usually not a big line. Use the automated kiosk machines to get tickets to speed things up. There's a good color-coded map for the different exhibitions and sections, and each room is numbered so the museum is easy to navigate.Since this is a huge museum with many famous art pieces, I recommend checking the Russian Culture section and the Winter Palace Interior section first to use your time well and get an idea of the Russian style. The Russian style presented in this museum are pretty heavily influenced by French and Italian styles so it's pretty eclectic. You can see the various experimental styles that are eclectic as shown in the Winter Palace Interior exhibition-there's a room that looks like a hookah bar with Moorish style cushions and velvet fabric, for example.There are several buildings in addition to the main building. Unless you have a particular interest in the other buildings' exhibitions, I recommend getting the generic (cheapest) one that allows entry to the most popular buildings."

Once overcome the mystery of how to get a ticket: you will find automatic tickets stations right of the entrance that accept cash and cards (and are in English as well). Once you have your ticket, go to the line \"people with tickets\" that leads you inside where you can buy your ticket! Why is there another queue with people also having tickets? I don't know. Pass cloak room and remain on the ground floor with the prehistoric exhibition to avoid the crowd. Once the bulk of the mass has gone head to the 1 floor where you will find gorgeous room: the museum itself is a palace to the items exhibited. Just stunning, really! If you travel on your own, you will find it difficult to find your way among all the groups but that is something that will be a struggle everywhere in Russia for people traveling alone."

There must have been at least twenty additional tour groups there, too. Consequently, it was very crowded and we were shuffled room to room and crowded around each item that our guide was describing. While the palace is very grand and opulent, I was disappointed that what were shown was all of the Italian, etc art pieces, Greek statues, and very few items of Russian history. My friend (who was with me) told me that we were NOT shown most of what she saw in a previous trip. We had a wonderful guide who did her best to maneuver us around (about 30 people) however, I think, due to the number of tours, we were unable to see everything. TIP: Go to the restroom whenever you have a chance! There was always a line! Glad I saw the place overall."

Visitors travel from across the globe to view paintings by Rembrandt, the Dutch Masters, and the early Expressionists, as well as the grand state rooms of the Winter Gardens.However, for us, the greatest exhibit was the amazing selection of cakes and other goodies in the museun cafe. It can be thirsty work walking the miles of corridors adored with priceless objets d'art, but a cup of tea and a danish pastry brings fresh colour to many a faded artefact and restoration to many a frayed work of art. On the whole, the museum represents good value for money and the famous queues, although scarily impressive, are not actually that bad and do keep moving. There is no good reason to miss out on visiting this stunning wonder of the world. Do not leave it to your '100 things I must do before I die'. Go now - before the danish pastries run out."

You can't even stand one minute in front a masterpiece that a group of 50 (!!!!) people enter the room and push to get in front of the painting. It was really tiring that I couldn't stand more than four hours, and it's a pity because as I said before it is not enough at all!Then in some rooms it was really warm and I have been stung several times by big mosquitos.I think that with all the money they get, they should try to solve these problems and it will be perfect."

So try to plan what you would like to see so you don't wonder aimlessly and waste time - it is huge! We went in July and it was CROWDED!!!!!! If you can do a little research to find out maybe a time that is better to go - early in the day or a bit later after the tours leave. I heard it's really quiet in January, but I don't think many of us will travel to Russia in January. Enjoy it and take time to see as much as you can!"

Worth the visit, our teens survived...but be warned we couldn't get them to visit other museums after so choose the ones YOU want to see prior to bringing them along. If you have teen sons, include the armory, visit the mechanical display and the one of a kind archeological relics from Siberia (mummy and permafrost preserved items) to keep their attention. The stories of the paintings and the visits to the palace rooms with the chandeliers and Russian gold details were a draw as well. A guide helps you jump the lines and is well worth the investment...especially maneuvering around the cruise tours. Enjoy!"

On my 'bucket list ' and the main reason to visit St Petersburg, even stayed in the State Hermitage Official Museum Hotel.Had already bought tickets on the Hermitage Internet site, and although we had to queue to get into the cloakroom and security, was well worth it as the queue to buy tickets was very long. Our ticket was a 'combined ticket ' that also allowed us into the new home of the 19th Century Impressionist and post Impressionist into 20th century, it is in the General Staff building across from the Hermitage, and into The Winter Palace.Spent a couple of hours in the main Hermitage building viewing room upon room of golden chandeliered magnificence, one of the highlights was the Peacock Clock . We then decided to go to see the Impressionist Paintings in the General Staff building, a warning if you want to purchase things from the Museum shop , do it before you leave as you cannot get back in, although there is a smaller shop in the other building. The collection takes up 2 floors of the building, and allowed you to see artwork that previously you had only ever seen in books. After a visit to the shop, we went in search of the Winter Palace exhibition, to say we were very 'underwelmed ' is an understatement. We thought we were going to see more of the magnificent Winter Palace rooms, but in fact it was just a small exhibition that took about 10 minutes to see!!!!!!Overall a very pleasant but also tiring day which is a must for any visitor to St Petersburg."

            "review": "Beyond Superlatives: One of the Greatest Palaces and Museums in the World. The Hermitage is without dispute one of the top art museums in the world. If you are in St. Petersburg, you are likely to see it either for the art, because it was the tsars\u2019 Winter Palace, or both.Let\u2019s start with the art. This collection is enormous. You cannot possibly see everything. It\u2019s probably close to impossible even to see just the very most famous paintings in a single visit. The best of these, perhaps, are the extensive Rembrandts. You can also see countless other old master works, including two pieces by Leonardo da Vinci.Incidentally, the outstanding Impressionist collection has been moved to the newly acquired and renovated space across the square in the old General Staff building (that\u2019s the large yellow neoclassical structure just opposite the Hermitage on the square). It\u2019s worth a visit in its own right, but we won\u2019t review it here.You will also want to come here to view the incredible palace and some of its contents. The main hallway is huge and grand. There are many rooms that are incredibly ornate and in some cases feel like everything is made of gold. This was among the most opulent palaces in the world.One thing you will not want to miss is the so-called peacock clock, which almost defies description. Everything about the clock is mechanical and much of it moves naturally and not at all like, say, a cuckoo clock. The clock itself is housed in a large glass display and is covered in gold. They can\u2019t run it all the time, but there is an excellent HD video showing the peacock fluidly turning its head, and various other creatures depicted moving around as well.We would strongly recommend getting a guide, at least for your first visit. Why? Well, first of all, doing so will get you an early entrance. We were in some rooms we had almost to ourselves in the early morning, but were absolutely packed with tourists by 11. Many of the tourists arrive in large groups, swamping some of the most famous attractions in particular. In the case of the two Leonardo paintings, for example, the room almost deteriorated into a line of Asian tourists lining up and taking selfies in quick succession. That left little availability just to enjoy the pieces for their intrinsic worth.You might also want a guide because this museum is absolutely huge, with literally millions of pieces of art. The Romanovs were fabulously wealthy monarchs, and spent liberally on art over the course of centuries so what is here is among the very best in the world. We spend a lot of time on line (the museum\u2019s website is replete with good images), but having a guide helped us enormously. In some cases the great artwork is so plentiful that it\u2019s possible to \u201close\u201d even the greatest pieces among many hung on the enormous palace walls.You can check the website to find pieces that suit your own taste, but among the hundreds of paintings that any art museum would leap at are:-Paintings by Fra Angelico, including Madonna and Child with Four angels-Leonardo\u2019s Madonna with flower and the Benois Madonna-Raphael: The Conetabile Madonna and The Holy Family-Titian: Numerous paintings, including The Flight Into Egypt and Portrait of a Young Woman and the incomparable Danae-Caravaggio: The Lute Player-Holbein-Lucas Cranach the Elder (the lovely Virgin and Child Under the Apple Tree)-Velazquez: Boy with a Dog-Murillo: The Walpole Immaculate Conception-Many, many Rubens paintings, including \u201cBacchus\u201d-Snyders: Fish Stall/Market. You\u2019ll also want to hunt for the comical \u201cbird concert\u201d, which is one of many Dutch masters hung 3-high in an enormous gallery-Some of Rembrandt\u2019s best pieces, including the Sacrifice of Isaac, Danae (vandalized by mad man, but partly restored), and Descent from the CrossJan Steen ( in particular the comical Revelers)-Watteau (multiple paintings)-Boucher-Gainsborough-Eugene DelacroixThe Hermitage is one of the world\u2019s top attractions and should definitely be on your list."

So 72 passengers from our ship accompanied a tour guide (required, with no visa, your tour guide is your visa). We learned much about the winter palace, like which columns were real and which were made of papier mache. Lots of information on the Tsars and Catherine the Great. We made our way to the art galleries and saw about 20 of hundreds. Largest was the Rembrandt. There was a gallery of Little Dutch Men or not Rembrandt. Some Titian, two Divincis. Especially interesting were the mini mosaics on columns, vases and tables. There was a room from the Vatican and a marvelous floor mosaic that Catherine the Great had copied, that are no longer publicly viewed because they are part of the Popes private residence. So the restrooms are old, old you can not throw your toilet paper in the commode and flush it down. But everything else is really beautiful. If you can take advantage of this tour be warned nothing else is open and you only see what the tour guide likes, so no Faberge egg, and the communists sold many wonderful things to get cash. Oh, and people will waste time taking selfies of themselves with the art (no flash allowed)."

No water allowed, which makes several hours inside quite difficult.Of course we are all there to see the collections of paintings, carvings, and exquisite ornaments. But also the structure itself is a work of art, with inlaid wood flooring, every door decorated elaborately, frescoes on nearly every ceiling, stunning columns in galleries, and jaw-dropping gilt work in ballrooms and other grand rooms. Some great views of the Neva River from the hallways that connect the Old and New Hermitages.Seeing an item up close or taking a picture is a challenge, with all the tourists jammed into each room. Save yourself frustration and buy a book in the gift store or on the street outside (which will contain photos of noteworthy Old Masters and Da Vinci's paintings, modern artworks, as well as some of the objects and rooms considered most noteworthy); just glory in the beauty and snap a photo of something that catches your fancy. For me the latter was delicate glass goblets and small mosaics. Glad I snapped the photos because they do not appear in the book, and they pleased me very much."

There were at least 7 huge cruise ships docked in the harbor - which means thousands of tourists competing for excursions. Our trip to the Hermitage Museum was long and tedious. Gridlock is the word for Russian traffic. Once there, the museum rooms were so crowded that it was not possible to look at anything except from a distance. Our tour guide herded us through the rooms, not even stopping to point out wonders of the art world. Overall, St. Petersburg was a huge disappointment. A four-hour tour involved 3 hours stuck in traffic! Although the Hermitage is fabulous, try to go sometime when you can actually look at something. Look for a private tour!!!!"

The gold on the walls, the paintings on the ceiling, the architecture. Stunning. We aren't art experts but the exhibits on display are astonishing.

Taking a tour allows an early entry before the crowds, which is a big reason to consider it - by about lunch time the museum was absolutely packed, especially around the Da Vincis and other famous pieces.

To see Rembrandts, Van Dykes, and many other classic artists together in one place was exquisite!The only negative was the crowds. We were there in the morning and even then, the crowds of tourists were building. By the time we left in late morning (about 11AM) the crowds were so large and the museum was so crowded that it was impossible to get out without elbowing your way through a thick wall of people moving against you. It was like swimming upstream against a heavy current!This is a great place to visit, but do so with an organized tour that can get you in early in the day.

Other tourists had the same idea, and that was the first problem, that it was too crowded. Every room we entered, we had to wait at the door, until it cleared, but by then our very well-informed guide, who was speaking to our group through ear-pieces, had usually moved on into the next room, and was describing some other art or artefact we hadn't yet reached. This must happen all the time, and it is very frustrating.The Hermitage houses many of Russia's finest art treasures, but there are far too many paintings, sculptures, statues and other works of art for them to have justice done to them in a three-hour visit. Instead, the lover of art needs to return there several times. Having said that, I would not feel that I had properly been to St Petersburg without this valuable and important visit."

We were told that if you stood in front of each piece of art for a half minute, it would take you 9 years to see everything and it is not all on display. Is that not incredible? The Hermitage is made up of five historical buildings and houses one of the finest art collections in the world. What you will not see here is Russian Art. You must go to the State Russian Museum to see that. The museum was founded in 1764 by Catherine the Great as a private exhibition hall; it opened to the public in 1852. Always expanding, the museum\u2019s holdings include 3 million items, including the largest collection of paintings in the world. Some highlights not to be missed include the following: Main Staircase, Malachite Room, Peter\u2019s Room, Armory Hall, Golden Boudoir Room, Giant Statues of Atlantes, Giant Jasper Vase, Leonardo da Vinci Room, Peacock Clock, plus the many galleries filled with paintings. We were fortunate to have a private guide with SPB Tours take us thru the museum. We were able to go to the front of the line and go right in. Our guide was an art history major who really knew her art. She was able to tell us about each and everything that we were interested in. I like Egyptian art, so she took us to see the Egyptian collection. This is truly an exceptional museum \u2013 not for the faint of heart \u2013 try to decide what you really want to see \u2013 there is no way you could ever see it all on one visit.

Make sure you go to the entrance for people with internet tickets/vouchers (when facing the Palace, to the right). Secondly - we saw some massive queues in the mornings so decided to go in the afternoon and there was no queue at all for internet tickets. It's the side entrance though (Small Hermitage, I think it's called) so you have to go back through the building to the Palace itself if that's what you're aiming for. It's not exactly clearly marked and the lady at the information desk wasn't exactly helpful.So get a map/floorplan and check which rooms/areas you want to visit. You can wander around freely, of course, but the place is absolutely enormous so if there are specific things you want to see then best to make a plan. Some rooms were packed with tour groups so we had to wait our turn to see the famous pieces (and encountered some VERY pushy tourists as well - be warned!)The Winter Palace is stunning and is a 'must see', but don't forget the General Staff building with the impressionists/post-impressionists. Amazing collection and a lovely modern building, calm and relaxing. Don't expect to be able to see the whole place! It's too big. :)"

Go to the second entrance, when facing the palace, it is on the right, but not the guarded street, the next one to the right, under the bridge.3. Be there at least 10:15 am to get inside by 11, the is also a queue (all people with vouchers). Stand in the queue and wait till 10:30, thats where the wooden doors will open (no sooner).4. You pass the security control (like at the airport, bags separately), it is rather quick.5. Go to the right to the cloakroom, put your things there, believe me, it s worth it.6. Go to the other side of the hall, check the bar code from your voucher directly to the terminal and don t forget to grab a map. (there is no need to have ID cards or have it printed, only if you need a free (student) ticket).7. Enjoy!"

The only downside is that it is very crowded in August vacation time with numerous tour groups rushing through on preset tours.If you don't have a guide, the audio tours are well worth the investment. Even if you think you know about the paintings and artists, the audio guide gives an excellent explanation of what the different rooms were used for. It's advisable to try and plan your route along the lines that the museum suggests. Otherwise you were up to miss a room you really wanted to see.Trying to see both the classical art exhibits with Rembrandt and da Vinci and Raphael and the impressionist collection the same day is probably too much.We did the Winter Palace the first day and then went to the general staff headquarters building which has been converted to a very impressive Museum of modern Art on the second day.

We only had a half day here which is nowhere near enough time - frankly you could spent months in this place and still not see everything. We got in without having to queue (timing is everything!) but within no time, the museum was heaving. It is definitely worth buying tickets online or hiring a guide who can get the tickets without having to queue. Failing that, start at the Impressionist & Post-Impressionist collection across the square and buy your tickets there as the queue will be shorter or buy tickets from the machines rather than queuing for the ticket office.. I would have thought that the Impressionist stuff would attract big crowds but it doesn't seem to do so - although I did hear some people with a guide complaining when they discovered they would not be seeing the Impressionists on their tour - as the collection moved a couple of years ago a bit of prior investigation would have revealed this to them. We had worked out a selection of things we wanted to see in the main building in addition to walking through the palace which is itself absolutely stunning. You have to be selective and we know we will be coming back so didn't feel the temptation to try to cram in too much. It is worth noting that whilst some areas of the museum bear a distinct resemblance to Victoria Station on the London underground at 5.30pm, other areas were very quiet. It gets quieter after lunch.The museum provides a guide of highlights and needless to say these areas are exceptionally busy with the exception of the Cranach paintings which are no longer located where they are shown on the plan - they have moved to the third floor where the Impressionist collection used to be until they were moved to the General Staff building elsewhere in the Palace complex. This change obviously flummoxed most people - we had to ask several of the generally non-English speaking attendants before we tracked them down and we were alone in the room. The beautiful da Vinci paintings, meanwhile, were surrounded by what can only be described as a rugby scrum - a couple of Japanese tour groups arrived at the same time and at one point the Russian matriarch guarding the room had to drag two brawling men apart. All they wanted to do was photograph the two star paintings - not look at them or appreciate them. It is unfortunate that people behaving in this way (and I am sure it is not just the Japanese) ruin it for everyone. We retreated and returned later on our way out when the crowds were still there but at least they weren't fighting over photo-taking positions! The Rembrandts were crowded out too but the impressive paintings by Frans Hals close by were neglected. The Peacock clock is absolutely amazing, much larger than I expected, and sitting in an amazing Baroque room. The decor is completely over the top throughout the palace with gold leaf & marble everywhere - it could be tacky but the sheer opulence & grandeur just takes your breath away.Overall, even though it will in all likelihood be very busy, this is something not to miss. Plan ahead and be realistic about what you can achieve in the time you have."

The collection is enormous of course and there is something for everyone. Don't forget there is a second, separate building on the other side of palace square. When facing the Winter Palace turn around and cross the square to the big yellow building - the entrance is under the second balcony from the left, to the left of the arch. There you will find the wonderful impressionist and more modern collections (start on the 4th floor).Tips:Buy an online ticket and you can use a special entrance - head right of the Winter Palace to the corner of the square and it is signposted.If you don't have an online ticket, go to the yellow building mentioned above and buy your ticket there (either in-person or from a ticket machine). The line will be way shorter. You can use the same ticket for both buildings, and skip the long ticket lines.Weds and Fri are open until 21:00 - a good time to visit is on those evenings to miss the biggest crowds."

Went to the art collection first, separate building, which was not particularly crowded, the tour buses and cruise ships focus on the main building so you get to wander around at leisure and there is a lot of really great stuff.

Please please please buy your tickets online, or at the machines outside the entrance! The museum is definitely worth it. If you are interested in the interiors, classical art, or ancient art then go into the Winter Palace, however if you're more interested in modern, impressionist or surrealist art you'll want to go to the other part of the Hermitage which has great works in the General Staff building which is the huge white semi circular building opposite the winter place."

There are only 10 Leonardo da Vinci paintings left in the world and the Hermitage has 2 of them. We went with a tour-which is recommended but it was still an exhausting experience due to the crowds and the lack of air conditioning.

You can plan your trip, putting what you want to see on a map with directions \u00a0 Or just write down key room numbers and pick up a plan. The room attendants are helpful even if it involves sign language.\u00a0Don't miss the Raphael corridors copied by Catherine the Great from Rome.

But the day we were there 8 cruise ships were in the harbor (and I was on one of them so can't complain) and the crowds at the Hermitage were similar to the NY subway at rush hour. Tour groups are let in an hour early and it's really crowded then but when it is opened to everyone you can barely walk through the rooms catching at best a glimpse of the art work. And because you have to carry your passport at all times and because they are having a big problem with pickpockets we had a couple very nervous tour guides. So glad I went but disappointed that I wasn't able to see more of the gorgeous artwork in this fabulous museum."

The sheer opulence of the rooms themselves is overwhelming. I attempted to take photos to capture \"some\" of their essence, but that really is impossible--a photo only records a fragment.Many reviews focus on the overcrowded galleries and oppressive throngs, but I didn't mind this -- even on the day we visited, which happened to be \"free admission\" for the public (first Thursday of the month). Standing outside in an enormous queue would have tried your patience, but getting inside as the doors first open (after cruise ship groups) allowed us to move around relatively freely.

You will find information on this all over the internet if you want some background information on it before you go. This is more to inform you of what to expect on entering the museum ... A couple of things to keep in mind... Try to get an early entry time (not later than 10am if possible) with a good guide, a good guide can evade a lot of the crowds coming behind. Don't underestimate how big the crowd becomes as the morning goes on. DONT bring bags, umbrellas or coats, even a rain mack with you. You will have to check them into cloakrooms on entering. You will be given a tag to claim them on leaving...leaving is absolute mayhem, no system at all at the cloakrooms, hundreds of people pushing and shoving you out of the way, only 1 lady per section trying to retrieve belongings. Took me 20 minutes to get my fold up rain gear back and we were early leavers. The queues outside were enormous and go on all day. I was there in July, maybe it is not so crazy at a different time of the year. It was well worth the visit but Once was enough for me.

We were fortunate to begin our tour before the doors were opened to the public which allowed us time to visit the interior rooms with less crowds and more opportunities for better photos. The museum has in excess of 3,000,000 items however only a small portion is available to the public. The public is permitted to visit the Winter Palace, the Small Hermitage, Old Hermitage, the New Hermitage and the Hermitage Theatre. Before entering the complex you will see the Palace Square with a dominating 2 mile long building. It is now the General Staff building.Once you enter the courtyard, the beauty of the blue, white and gold fa\u00e7ade of the Winter Palace dazzles you. We spent 4-1/2 hours at the Hermitage Museum and could not begin to do justice seeing all that it has to offer. Highlights of our visit were: the Palace Square, Winter Palace, Jordan Staircase, the Peacock Clock, Golden Drawing Room, Rembrandt\u2019s Return of the Prodigal Son and so many more. If you plan on going, you surely will not be disappointed. For us, we hope to have another opportunity to visit St. Petersburg and pick up where we left off today!"

Either pre-book your ticket on line or use the following trick: When you approach the building from the front, follow the signs for the on-line ticket holders. This will take you off to the right and through a side gate to a separate entrance. Just before you get to that entrance, under a portico are two ticket machines where you can use your credit card to purchase tickets. No-one knows they are there as I only ever saw one person using them. It spits out your ticket which you then take into the nearby entrance and scan through the turnstiles and you are in, while the other 2,000 people still wait patiently in the line for the ticket office.If you have booked on-line, then use that same entrance I have just directed you to but take your email confirmation up to the desk, where they will issue you with a physical ticket to scan at the turnstiles next to them.There are maps available in most languages and you are going to need one or you will get lost.There are 400 separate galleries spread over 3 floors and several buildings. Remember that this is the largest museum in the world so my suggestion is to go first to the caf\u00e9 and over a coffee or a snack from their amazing selection of delicious items, sit down with your map and plan your route in order to see as much as you can.If you are there on Wednesday, not only does the Museum stay open longer (until 9pm) but the famous Peacock Clock is wound up at 7pm on Wednesdays to do it's thing. This is the only time you can see it operating, but be warned, there is seating in the hall where it is for only about 6 people, and if you don't get there at least a half hour early, you won't get anywhere near it to see it work.There are too many fabulous items in the Hermitage to list - download the ap and you can get a virtual tour - but don't neglect the State Rooms. The grand staircase is a wonder, and these rooms formed the Winter Palace of the Czars and are magnificent in themselves.Photography throughout the Museum is permitted so go for it.If you want something from the Museum Shop - my daughter wanted a special \"Hermitage\" teddy bear - best to look at the start of your visit then leave it to \"on the way out\" - even though the Museum shut at 9pm, the shop shut at 6pm.This building and this collection is unsurpassed - take several days to do it, or work out what you want to see beforehand and target those areas using your map."

So I wouldn't suggest you this, unless you are a student, because it is possible to get a discount. There are machines for buying tickets, be sure to use those. For 300 rb you can visit the Diamond and Gold rooms, and it is totally worth it, because it is one hour of guided tour and many interesting items are on display. The rooms of museum are beautiful, but you can read about that elsewhere, plan to spend at least 4-5 hours inside."

The Hermitage is housed in the winter palace and extensively fills many parts of the palace. Not only is the art interesting, but so is the architecture and room decoration. We ordered tickets online but had difficulty finding the proper que to get in...a number of misleading signs. Online tickets really are a much qiicker way to get in. Once in you can take flashless photos without purchasing a photo pass (no one hassled us at all). The crowds can be rather thick, especially at the popular and we'll known pieces (Rembrandt, da Vinci, Michelangelo, etc). I doubt any time of day is best to see these. I particularly enjoyed the lower level showcasing Greek art as the rooms were beautiful and there were few tourists.The moderns (Picasso, Monet, etc.). Are no longer housed in the main building. Rather, you have to go to the General Staff building. This was well worth it as there are a number of Monet and other modern masters.Most name plates have English, as well as a few longer information signs. We had some information on key pieces in a guidebook and got along fine. If you really like to know more than the title and artist you will want an audio guide or tour.We were in no rush and walked through the vast majority of rooms. This took us about 6 hours. It would be difficult to see much in less than 2 hours, especially when getting in and fighting crowds."

The oldest building was home to the imperial family, the others housed their art collection, they all are now brimming with incredible works from great European artists.The buildings are incredibly crowded thronging with tourists for all over the world. If one waits in line, it could be hours of waiting before one can enter.There are great paintings from famous artists, the most impressive being the Rembrandt's. The sculptures are magnificent, the armory room very impressive ma she Egyptology section almost as good as the British museum.Be prepared for lots of walking and heat can be daunting.

            "review": "in one word: overwhelming in size and contents. Officially named the State Hermitage Museum, this is probably the most visited site seeing event in St. Petersburg. And it is well worth the visit, though one should schedule at least one full day for a visit. You should also be prepared for large tour groups milling around in most of the exhibition holds and in front of toilets, which offer plenty of opportunities for pickpockets: be aware.The Museum comprises five buildings all connected and accessible with your admission ticket with the exception of the Winter Palace of Peter the First. The entrance to all is in the main winter Palace, the largest building of the complex located close to the Neva river and the Dvortsovyy Most bridge and street. The group tours enter on the river side, while the individuals use the inside entrance from the court yard. For all those who have their own transportation I would suggest leaving the car at the hotel, and taking a taxi rather than exposing oneself to the stress of finding a parking spot.Since you are dealing with two or three big buildings involving lots of stairs, very comfortable shoes are recommended; as a matter of fact, the guide brochure offered by the Museum requests that you do not wear high heels. I would also recommend, that you take some time before rushing into the Museum\u2019s exhibits, and decide what exhibitions you want to see the most. The information plan is very well organized and colour coded, allowing you to prioritize your wishes. It an enables you as well to find the shortest way from point A to point B.The staff is quite helpful though not always willing to offer information in English. Therefore a few Russian words might help to break the ice and show your willingness and accepting the mother tongue. All of a sudden you will find that the English or German or whatever will be offered as their alternative language.We found the toilets quite clean and the coffee shop on the main floor of the main building offering reasonable food options at reasonable prices. All floors are accessible to handicapped people including those in wheelchairs, though at times reaching ones\u2019 destination might be labourious.A definite must in St. Petersburg."

In high season the crush of mainly Chinese and Japanese tour groups all competing to take photos of the de Vinci\u2019s and Rembrandt\u2019s is a nightmare \u2013 luckily for the Rembrandt\u2019s there is a room full of them, and they don\u2019t have a clue what they are looking at, so they just take a few photos of the first one and leave the rest alone - thankfully. They should have a separate room with pictures of Mickey Mouse and Homer Simpson, tell them they are da Vinci\u2019s and Rembrandts, and they wouldn\u2019t be any the wiser. Either way, don\u2019t come here expecting the opportunity to quietly sit and admire a da Vinci \u2013 because you won\u2019t. Luckily I never rated da Vinci\u2019s paintings (sculpture a different matter) \u2013 the Mona Lisa doesn\u2019t look like she wears an enigmatic smile, in my opinion she looks like a constipated granny.Also make sure that you arrive before opening time (before 1030am) and have correct denomination of notes below 1000 Rubles so that you can use the ticket machines (they take 100 to 500 Ruble notes only, and the price pp is 600 Rubles), rather than queue for 100m with the crowds.The art work. Be selective, as there is so much to see. We whizzed through and still spent 3 hours inside and missed the entire downstairs, including the Egyptian room. I skimmed through the French section (I never rated French art \u2013 too overdramatic and all show \u2013 typical) and the English section (there are only a couple of landscapes worth seeing, and they are mainly poor portraits of Russian nabobs.) The English section doesn\u2019t even have any dogs playing poker! Big disappointment.But the Flemish and Dutch art is wonderful, and the tapestries following from climbing up the main staircase are also wonderful. Take your time with the Rembrandt\u2019s \u2013 you will never see such a collection, not even in Holland (although The Nightwatch is in Amsterdam and is probably my favourite painting.)The state rooms are beautiful. Being a geologist I can only stand in amazement at the malachite, rhodonite, porphyry (less so) and, most beautiful of all, the Lapiz tables, urns and other furnishings.I didn\u2019t make note of all the room names, but the red-flock-wall-papered throne room puts the best of British pubs to shame, and the golden columned (ball?-)room is beyond imagination.Summary: visit out of season and early to try avoid the crowds; use the ticket machines; spend time on the Rembrandt\u2019s and, I suppose if you like them, the da Vinci\u2019s and other paintings; and be prepared to spend a whole day inside, because if you really want to do the place justice, then you will need that long! Oh \u2013 and the audio guide is worth the money."

The second day, he was determined to see it, so we got there at 10:30 in the morning. After being in line for one hour, we were almost halfway up to the door. There are these announcements made that are almost inaudible and you cannot hear them very well over the wind and talking. I told my brother, \"It sounds like they are saying something about ticket machines.\" There were about 5 machines near the back of the line that look like ATM's, but since I live in Russia, I am accustomed to seeing KACCA or Tickets at places that sell tickets. These machines were not marked in any way. I told my brother to hold our place in line, and I walked back to look at the machines. Sure enough, they sold tickets, and you could by pass the two hour line and walk straight into the museum. Why they do not have these ticket machines marked is beyond me, but what a waste of valuable time! Just think, the first day, we LEFT. Perhaps we would have never come back! They need to get their outside signage updated to fit the expectations of tourists. It is a pretty simple thing to know where to buy tickets! Come on Hermitage! How long have you been open?!? Also, since the lines are so long, they should put a shelter for people to stand under. I would NEVER stay in that line if it was raining- which it does almost 6 out of 7 days there."

Buy the ticket on the Russian website. It's identical to the English one but oddly tickets are half the price. Irena Domingo has a blog that tells you how to do this.3. Go on Wednesday or Friday evening when it's open till 9pm - the rooms are much quieter after 6pm.4. Allow plenty of time!5. Get an audioguide. The English tour doesn't happen that often and you'll just be stuck in a group without having a chance to pause and look more closely.6. Ask when the Peacock Clock operates.

I loved the Peacock Clock; Nicolas II's library was evocative; the Treasury (one could go in as part of a pre-booked group) had a lot of interest. However, the main art collection was a big disappointment. It did not live up to the hype. Many of the famous pictures allegedly by great names were actually \"attributed to\" and not of the calibre you might see in the Louvre or the Galleria Borghese for example. I think the most interesting collection was the 19th century aristocratic portraits by Christina Robertson which were brilliant. It is worth mentioning that the loos are good and the catering very well priced."

Long queues to get in could be alleviated but having longer opening hours. The museum doesn't open until 10:30 am and by then everyone is queuing up to enter. Upon entry you need to queue again for the cloakrooms as you cannot take bags or coats inside-althoguh we did see some people with these in the museum-not sure how that happened. You cannot return to the cloakroom unless exiting the museum, and then you would need to buy a new ticket to get in. So make sure you have everything you need with you when you leave the cloakroom. However you can't take a waterbottle or snack into the museum By lunch time we could see the queue to enter was enormous-through the courtyard and all around the square, What these poor folk standing in the rain didn't realise was that the ticket office was closed for lunch. Really? Who treats customers like that? Most of the tourists inside the museum were in groups and frequently blocked the flow around the museum. The whole experience was like trying to view fine art on a crowded commuter train. Fantastic building though! very ornate richly decorated walls and ceilings."

It can be very hot and crowded in the state rooms with up to 17000 visitors each day in peak season. Security requests that no water bottles be taken in so make sure you're well fed and hydrated and then feast your eyes on fabulous gilded and chandeliered state rooms with Delft tiled storage heaters in each corner, see artefacts of the most decorative order, stunning parquetry floors, frescoed walls and art works beautifully curated.

It did not disappoint. I went to Russia as part of a cruise of the Baltics that had 3 days in Peter (as the locals call it.) As an art buff, I read and heard from other visitors that their biggest regret was that they were limited to 2-3 hours in the museum and didn't get to see the Impressionist works. After checking comments on Trip Advisor, we selected a local tour group so we could see more than the ship excursions were offering and spent about 8 hours in the Palace over 2 of the 3 days we were in port. Our guide (Marina with Inside Tours) was very knowledgable and we covered everything I wanted to see, from the Treasury Rooms to the Old Masters, Impressionists, Peacock Clock and more. The palace itself is stunning. Some popular works were hard to see with the crowds, such as Leonardo's Madonna and Child with Goldfinch, but be patient and you'll finally get to the front. Our first day was a Tuesday and Marina said it was the busiest day there because it was closed on Mondays and Catherine's Palace in Pushkin was closed Tuesdays, so everyone hits The Hermitage Tuesday. If you can go, do but get tickets prior to the visit, particularly to the Treasury Rooms as they are on a strict schedule. Exhausting, but well worth it."

We concentrated on Italian, Spanish, French art (main building, 2nd floor) and also went to see the post/impressionists & other contemporary paintings which were recently relocated to a separate (impressively renovated) building, across from the main building.

I am almost sure that if I had 3 weeks here in some sort of important position, I could design the inside so that it is not confusing and doesn't take away from the experience. When you are inside, nothing is clear, you don't know which way to go, there is hardly any information on any of the works and its like a stadium at halftime inside. I understand this is Russia so I do not expect nor was I expecting all the information in the world, however more information could of easily been produced in English about the artworks, time periods, etc. There is more I can say but no need for me to say it. However, had I known previously what I know now, I would not have wasted 600 rubles or my time on this place."

It was founded in 1764 by Catherine the Great with the main complex made up of 6 buildings, 5 being open to the public. The Hermitage is one of the largest and oldest in the world with over 3 million works of art.I highly recommend going as part of an organized tour as this will get you into the group entrance instead of the main entrance where the line was at least 2 football field lengths (maybe more see photo attached) long. Our guide surveyed us before going in and was able to get us to the things that we wanted to see and most popular pieces in our half day visit. You could probably spend weeks here and still not see everything. The complex in itself is incredible. Photography is allowed but with no flash. The admission fee was around 300 rubles or $10.00 us. Tour companies will mark this fee up with the inclusion of a tourguide."

Try to divide your trip into two days.5. Take a tour guide if you are short of time but if possible do it slowly at a leusurely pace using the audioguide.6. If you are an art lover you are in heaven. However part of the heaven has moved across the square to the Staff gallery. This is the one with the Impressionists, the post impressionists and the Picassos. You can enter this with the same ticket. Try to set aside atleast a couple of hours for that.7. In the main museum, there is a dizzying collection of Rembrandts and Reubens along wirh some Da Vincis and an incredible work by Michelangelo8.

Its big, it has an extensive collection of art from all over the world. The building in itself is already a masterpiece.Its a must-see when you are in Saint Petersburg. Just some tips:Make sure you book your ticket vouchers online. It will make you save tons of time and avoid waiting in line for tickets (which will take hours). It will cost a little more, but will give you huge amount of convenience.Wear comfortable shoes. Walking through the museum is a physical task. Make sure to be ready for serious amount of walking! Went on a summer and it was packed! The locals I talked to said that winter time is the best time to visit the museum, as there are very few tourists (but you get to experience the infamous SPB winter).If you do not have a lot of time, i suggest you visit the Russian Art collection, and the art from Siberia and Central Asia, exhibits you might probably only see in the Hermutage. There are pieces worth visiting (Like a Cezanne, a Picasso and Athena's head in the Greek Collection), but other exhibits you can see similar things on other museums.The building has different gallieries, designed with different themes (and jewels), i love the Malachite room personally. Most definitely you should also und your \"personal favortie room\"!"

The art collection alone is worth the trip with an amazing collection of Old Masters in an opulent building that almost exceeds opulence. The problem is that is so crowded that you will struggle to see much. Try and go on your own and you will face a wait of at least an hour and it rain quite a lot in this city. Go with a tour and you will reduce the wait but will end up being taken through at a brisk pace battling with wave after wave of other tourists all following their guides. Yes you should visit but don't bother during the summer months unless you are made of sterner stuff than our family"

You can't hope to see it all in one visit. I recommend going with a tour group, as small a group as you can manage. Groups can pre-book a set entry time and avoid the long line ups faced by independent visitors AND that entry time can give earlier access than independent visitors can get. If you come to St. Petersburg on a cruise, you may be able to book a tour that visits in the evening and I was told this was a more relaxed way to see the Hermitage though I did not do this. Wear good walking shoes and be prepared for stairs, congestion and line-ups inside the buildings. Also be prepared to be amazed!"

The winter palace is also nice to visit, but we had visited Catherine's palace the day before so the winter palace was unimpressive after Catherines. Unfortunately the day we visited the Hermitage, there were 5 cruise ships in port and the crowds were insane. I've never seen crowds anywhere in the world as bad as what we experienced in the Hermitage the day we were there. We arrived relatively early and didn't have to wait in line too long, but once in the museum and palace looking out into the square, the line was huge, stretching throughout the square. If in St. Petersburg, the Hermitage should be on the top of your sightseeing list despite any crowds."

The Hermitage may be the cream of the cream of art museums in the world since the buildings themselves are works of art and vessels of Russian history. The collection of art and artifacts is overwhelming. We spent three hours as part of an organized tour with SPB and we got to see an enormous collection but we know we probably only scratched the surface. The museum becomes increasingly crowded as the day goes on and the staff does a great job of crowd control, but some suggestions for maximizing your experience are contract with an organized tour group and be sure your tour guide is knowledgeable about the museum and its art and history and knows how to navigate the enormous space. If you choose to go independently, the line tends to go around the block and, in my opinion, spending two hours or more on line is a waste of time."

            "review": "A Great Museum. My wife and I toured the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg in May 2016. What a fabulous place. The name \"hermitage\" means \"a place of solitude.\" The Hermitage is located in the Winter Palace of Empress Elizabeth Petrova and the palace was greatly expanded by Empress Catherine the Great and she began collecting the artistic treasures that were the beginning of the Hermitage. The Hermitage is one of the greatest museums in the world and easily rivals the Louvre in Paris. The collections are extensive and are magnificent. The rooms of the palace of the Romanov tsars are also restored. The palace was restored to its former glory which was destroyed by the Nazis during WWII during the 911 day siege of St. Petersburg. Most of the collections (two train loads) were moved deeper into Russia when the Germans attacked Russia and thus were preserved. The rest of the collections were stored in the cellars and thus protected from shelling. The Russians also captured a lot of art that the Nazis took during the war and placed it in the Hermitage. In touring the palace with its beautiful rooms, much of the art collection is also viewed. The collection is vast with many magnificent paintings and sculpture. Works by Leonardo da Vinci, Madonna with a Flower, the Little Madonna and the Benois Madonna, are on display. Paintings include Gainsborough's The Lady in Blue, Gros's Napoleon on the Bridge at Arcola (a different-looking Napoleon), Delacroix, Titian's Danae and The Repentant Mary Magdalene, Caravaggio's The Lute Player, Ruben's The Union of Earth and Water and Perseus and Andromeda, Rembrandts, El Grecos and many others. Sculptures include Canova's The Three Graces (a beautiful white-marble group), the Dionysis Hall filled with Roman and Greek statues as is the Jupiter Hall, and many other sculptures that are simply exquisite. In one of the palace rooms there is a huge shiny brass clock called the Peacock clock which was made in England in the 18th century and has many intricate works. There is a huge Peacock standing on a brass tree trunk with a large brass rooster below the Peacock and a metal owl in a brass cage containing several bells that ring when struck. On the hour the Peacock comes alive and spreads its HUGE brass tail, while the rooster crows and the bells are chimed. It is truly a wonder and I had never seen anything like it before. There are many rooms within the palace but the ones I thought were wonderful were (1) the Raphael Loggias, copies of the loggia in the Vatican, (2) the Jordan staircase in white marble and gold trim, (3) the Hall of Peter the Great with a inlaid parquet floor that is simply outstanding and awe inspiring, (4) the Gallery of 1812 with many portraits of Romanov generals, and (5) the huge St. George Hall, a throne room of white Carrara marble with a large throne decorated with the Romanov crown and the Russian double eagles (as are the gold chandeliers in the room). Many of the rooms in the palace have beautiful inlaid parquet floors or mosiac floors. The great Impressionist paintings are now located in the General Staff Building across the great plaza and these should not be missed. There are exquisite paintings by Pissaro (The Boulevard Montarte), Renoir, Monet, Cezanne, Vincent van Gogh, Gaughan, Signac, Rousseau, Picasso (several including The Absinthe Drinker), Matisse, Vlaminck, Dufy, Kandinsky and others. Many of these Impressionist paintings I had never seen before not even in books. Since we only had a morning and part of an afternoon, we simply did not have time to sit an marvel and the beautiful artwork. We had also opted for the private access tour on which we were taken by bus to another neighborhood in St. Petersburg to huge buildings where other Hermitage treasures were stored including furniture, clothing of the tsars and empresses (including Catherine the Great's green military-style outfit that we saw her wearing in a portrait of her on her horse), tents from rulers of the middle east, and a huge room of carriages of the tsars including coronation carriages. On the whole, I like the private access tour but I would have appreciated more time in the General Staff Building.  I recommend that you reserve two whole days for touring the Hermitage so you are not rushed and so that you don't become burned out and overwhelmed by seeing so much great art in a short period of time."

Your holiday in St. Petersburg would not be complete without a visit to the Hermitage, one of the largest and oldest museum collections in the world. Since it is the peak tourist season during summer, do expect long queues and big crowds when you visit. We started off our tour of the Hermitage from the Winter Palace, which has a really impressive white-and-gold grand double staircase that is bound to leave a memorable impression. The Hermitage museum-complex consists of five different buildings, the Winter Palace, the Hermitage Theatre, the Small Hermitage, the Old Hermitage and the New Hermitage. The highlight of the Hermitage buildings are the art pieces, and the various rooms usually have a theme, e.g. Rembrandt, or art from the Italian Renaissance period etc. The Winter Palace showcases more of the grandiose palace rooms to give you an idea of what the lives of the Russian Tsars were like in the past. Because the museum-complex is so vast, it is impossible to see the entire collection in one visit; so you might wish to consider keeping two days if you have the luxury of time in St. Petersburg. Or, if you have only an afternoon to spare like I did, you could zoom in on the more renowned pieces by celebrated artists like Michelangelo, Raphael and Rembrandt. There\u2019s also the Peacock Clock in the Small Hermitage that\u2019s really cool as well; it looks nothing like one but it actually is clock that still functions today."

I knew it would be busy but I had no idea of what the crowds would be like.Next time I would plan to purchase a 2-day pass and the audio guide and do it on my own time so if I would get lost in this enormous museum it wouldn't matter!I had to pay extra to see the \"Modern\" Impressionist and post-impressionist paintings in another building but it was well worth it. Could have spent a day in this part alone. Unbelievable collection of VanGogh, Monet, Manet, Matisse, Picasso, etc."

There is so much to see and after a while there is too much to take in, the architecture and the exhibits and the related history. You must have a guide to explain it all. Our guide avoided the crowds but that may have been at the expense of seeing important things. I suspect that you could go regularly for a week and still not see everything, let alone appreciate it."

The historical imperial rooms were so grand and the arts collection was equally spectacular. We were here with TJ Travel for about 2 hours only, too rushed a visit but we were still able to see plenty, thanks to our tour guide. We walked through Field Marshall Room, Memorial Hall of the Peter the Great, Armorial Hall, War Gallery of 1812, St. George Hall, Pavilion Hall (Peacock Clock). Then, we saw the art works by Leonardo da Vince (Benois Madonna, Litta Madonna, see contrast of the style), Titian (Danae), Raphal (Conestabile Madonna, and replica of Vatican Loggia), Michelangelo (Crouching Boy), Canova (The Three Graces), and Rembrandt (another Danae, The Prodigal Son) etc. Due to the time constraint, we didn\u2019t visit the General Staff building for its modern impressionist collection. The museum is the third largest after Louvre and NY MET with ~3 million collections. My advice is to get an Hermitage guidebook at the museum or any gift shop to make your visit more memorable. The museum was very crowded, so you better off enjoy photos in the guidebook. If you come on your own, you can find self walking tour info in Rick Steves tour book and saint-petersbrug.com or familiarize yourself with a virtual tour at hermitagemuseum.org. With limited on what we could see, we nevertheless left very impressed.The name \"Hermitage\" (French, \"abode of a hermit\") just makes it even more contrasting."

If you buy your ticket on line you will pay a lot more (I paid $17.95 per adult) but the line is much shorter. there is a kiosk selling tickets by the 'internet' entrance. Those tickets were 600 rubles each. After you go through the 'Internet' entrance (to the right of the main entrance, down the alley between the green and cream colored buildings) you will be able to check your bags and coats for free. It's a good idea to drop off anything you don't want to carry around for hours. But remember you will not have access to the bags until you leave.Use the bathrooms since the ones inside are not as nice and are spread out/ difficult to navigate to.If you have children in your group you will need to get a free ticket at the counter before you go through the turn style.If you have checked your bags pay attention to the halls you walk through (Egyptian) so you can find your way back.It's ok to go through without a tour guide, guide book, audio guide or app on your phone. It's ok to just walk around and look at stuff. If your family is like mine, they'll be happier if they can just walk around and look at some things without knowing the history and detailed explanations or the artistic significance of The works for they see. It's ok to just enjoy it on your own terms. If you're an art liver and history buff we would love a tour.My daughter enjoyed finding the dogs in art work. You can tell which things are famous by where all the tour groups stop and take pictures.Your ticket is also good for the General Staff building across the square (the long yellow building). This is where the Impressionists are kept. I will write a separate review. You should make sure to go.While in the Hermitage pick one work of art you really like. Sit and look at it for 10-15 minutes. Look at it from all angles. Take a picture (no flash). Take a selfie. Buy a postcard later if one is available. Make sure to find out the artist and year. Take a picture of the sign if you might forget.Later when your snobby friends talk about a \"must see\" work of art (that you didn't see) you can talk in great detail about your favorite work of art and ask if they saw it.There is no way to see it all."

Because of Russian visa requirements, it was essential to book shore excursions via the ship.This tour is a must, allowing early entry and relaxed viewing before the hordes arrive.Three hour queues are common at peak times.This is undoubtedly the best museum I have ever seen, the wow factor increasing with every minute.Our excellent Russian tour guide had calculated that if you spent fifteen seconds at every display, and allowed time to eat and sleep, it would take sixteen years to see it all!I can believe it.A must.The gold and diamond rooms are separate trips which we didn't have time to see unfortunately, next time maybe."

As it is quite a large museum it is a good idea to take an audio guide so you can see the important rooms and you can take your time to listen to the description as some of the inscriptions are only in Russian, sometimes the museum can get really full and with all the tours it is hard to move around without getting pushed out of the way, therefore try going in the afternoons. The ticket is only valid for one day and it is impossible to see the Hermitage in just one day so they should consider making tickets valid for longer."

You could spend almost a day, without looking at a single exhibit, just walking from room to room looking at the walls, floors and especially the ceilings. Once you start checking out the exhibits, if you read all the available information, you could easily be there a week. I would heartily recommend buying your own ticket ( much less expensive from the machine by the 'Internet voucher' door than online) than going with a guided tour because on those you are whisked through at great pace with no time to study anything as you are constantly trying to keep pace with your guide."

This should be a more exciting place to visit, due to the spectacular art, but I found that I didn't really enjoy my time here. You can see rare da Vinci paintings, a Michelangelo sculpture, Rembrandts, and so much more...but the place is swamped with an unmanageable number of visitors. Fire code in the United States would never in a million years allow this place to keep functioning this way. When you first go in the main hallway and go up the main set of stairs, it feels like you're on the verge of a trampling. It gets better, especially if you are there to see all sorts of different artistic works, and not just the really famous stuff. I actually heard someone walk up to a Rembrandt asking, \"Is this the famous one?\" before taking out his cell phone to take a photo. It's great that people are interested in seeing art, if even for the celebrity of it all, but it's difficult to appreciate art when you're being rushed along so the next group of people can snap a pic to use in their online posts. Another oddity is the fact that there is no air conditioning in 95% of this place. And it gets very warm with all the bodies in there. Not to mention, muggy, since it's often overcast or raining in St. Petersburg. We wondered if it wouldn't damage the art, since every other major museum I know checks for temp and humidity on the hour in their galleries. It was a bit bizarre, even with windows cracked open to try to alleviate some of the heat...which meant more moisture comes in. Anyway, I digress. We would suggest that the Hermitage do what the British Library and the British Museum have done: take your masterpieces that the vast majority of people most care about and put them on the nearest floor, in a sort of best-of-the-best area. That way, they could eliminate people having to wander all over kingdom come to find a few pieces of art and art lovers who are interested in seeing the other stuff don't have to deal with as many crowds. Like other people suggest, you can buy your tickets from eight electronic kiosks in the courtyard (four on each side - go to the right side where nobody notices they are and there probably won't be a line at all) rather than wait in the huge line. A big bonus is that they sometimes stop selling tickets to the people waiting in line due to being overcrowded inside...they didn't seem to stop sales at the kiosks, though, so after we bought our tickets, we walked to the front of the line, showed them our tickets and walked right in. Coat check is free. You can probably find lists of their artworks available on their website, so I won't cover any of that here. Bring a fan."

The main clock room holds 3000 coats. The process of getting in, especially if waiting in the rain, which was the situation when we visited results in frayed tempers and aggressive behaviour which we experienced. The museum holds fantastic paintings and artefacts. We booked to visit the gold room in our tour which was spectacular. The only downside of the gold room was that the tour guide was a member of the museum team and did not speak English. This resulted in our tour guide translating everything that was said, which was not ideal and like being in a time delay. The tours around the museum are closely timed and you have yo keep walking either in some areas no stopping yo take photos. Would thoroughly recommend the museum if visiting the city but patients us required to overcome the queues"

If you want some quality time to appreciate key pieces, arrive early, perhaps a make a number of short morning visits, or better still brave the cold and visit off-season. Otherwise be prepared to jostle for position for your turn to get 10 secs in front of a Da Vinci. If a single visit is all you can do and you're tight on time, a tour guide may be best as they know the quick routes through the main exhibits. If you're going it alone, get a on-line guide beforehand and plan the route out.

Well as recommended we arrived early and at that time the queues were manageable.On reflection though we wished we had booked online and then you could more or less walk straight through to the front of the queue.We actually spent five hours in here so that gives you an indication as to how much we enjoyed the visit. I would say first of all ignore the irritation of the organised cruise tours who obviously think that their visit is more important than everyone else's!This place is spectacular from the minute you walk though the entrance gates there is so much to see and enjoy and as a bonus the exhibitions are housed in some spectacular buildings. Many of your major artists are here such as Gainsborough, Rembrant, Reynolds etc etc. Plus we even found work from Joseph Wright a local artist for us coming from Derbyshire! There were lots of early statues and artwork and once you have started in the exhibitions before you realise it you will have spent many hours of enjoyment walking around the various floors of sites to see."

While the museum is impressive and has wonderful exhibits and pieces, the crowd and lack of efficient crowd control killed the experience.Long lines and people pushing to get through gets tiring. I suggest going as soon as they're open (or beforehand and stand in line), as by 11 on the day we visited they closed the entrance for a few hours as they were at capacity. When leaving we saw the line extend into the middle of the square; not worth waiting that long in our opinion.If you haven't seen any of the other palaces or museums in Russia, then it's worth it. We really enjoyed visiting the quieter parts of the museum (top floor)."

That was despite being in a subgroup of thirty or so. It's probably a case for a money belt being worn under all your outer clothing. It's not convenient but it should preserve your valuables.Refreshments are available (and you'll need them - this tour can be quite exhausting) but there seems to be just one person serving the hordes.

As we are not avid art lovers the idea did not appeal, but as it is on the agenda of most tours we did not have a lot of choice!How wrong we were. Our guide Tanya, from Guide Guru, quickly evaluated our interests as being more about architecture and interiors than art, and very efficiently moved us through more of the glorious Winter Palace rooms and just some of the more important parts of the art museum. The experience was truly amazing and we were very appreciative of our guide taking the trouble to accommodate our interests."

Once inside if it has been raining you will likely have umbrellas/jackets, you will have to check those to your left. Depending on the madness of the main hall there is another entrance in the 1400 or less small coat check. If you can and its not crazy rain, leave everything at the hotel you can and don't check anything as that is as much a hassle as getting in.To give you an idea, we waited in line to get in for about ten minutes with pre purchased tickets, the long line is roughly 3 hours.

All of these being on the same floor was nice. I had a map of the floor and circled and wrote in what I wanted to see. As you walk in each room, look for the room number above one of the doors. This will help guide you around.  TIPS:Buy tickets online-even if you read there won't be a line or you can use the kiosks, this took the guess work out and you knew you were ready for entry.Download the free APP-very helpfulIt's crowded & rooms can get hot-especially the Rembrandt roomThere are a few seats in many rooms-kids found them...Use the bag check for big backpacks. Carry water bottle & snack in your smaller bag. Know there are tours & individuals who will likely cut you off, take up entire viewing space, walk right in front when you thought you were the front row, elbow to get in front, etc. Be prepared to jostle right back or you might not get a peek.We saw what we wanted in about 3 hours.

            "review": "Pick and choose from a wealth of wonders. We spent six hours in the Hermitage ... it was nothing like enough. In fact six days would probably only scratch the surface. We last visited more than 40 years ago when Petersburg was Leningrad and we, as students, were closely supervised. The supervision is still a problem. Visiting during a cruise, the only way we were allowed off ship was as a group ... unless we cared to organise individual visas. So the speed of the trip was reflected in a largish group. On the up side this meant we were able to enter the museum at any earlier time than allowed by general admissions. We had a tour of one of the gold rooms, too. Both these seemed only to be available as a group. The gold was fabulous and its history haunting. Even with the early admission the rooms seemed very busy. Our highlight trip then went through the five buildings which make up the Hermitage. We went nowhere near the modern paintings in the General Staff Building. Since the Impressionists were at the heart of our previous visit this became a necessary evil. Many works left a lasting memory: Michaelangelo's Crouching Boy; the 1812 Gallery; the Grand Church; the Pavilion Hall with its mighty mosaic and Peacock Clock by James Cox. The tiny Head of an Old Man by Rubens stopped me for longer than it should and I nearly lost the rest of the party. It was intriguing, too, to see pictures last viewed in Norfolk at Houghton Hall. For a brief period many of the works sold from that collection to Catherine the Great were allowed back to Britain for the Houghton Revisited exhibition.  As with our previous visit, I did find that a number of paintings were hung facing the light. In sunshine this made it difficult to view them in their full glory. My advice with the Hermitage and limited time is to study the museum's website and plan a route to see just what you want to, Along the way you will pass Rembrandts, Van Dykes, Raphaels and da Vincis. It will be up to your schedule to decide for how long you stop and stare."

Found the whole experience very pleasurable, we had a 2 day ticket, what was good about this place compared to the Catherine and Peterhof, is that one could take one's time and see things again and again. The vasteness of the palace meant that there was always something new to see. In the General Staff Building, the Impressionist paintings were particularly appealing with all the masters of the genre being represented, Monet, Renoir, Degas, Picasso etc. On the ground floor there was a famous painting of the young Bonaparte in Italy. Of all the places I went to, the Winter Palace and its accompanying buildings was the best value for 800 Roubles on a 2 days ticket."

Save your energy for the truly great art works of this world in Paris, Rome and London where equally large crowds behave appropriately and give you space to enjoy the material on display.

There are 5 different buildings joined together that makeup the museum. It is filled with beautiful architecture and an impressive collection of over 3000 items. We were hurried through the visit as we were on a tour and we spent nearly an hour waiting in line to get in. But even though we were on a short trip through it was worth seeing. Make sure to look up at the elaborate ceilings. Photography is allowed except for flash. And there is a lengthy security clearance to get into the actual museum once you are in. Do not bring backpacks or any other type of large bag. You will have to check your coats (especially if wet) in the cloak room which adds to time at the back end to get your belongings back. It's definitely a must see and better if you allow more time to leisurely go through."

How else will you know where to enter and what to see in what order? How else will you easily get into the Treasury Room, which requires a special arrangement and a specially trained lecturer, even if you come with your own guide?But if you do come on your own be sure to purchase your ticket online. This will prevent you from waiting on a long queue in order to be admitted. (I don't believe that the price is any different.) Once you have your ticket, lines are short or non-existent. But know this, online tickets are only admitted through a special entrance on the side of the museum (not joking, as this museum has many entrances, which results in a great deal of confusion for visitors).Next, be sure to STUDY the layout of the museum. You can do this online or even through various smart phone applications. Try to prioritize your interests among the many subject areas from Russian treasures to Greek Sculpture to Western European Art of earlier centuries to French Impressionism. And do make an appointment to see the Treasury Room, which is similar in nature to the Green Vault in Dresden, if you've ever been there. Amazingly fine treasures were given to the Czar by subjects of his expansive country (a country so large that its boundary touches upon other empires such as China, Turkistan, Iran, etc.). Were these subjects who provided such treasures paying homage or were they providing fealty in order to ask for favors? A good read of Tolstoy's novella, \"Hadjii Murat,\" will help you to understand how such a collection might have been formed.Western Art in the museum covers paintings from the Netherlands, from Italy, from France, and from Great Britain. Rembrandt is given particular emphasis in this collection, but, alas, there is not one Pieter Breugel, the Elder, and few El Grecos or Abstract Expressionists. As expansive as it is, this is not a perfectly balanced and curated collection. 20th Century European Art is in a completely different building where you are admitted by the same ticket but must cross a very large central courtyard to get there. In winter, you will need to dress in your outerwear, even if for only 5 minutes.Bathrooms are a bit sparse. Food is served in one central area, but for all I know there are other locations I never saw. Do not expect a full meal, only a sandwich or pastry and a drink. Since there is so much to see, it might be cost and time-effective to eat a hearty breakfast beforehand and then a large dinner once the museum closes. We decided to return for another half day visit, but alas there is no half-day admission price. If you purchase your ticket on your own, however (which we did not), you can get a two-day value ticket that saves a good deal of money.One final word of warning, beware of the men outside selling guide books. Two of them \"bumped\" into my wife and pick-pocketed her wallet! An unusual occurrence? Hardly, as we had been warned by our guide to be careful. But these guys are pros. Perhaps it's a good idea should you have two credit cards with you to keep each in a separate place. Anyway, this is one thing that is unlikely to happen visiting the Metropolitan Museum in New York or the Kunsthistoriches in Vienna. They have THAT on the Hermitage."

Next day was at the General Staff Building, which has all the Impressionists and almost all the toilets. I'd give the Hermitage 4 stars due to poor infrastructure for visitor comfort and the fact that it's packed with tour groups dully following their leaders and taking selfies. But since the art is over the top wonderful this brings it up to 5 stars. If you don't go with a tour and have the patience to wait while the hordes are blocking your view of the piece you want to see. While you're waiting go look at the other paintings the tour groups aren't looking at."

Amazing and beautiful things from all time periods and places. Stunning. We went twice for many hours each day and I think we still missed stuff. And the rooms of the palace...left me speechless.Some info/suggestions that I hope will help:1. The Hermitage is CLOSED ON MONDAY.2. Info I saw online said you have to bring your passport. Nope. We were there on two different days and no one ever asked for a passport.3. You can buy your tickets online. The up side of that is that you are spared a long and very slow line. Down side is that that charge significantly more money online. But you have another option! There are ticket kiosks in the inner courtyard of the Palace by where you enter from Palace Square. These kiosks don't let you buy the multi-day passes--only one day passes--but these are MUCH faster than the main line. If we had stayed in the main line we'd probably still be there waiting to get in.4. If you like art or beautiful architecture even a little plan on more than one day.

You will be asked to leave it at security. The palace is huge and stunningly beautiful. Every room is different, every ceiling is incredible, every floor a triumph. I'm not kidding either. I've travelled the world and I'm not easily impressed but this is a place you should put on your bucket list.The only problem is the large tour groups of people, they are mainly Chinese, who are rude and seem to spend their time blocking the doorways and elbowing everyone out of the way. The Palace opens until 9pm on Wednesdays. Try and visit later in the day when the tour groups have gone home. There is an incredible amount of art and artifacts on show but the star is the palace itself."

There are thousands of people there during the day and you just would not get close enough to do justice to the art. This way we did. My wife was in a wheelchair so she had a virtually unobstructed view, which would not have been the case during the day. At the end of the visit we went to the large Italian Skylight Hall and there was a concert by the State Symphony Orchestra of St Petersburg. The music was so good and the setting just stunning. It was a privilege to listen to such talented musicians in these surroundings. We followed this with a champagne reception. OK it was expensive but it was a magical night and we all agreed it was an experience of a lifetime."

This is our second trip to St. Petersburg and we spent four hours with a guide inside the Hermitage - we loved that the impressionists and post-impressionist work was moved from the Winter Palace and into another building on the property. It requires a separate ticket, but at least it gives you space and quiet.The Winter Palace, full of Raphael and Rembrandt and other amazing treasures - not to mention being inside the Winter Palace (and its history) is amazing. It's also packed with people who are fine with pushing and other non-civilized behavior. Even with a pass and guide that got our family in 30 minutes before normal open, the Hermitage immediately becomes packed during prime visitor season.That said - it's an absolute must visit."

            "review": "Overwhelming in every sense. The State Hermitage Museum is overwhelming in every sense of the word. Plan to spend at least two half days, and research what you'd like to see online. For example, if you've seen plenty of ancient Egyptian sarcophagi in London or New York, you may want to save your energy for the Italian Renaissance paintings.First off, the complex is so vast that, although we had tickets we\u2019d purchased online, to use them we had to trudge a kilometer, after walking a couple of kilometers from the Admiralty metro station, to an entrance in the New Hermitage, separate from the main entrance in the Winter Palace. A couple of kind staff members helped us get my husband a wheelchair and take it, via key-operated lift, to a bridge connection the second floors of the two buildings. He disavowed any interest in the ancient Siberian, Caucasian and Central Asian art, which I had read about online and was keen to see. He encouraged me to leave him sitting in a wheelchair tucked next to a crescent of a floor mosaic while I sought out the galleries. I expected to return in 15 or 20 minutes but ended up being gone an hour, partly because I got lost twice, despite having the museum diagram with me. (The floor plan was available in both Russian and English, but not in any other language, although the audioguides came in greater variety.)I finally found the section I was looking for. It was worth the effort. The display cases of artifacts were accompanied by texts in Russian, with briefer versions in English, explaining the excavations of the ancient sites by careful Russian archaeologists. Of special interest were the Sogdians, whose territory now lies in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In the Fourth Century BCE they were conquered by Alexander the Great, and some small stone carvings in his image were on display; but they were independent throughout most of history. Until their conversion to Islam, they were Zoroastrians. The Sogdians dominated trade along the Silk Road from the Second Century BCE through the Tenth Century CE. Thanks to the dry climate, many ceremonial and everyday items, murals and even Chinese silks survived to be uncovered in the 20th Century. Images of Sogdian merchants appear in ancient Chinese art; in fact, one word for \u201cmerchant\u201d in Chinese is a variant off \u201cSogdian.\u201d Among the things I appreciated about the ancient Asian galleries was that there were almost devoid of visitors. Only 12 other people were peering at the cases, several of the taking notes. There wasn\u2019t a tour group in sight.One reason why the layout of the Hermitage is confusing is that it was designed as a set of palaces, not as a museum. In fact, the Russians deserve a hand for having accomplished the presentation of both aspects more or less successfully. Imagine merging the Louvre with Versailles!In fact, the painted, carved and gilded d\u00e9cor seemed to be getting short shrift from the crowds of tour groups, about half of them Japanese, intent on seeing the world-famous masterpieces hung on the walls. I somehow managed to pass twice through the Gold Room, Catherine the Great\u2019s elaborate, glittering, imposing main ballroom. Huge urns, some lapis, others malachite, adorned the galleries devoted to Spanish art, including some fine Goyas and Murillos.Pushing a wheelchair through room after room of Italian Renaissance, Dutch and Flemish paintings was like parting a Red Sea of tour groups, all intent on the paintings by Rubens, da Vinci, Rembrandt and the like. The Hermitage paintings are dramatically unequal, probably because Catherine the Great tended to purchase entire collections when they came on the market. To the museum\u2019s credit, the paintings of uncertain authorship are labeled \u201cAfter Rembrandt,\u201d \u201cWorkshop of Rubens\u201d and so on. After three and a half hours, we had seen or at least whipped through everything except the Russian Culture and Decorative Arts portions of the Winter Palace and the Hermitage. Both of us were reeling, from the effort of taking everything in as well as the effort of walking kilometers amid jostling, distracted crowds. My husband, whose sore knee was feeling better, gave me a break by switching places and pushing me in the wheelchair, but we got to the point where we couldn\u2019t even consider tromping over the General Staff Building to see the collection of 19th and 20th Century French art. So many Impressionists, so little energy!"

We were told by our guide that if someone spent one minute looking at every exhibit in The Hermitage, it would take eleven years to see every exhibit. An exaggeration perhaps, but an illustration of the size of this place.Tour groups are taken through a series of the most splendid rooms containing art, sculptures and other exhibits. Some amazing, rare and hugely valuable objects.The problem with all the main sights in St Petersburg is the volume of tourists trying to get access to view the beautifully restored buildings. Queues are long and many rooms in the various palaces cannot be seen to full effect because they are so full of people. The Hermitage is no exception and in the limited time we spent there \u2013 an hour and a half out of a two day tour \u2013 we had a tiny taste of what was on offer. Our guide was exceptionally knowledgeable about each of the rooms we visited and the items they contained. But with so much here, and so many other places to see in a short visit to this city one cannot do justice to this world-class museum and art gallery.For a decent chance to properly appreciate everything here, it would be necessary to make an independent visit to St Petersburg outside the cruise ship period and allocate much more time to enjoy the amazing exhibits. A guide is needed \u2013 if travelling independently and an audio guide is available, it would be a huge advantage to visit at a slower pace. The souvenir shops looked good, with an interesting selection of appropriately local souvenirs \u2013 similar shops were at most attractions and also at the cruise ship terminal and prices appeared to be much the same everywhere."

Remember to pring the e-tickets out which can be immediately used at the turnstile.For less arty first-timer, suggest to check out the highlights as stated in the Hermitage pamphlet first, as one day is definitely not enough for drilling into each piece of art work."

Like the Lourve, this is one you'll want to leave a lot of time for.Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and are good with stairs. We visited in July and it was warm inside, likely due to the amount of people. If you're with a tour group or just your family, it's easy to get separated because you're all picking your jaws up off the ground at different things at different times. I recommend finding the small cafe near the exit. It works well as a designated meeting spot and is before the actual exit so you are free to resume gawking until your feet give out."

Only a few people were there and we were taken by a guide to see several rooms.

Even if you are not very into art or don't know very much you can't help but marvel at the decor and stunning chandeliers."

We were still We through the rooms fairly quickly but we could at least enjoy the paintings and the grandeur of the palace without the space being completely full of people. We had a guide who spoke very clear English. We obviously only saw a very small section of the Hermitage and had no control over which rooms we were directed through, (Its very possible that other evening groups were being shown around another part of the museum as it is sooo vast). Towards the end of our tour we were shown into a beautiful salon and we had a private concert by the St Petersburg state Orchestra. So much more than anything I had anticipated. I thoroughly enjoyed this part of the program. After being shown through the Egyptian artefacts towards the exit we were offered a glass of champagne or orange juice.."

The Winter Palace and connected buildings are absolutely spectacular -- what an impression this must have created for first-time and regular visitors alike! The scale, the gilding and decoration, the furnishings, and all aspects combine to create the feeling. Certainly make sure to see the grand entrance hall, the small and large throne rooms, and the ballroom, but there are also many other places to enjoy. I particularly recommend the gaudy great church of the Winter Palace and the dark, carving-decorated, almost brooding study of the last Czar, Nikolas II.The art collections are phenomenal, with something for so many different interests. In the Western European painting, I found the Rembrandts and the two da Vincis to be terrific, even if they were justifiably mobbed. We took a private tour of the Treasury Room, which I highly recommend, and marveled at many things, particularly the Scythian metalwork from more than 2,500 years ago. Also, Oriental carpets are a particular interest of mine, and the Pazyryk carpet is the oldest surviving pile carpet -- a stunning work -- with the felts from the Pazyryk tomb being amazing as well. And you'll have much less of a crowd in this area of the museum.I have to also put in compliments for the Hermitage food service. The items we had were very good, and not terribly overpriced as sometimes happens with a captive audience. The food lines moved along reasonably, and we didn't have too much trouble getting a seat, either."

I read that if you spent one minute on each item in the Hermitage, and did it for 24 hrs. a day, it would take eight years to see it all. Having said that, if you love art at all, this is a \"must see.\" The collection is enormous, diverse and breathtaking in scope. An important note is that everything here was purchased by the Romanov family, unlike some museums which contain works that were \"liberated\" from other countries. We paid extra to see the \"Diamond Room\" and while the jewels and other jewel encrusted items were spectacular, the tour felt rushed (in fairness, the Diamond Room has it's own guides). We were visiting in May and even then, the crowds were huge. Be sure to go as early as you can, and even then, be patient. Once in, the wait will have been so worth it, but wear comfy shoes and be prepared for lots of steps. On our tour, according to my fitbit, we walked 3.11 miles during the tour; in just over 3 hours. Except in the Amber Room, you can take pictures, but no flash. Be sure to look up (ceilings are fantastic) and down (parquet wood floors, stunning) in addition to the objects in each room. From my point of view, just seeing the Rembrandts made the whole visit worthwhile; \"Prodigal Son\", \"The Man in Red\" \"The Crucifixion\"....just astounding. Oh, and the Malachite Room, the Lapis Room, the Egyptian Gallery, the Impressionist Room....you get the idea. Don't miss this."

One of the world's biggest museum, from what I've read, it is indeed huge and it would probably take a lot of time (and cost you a lot of money for the tickets) to visit it all. So, obviously we chose to see one thing of many, the painting galleries. We visited on a Saturday morning, hence the place was quite packed with tourists. Beautiful paintings from several Painting Schools (Dutch, Flemish, Italian, Spanish, French). The museum's rooms are also exquisitely decorated, very oppulent.The museum also hosts collections of Egyptian art, antiques, jewellery, etc.If I were to make a comment, though, the ventilation is nonexistent (compared to other big museums in the world-British Museum comes first in mind), and due to the crowds the air inside the rooms is hot and stuffy. This is not only annoying for the tourists, but also the lack of airflow could harm the painintgs in the long run. (Although there's obviously a few for this attraction, the conditions leave much to be desired. )The exterior of the museum's buildings, although gorgeous, is also in desperate need of a fresh coat of paint. (Is the Russian administration not interested in preserving its cultural heritage?)"

You are allowed to take pictures but no flash. I highly recommend that you buy tickets online (it is more expensive than buying at the museum) but you will get to skip the long lines at the museum entrance. With internet ticket, you can enter the museum through Millonnaya Street (at the end of museum building). There is an alley between 2 buildings. Look for the entrance sign (should be the 2nd door on the left). Go inside and show your tickets. It's a brand new entrance (yes, bathrooms are brand new too) with a big lobby. It seems like they designed this entrance for the foreigners. We were the only ones using this entrance while at the main entrance, there were literally lines of people (at least 300 to 400 people) waiting to get int.

The groups from ocean cruises are on a tight schedule so step aside and let them pass or prepare to be trampled. As others mentioned there is a ton to see and the rooms in the Winter Palace are magnificent. Don't miss the peacock clock and watch the short film that shows how it operates. Once you are through the highlights tour the crowds will thin substantially and you can view at a more leisurely pace. There is a very interesting exhibit of arms and armor on the first floor that was practically deserted. Hang on to your map because they aren't available in the museum and you don't get one at all if you come with a group. There is an app you can download and the museum has free wifi. Be aware that much like the Louvre you can't always get from point A to Point B without a detour to C. Example, you can only get to part of the first floor from the second floor.

Even with the two days, we did not see everything we wanted. One thing to keep in mind (and probably the only negative thing about the museum) is that once you enter one of the locations you can't leave and then return on the same day. Also, it gets really busy with tour groups coming in waves, especially in late mornings and early afternoon, so it is best to visit the major works either first thing in morning or end of the day.

We were here on an excursion so we had our own guide; this meant we got in early but it also meant we were guided to where they wanted us to go. I would love to have several days to go through here, it is incredible ! The building itself is worth walking through and seeing, but the displays are ... wow ... ! If you are in St. Petersburg you have to make this a stop !! Our guide told us she is often asked how long it takes to see everything, she said if you stood at each display for 30 seconds it would take 3 years to see everything !! Luckily, the organization of things makes it easy to see what you would be most interested in seeing. Highly recommend !!"

The building is old and the maintenance of the facilities is rather basic. There is no environmental control in the museum. Many of the items are poorly lite and hard to see. The Gold Room provided an opportunity to view the oldest collection of gold pieces from the 7th to 4th centuries BC. The displays were hard to view and enjoy. The crowds are large and at times very pushy to get the best views. While we enjoyed the art we did not enjoy the experience.

Try to be there off the main season; try to do it in a small group.

If you have older guests, you may want to strategize the specific areas you want to see. There are stairs. Some rooms have air and others do not so at times it gets very stuffy. You are allowed to take pictures inside except for rooms with temporary exhibits and the Amber Room. If you're coming on a cruise ship - try to book a private tour - many are able to get you in prior to it opening. Though the cruise ships say they do too, it is VERY hard to be a large group in the Hermitage. You won't see nearly as much as you can with a private guide. (I used Guide Guru.)

I last visited the Hermitage about 20 years ago - it had an extensive but tired collection in a tired, poorly lit building.It is now totally transformed. The collection remains world-class, but the building is now an equal star. Almost all the rooms have been extensively renovated - new parquet floors, beautiful building, excellent lighting. This truly does feel like a palace of the Tsars.Signage remains limited - consider another source if you want more than title, artist and date. But there is wifi throughout the building (ostensibly so you can download the Hermitage apps and buy content through in-app purchase, but I was able to use for browsing as well).Crowds can be crushing, but get away from the main routes and they thin out tremendously. And if you buy your tickets online in advance through the Hermitage website you can use the secret entrance off Millionarskaya ulitsa which was completely empty when we entered.As others have noted, the cafe is serviceable. We found it surprisingly uncrowded despite the hordes in the museum - presumably all on tours with lunch booked elsewhere. It gave us the energy to continue our exploration after lunch.A word about the new (2014) General Staff building which holds impressionists and modern art. This is included in admission and is a world-class museum in its own right - definitely make time for it. The building is a fantastic renovation of an older building, with glassed over courtyards and elevated walkways. Currently still 'filling out', only about 1/3 the rooms are full (May 2016) which meant we could tack on in 2 hours after the Hermitage (seeing about 1/3-1/2 the collection). When it is full it will require more time.All in all, wonderful to see how improved the Hermitage is in the 20 years since I last visited."

There was no one on the grand staircase with us and we got to explore rooms by ourselves which makes for good photos. But no matter the season you visit (meaning you might have to line up) it is worth visiting. The state rooms of the Romanov family were beautiful as was the furniture & the art work of course. It is definitely worth a visit for the history & because it is so beautiful & grand. We didn't get an audio guide but perhaps in hind sight it would have been beneficial. We also got really lost even though we had a map.....it's quite large. The cafe was packed on the way out (we had already decided a big breakfast was in order to avoid having to eat there as I heard the food was ordinary). Souvenir shops on the way out had some nice things & I think you can also shop online from their souvenir shop now as well.

It is housed in a hall that looked like you are in Crete or ancient Athens.The Egyptian collection is one where we felt was \"worth more\" than the one in Cairo. Not in the number of exhibits but in terms of the quality, display and the lack of a crowd. There is a real mummy on display when we were there, so you do not need to pay extra like somewhere else (ahem) for the viewing pleasure.At the end of the whole tour, your eyes may be popping our from sheer exhaustion of looking at all these beautiful and well preserved exhibits.

It's a very huge area so not recommended for people who can't walk much..plus there are so many exhibits that no matter how hard u try it's impossible to see even half of it , so u always have that feeling that u have not seen the whole of it, nevertheless it's a must if u r in St Petersburg but make sure to visit it before Peterhof Palace..Hermitage is well maintained and looked after unlike most of the historical sites in India."

Our two year old slept in the stroller throughout the entire tour but I think this wouldn't be a fun place for a toddler if they weren't sleeping.

Overwhelming opulence, treasures at every turn both as part of the building and separately displayed. As with most museums in the city, the huge collections of art, culture & antiquities are breathtaking. Words fail to adequately describe.One major drawback - the hordes, and I do mean hordes of visitors in every room and we visited in what is regarded as off-season."

We love the story about why they named it the Hermitage (for the hermit queen who had tables that raised an lowered so if she did not even want to see a servant she did not have to). Mostly we loved the amazing art. Do not come here looking for Russian art. It is in a different museum, but the rest of Europe is so well represented here. Also, do not miss the large peacock clock. Though it is only allowed to actually function in full on Tuesday evenings at 7:00, there is a great video to show what it does. Must see.

Start with the Russian Imperial collection, then nationalize art in private hands after the revolution, and you get an exhaustive collection. You need about three hours if you are just going to walk through without stopping much, especially as now the more recent art (impressionists) is housed in a separate building across the plaza. we had two half day stints and were very pleased with what we got to see, but could have gone back for another day. I suggest splitting it up, as it can get mind-numbing after a few hours - one gallery just filled with Rembrandts. The newly developed space for the impressionists is beautifully designed, with plenty of room for the art. One downside of the displays in the Winter Palace and adjoining buildings is that there is ofter reflected light on the paintings, making some works difficult to see. I could have used a polarizing filter on my camera, as some of the work was impossible to photograph well without one."

We had a wonderful guide who had a vast knowledge of the places she took us but as we had a big itinerary things were a little rushed. Mush was made of the Amber room, the cost and no photographs allowed. It was not explained why and most of our group would have liked to have a photo to show friends and family something they will probably never see."

It is huge and each chamber is filled with not only art, but sculptures. Definitely need a guide of some sort to decipher what you are looking at. An audio guide is good but a knowledgeable tour guide is the best. Unfortunately, we had limited time to spend at this museum so we basically rushed through each room and could not spend as much time as we wanted, and the line going into the museum was outrageously long even though each ticket had an assigned time to it. I understand that you could enter later than your assigned time but not before. Although the line going in was somewhat orderly, we still had tour groups who was running late and tried to cut the line to gain admittance so there were some chaos. But once inside, you'll appreciate that the wait was well worth it."

An entire room is dedicated to Rembrandt. You would need an entire week to explore every room. A tour with a guide is highly recommended to make sure you see the highlights.

The Winter Palace is a beautiful work of art in itself, creating the perfect setting to house such a wonderfully eclectic array of extraordinary treasures and artworks that make up the Hermitage Museum. Of course this is only one of the many buildings to house the Hermitage collection. We visited the Hermitage on two separate occasions, first with the aid of a private guide and then by ourselves. Due to the sheer size of the collection it is a good idea to either visit with a guide or do some research into areas of personal interest so you don\u2019t miss personal favourites.For our first visit we chose to include it with our private tour through Dancing Bear Tours. We spent about three hours with our guide going through level one of the Winter Palace. We covered a lot of ground and, although like any such tour, we moved at a quick pace, it was a great way to get an overview and see a good cross section of rooms and exhibits. We saw the beautiful gold, blue, malachite and throne rooms and enjoyed temporary exhibitions including the mechanical curiosities. As well as visiting a broad range of rooms and artworks, it was a great way to familiarise ourselves with the museum and ask questions about how to plan future self guided visits.On our second visit we went through by ourselves. From our guided tour, and a bit of research, we knew where to get our tickets and what areas we wanted to focus on. We arrived at 12:30 and were thrilled to get tickets for an English guided tour of the Diamond Room in the Treasure Gallery. Within the Treasure Gallery there are the Diamond and Gold Rooms. Entry into these costs an additional 300 rubles per room and you can only enter through a guided tour, these tours are limited and popular. We spent an hour with our knowledgeable and friendly guide Anastasia and saw some wonderful treasures. Starting from the middle ages there was a lot of jewellery and religious gold pieces, moving through the ages into spectacular watches, snuff boxes, necklaces, rings and broaches. There are two magnificent sets of ceremonial horse attire, received as diplomatic gifts from the Ottoman empire, with one horse blanket containing a whopping 30,000 diamonds. There are 20th century masterpieces by Cartier, Faberge and Tiffany. Definitely worth the small extra amount for a visit. There is no photography allowed in this room.Definitely worth at least one visit and if time permits more. A guide is a great idea if you want a broad overview and help navigating through the vast site on a limited timeframe. There are maps available onsite and it is also easy to self navigate through the museum. Photography is allowed without flash, except for temporary exhibitions and certain rooms which signage will explain. Also no water allowed inside galleries. Large bags need to be left in the cloakrooms. A wonderful site to visit."

There were so many awe inspiring and extravagant rooms, and that was a plus for me (I enjoy the architecture more so than artwork). There was representative content from many cultures around the world, so expect variety. Some of the statues and carvings were so intricate, they were very neat to see.I'm in my early 30s, and am not an \"art person\" by any stretch, but I found this museum fascinating.

As you enter and walk through this marvellous building you can almost envision the aristocracy of a bygone era moving through the rooms with their beautiful period clothing. The jewels on the crowns, the precious stones on snuff boxes belonging to Catherine the Great, the intricate hair combs made of gold and the wonderful tapestries that covered huge walls were mind blowing."

There is so much to see once you are inside (more than can be done comfortably in one day) that you don't want to waste time in queues.Secondly, if you take one of the tours (we took an English one), you can find out quite a bit about the history of the buildings and it can also serve as an orientation tour in advance of your own exploration afterwards. Admittedly, these tours are variable in standard. Ours was one hour long and a bit dry, but we know people who went on one a couple of months ago and they said theirs (for the same money) was two hours long and that the guide was really interesting.Thirdly, do save time at the end of the day to visit the Winter Palace of Peter the Great, which is only a short walk away from the Hermitage and main Winter Palace. A visit to this is included in the general ticket price. There weren't many people there when we went but it was well worth the visit. It is such a contrast to the opulence of the other buildings and provides you with a good insight into the Tsar himself - whose very life-like model will stare you straight in the face!"

The only observation I could indicate is the deficient illumination of most of the paints that results in light reflection over their surface. This review is directed to the free entrance to the museum. I had the oportunity to visit the Hermitage the first week of April 2016 and decided to take advantage the free entrance. We arrived at 9:30 am and stayed on a line of about 50 people outside the palace. This queue grew fastly to about 300 people when the doors were opened to access the couryard at 10 am. Another queue was formed at both entrances of the museum and when admission was granted at 10:30 am,in groups of 20-30 people. The queues in the courtyard reached the entrance to the palace about 1000 people. The entrance was free but a ticket had to be adquired at the box office to actually enter the museum. This process worked pretty fast. It took for us only about 15 minutes to enter the museum after it was opened. We assume that if we would have arrived not at 9:30 am but much later probably the queue would be for at least 1-2 hours to enter the museum. Note that if you had already bought tickets before in internet or buy tickets in the automatic machines in the courtyard (entering at right), you could pass directly in the entrance control. My conclusion about free tickets is that it worked for us arriving one hour before admission in April that is not the top season. I suppose that in Summer this would not be practical and would be better to pay the entrance or even go other day when the museum would not be so crowded due to the free entrance. Practically all tourists entering the museum were russians with a few foreign visitors. When we walked outt the museum at about 3 pm the queue exended outside the palace enrance into the palace square."

Cost about 600 rubles to get in I think. We literally walked through the rooms at random- and each room was great. The highlight was certainly the Golden chapel. It was sunny at the time and the beauty of the room was quite breathtaking. One top tip - If you do leave the museum through the exit sign - they wont let you back in!! At the end of our visit we decided to visit the souvenir shop - we misunderstood the route and went past the exit sign. No re-entry I am afraid. The customer services desk was quite clear about this!"

Definitely recommended.There's a cloakroom which you can leave your bags and coat in although it did say to leave bigger bags - i didn't and no one told me otherwise as I only heard the announcement on the way out but can only think this was because the place wasnt overrun with tourists."

But of course there's lots more to see so a day is the max that most tourists can devote to the museum. The Winter Palace is gorgeous as a structure and the exhibits are beautiful too. Though there's only so much the human brain can assimilate! :) There is a small cafe in the main building with excellent desserts (try the carrot cake!). Peter the Great's original residence which is right next door is also very fascinating and I would recommend visiting that as well. We took a guided tour and got to see all the highlights because the thought of navigating those hallways on our own was a little overwhelming! But in retrospect, we could've managed on our own with an audio guide and there's enough information at each exhibit in English to give you the information you need. I would imagine roaming the museum, with some lovely classical music playing on your iPod would be a great way to take in all the beauty."

Yes, the interior was majestic, but other than that, most exhibits were quite average in our humble opinion. We might not know every single artist there is for sure, but for such a renowned museum, we were a bit more demanding. Interesting visit nonetheless, we would not recommend spending hours and hours there though. Beware: in case you want to buy something from the souvenir shop, make sure you take some money with you before leaving everything in the cloakroom!

My recommendation is that you read about the museum beforehand, and pick the rooms that most call your attention. Otherwise you get crazy trying to figure out at the last minute what you want to see.

            "review": "deservedly popular, world class collections. The former Tsars' Winter Palace, now the Hermitage museum/gallery, is justifiably renowned as one of the world's most important and extensive collections of art works and a highlight of any visit to St Petersburg. It is also probably the most attractive setting for a gallery in the world, and you can view some of the imperial state rooms in addition to the impressive rooms in which the collections are housed.Whatever your preferences in terms of period, genre or artist, there will be something here you will love. There is too much to take in in one visit, and you shouldn't try. Our guide expertly shepherded us round the most important features of the collection and then left us to our own devices. Most of us were keen to view the Picasso, Matisse and Impressionist collections, which are now - wisely, in my view - housed in a new building just across the square, in attempt to disperse the crowds somewhat. Two things to note about this - there is a separate charge for this in addition to the main collections, although not excessively expensive (a few hundred roubles, if memory serves). Also, it was surprisingly difficult to find the collections in the new building, even being able to read the Russian and having asked several members of staff. No doubt this will improve/have improved once the annexe is fully up and running!The only other reservation, if you are visiting in the summer months, is that it gets very busy, especially on Wednesdays, when many of the city's other attractions are closed. I first visited Russia in December 1992, on a school exchange shortly after the fall of Communism and, in the winter at that time, we had this place virtually to ourselves, an experience I imagine will be impossible to replicate these days! But of course, it's good that this world-class attraction is now accessible to so many more people."

For the most part, you can take photos, but there are old ladies in all the rooms and some of them will nag you out if you try to take a photo (apparently their rules on photos are arbitrary). You can rent an audio guide (basically like a phone device that explains the various rooms) for 500 rubles (roughly $8 US as of 4/13/2016). If you like art, you will really enjoy this place.

I have to emphasize that I entered at 4PM in late March, on a Wednesday (when the museum opens till 9PM). There was just a very short line (like 4-5 groups). While having a reserved ticket, it took me a bit of time to change my printed ticket to a \"normal\" ticket from the booth. So my suggestion is, to visit the museum on Wednesday without a reserved ticket if you are visiting off-season. The museum got emptied after 7PM and I was often the only one in a particular room, which I enjoyed a lot.Most visitors focused on the European arts on the second floor, but I found the collection of Siberian and Central Asian culture on the first floor very interesting too! Don't miss them as there are not many places you can see collections from these areas on earth."

Inside they have rebuild, extended and rebooters four floors of museum space. It has also nice facilities after the security check at outdoor including cafe/restaurat and giftshops. The extension was opened in 2015 and it is still (April 2016) work in progress.The main permanent exhibition is international art from 1800 - ca 1950: Picasso, Matisse, van Gogh, even the unique black icon by Malejevits is there. You can see how modern art was invited! You find the exhibition from 3rd and 4th floor! The is guidance, but the first and second floor are mainly empty with termorary exhibitions. You can find one eastern egg and other fabulous works of Faberge from there. Anyhow, take your time - walk the corridors, it is great.Take time at least 2 - 3 hours.

The tables (often semi-precious stone) and statues were, I felt, more beautiful and interesting.

The machine is easy to use - takes cash and card in all languages. You have to park your backpack etc.in the cloakroom before you can proceed. It's hot and crowded even on a good day. So pace yourself. Check to see if its closed before you visit as they close one day a week. The art is magnificent and is the building as you would expect. Regal and awe inspiring. It can all be a bit overwhelming so you might do as we did and decide in advance what you wanted to see. Even on a highlights tour it took us half a day to get around. In one of the rooms a russian school choir was singing - brilliant acoustics.. It is surprising to see such important works of art up so close and accessible unlike other european art galleries. Wonderful experience. 10/10"

But if you manage to get there at open, you will be alone at all halls - trust me, its a cool experience. 3. If you doing this after lunch, start at the new wing (separate entrance, your ticket works there, its called Gen Shtab). Brand new, tons of natural light. Also thats where they moved all their best works of Impressionists (80% of people goto museums to see these anyway, right)? They are all on top floor 4. Gen Shtab also has cool book store on ground floor. Because of RUB devaluation, they sell Taschen books for half of what you would pay in London."

Everyone was confused. And once you make it through the door, then there are two or three more lines before you actually get into the museum itself -- a line to show your ticket receipt and get your ticket, a line to check your coat/bag/water (no water allowed), & a line to go through the security checkpoint. And it seemed as if it were the first day with a new system, as most people working seemed as confused as the guests - & to think they go through that every day...(!)

This museums is the best in understanding and appreciating Russian history, culture and the old imperial family. The place is laden with jaw dropping architecture as well as good artifacts. I enjoyed visiting the winter palace and looking into the rooms with all their rooms and furnishings as well as paintings. The place is dripping with imperial Russian history and a little of Russian revolution history. I would suggest visiting the central Asian, exhibits and artifacts as well as the Siberian areas which are not so well visited sincerely are on the ground floor. Personally, theses are probably the only artifacts you will find from that region that is well preserved . I wouldn't visit the Western European exhibits since you see similar stuff in the Lourve, Vatican Museums, Metropolitan museum of Art etc... Which tends to be more comprehensive since they came from there. Try to snag the visit to the gold or diamond room to get a personal guided tour by the museum curator to those rooms. I managed the gold room tour at around 1300hrs but not the diamond room tour which was at 1345hrs. You need to book it at the main ticket office in the main building and be the first 15 pax (English speaking) for that day. It cost 300Rubles so quite worth it. You will need to buy the main ticket first from any if the ticket office outside or the automated machine before you can purchase this special tour ticket though. The tour is 1.5 hours long. In the gold room, you see Central Asian, Old Roman and Greek gold artefacts around the Volga and Caspian Sea region as well as middle eastern and Chinese artefacts. Worth spending 4 hours in the palace with gold or diamond tour."

The Jordan Staircase and the Malachite Room are my faves. But the museum is also full of incredible art, artifacts and sculptures! You can easily spend a whole day here. Just be careful; your ticket only allows you to enter the museum once and the guards are very strict on that. Unfortunately the lockers, while being within the building, are outside of the museum entrance, so be careful."

I highly recommend s your of the room of treasures. If you're pressed for time do the room of treasures instead of the gold room which covers a lot of detailed history about the pieces. The ticket line is usually very long and small groups are let in at a time so if you're traveling in winter bring a warm coat! There are student discounts but you must have a student id,international ids are fine.After buying a ticket,you will need to check your coast then pass security and scan your ticket. The museum had 3 floors and most of the collection is stored on the second floor. We did a quick loop around the first and third floor then spent the remaining time on the second floor. You can find a golden peacock clock on the 2nd floor that animates and clucks on the hour. It was closed when we visited so be sure to ask before seeking it out."

However due to the sheer volume of stuff in the museum it can be a little bit overwhelming. If you don't have much time I would recommend the little Hermitage which has an amazing collection of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings. To really appreciate the Hermitage you need at least 2 hours but a morning till lunch would be ideal."

We were fortunate to have a private tour with a local guide who was extremely knowledgable of the art and able to guide us around the buildings so that we were able to find the thing we were most interested in. We only had a singe day to explore here but if given a chance would certainly go back to see more. The wonderful Winter Palace, the building that forms a portion of the museum is worth a visit by itself, once home to Russian Emperors.

It was noted on one site that to see all of the rooms would mean walking approx 6 miles! We were more interested in the key rooms rather than the exhibitions and still spent most of the day wandering around. A few tips:- It was closed on a Monday, go early as it got busy even in low season with groups and school trips, use the kiosks in the courtyard to buy general admission tickets to avoid queues, if you want to see the gold or diamond rooms you will need to do a tour and buy tickets from the desks inside, use the free cloakroom for coats and bags - it's too hot and too far to walk to carry them, if not doing a tour or using an audio tour grab a map and mark off the rooms as you go - we managed not to get lost by doing this, the room numbers are above the doors, if you want to see the key rooms ask the audio stands for their route map - it shows the rooms you don't want to miss, if you want to see the exhibitions plan before you go - there's lots to see and you probably won't be able to do it all. Really pleased we went. It was stunning."

I was there in March which I do not think is a particularly busy time. But here's a tip to save you queuing and wasting time:- Buy your entrance ticket from the machines in the courtyard. (Don't buy from ticket office inside which is where lots of people queue because they haven't bought from the machines.)- Then enter the museum... There might be a crush of people when you first enter. But they are queuing to buy tickets. Politely push through them explaining if anyone harumphs that you've got tickets already. You'll pop out into a virtually empty lobby area where you can go straight to cloak room, toilets or the actual museum entrance turnstiles. So buy tickets from the machines outside and don't fall into the trap of queuing with the crush of people inside. Just keep pushing through. And then you'll be in one of the most wonderful museums ever. This tip worked in March. I can't vouch for it in the busier summer months."

We visited 8 different palaces in the St. Petersburg area\u2026 all so rich in history. I found they individually told their own stories of their respective pasts. I did not however, find this to be true of the Winter Palace. In my opinion the Winter Palace seemed a bit sterilized from its unique history. While opulent and beautiful, with the exception of the library, it seemed to me lacking in the presence of those who had once lived there. Also, beware of taxi cabs waiting outside. It cost us more to take one of these cabs less than a mile to our hotel, than it cost us to take a private car in from the airport. The meters are jacked to exorbitant prices."

The Palace Square however was incredible. A place of such history and splendor with the Winter Palace and General Staff Building on either side. We were there early in the morning and it was almost empty which was very special. The Hermitage, bizarrely, is focused on the art work held by the museum, rather than the lavish and fascinating history of Russia and the building itself. We found this rather disappointing. The state rooms themselves have not been preserved or set up to represent the actual state rooms of the Romanov Family, but rather as example rooms of popular decor and furniture of the time. If your passion is art - then go for it! This has one of the largest collections in the world and I'm sure you will be blown away.If your passion is history - still go for it! But read up before hand on the building and the rooms. The information in the building is very scarce on this. And we didn't fully appreciate what we were seeing because so much is focused on the art work. We were there in the low season so were lucky enough that the building itself was not busy and we pretty much had the place to ourselves - a rare treat I think. The best parts for us were the grand staircase upon entering, which really is beautiful. And the Grand Church of the Winter Palace was also absolutely incredible.As I said at the beginning, you cannot go to St Petersburg and not going to the Hermitage. I'm very glad we did it, but we were hoping for more history than art history."

You must also visit the Impressionist section which has been located in the Guards rooms in the curved building opposite the main palace. Fantastic!!

Trip Advisor commissioned someone to advise on sights in St Petersburg and he allocated 4 hours for this museum, gallery, fantasy. Nonsense. We spent a full day and only saw one level of it. The main building has 3 levels and there is a separate building with Impressionist art we didn't have a hope of getting to.The museum has apparently something like 3 million art pieces, not all on display, but it feels like they might be.. Apart from that the building itself, structurally and in fitout, is a major artwork. To say that it is grand is inadequate; indeed, words cannot describe. I have been to many of the major art galleries in the world and they are eclipsed, not necessarily in the volume and quality of the art, but by the enormous, outstanding, extraordinary and amazing gallery. What is also terrible is that this total tsarist indulgence was built by virtual slave labour suffering the cruellest and harshest conditions.There are over 400 rooms in this palace converted to this gallery. Each room is different in decor with splendid vaulted ceilings, ornate columns, massive inlaid doors, worked double windows, decorated walls and timber pattern floors the like of which cannot be found in any other palace anywhere. We were told that the floor in one medium to large room (about 25 metres by 15 metres) took artisans 5 years to make. The room contains 2 malachite urns which took 10 years to craft. The splendid throne room is about metres 50X25x15high and, of course, exceeds the other excesses. And the art! There are rooms full of Rembrandts, Van Dyks, Rubens and more much much more. Works of every major classical artist is here in superabundance.

So clearly you will not see everything in one go.My recommendation, and what we have done every time we have visited, is to get a guide. They have guides in the museum or you can find private certified guides that you can hire for yourself. In any case, in my opinion it really is not worth getting an audioguide and simply wandering around. You will likely miss the most interesting items in the collection this way."

We saw so many Old Masters and were surprised to be standing next to a Rembrandt, a Matisse or a Van Gogh which had no visible protection from the people walking passed.

The collections are impeccable, the interior designs and decorations are elegant. I could not remember each rooms, some of them were spacious dance and music halls, with St.George's Hall striking for its red center and parqueet floor. The room of ancient Egypt gave me creeps (since I read they put real mummy there...), the jordan staircase, the war gallery, the skylight rooms..you name it, every room, every hall, every hallway...this palace is a masterpiece.

We went in with it in mind to go all the way around, after we had a guided tour of the gold room. Our guide was the sweetest lady whose speciality was in fact Spanish art, however, her grasp of the English language and depth of her knowledge with regard to the contents of the room was impressive, to say the least.There is so much in the Hermitage to view that like with all museums, you reach your saturation limit, at which point we called it a day... Given the size of the building, we believe there was much more!!"

Yes, you read me right. Three million!While of course you can just wander in on your own and start being impressed, you'll have a tendency to just be amazed - while missing the intricacies/unique qualities/best bits. You must get some kind of tour happening - which is available in every budget size. I went massive with a private tour by Irina from Marina Tours - expensive and worth every ruble! We did three hours in the main buildings with a private one hour tour of the Golden Treasury. Show stopping and an unforgettable experience. But if the Hermitage isn't on your bucket list and you're in the market for something less pricey, an audio tour in most of the languages of earth is actually all you really need.I must say though, put aside some coin for the treasury rooms. Because who could miss an opportunity to see gold jewellery from 4000BC and a saddle quilt with 18,000 diamonds?"

Reserve plenty of time and visit even few days in a row. Some exhibitions were moved in another building, as maintenance works were carried out. Also, some sections were closed. This happens at each big museum, though.The most troubling is their printed guide. Not only the museum has double corridors (in parallel) and you need to see where you are, but also the room numbers and their corresponding rooms do not match those from the printed map. You follow a corridor and see on the map that it should come a certain room. When you get there, you are in a slightly different point. A bit disconcerting, but manageable."

We were on a tour and were told to look at some art but looking at the ceilings or walls were just more interesting sometimes. Got to see the Throne room, Church, Apartments and Ball room, Grand staircase as well as so much art. The painting of all the Tsars and Tsarinas were very interesting and unique but my favourite thing was the Peacock clock - this caused me to get separated from my group though and i spent the next 30mins slightly lost. Because of its size, and that its made up of many buildings its not a place you want to get lost in - wearing in and out of buildings and up and down levels is very confusing - however i did get to see some interesting things that others might not have :)Amazing place - definately recommend"

Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Picasso, Matisse, Michelangelo, Da Vinci and so, so much more to view here. You can get pretty close and see the masterstrokes of each of the artists. Having grown up hearing about some of these and seeing them in pictures, my experience was totally surreal. Swarms of people gather around certain paintings and pieces whilst there tour-guide recites the story behind each piece, however, you may listen in and exhibit a little patience in order to get up close and personal when its your turn. Most of the pieces are from individuals' private collections, and if you try to touch something or get too close you'll be escorted out. Oh and, they say that if you spend a minute looking at each piece at the Hermitage, it would take you 11 years to completely view the gallery :) . Take your time, pick your artists / pieces, and head on over for some feel-good viewing."

When visiting St Petersburg the Hermitage is one of the worlds greatest collections if not the greatest ,where else are they 49 Rembrabts and Rubens all in one place!!This is not to mention the extreme conservation work that has been completed on the State Rooms of the winter Palace I would hate to even think of the money spent on the restoration of this unique world treasure .THANK YOU Russia for the foresight and care that has been taken on these monuments.To give this collection a fair coverage you would need many days HOWEVER even a short visit is an eye opener into another worldThe visitor number are however huge therefore you may well want to consider booking ahead to avoid the queues ,take on a half day guide to allow you to see that parts of the collection that attract you ,pay extra for the limited time slots available before or after closing times and limit yourself to see a few parts of the collection and rooms rather than try to run yourself silly and cover it all.This is just not possible on a single visit.HOWEVER this place is a must for any world traveler regardless of there interests."

Make sure you leave 1 day for it - unless you really have zero interest/appreciation in art.... Bought my ticket online I still had to queue in the ticket office to collect me ticket!! (maybe because it's winter/low season so they closed the ticket collection machine..). But I found it's cheaper to buy there! Cheapest ticket is \u00a36 but I bought it for \u00a312 online (the cheapest option) - it might be that the \u00a312 offers more buildings/wings of the museum to visit - but I can't even finish one building within 5 hours, not to mention having time to visit the rest.... No idea about how long the queue is in summer - probably that's when you really need to buy online and pay premium if needed!"

The Hermitage Museum complex consists of six historic buildings (one of which was the former residence of Russian Tsars) today make up the Hermitage Museum, housing one of the finest art collections in the world. Allegedly, Catherine the Great bankrupted Russia in the process of building this incredible museum, which collections containing over 3million items include many works of the great masters such as Rembrandt, Rueben's and Van Dyk, plus many, many others.  The Hermitage is as huge as it is amazing.You\u2019d struggle to visit even the most important sections in one day. If you go independently, you must choose what to see before starting your tour but it will be unlikely for you to enjoy the Treasuries. Artwork aside, the interiors are breathtaking and you can get up close to both furniture and paintings & get a real sense of how the Romanovs lived. Must sees include the Gold room, the crimson boudoir, the church, the Jordan staircase & peacock clock. The signage isn't great & it's huge so do your research in advance, or you\u2019ll spend a lot of time retracing your steps. Make sure you don\u2019t miss the Raphael Loggias, designed to mimic the Gallery n the Papal Palace in Vatican City. It\u2019s s fantastic tunnel like hallway, with concentric arches the whole length, making for a great photo opportunity. Take some shots of the full gallery, but also zoom into sub-elements to focus the eye.           The experience is just as much about the building, not just the stuff on the walls. All you need to do is walk from room to room and try not to let your jaw drag on the floor. As a drop dead imperial statement these buildings are without equal. Wander and look up, look down, look out the windows at the river or out across Palace Square and let yourself be impressed. Then get a coffee and something to eat and go to the building on the other side of the Palace Square, The Building of the General Staff. It was the Foreign Office of the Tsars and recently had an internal refit. It houses the 19th and 20th century French collections and is one of the greatest art experiences it's possible to have. Forget the museums in Paris, these galleries are the greatest visual art experiences you'll ever have.  Tickets for the complex are very limited and you must arrive at dawn to secure your entry. Some hotels also sell tickets, so if you have that option then it\u2019s worth considering, as you\u2019ll bypass the queues. If you have connections, or your guide is approved, you maybe able to get in on a Monday, when it's closed for the public. On any other day, or unless you go in Winter, the museum will be very crowded - don\u2019t expect to be able to be left in peace to ponder over individual items as you\u2019ll likely be shunted along. The Museum is free of charge the first Thursday of every month. To get the most from this place, a Guide would be helpful. They\u2019d be able to explain the history and significance of key items and rooms, ensure you don\u2019t miss any critical pieces, and provide insight into the life of the Royal Family .. however, from a photographers pov, that may be not a good option. Guide\u2019s are generally not happy to sit around while the guy with the DSLR stops to take photo\u2019s through a random window of the view down below the street, or fiddles with their camera settings for 15mins while taking experimental shots of the ceiling.  Photography is permitted, but strict rules on camera equipment and bags\u2026 you\u2019re not allowed any bags or tripods..Also, you will not be allowed to go back to your bag unless you have a multi-entry ticket so you\u2019ll need to be some creativity If you need more than 1 lens (e.g. zoom and wide angle) then you'll\u2019 need to be able to put one in a coat pocket or very small handbag. You\u2019ll not be allowed to use a flash anyway, so you\u2019ll need to to be running at high ISO\u2019s unless you can leverage natural light coming in through the large windows, but that\u2019s only good for a few of the rooms. You will not be allowed to take photo\u2019s in the Gold and Diamond Rooms.I always believe that first impressions last. So if you want a an impressions you won\u2019t forget, I recommend approaching via the small side street 'ulica Bolshaya Morskaya\u2019 which will lead you North and under the Archway of the 'Building of the General Staff. This will open up into the vast Palace square revealing the museum entrance directly opposite you, and beautiful in each direction.  To the North is the triumphal central column and the aqua coloured museum, west is towering domed roof of St Isaacs, behind you will be the gentle neo-classical curve of the General Staff Building. The square is a fascinating place, try and spend some time there spread out over the day. You will find yourself transported into a Romanov period setting, with player's dressed in Romanov costumes trying to get tourists to take their photo\u2019s for a fee, traditional horse carriages, and if you are really lucky you may even find a film crew making a period drama, complete with extra\u2019s. In the evenings, the square transforms into a concert arena, with impromptu bands blaring out various genres of music and the youth of city dancing."

I bought a 2 day ticket only which allowed to skip the queue but it wasn't that busy as I visited in Dec so the crowds had subsided. Make sure you put your bags at the free coat checks and take all you need with you because unless you have a multi entry ticket you won't be able to go back out to get stuff from your bag. It's also easy to get lost so grab a map of the winter museum and if you want to see the French impressionists, walk across palace square to the General Staff building on the 3rd floor to see them. The museum is closed on Mondays but open late until 9pm on Wed & Fri nights so make the most of the open times. Plus the first Thursday of each month is free for everyone!"

We were in awe. Some dating back to 3c bc. We visited the winter palace. A little odd. You have to go out of the hermatige walk along the canal and enter from the embankment side. It's not well signed for non Russians. We were told to take a large card guide, without which we wouldn't have understood anything we were seeing. Perhaps the most bizarre thing is the wax man. A life size copy of Peter the great created from casts 3 days after he died. It even has his real hair which was cut and used. It was then back up the canal and across the square to the gallery. We didn't really know what this was but being as it was included in our ticket we gave it a try. We were fortunate to see a steve mccurry photographic exhibition which was outstanding and lots of other artifacts. We didn't see everything as there is far to much to see in a day.

Founded in 1764 by Catherine the Great one of the oldest and most important museums in the world with a collection of 3 million items, the largest in the world. 6 buildings form the Museum, accessible from the courtyard, in front of the Winter Palace, a building with 1,786 doors, 1,945 windows, 1,500 rooms & 117 staircases!!! Hermitage is huge.You can't visit even the most important sections in one day. If you go independently, you must choose what to see before starting your tour but it will be unlikely for you to enjoy the Treasuries. Tickets are very limited and you must arrive at dawn to secure your entry. I had the luck to visit the Museum on Monday, when it's closed for the public and that's why I enjoyed the collections with nobody around. Although we were a group with a guide, we had to be separated in the Gold Room, in smaller groups with extra guides. But it was worth it, even for the small gold jewel created by a Greek artist. Unique in the whole world, no one can guess how it was achieved. The gold is so fine, it's like a hair. You can't believe it's real. The Museum is free of charge the first Thursday of every month. Photos are allowed but not in the Gold and Diamond Room."

This is a personal view of the Hermitage, everyone has one, this is mine.The Winter Palace and Hermitage are enormous, we clocked up just under 5 kms walking. The whole place makes you wonder just how many paintings there are in the world. It's very easy to get tired very quickly. And really, it's the triumph of quantity over quality. There are a few nice Leonardo's and a Caravaggio was on display, but part from these, the actual collection didn't do that much for me.The experience is about the building, not the stuff on the walls. All you need to do is walk from room to room and try not to let your jaw drag on the floor. As a drop dead imperial statement these buildings are without equal. Get there early and just wander and look up, look down, look out the windows at the river or out across Palace Square and let yourself be impressed. Then get a coffee and something to eat and go to the building on the other side of the Palace Square, The Building of the General Staff. It was the Foreign Office of the Tsars and has just had a smart internal refit. It houses the 19th and 20th century French collections and is one of the greatest art experiences it's possible to have. Forget the museums in Paris, these galleries are the greatest visual art experiences you'll ever have. To stand in the same room as Matisse's overwhelming Dance and Music canvases will always be a high point in anyone's life. When there's so much fear and loathing all around, a visit to the General Staff reminds you of what human beings are also capable of. It's uplifting, inspiring and a great remedy for the world's ugliness and stupidity."

Thirdly, make sure you allow plenty of time and eat before you come. There is a cafe, but I would suggest going on a full stomach so you are not forced to rush. Lastly, there are plenty of clean restrooms so no need to worry about that! I was pregnant and was thankful for this last one :)Pictures do not do this justice because the size of everything is so large and dimensional.

Unfortunately I went on a group tour and we only spent less than 2 hours here - so it was a whirlwind tour. If you love architecture, culture and arts you will need to spare at least 3 - 4 hours here to visit all the sections and get up close to works by Da Vinci, Van Gogh, Raphael and many other great European artists.Travel light as you will need to leave big bag at the clock room. Again be prepared for a lot of walking as there's a lot to see. As any where in Russia toilets are limited here and there's always a long line."

Much like the Metropolitan in New York, or the Louvre in Paris, you would need to dedicate at least a week to have any hope of seeing a high percentage of the masterpieces contained there. This museum, which includes the Tsar's Winter Palace, is unbelievable! Much of the art is religious in nature. It is fascinating to see how the last Tsar and his family actually lived, and the palace quarters have been lovingly preserved, and in some cases, restored. You will need to climb stairs, and it requires a good deal of walking. However, there were benches and chairs here and there along the way for taking brief respites. I would recommend this tour to anyone who wants to get a look at Russian royal life in the early 20th century."

Along with the shear size and endless exhibit halls are the other countless tours that are trying to cram themselves into these tight areas. If possible, allow two days to see the Hermitage. If more time cannot be given, then pre-plan. Also note that the Hermitage does not have air conditioning, so if planning a visiting during the summer, make it an early summer visit.

            "review": "Incredible Art Museum and PICKPOCKET ALERT!!!!. The Hermitage is unquestionably one of the world's finest art museums, not just for its collection (largest collection of paintings in the world) but also for its palatial setting. Comprised of several buildings, the core is Catherine the Great's Winter Palace, built in the mid-late 1700's. If you're on a tour, this is where you will go.As a museum, the Hermitage has been open since the mid-1850's. It would take you days to see all there is to see here, though most likely you'll be going through in a tour group that will limit your time to a little under three hours. That was the case with our \"Highlights of the Hermitage\" tour. Leaves a lot unseen, but a good experience.While this review could go on and on about the art, you'll see plenty on your own. The only disappointment was not seeing some of the Impressionist works, as that area or building was closed the day we were there. It may be that there's a renovation going on that will keep that area closed for a while. Check with your tour guide.Now -- PICKPOCKET ALERT!!!! Seriously, I saw this in action. Entering the Winter Palace, we were directed up a flight of stairs, at the top of which are a few ATM's. This pickpocket alert is specific to that area. As we were later leaving the museum, several of our group withdrew cash from these ATM's in order to pay for the tour we were on. As I stood there, I noticed a blind man, alone, complete with sunglasses and white cane, standing nearby, facing in the direction of the ATM's. What's wrong with this picture? A blind person in an art museum? Sorry -- no Braille pictures here..... As I continued to observe, a small group of folks, not in our group, who had just withdrawn cash started down the stairs to exit the museum. The \"blind\" man turned and followed them, closely, down the stairs. However, they proceeded rapidly and he stopped after only a few steps down the stairs. In retrospect, I think this was because he didn't want to be seen going down stairs at a rapid rate, unlike what a real blind person would do. He came back up to the top of the stairs, turned again in the direction of the ATM's and stood there as members of our group withdrew cash. Finished, it was now time for our group to leave. When we were about 1/2 way down the stairs, I turned and looked back. The \"blind\" guy was at the top of the stairs, facing our direction, but not proceeding down the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs, a man was sitting on a bench, phone to his ear. That may have been an innocent conversation, but it struck me that his gaze was locked on the purses of the women in our group as we passed by. I sensed that the \"blind\" guy at the top was communicating with the man at the bottom, telling him which purses had just had cash put into them at the ATM's, OR, having already been alerted by the \"blind\" guy, the man at the bottom was in touch with others waiting in the crowd outside the nearby exit, identifying persons and purses to target where the opportunity to pickpocket a purse would have been best. I alerted the members of our group, and, thankfully, nothing more came of this. I'll never know if all this was just coincidence or not, but something just didn't seem right here. Blind guy? I don't think so..... I'm not a paranoid individual; I'd bet money I'm right on this. Bottom line, enjoy the Hermitage -- it truly is fabulous. Just be alrert in the area of the ATM's if you use one."

If you want to avoid getting lost keep reminding yourself to follow the map!It is worth pre-bookng a ticket voucher online - although I arrived at 10:15 I still had to queue for half an hour or so to pick up my tickets. But, walking past a huge line and then straight in made it worthwhile.Given the size of the place I can't neglect to mention the cafe. You will be in there all day and will need a stop. You are not permitted to take water into the museum with you - some people were having theirs taken off them, some were not (in the usual Russian way). I had seen the cafe described as 'dire' but was not prepared for what I found. Truly awful. Not only was the extremely limited food bad there was almost nowhere to sit. Hopefully they will see that needs some attention. Whatever you do, however you do it, make sure that you take this into account.You have to enter the Winter Palace by leaving the Hermitage and walking around the front on the embankment. Whilst the palace is amazing it is much smaller than I had anticipated (size isn't everything) and the few tours that were going around absolutely filled the small spaces making it impossible to see anything and read the information until they had moved on."

On the first day we were picked up on time and Olga guided us round the Hermitage, the Church of Spilled Blood, St Isaac's Cathedral, St Nicholas' Church and the Russian Art Museum. On the second day we went to Peterhof and Catherine's Palace by hydrofoil. Olga really impressed us with her knowledge and love of St Petersburg.We wanted an intensive 2-day program with a guide and driver, and Guide for You's planning and coordination meant we didn't waste a single minute. We stopped for coffee breaks en route in uncrowded places, and despite our busy program we never felt rushed.

We didn't find the direction signs all that helpful. Also we had hoped to track down the Gaugin but were a bit bewildered by the floor plan's descriptions of areas. Souvenir Shops seem to be dotted about all over and there doesn't seem to be any one bigger selling everything.

The Asian exhibit was good, as was the Egyptian one. The sculpture section was interesting, and the artwork of the rooms themselves (walls, ceilings, chandeliers) is beautiful. I found the Iranian exhibit to be very interesting. As soon as I walked in the room, and was like, \"Wow. This is a totally different style of art.\" From a historical and current events perspective, what a shame that religion continues to ruin incredible cultures all around the world. The art of Iran was very interesting. I am not really into paintings of the despicable people known as Kings and Queens, but there are a ton of pictures of them if seeing human beings that had many other human beings tortured and killed in the name of power is your thing. I spent the better part of 5 hours at the museum, but you could spend a few days if you wanted to. The exhibits are wonderful. I saw three different actual mummies, which I had not seen at any previous museums. It would be nice if they had better quality food/cafes inside. It is pretty subpar for refreshments... Also, the view outside the windows is beautiful, but they have these extra panes of glass which make it very difficult to see or get good pictures of the view outside. Anyways, if you are in St Petersburg, this is a must visit on the list of sites."

Download and app for explanations as there are limited details when inside. Even the free map is sparing with detail and each exhibit has only a name and artist (at least in English). The palace itself is amazing so some of the rooms are simply just to see the palace. The Caravaggio was missing when I was there which was disappointing as this was a highlight for me. It was apparently gone for restoration. 600RUB The line to get in to buy tickets vs those who have pre-purchased can be as long as each other so don't stress if you do not buy in advance. The line to buy tickets moved quickly. There is a restaurant/cafe inside if you are there all day and need food. If you are going there to see Faberge eggs then don't - they are now in the Faberge Museum at the other end of Nevskiy Ave. There is a Da Vinci, a Michelangelo sculpture and heaps of Rembradts & Rubens.

            "review": "Love It, Hate It Museum. Let me start by saying that this was the last major European art museum remaining on my bucket list. So I have a lot with which to make comparisons. Over a 3.5 day period I saw every room in this huge museum that was open to the public without a required tour (so I did not see the state treasures). On the Love It side the state rooms of the Hermitage are simply incredible and arguably the most beautiful rooms to hold art that I have seen. The European painting collection is superb. Other highlights for me were the Raphael Loggia, the Canova statues, and the French Impressionist/Post Impressionist art, the Peacock clock, and the Siberian art/art of ancient cultures of the steppe. The latter is amazing and something you will not see in other major European museums. Now for the Hate It part. The museum was very overcrowded with huge numbers of tour groups- much worse than any other European museum we have been to. The day before we went we found ourselves standing outside the Neva river facade waiting for a hydrofoil ride. Looking down the street there were tour buses in a long line as far as the eye could see (ala the warehouse scene at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark). My husband and I looked at each other with wide eyes realizing that all those people must be in the museum and they were! This was to the point where it interferes with individual museum goers viewing the art as these groups stand in mass in front of the best works of art and pose with the art for photos. My best tip to avoid the mob is to be sure to go on one of the days the museum stays open until 9pm. I did this and the tour groups disappear by 5/5:30 and then it is a normal museum experience. I retook all my photos at this time so there wouldn't be 100s of people in them and was able to stand in front of the Leonardo's and the Peacock clock by myself. Also, to avoid the crowds you should see the Siberian/steppe art and the Impressionist/Post-Impressionist art during the day as these areas are off the beaten track with no tour groups. Another issue for me is that although the exhibit rooms were gorgeous the lighting was often poor. The chandeliers and many windows reflected on the paintings obstructing the view and ruining one's photos. And, the state of some of the paintings was poor- obviously not cleaned in a long time- making them dark with muted colors. This I found quite surprising. The ticket system although new and computerized is a pain. You are allowed only one entry per day so you cannot go out for lunch and the dining options are very,very limited with few tables. Completely inadequate for such crowds!! Also, if you do go to the Siberian wing you cannot then get into the main part of the museum without a very long and convoluted walk upstairs and over the ticketing area. I recommend buying tickets in advance so you can walk in-- the lines are huge from the minute it opens in the morning. Be sure to download the Hermitage apps and maps in advance. There is a self guided tour of the state rooms and major works of art which is very helpful. And unless you have multiple days as I did you will carefully have to decide what to see as it cannot be done in one day."

Once the general admission time arrived it quickly filled up, we were glad of an early start to beat the rush. In the summer months it is evidently jam packed and uncomfortable, tours can be rushed as the stewards move people along.The first WOW was the winter palace, such opulence and so much gold - how the rich lived !!! We had time to absorb each room, words cannot adequately describe - YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF !!! Next came the art collection - once again mind blowing that they have so many paintings by famous artists on open display.

The colour of the buildings are just so right for the time period and size of the Palace. You just walk from room to room and can't believe what you are seeing. The best way to do this museum is with a guide or you could get lost or not really know what you are looking at. The tour guides are like little encyclopedia's they are so knowledgeable. When you get to the sculptures and painting they can tell you such detail about each one. You could spend days here depending on your interest in the arts. Ours was more about the architecture, the craftsmenship is so beautiful that it is sad that this art has been lost. You just can't believe from the floors, to the walls to the ceilings the time that has gone into building each room so beautifully. When you see anything gold it really was or is gold.

            "review": "Not on a tour!. I like to take my own time as a tourist, looking at what I am interested in and therefore don't generally join the big tours. In Russia this can make for some interesting situations. I did some research before going to the Hermitage and knew if I wanted to see the Diamonds and Gold I would have to sign up for specific times and pay extra. At the kiosk on the way in I did that, although it seemed to cause some irritation from the lady doing the tickets. I was assigned some times to go, something like 1:00pm for the Gold Room and 2:45pm for the Diamonds. Since it was only about 11:00 am I went up to the main floor and got an audio guide - it cost about 400 rubles and you put a deposit of 2000 down (or some kind of ID card) that you get back on the way out. The audio guide does not cover everything but works quite well. You need to make sure you do not get in synch with the big tour groups who are going through with a guide talking to them on earpieces. When the guide is talking about the Leonardo de Vinci you have 26 people moving as a swarm to envelop the topic of discussion. The items on display are quite impressive but not quite as much perhaps as the Armoury in Moscow. I ran out of time so I went down to catch my tour at 1:00pm. There was a sign that said wait here for tours of Treasure and something else. I showed the lady there my ticket for the English tour and she said wait here. At around 1:00pm someone arrived and said something in Russian and some people left. I figured for the English tour they would announce in English so I waited a bit longer. after 5 mins or somI asked the lady again. This time she told me for the Gold Room I needed to go out of the secure area and go in another entrance, and she pointed in the general direction. I went out but could only see the entrance back to where I had been. I waited a few minutes and got to a lady at the Information desk. she pointed me through the cloakroom. There was no sign anywhere that would indicate this was the way. At the security check at the back of the cloakroom they had been alerted I was coming because they pointed me down the hall and said go right. I went right and passed a lady at a desk but did not see any signs to Gold room or equivalent. As it turns out this lady at the desk was in front of the Gold Room but perhaps you don't advertise this. When I figured this out it was perhaps 20 min late for the tour. The security person said can you come back at 3:00pm for the next one. I said no I was booked on the Diamond tour then. He then let me in the door to the Gold Room and pointed out the group I should be with half way through. I was able to browse at my own speed and catch up with the group , so all was well.After this I headed back to the original entry for the next tour. Since I had gone out my ticket would no longer scan, so they had to open a special gate to let me back in. I guess this is the way it is supposed to work. I was a little early so I went looking for a cup of tea. I found the cafe. It had perhaps seating for about 15, but was not crowded. The Hermitage has a cloakroom signposted for 3700 people, but a cafe for 15,. If Disney were running the place it would be the other way round. However it worked I got a drink, and headed back for the English tour of the Diamond Room. At the appointed time a lady appeared and announced in English for the tour. We went on a long walk to the entrance of the diamond room. The lady said she had been at the museum for more than 50 years, so she definitely knew her stuff but speed was not one of her main attributes. The Diamond room starts with more Gold trinkets that have been excavated from ancient digs. Since I had just been to the Gold Room I was ready to move on. So I wandered ahead a little to look. The person minding the room was most upset at this and told me I should stay with my tour. Two other folk who had also done the Gold Room were also getting anxious. Eventually I decided to make an escape and left with only a quick look.I suppose the best strategy would be to a) Speak Russian, b) Get a private tour guide so you can go at your own pace but navigate the intricacies or c) Not worry about it. I am a c) person. It was a little frustrating but I saw a lot, probably missed a lot, had a good time so not to worry."

I visited Hermitage exposition in Winter Palace of Saint Petersburg in the beginning of May 2015 along with touristic group of \u201cEkletika\u201d agency. It was the final part of an excursion, so our tour guide left us on our own. It\u2019s up to you how long you want to stay in Hermitage. You can be there for hours and still not to see everything, thus it\u2019s better to go back to the hotel by metro or taxi, there is no touristic bus provided. The Winter Palace is absolutely magnificent! It had been re-built and altered almost continuously between late 1730s and 1837, when it was severely damaged by fire and immediately reconstructed. Winter Palace was an official residency of Russian emperors up to 1917. Currently, the restored palace is an architectural complex comprising several buildings and housing Hermitage Museum.My advice would be to come early and choose working days. There are literally crowds of people on Saturday and Sunday. We had to wait outside for almost 40 minutes in queue, and then we had been standing in queue again, but this time in the wardrobe. Visitors are not allowed to enter the museum in jackets or coats, bring food and big bags. You can make photos, but don\u2019t use the flash.If you are a big fan of Arts, this place is definitely a must visit! You'll have a great chance to see the biggest collections of Dutch, Flemish, Italian, French, German, British and Russian artists, enjoy the paintings of Paul Rubens, Diego Velasquez and Thomas Gainsborough, have a glance at vintage interiors and dinnerware of 17th and 18th century as well as appreciate the sarcophagus and hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt.Little tips:The museum is unbelievably big, so get a map; it\u2019s free of charge. Focus on several halls and artists you really want to see. If you don't speak Russian, choose special excursion for foreigners with a tour guide, who will be able to explain you interesting details about the works of arts and the museum itself.Plan to spend the whole day in the museum not to be in a hurry and wear comfortable shoes. You have an option of purchasing a two-day ticket to visit two days in a row.Once you are done with the museum, find a pier across the road, where you can buy a sea excursion to Peterhof Palace or a sightseeing tour across Saint Petersburg Channels and Fontanka River."

Agreed, you have less time there doing it this way but the trade-off is you don't have the crowds and with only 30 or so people touring through the many rooms you visit, you are able to get really close to study the artists' skills or stand back and view and photograph the works without anyone getting in your field of view - brilliant!! The security guards accompanying the group were excellent - no rush, no push - in fact, they moved signs and barriers for us to get a better or uncluttered viewpoint! Can't argue with that! And as for our guide, Olga, a Masters Art degree graduate from St Petersburg University - she was outstanding! She told us so many stories about the collection and the artists, she made the evening truly informative, rewarding and memorable.We visited, we saw and it was well worth the journey from Australia."

If fair to say, it's however almost too big. To really give justice to it, a serious amount of time should be dedicated to visiting the Hermitage - or it is likely to go over one's head.For me my personal favourite was the Golden Bird Clock - an incredible piece of craftsmanship and absolutely beautiful.

When we visited there were few signs how to get there. Cross the square to the staff building .... That is the one that is slightly curved with the arch and the horses on top.... Ok .... If you have your back to the hermitage walk across the square and go to the entrance to the left of the arch ... Not in the arch, off the square directly. Ok, now you're in the new building .... Cloak room is on the very bottom floor. Suggest you take lift to the top floor and work your wAy down each floor. No info desk or maps or much in the way of signage when we were there but really worth the effort. Lighting is much better than hermitage."

Hermitage is a vast museum, it poses huge challenges, both mental and physical endurance on any visitors.From my personal experiences (visited three times) once followed a cruise tour, and twice on my own, I found it is impossible to see its entirety at one go. Hermitage has a general staff building, across the plaza, as far as I know, new ticket has to be used. one can't use the same ticket after visited the main part. So it is important to do home work about its collections, obtain a museum map in advance and make a plan of visiting route to cover the art works one would like to see in advance. if one arrives during the warm months, expecting to see lots of tour groups and vast amount of visitors. The queue in front of ticket office will be long and a bit of crammed when approaching to the ticket office window. Online ticket bookings rend little advantages, one still need that confirmation to exchange to actual tickets to pass through the automatic ticket gates, there seemed no designated ticket windows for such exchange process, so with the online booking, one will still need to join the normal queue.so if one only has one day for the Hermitage, I will suggest visit the general staff building first, it has impressionism collection, and Picasso and Matisse. if you still have the energy left, and time permits, buy the ticket there for the older part of the museum."

So Inside this amazing Palace, thanks to Catherine the Great, you will find a treasure trove of paintings, sculptures, wonders of the World..the rooms / staircases alone are spectacular in their opulence and glory that was the typical of the Russian Czars- I don't even know how to put all this into words, but we, both my husband and I were completely blown away by the gorgeousness of this place..take your time, do not rush; it is yours to enjoy! Paintings by Rembrandt, many Italian, German, French, Dutch artists line the gorgeous walls of this palace..one room that is utterly fascinating to me is the chandelier room with the gold Peacock that moves! Fantastic wonderful gorgeous..outstanding- and well worth the effort to go; Bit of Advise, book tickets online! Just google The Hermitage, Before you go which I did; saves those line ups and time!

There is just so much to take in and so much to see. You could spend all day there and not see everything, but in reality your body and brain can only take about three hours, so you need to see the important things in that time. We went on a guided tour and were first group in the door when it opened, ( we got to see the grand staircase before it disappeared under people ) it quickly becomes very crowded, and hard to move around, the floors and ceilings are all very special and need to be looked at, which can be difficult. You can buy a recorded guide but really the only way to make sure you don't miss the most important items in the Hermitage it to go on a guided tour. As with most museums in Russia there is so much to see it can be a very trying experience. But certainly a \"not to be missed\" experience."

We saw an amazing number of paintings by European masters in our all too brief visit, and sculptures, great-rooms and ornate hallways; even the restroom doors are fancy in here!

Hermitage is HUGE, and when on a tour you can't choose the section you get to visit - so it's \"potluck\" on what items from their incredible collection you might be lucky to see. IF you can see anything over the thousands of people also touring. We were pushed through rooms in such big groups there was no room to lift your arms to take a photo -- & if you were near the (unnamed foreign country) tourists who never let anyone else close to a painting or an exhibit case, there was no polite way to maneuver. It was a nightmare. The traffic was supposed to flow in 1 direction, but that didn't stop some from reversing course & going back through doors which were jammed with others going the opposite way. We never saw a Faberge egg, never saw a Russian royal jewel, & only heard our guide say there was a Rembrandt somewhere in 1 of the rooms. If you have only one day in St Petersburg, I suggest you go to the separate building where they've moved all the Impressionist paintings --- unless you are guaranteed seeing a better portion of the Museum than we saw. The selection of which area of the Hermitage is open on a particular day can't be controlled by any tour company, & so the 1000's visiting on any day are at the whim of some Russian roulette player. Good luck - & be prepared to forcefully elbow your way to what you want to see."

Having travelled to St Petersburg from Moscow on the excellent connecting TVG style train we naturally had the State Hermitage museum down as a must see attraction when in the city. Obtaining the necessary entrance tickets was easy from our excellent hotel, which was the official hotel for the museum.However, when we eventually made our visit we were left with mixed feelings. On the plus side, the museum is housed in the most impressive buildings imaginable and face on to a magnificent square by the waterfront in the city. The unforgettable Baroque architecture of the Winter Palace and its unique green facade will linger long in our memories, but our experience inside was less impressive. Quite simply, there were too many people circumnavigating the museum at any one time, making the visit something of an ordeal, rather than the splendid experience it might have been. Certainly the art treasures on display were magnificent, particularly those of the Dutch masters, but then there are many other famous art galleries around the world which house an impressive collection of great masters. Those in Paris, Florence and New York to name just a few. The volume of people jostling for a viewpoint hindered our experience and I was left with the feeling that I had enjoyed strolling the streets of St Petersburg far more than I did competing for space inside this, one of the world's most famous collection of art treasures."

Could use some refining as in real life it feels a bit \"fake\", but it's great nevertheless. I was lucky to visit in October, and on a sunday at 11am the queue was almost non - existant. I had only one issue when trying to get my free student ticket: the student card of my university does not have any date on it to show the validity, so I had to go to the reception to get a \"pass\" with which to claim my free student ticket at the ticket booth. Still, all this was done in under 15 minutes.It was then time to leave my jacket at the cloakroom: a large bunker in the basement which had a rather unpleasant smell. I suspect that was due to the bathrooms being present in the same hall. The bathrooms were not the best ones in terms of cleanliness, but I attribute that to the hoards of tourists which seem to forget any form of manners once they step in a public WC.The art on display is so much you could fill a whole week if you wanted to carefully look at every painting, but it's not my thing, I was mainly interested in the interiors of the palace, which I was literally awed by. Some rooms were literally magnificent.However, navigating through the museum was a challenge in itself, as there are a thousand micro - rooms (sometimes numbered, sometimes not) and you have to keep track of it, or you get lost. Especially since the map they give you is not terribly clear.Major downside: the people. So many people everywhere. It was unbearable.Another downside: not enough toilets! I think I counted only 4 in the whole museum. And not enough places to sit down in some areas, which are a must in a museum this big.However, I have to say that all in all, the interiors made the visit worth it. If you're not interested in the interiors, go only if you're serious about art, otherwise you'll end up enjoying the first few rooms, but then skimming and running through the other ones, as I had to end up doing due to the massive size of the museum."

After depositing bags, coats and umbrellas, at the Cloakroom the great hall leads up a majestic stairway to the exhibitions collected in large halls and dedicated to a period or subject. The main treasures lie ahead including antiquities (Rome and Egyptian) , old masters paintings ( DaVinci, Titian, Raphael, Michelangelo, Rembrandt). as well as impressionists painting (Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh) It's very likely to get crowded in this area. We were in a guided group with an interpreter which helped us get around quickly and included a trip to the gold room, which was a highlight. I recommended it highly if you enjoy unique jewel artistry among these Romanoff treasures. Another interest is the mechanical peacock clock with a bee circling the clock section as the second hand, when it's working, in the Pavilion room. Recommendation: Use their website for individual tickets. Or join a group tour for quick access as the museum is crowded, or go at night on these tours. The Gold Room was accessed at a particular time arranged through the tour. The Docent speaks only Russian so a guide-interpreter was enjoyable And more highlights can be accessed in the limited time allotted. There is no way to see everything in several days there."

The problem is that due to policy of the management , there is no real limit to the amount of groups they let inside. As a result it is almost impossible to move arount and to take pictures. You must learn your way in advance in order not to get lost. the explanations are sometime is Russian only."

We were pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to move around and see the exhibits. We were told by our guide that it was because it was towards the end of season for large cruise ships. She said it was because the water was getting low and, for obvious reasons, ships cannot come in when it is winter. A tip is to come at a time when there are very few cruise ships. One can imagine how thousands of passengers arriving together must make the place very crowded. We stayed 5 nights in St Petersburg but feel we only scratched the surface. Apparently it would take three years to cover everything in The Hermitage even if one was to spend only about 3 seconds in front of each exhibit!"

If you have the means / opportunity plan to spend a few hours over several days here. You can not even begin to really appreciate it in one day. We took a private tour first to just acquaint ourselves with the general layout and got an excellent overview. After that we returned over a week and used the excellent audio guide (NOTE: the audio guide is only a few hundred rubles to rent BUT you must either leave your passport OR 2000 rubles as a refundable deposit) . There is also a downloadable Hermitage iPhone app but we couldn't get it to work reliably inside the building. You can also buy tickets ahead of time online which allows you to skip the long line to buy tickets at the box office. However other people warned us that there is still a long line ( even with tickets) just to get in. Since we had a week we avoided the morning rush and never went before 11 and just walked in without waiting in any lines. Also note: they have recently moved all their impressionists and modern art across the square to the General Staff building. You can get tickets there as well but you have to get WHOLE complex tickets if you wish to visit the main body of the Hermitage AND the impressionists other wise just get tickets for one side or the other. Also another good thing to know is you can NOT enter and exit the main hermitage multiple times. Your ticket is only good once a day so plan accordingly-- you can not leave for lunch and then come back without buying a new ticket. They do have a \"cafe\" on the ground floor but I found it the most disappointing thing about the whole place (lol)-- really just coffee and very sweet cakes and ice cream. The place is so massive I definitely wanted something more to fuel up half way thru the day. Another good thing to remember that-- while it is closed Mondays-- it is open late (till 9 I think) weds and Fridays. So on those days you might want to aim to come late afternoon and try to avoid some of the giant tour groups that sweep through elbowing everyone out of the way in their race around to take the most pictures ( if you've been to the hall of mirrors on a bad day in Versailles you'll recognize this breed of visitor). In addition to the main halls there are two separate tours of the \"treasure rooms\". Each room (gold room and diamond room) have English tours a few times a day. You can NOT see them outside of these tours and can only buy tickets the day of at the inside ticket booths. (Once again buy your main tickets online and then once you get inside just buy these add on tickets). Hopefully some of these tips helped-- it really is an amazing collection and should not be missed!!!"

It is always a pleasure, and on the first occasion, with an engaging expert, it was a joy to view a selection of the massive collection of famous artwork from the great Masters. On this trip unfortunately our guide was dull and vague and at the end of two hours my daughter (aged 13) declared that once you\u2019ve seen one Madonna and Child, you\u2019ve seen them all. The museum is overwhelming and if you are not already well-informed you really need a good guide (or at least a good guide book) who can pick a selection of work that will appeal and inform according to your taste, interest and level of expertise.It is worth knowing that the collection of impressionist work is now in a separate building so a short guided tour (especially from a cruise ship) is likely to offer EITHER Rembrandt, Rubens and Raphael OR Monet, Manet and Matisse. A real art-lover should probably visit for several days and, to get the most from the visit, organise a bespoke itinerary!The Hermitage is, however, worth a visit even for people with minimal interest in art. It is a beautiful building with jaw-dropping interiors. My daughter was thrilled by the splendid rooms of the Winter Palace and loved the mechanical peacock clock \u2013 a quirky highlight (and there were many highlights)of the Pavilion Hall.I have to recommend the Hermitage as a must-see in St Petersburg but I would suggest that good planning could make quite a difference to the experience."

The one drawback are the crowds who visit in their millions, try seeing the galleries on a tour in the late afternoon when the cruise ships have departed."

The contents of the place are better than anything we've seen in London museums, the Louvre, the New York Met, Berlin, Madrid etc. And they've really been renovating and getting more signs up (other than in Russian). So stupendous and alone worth the visit to St Petersburgh.Annoying though because, as in so many galleries and museums, the curators never think how people circulate round the place. Even with a map the geography is almost incomprehensible as there are so many buildings, most of which are only linked at certain floors. Bit of a frustrating nightmare as there are no signs or maps within the place. Only other negative is the places to eat or drink are few, tiny, badly designed and awful. But as I say the contents are world class so these are prices more than worth paying for such a fantastic museum. "

The first thing I noticed in St Petersburg was the new cruise liner terminal, currently accommodating six cruise ships with plans to extend the terminal to take sixteen cruise ships. The second point was the relaxation of Russian Immigration control. Yes, they're still a surly lot but the administration aspect of entry was greatly reduced. On our previous visit vouchers were required for taking photographs in public buildings - no longer a requirement. The Hermitage was the cruise driver with its three million pieces of art. Our first visit to the Hermitage was in conjunction with a visit to the must see Peterhof Palace. Unfortunately, Putin was in town, reslting in road blocks and therefore coach delays leaving just half an hour for the Museum visit. On this occasion we took a designated ship's three hour tour of the Hermitage for \u00a350 per person. A benefit included entry to the museum some 90 minutes prior to opening to the general public, and we were the only cruise ship in town on the day.In the evening we took advantage of the ship's tour, 'Evening on the Waterways of St Petersburg'. at \u00a345 per person. When visiting Russia we take advantage of the ship's visa authorisation rather than the messing about and cost of indepentdently acquiring a Russian visa. All the main sites take Euros. Finally, we took the ship's tour of the Spilled Blood Church with a 90 minute shopping opportunity. The shopping element was unaccompanied at \u00a335 per person. Many passengers enjoyed an evening at the ballet for \u00a355 per person, an event we enjoyed on our earlier visit.I cannot speak to highly of the Fred Olsen Cruise Line.This was our thirteenth cruise and first with Fred Olsen. The food was excellent, the waiters and stewards excellent mainly because they were from the Phillippines. They are so happy and professional. The entertainment was of Thomson standard, and I can't praise higher than that. The ship was the Boudicca sailing out of Newcastle. If you live in the north of England and Scotland, and wish to cruise Norway or the Baltic, I can't think of a better place to sail from, or cruise line top sail with."

Obviously you cannot stop and look at every work of art, but it you plan your route, take multiple lunch breaks to clear your mind, and arrive early, you can get thru every room, focus on one or two items you like per room, and spend a lot of time in a few rooms you really like. Unless you have limited time and a few rooms (art periods) you really want to study, I suggest you ignore the conventional wisdom and try to get feel for the whole place, or at least most of it. Skip a few room that have never really been among your favorite art periods. In some of the rooms, the architecture and design alone is worth stopping to admire This one day tour is even easier if you have a private guide (we did) who is young and energetic. There are fewer toilettes than you might expect, so when you are near one, use it. The line to get in is long. You can avoid a lot of it if you pre-buy you ticket on-line. You can also do this with the help of the front desk at most hotels."

Pickpockets abound and it is wise to leave every valuable item in your hotel safe. Even a cloak room ticket needs safe guarding.

Getting in was easy and we also purchased the audio. This was almost as much as the entrance fee but for what you are about to see has to be good value. The museum is vast so sensible footwear is a must. The state rooms have been restored to former glories with masses of gold leaf and grandeur on display. Some of the rooms are jaw dropping in there grandeur. You can understand how the uprisings occurred given the displays of wealth on show. Paintings. Antiquities in abundance and want you to learn more. Audio of individual paintings very good."

At least in this museum they let you take pictures. . . . .One small point; Russian citizens can enter for free on the first Thursday of every month. Guess when we went!So much history in one place; the pictures, the architecture, the ornaments and one room that made you stop and think for a moment. There is a royal private dining room that became the 'birthplace for a revolution' as it was where most of the ministers were found eating. It was spooky to stand in a place with so much history."

Walk in the footsteps of the Romanovs - stroll through the galleries of Catherine the Great - down hallways and stairways where Peter the Great stood - Whether you are an art lover of have an appreciation for Russia's imperial past, or both - a visit to the Hermitage is a bucket-list experience. The scale of architecture , decoration and grandeur is truly imperial - precious and semi-precious stones carved and inlaid in wall panels, balustrades and ceilings, chandeliers etc, and that's not even beginning to count the precious items on display as part of the museum's collection! Like a visit to the Louvre it's difficult to see everything in one visit, or absorb everything you see. I had booked a private guide rather than visit with a group so we were able to move through the rooms at a slower pace which I found much better - watching the larger groups being rushed through quickly. It's a crowded attraction at any season, so I recommend visiting either at the beginning or end of the opening hours if possible, and don't short-change it! St. Petersburg deserves several days on the ground - if you're trying to do this as a shore excursion be aware you'll only get a glimpse and be left wanting more; splurge and get the land visa - the complications & expense are worth it! Recommended viewing - the moving \"The Russian Ark\""

            "review": "Visiting St Petersburg \u2013 a few tips for 2016 & Impressionist paintings. OK it had been a long time since I was there. As always the drawcard is Catherine\u2019s Hermitage museum and Winter palace \u2013 open all year round. As we were very tight for time we chose to book a guide but it is not necessary - others seemed content with the audio guide or iPhone apps. Next up is the Peterhof gardens and summer palace. If you liked Versailles then this is a must do. If you like large formal gardens and fountains then this has the most you are likely to see in any one place including the trick fountains.Getting there \u2013 do not do a group tour. Take the hydrofoil from behind the Hermitage (1300 roubles return). On arrival don\u2019t do the gardens \u2013 go straight to the grand palace, get in the line and grab an audio guide with your ticket. The audio guide is excellent \u2013 a little too detailed at times but it does have a fast forward button.We were there start of Sept \u2013 wow the large groups of Japanese tour groups off the supersized cruise ships are huge (e.g. group No 27 from cruise ship X). Now the bonus. For crowd control and humidity control the room wardens hold back the groups. But as two solo travellers with audio guides we and you will be able to walk on through overtaking the groups being held back, as well as lingering longer where you wish. We had not known this benefit and we were very glad we had not done a group tour. The rom wardens seemed very appreciative of sole travellers taking time with audio guides (i.e. we were genuinely interested) and went out of their way to assist us or chaperone us to best positions.One of the super wealthy Russians has opened the Faberge museum \u2013 which houses the substantial Faberge egg collection he has assembled as well as much other Faberge stuff \u2013 well worth a visit. He also has his personal Renoir there for you to see !The big surprise though was the new museum the Hermitage has spun off for its Impressionist painting collection. Opened progressively since Dec 2014 they have taken over half of the yellow semi-circular General Staff Building opposite the Hermitage and this has enabled them to put on display their 19th & 20th century art. Truly excellent as before so much of it was in storage. Architecturally the building renovation is also excellent. Well travelled as we are, we have never seen so many works with so few people viewing them - no one else or only a few in the same room. Room after room dedicated to single artists, with many paintings not under glass. By my count we saw :Matisse 38 paintings Picasso 30Van Gogh 8Gauguin 19Cezanne 14Renoir 23Pissarro 6Sisley 4Degas 6Monet 14Bonnard lotsAnd many more recognisable masters. Other tips ? I don\u2019t do ballet. But many years ago when I was young I had the pleasure of joining a bus load of little old ladies from the Smithsonian Institiute in Washington to see the Bolshoi Ballet perform at the wonderfully impressive old Kirov theatre in St Petersburg. So as no major companies were playing this time I said to my wife we could do one of the shows run by entrepreneurs at Catherine\u2019s private theatre in the Hermitage, but be aware the quality is not at national level. So we went to see this commercial production of Swan Lake. Yup \u2013 after Act One an older Chinese lady came up to the usherette and said the male star is too old to dance. As we watched it was clear the choreographer had set his role so he mainly walked rather than danced. It was barely OK only as we mainly wanted to experience the inside of the theatre. This production is attended almost solely by tourists and is regrettably low tourist quality. Enjoy the theatre ambiance, not the dance !It was good to see St P again after all these years. The streets are full of friendly people and are safe. You don\u2019t need a guide. Just get a good map such as Ulmons, which works on your phone\u2019s GPS system and a good guide book, using audio guides along the way. We stayed the W hotel which has an ideal location and also ate at the nearby Craft Brew Caf\u00e9 and SiCaffe which is sometimes an evening jazz venue \u2013 all three we would recommend to friends as worth doing."

The symphony was superb (in the Large Italian Skylight Hall, so we were surrounded by lovely art as we listened to a fine orchestra play excerpts from major pieces.) Have been to concerts/operas in NYC, London, Paris, Boston, etc. - so we do know top quality performances when we hear them.

While it isn't visually stunning architecturally, it contains works of various masters (Rembrandt, Titian, Renoir, Monet, Michelangelo) as well as sculptures by Rodin. The Jordan staircase is everything people say it is. Very impressive. And make sure you check out the Golden Peacock clock. Definitely one of a kind and amazing in both it's simplicity and complexity.To really get the most out of a visit here I recommend taking a tour or getting a guide that is knowledgeable. The books are nice, but to hear the stories behind the paintings really increases one's appreciation. We were fortunate enough to take a tour with only 300 other people. It sounds like a lot - but nowhere near the crowds they get daily. Plan to arrive early and leave late. And then want to go back again as soon as possible."

However, none can compare to this opulence and grandeur--I am speaking of the Winter Palace. Everything is over the top without coming off as \"Las Vegas\" excess. Elizabeth I was responsible for most of the gold--her decor style? \"Always add more gold.\" The craftsmanship of the wood parquet, inlay, & marquetry, not to mention the lapidary skills used in the configuring of massive decorative objet d'art, columns& furnishings. So much malachite was used in this palace and other places in Saint Petersburg that there is no more in the country. And OMG the ART! Just incredible. Huge massive canvases commissioned for the place. Entire collections purchased from lifelong collectors. After spending days looking at tons of icons in many beautiful churches and cathedrals, the private cathedral at the winter palace held (in my opinion) the two most gorgeous and extravagant ones. There is much too much to see! If you have been to Egypt, skip that section. If you have viewed the Greek & Roman collections at The Met, you can skip that. I did not get to see, but think it would be worthwhile to see the lapidary collection--separate price/entrance. This deserves a rating over five stars!"

We bought tickets (NO queue) and walked to the front of the hot, exhausted seething mass of tourists: to our surprise and relief we were just waved in! So I would suggest you just turn up and use the machine: less than 5 mins to purchase a ticket and be inside the Hermitage!

The place is always busy so be prepared for crowds by leaving heavy bags and personal items in the coach or in your hotel. TOP TIP: Visit in the morning when it is slightly quieter."

I have wanted to visit St Petersburg for many years, last year I tried and didn't get a visa, I'm ex military, and the Russians aren't that keen on ex military having a visa..!!!?So this time went with P&O aboard the Adonia, it was a Baltic cruise with two full days in the city, so anyone who has trouble obtaining a visa, go with P&O and you get into the country with the ships block visa system.We had an evening tour of the Hermitage, only P&O passengers with a guide, what a fantastic way to see the inside of this magical building, plus no queuing, you stand up to two hours to get into here during the day.. Beware !!!I've been into many many palaces in my travels, but the Hermitage is one of the top five in the world, it's breathtaking to see the decor and fittings, plus it holds millions of artefacts.I don't think any words can describe just how beautiful the hermitage is, you just have to see it to believe the colours and grandeur of it.We ended the tour with an hour long concert, given by the St Petersburg state orchestra, in one of the grandest rooms I've ever been into, a memory I'll always cherish as one of the best trips in my life.I would recommend a trip here to anyone, its a bucket list place to visit."

            "review": "A Survival Guide for touring the Hermitage.. Let me start off by saying that this review is not for those traveling on some formal tour of Russia or tourist from cruise ships who have only a day or two in port. Rather this Survuval Guide is for those independent travelers who want to set their own pace and agenda.As so many have already commented and I will verify...the Hermitage is overwhelming.... Not only the artwork but equally important the architecture and furnishings. During my visit to St. Petersburg I spent approximately 8 hours touring both the Hermitage and the General Staff Building. I spent 5 hours during the first day just touring the top floor of the Hermitage and the 2nd day I spent 3 hours visiting the Diamond Room and the Impressionist Collection within the General Staff Building....a MUST see !!!Tour OrganizationYou have three options...you can hire a personal guide ( I'll explain about personal guides in my review...A Survival Guide of the Russian Palaces ) , you can rent an audio guide...or you can do what I did....research on line which pieces of art work you really want to see , print out the description and tour in your own. This may sound like a lot of work....but their are websites that list key pieces of art, a nice description of each and where in the Hermitage they are located. The advantage of creating your own tour is that you can pace yourself and only focus on what interests you.Being a photographer I also wanted to linger in a room and take it all in ......and I do mean taking in all the grandeur. The photo ops were great. When you thought one room was over the top , the next room just seemed to be even more spectacular. All too often people are rushed from one room to another to see pieces of art without looking closely at the room itself...be it the floors .... each room seemed to have a different inlet, the ceilings , the columns, the chandeliers or the walls....The Hermitage really consists of multiple attached palaces.....most of the rooms are numbered right above the doorway so it is relatively easy to find your way around. In addition the museum has an excellent map of the museum in English and a variety of other languages. And have no fear.....if you do lose your way as I did a few times....each room has a guard and in all cases they were very helpful pointing me in the right direction despite my speaking a word of Russian.You can also go the route of getting an audio guide....I was told that to take the entire tour would be about 3-4 hrs....of course you can skip art pieces along the way....again, I felt I had enough information about the 50 or so pieces of art I wanted to see not to have to buy an audio guide.Lastly ...given that you will be on your feet for hours...note that throughout the Hermitage there are plenty of places to sit and recharge ones batteries.Getting TicketsI would strongly suggest you getting the discounted two day tickets that allows you entry to the entire museum excluding the Gold and Diamond rooms.The museum is closed on Monday so you will need to check if the ticket is valid for a Sunday and Tuesday given that you must visit the museum on consecutive days.It is hard for me to fathom anyone trying to tour the entire museum...or at least the rooms and specific pieces of artwork without being totally exhausted.... There is just sooo much to take in. Again, I suggest you pace yourself and cover the museum over two days.Note...if you get your ticket on line you only need to show it at one of the ticket booths....there are internet ticket booths that are staffed just inside the front entrance...These may offer shorter lines then waiting to buy a ticket...make sure to bring some form of ID ...your passport or a copy of your passport pic...you will need to show that to have your online ticket verified.For the Gold and Diamond rooms you need to get your tickets the day of your visit and I am pretty sure you must buy it in person. There are only 3 tours a day of each room . I was unable to your both and when I asked at information which was better..I was advised to tour the Diamond Room which I did. Now....the museum opens it's doors at 10:30..... I arrived at the Museum at 9:30 and found only 5 people in line. At 10 AM the front gate is open ...at that time there were about 50 people waiting in line.....clearly not all were waiting to buy tickets for the Gold or Diamond Rooms.... You enter the museum courtyard...it doesn't matter if you go to the right or left you will have to stop and wait in line again for the museum itself to open at 10:30 ....then you proceed inside and there are 3-4 booths selling tickets for both the Hermitage and Gold and Diamond rooms.TimingOn my first day I arrived at the museum around noon and found it relatively empty...absolutely no lines at all. This could have something to do with the chill in relations between Russia and the West. In fact I saw very few westerners during my stay in St. Petersburg. The vast majority of organized tours consisted of Chinese and Japanese tourists.Note that I said I arrived around noon....this could also be a reason why the museum was relatively empty.... I say relatively in that the second day I went, at 10:30 AM ..it was considerably busier.My thinking is that tour companies want to get their touists into the museum early and then have them get out by lunch time...or they arrive in the museum after their lunch around 2 PM ...not sure how true this is but for myself arriving around noon I found the fewest number of tourists. On the following day when I took the Diamond Room tour at 2 PM I found it considerably more crowded.Now, this may be going to an extreme..... but I also checked on line for the number of cruise ships in port ..... I figured that the more cruise ships in port, the more crowded would be the top two attractions.... Peterhof and the Hermitage. I selected those days that had the fewest cruise ships for visits to these two sites....again all this information is easy enough to find on line.The General Staff BuildingHere is one of the most pleasant surprises of all.... For anyone interested in the Impressionist and post Impressionst art periods.... And who doesn't .....then DONT leave out a tour of the General Staff Building. This is the semi-circular , yellow building, broken down the middle with an archway that faces the Hermitage.When facing the staff building with the Hermitage at your back...the wing to the left is the one that houses the impressionist collection. The entrance is easy to find once you walk over.How many times can you say that you entered a museum and found yourself in a room filled with Monets or Van Goghs or Kandinskys and you had the room entirely to yourself !!!Yup..... This museum is a ghost house...during the 2 hrs I spent only one tour group went through. Again I can only guess why this is..... My guess is that the museum rooms are bland...just plain rooms..in contrast to the ornate rooms of the Hermitage. Tour companies probably prefer to hit their customers with the WOW factor of the ornate ness of the rooms of the Hermitage as well as through in some choice pieces of art. In contrast...a tour of the General Staff building can only focus on the WOW factor of an unbelievable collection of impressionist arts but that's all....no spectacular rooms at all.The Diamond RoomThe Diamond Room tour I would rate as a 3 star .... I much preferred viewing the collection at the Faberge Museum. The difference being you could not linger and look at the pieces in detail....the guide had to complete the tour within an hour so you always had to keep moving.The one advantage of this tour is that you first enter the Diamond Room via the Gold Room....and the guide does spend time hoping over a few of the beautiful ancient pieces before proceeding into the Diamond Room.Gift ShopI spent a good week walking the streets of St Petersburg....and other then seeing the poor quality if tourist gift shops selling the all so common nesting dolls, average quality miniature painted boxes and the enamel replicas of the Faberge eggs .... There wasn't a single shop I wanted to buy anything at...... Accept the Hermitage Museum store.I found a variety of gifts for both children and adults at the museum store .... good quality and well priced."

In case you are an art lover it would take you around three days to enjoy most that the Palace has to offer. Such tickets are even availabe and -revisited- I would seriously consider that. It took me hours just to finish the extensive Rembrandt collection on one floor, let alone there are other apartments and 2-3 more floors with the greatest paintings imaginable up to Pablo Picasso. The Palace residence tour itself includes so many rooms with the richest furnishing, decoration and most precious items you could think of. The internal splendour of the winter palace tops any display of aristocratic decadence by far and outshines all other palace residences I have ever seen. Revolution-provoking splendour it is in fact and stunning. The Winter Palace and its Hermitage alone are worth all the journey to Russia. A must-see worldwide."

For people who are more interested in the historical significance of the building than art then don't miss the throne room, the Tsars throne standing on the Dias is a poignant reminder that this was the Royal Palace and home to the reigning Romanov family. The beautiful gold chapel room is breathtakingly and you can see several rooms that were used by the family. Also don't miss the intricate peacock clock that is now encased a a glass show case.For art lovers you could spend a year here and not see every piece. There is an interesting exhibition on Egyptian artefacts complete with genuine mummy.The Hermitage has a couple of cafes so it is possible to get refreshments, if you wish to visit the diamond exhibition buy the tickets and book your tour time when paying for admission as the set times very quickly sell out. The first Thursday of the month admission to the Hermitage is free but there are very long queues to get it. If there is a line in Palace Square the entrance from the embankment side can be shorter.

It was the official residence of the Czars, their Court and 1500 servants until the Revolution of 1917. Today, it houses one of the world\u2019s greatest Museums. The Complex consists of 5 Buildings \u2013Winter Palace, Small Hermitage, Old Hermitage, New Hermitage, and Hermitage Theater.Inside this amazing Museum is a fantastic collection of every type of antique and art you can imagine. Every room will leave you breathless with amazement. The ceilings, the walls and the floors are exhibits in themselves.There are statues, holy relics, jewelry, ceramics, porcelain, furniture, clocks, tapestries, weapons, clothes, precious stones, furniture made out of precious stones \u2013 you name it, they have it. There is a lot of stuff from the Greek, Mogul, Chinese, Japanese, European and Russian Empires. Plus there are more \u201cmodern\u201d paintings by Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh, Matisse, Picasso, Rodin, Gaugin, etc., that are all awesome. It also has over 3 million works of art ranging from the ancient Scythian gold art to the modern Cubist art. The giant malachite and amethyst urns were stunning. The entrance and the staircases immediately take your breath away. You will sense the power of Imperial Russia as you walk around. By the time you exit, your mind is numb with all that sensory overload.We reveled in every minute of our time here, and left extremely inspired. Simply Wow!"

Like its people, it is a young city has a certain sense of confidence and ambition. Young women smartly clocking their heels is a distinct, recognisable sound. Compared to other great European cities, it is only 300 years old, founded by its namesake Peter I - the Great, it has been the seat of the Monarchy for 200 years until the Soviet revolution in 1918 practically violated and raped its glory and riches. It has a bloody and well documented history and in a way the restoration of the city began only after the Perestroika ( which literally means restructuring) movement in the late 80s - and what a job they have done ! It has jumped up my list of favourite cities to break into the top 5. Listing out the great monuments and landmarks would be easy but my vocabulary would prove limited to describe the beauty and the grandeur of it all. It is not about a single landmark or Palace or a museum or cathedral or a fountain or square or canal or bridge - it's how it all comes comes together to give the old city its unique character. I think an impromptu reaction in marathi by Rahul Rahul Chandak when walking the halls of the Hermitage Palace best describes it...'Shrimanta cha tandav' he says - loosely translated to 'the dance of Opulence' The Russian pride in its past and the effort to painstakingly restore its glory is heartening and in sharp contrast back home. As the say : St Petersburg sparkles in the night. I offer a few photographs as additional evidence and rest my case.Another thing that was strikingly different was the sense of order. Four full days and we did not see a single policeman, no one broke traffic laws, people crossed at Zebra line, cars waited for pedestrians , Bikers zipped at over 100 kmph on the Main Avenue of the city - Nevesky Prospekt with confidence that one will step on the road, clean and dust free, thrash cans every 100 meters - it was almost military discipline."

The St Petersburg people are different to Moscovites. They are more friendly and relaxed and make visitors feel welcome, a new feeling for me in Russia. We were offered a handful of strawberries by an old gentleman on the Metro just because we were visitors. The Metro now has all stations in English script which makes transport so much easier.

We then entered the museum through a a side door on the left rather than the main entrance without queuing. All very painless but we were early. Note there are no cloakroom facilities at the side entrance here to leave bags/coats - they were happy for us to carry reasonable sized bags and small back packs. We could pick up an audio guide at the side entrance although it is a somewhat tortuous process and you need to leave one ID for the group or 2000 roubles per handset. Personally we found the audio set useful for much of the art - but of little value for the rooms in the winter palace - so it depends what you want as to whether to get a guide. We did have a hilarious moment when one of the audio guides needed replacing - we did this at another desk in the museum but returned the replaced one to the first desk. The woman here ranted continuously in Russian as the handset number did not match what she had on her sheet and she did not want to return our ID to us. The museum is tricky to navigate. Their map is somewhat helpful. Anyone under the age of 35 speaks English but otherwise the guards in each room were largely unhelpful - even if you showed on the map the toilet sign they spoke to you in Russian and did not even try to point in the right direction.Vegetarians - take your own food as the cafe has little to offer. The service is generally poor. But the Hermitage itself - many adjectives are needed to describe it to do it justice. The rooms in the Winter Palace are just magnificent and are worth half a day alone. Do not miss the Hermitage as it is definitely worth it."

My advice is to visit Generalska building just across beautiful main Hermitage. You will be able to buy ticket for both collections, great masters and modern art, without a minute vasted in the line. As this year is 100th birthday of Black squear, a painting of Kazimir Malievich presented on December 19 1915, than it would be a pity to miss it. Besides, modern art collection is amazing. Almost all great painters of the first half of XX century are there. Don't miss it.Main building is dedicated to old masters and because of that is crowded, lots of turists wondering around not knowing what to see. I recommend Rembrandt with some of his masterpieces of early as well as his last period, Rubens, Dutch masters of landscapes, Van Dyck etc. If you have enough time, go through the grandious halls where Aleksander Sokurov made his film Russian Arc. Feel the time passing or stand still in these unforgettable rooms.If you are art lover, it will be the day for remembrance.After you leave this Museum, it will be enough time to wonder around parks and take a boat on Neva. In June you will fall in love with this city, cause White nights keep you awake and do not allow you to go to sleep. Enjoy by the river, enjoy on the canals, be part of this amazing city."

They said thought there are many fine galleries in Saint Petersburg I might be interested in a little yet known feature of the Hermitage. The General Staff build, found in the Hermitage courtyard. has been renovated and is to house the impressive collection of those periods I was seeking. I could purchase a ticket at the hotel or at the museum ( good for entrance to both). It was a rainy day and the hotel provided free transportation. The lines at the main museum were as to be expected easily 1,000. Well with ticket in hand, purchased at the hotel, I decided to explore the General Staff collection. I was overwhelmed. The exhibit had been opened in June 2015 and the floor plan and audio guides had not been made available as of yet, but what a gem I had been led to. The interior of the building was spectacular, and the collection was remarkable. Here is the amazing part. I was nearly alone for 4 hours with Renoir, Degas, Van Gogh, Cezanne, Pissarro, Picasso, Matisse and many more. I am sure when they have fill all the rooms still closed off this little secret will be a secret no longer."

It reminds me of the Louvre in that you have to be selective on what you want to see, because even a full day here will allow you to only see about 2% of the works on display. The museum is absolutely enormous and comprised of multiple buildings, but most of the art you'll see is in the winter palace, so named for being the winter residence of the czars. This building has three main floors of art arranged in wings by the nationality and period of the art. Main sections include Ancient Egypt, Art of Antiquity, and art of the Orient, as well as the art of various nations (Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, etc.). There is obviously a huge Russian collection, and the palace itself is a work of art, with opulent decorations and historically significant rooms and furnishings.My favorite sections were the Italian Renaissance area (with paintings from Leonardo, Raphael, Titian, and Lippi and a Michelangelo sculpture) and the Dutch and Flemish paintings wings (Hals, Rembrandt, Steen, van Dyke, and Rubens). The rooms are relatively easy to navigate, but be prepared to stand in a line to see the big stuff like the Leonardos (while people take pictures with their phones).Taking a guided tour is helpful, as the guides know where to go to see the popular items. You'd spend a lot of time wandering around if you did it on your own. That may be exactly what you want, though, as every part of this museum is incredible. If you're there to see the most popular pieces, however, it may be too difficult to navigate the place on your own. Regardless, be prepared for a busy, long, crowded day.If you're trying to get to the world's greatest museums before you die, you need to hit the Hermitage. It's definitely on the list."

Advisable to use those but you can take them in if toy really want. They pass everything through a security machine. There are lots of picture signs up about no flash photography no food no drink no stillettos at this security station but it's still quite confusing as they try to move people through ASAP and the numbers are large. Better to take as little as possible with you e,g a wallet a camera or a small handbag. There are lots of toilets and caf\u00e9s on the ground floor and prices are reasonable compared to other museums we've been to. A chicken salad sandwich was 170R 220R for baked cheesecake , and the food is good. This is rated 15 in the top most visited museums in the world and it is easy to see why. There are artifacts dating back from prehistoric right through to modern day architectural exhibitions. My only regret is that we did not have enough time. The students among us are going back before we go home . Thoroughly recommend a visit here. You would be silly not to go."

Instead go through the middle arch and you will see a glass box office off on the right hand side with a sign for electronic tickets. You will exchange your paper tickets here for real ones. Best to buy two or three days in a row then collect all tickets at the same time. After you have collected your ticket you will not have to wait in any line the next day. At the end of the day do not take the white taxis parked in the Palace Square if you are facing the Hermitage to the right. They are scammers. They claim to be Hermitage taxis and when you ask how much they tell you not to worry that they have a meter. When you arrive at your destination you find out the meters are set to their own high prices.

Get there early, its really crowded, and I'd recommend going with a tour that handles your tickets and entry. The option is long walks and long lines. If you're really into art here's what I recommend: take a behind the scenes tour that gets you in before the museum is opened to the public and includes at least an introduction to the major areas, and a chance to visit the off site restoration and storage facilities. Then plan a day or two to go visit areas of special interest to you on your own.My behind the scenes tour was 8 hours, mostly walking but it was worth it. I'm 75 and the tour was easy enough. Here's the only problem: on a tour you go at the speed of the group and this leaves you with only a minute or so with some of the world's most famous works. ( Like other huge museums you could not see it all in a few days or a week). Be prepared for big crowds, a lot of walking, and a lot of very long staircases. Disabled access in any of the grand Tsarist palaces does not meet the standards we expect in the USA but they are getting better. I suppose there are elevators, but you have to work to find them."

This place is just not geared up for Independent travellers. The maps are pretty useless not specifying the contents of the rooms in any more detail than 15-17th century French art and on some floors you cannot move from one side to the other without going upstairs crossing on that floor and then coming downstairs again!. There are lots of ladies placed helpfully around the building but none I encountered could speak any English. Pretty much no-one over 30 will speak English and all the staff seem to be older than that. If you see anyone serving in any of the numerous shops below 30 ask them and maybe you can get directions that way. An audio guide would be great but they are in limited supply and you need to leave your ID or 2000 Rubles deposit. We stood in line 20 minutes to get one but they ran out just 2 people before us. I found a museum app claiming to give a downloadable audio guide but the download would not work and I suspect it would only be in Russian anyway. If like me you don't heed the above advice then hopefully these tips might help. Go on a Wednesday it's open till 9pm arrive early at 10.30am as General admission starts. As you enter under the arch ignore the signs for Kassa or ticket office and turn immediately left or right back on yourself to some green temporary canopies. There you will find computer ticket booths available in English as well as Russian, you can use card or cash to buy and print your tickets there. With tickets in hand you can avoid the line and follow signs for entry to ticket holders, this will be by a side entrance not the fancy staircase. As other reviewers have said you will not be able to see it all so if you want to see the old masters or what the museum website describes as it's highlights then go directly to the first floor. This way you will get there before the tours who will go in a more logical chronological order. Room 247 houses the Dutch masters PP Rubens and next door A van Dyke, 283 is either Titian or Da Vinci, can't be sure now but you will now be in a flow and each room in this sequence will have famous brilliant artworks. When you have enjoyed the masters you can then work back through the rooms including the staterooms which will be relatively less busy now (still very busy!!) Most tours start at 11am so you can have that 30 minutes almost to yourselves.Currently an L shaped area is under renovation and the impressionists are in the General staff building across the square. Floor 3 contains Japanese and Chinese art and the ground floor artefacts from the ancient world which you may see better in Greece, Rome or Egypt.There is a very hot and crowded cafe on the ground floor serving limited but inexpensive salads, sandwiches and cakes."

We went on our own and had pre-booked tickets online. Pre-booking the tickets cut down on the waiting, although we still waited about 45 minutes in line. If you use this approach, remember that you have to have some form of identification to get the tickets. The main part of the exhibition was extremely crowded with many tour groups, but we were still able to see things well (although some patience and maneuvering was needed). The high point of our visit was the Impressionist Art - located in a separate building. It appeared that very few tours go to this part of the attraction as it was not at all crowded. It was possible to take one's time and really see one of the most impressive collections I have ever seen. Do both of these when you visit if you possibly can. We spent about 3 hours, but one could spend days. I would recommend choosing the things you really want to see and focusing on these."

I was disappointed I spent all that money and time for it to be more or less what I expected, and the point of this review is to give you permission to skip it. If you are going to Hermitage because you feel you ought to when visiting St. Pete, I recommend you read about it and envision it or see a video about it, and then go do something else. Almost anything else. To begin with if you spent two weeks in the place all alone you wouldn\u2019t see 5% of what is there. The buildings are beautiful, some of the interiors and pieces are spectacular, but between the volume of what is there and the hoards who are also visiting, beyond experiencing a bit of grandeur, you won\u2019t see anything as well as you could see it in pictures. Even with a very knowledgeable pleasant guide, a decent sound system, and early entry because we were part of a tour, we still spent more time and energy trying to hear and see and keep up as we did actually enjoying what was there. On your own I\u2019d think you\u2019d spend more time trying to orient yourself and figure out where you were than you would appreciating things.If you are a hard core bucket list person and Hermitage is on it, I guess you have to endure it, but for me it will likely be the last thing I do as a \u201cI suppose I should because everyone will ask about it\u201d venture I otherwise have serious reservations about. In retrospect I\u2019d be far happier recycling that old Yogi Berra quote about \u201cit\u2019s gotten so crowded no one goes there anymore.\u201dAs a seasoned world traveler, I expected this would be more of a hog-rassle than an enjoyable experience, and I'm indeed sorry my better judgement didn't prevail."

Magnificent interior but the level of grandeur, so reminiscent of my experience of Louis XIV's similar Versailles Palace, left me thinking that often less is more! Way, way over-the-top grandiloquence. The interior apartments had the same calibre & decorative style of gold & white elegance. The Museum opens on to a sublime, white marble staircase with large numbers of visitors on it snapping shots of everything in sight. The plethora of portraits of Russian generals from the Napoleonic Wars (all in one corridor) was somewhat of an overindulgence I thought. Fantastic array of 17th-18th century art works on display which makes many other galleries pale by comparison - including Rembrandts & paintings by other Flemish/Dutch masters, a Michaelangelo sculpture & two rare Da Vincis."

No visit to St Petersburg is complete without a visit to the Hermitage Museum - but plan your visit and try and avoid the crowds, especially tour groups. We bought a two-day ticket which enabled us to go back a second day and pick up features we had missed the first day. The first day we had to convert our voucher into a ticket which meant queuing, but on the second day we were able to walk straight in. We selected the features we wanted to focus on - in our case, the Dutch and Flemish masters and the royal state rooms - and gave the rest a miss. About three hours was enough, but the best piece of advice we received was to go on a Wednesday when the Hermitage stays open until 9pm. We arrived at 5.30pm and almost had some rooms to ourselves. All the paintings etc have English as well as Russian details next to them and the audio guide is well worth the hire. Many of the items have audio commentaries. I found the room numbering system a but of a struggle. If you can find it, the royal chapel is an (almost hidden) gem."

In addition we were berated in Russian by a tour guide more than once for no particular reason which scared my son. Our guide suggested that this is because she earned less than the guides that are able to speak other languages.The museum should also consider banning cameras as viewing through a camera lens detracts from the experience and spoils the experience for others.If you can visit outwith the main cruise ship season or at a quiet time of day it would be a more enjoyable experience."

The building itself is magnificent and is a must see for any person visiting St. Petersburg. While I am not a huge art lover, they have a large, impressive collection. For me it was the opulence of the rooms themselves, the amazing ceilings and the history that was so impressive. As to the crowds, we visited as part of a cruise tour. Our tour had gone to Catherine Palace in the morning and then we saw the Hermitage in the afternoon. Well, by afternoon, the place is packed full of pushing, shoving tourists. Our family included a older woman who walks slowly and two children under the age of ten. Our tour guide was going at such a fast pace through the museum that we spent most of the tour more concerned about keeping up with her and making sure that no one got lost in the enormous crowd. We did not get to enjoy our visit nearly as much as we had hoped - more the fault of the tour we were on than of the museum. However, my brother had booked a different tour in St. Petersburg than the rest of us and they visited the Hermitage first thing in the morning. He had a much different experience than we did. Whereas my pictures show rooms packed with people, his show open rooms with only a few people milling about. In the end, I recommend a visit to this amazing place, but you need to get there first thing in the morning, be able to spend the better part of the day exploring the many wonders of this museum and try to avoid going on a day when all the cruise ships are in town."

Even my eleven year old son enjoyed his trip to the museum. The rooms were fabulous, such opulence you could see before you. We saw some famous paintings and the room with the paintings of all the military officers, floor to ceiling paintings was unbelievable, that was my favourite room. Also I loved the entrance of the museum/ palace, it was stunning, the columns and stairway was something else!When visiting this city, this visit is a MUST!!"

If you join a tour in advance, you may be able to get in an hour ahead of the opening and avoid the line-up. A tour will also help you get around inside the museum (because it is HUGE) and zero in on some highlights. If you don't take a tour, at least go for the audio self-tour.

You are provided with a voucher that you can use to redeem for tickets within 6 months. There is a special ticket window for e-tickets. When I came at 10 am there were maybe 5 people at that window compared to thousands in the other line. I have also purchased guided tour in English for my family of 3. The best thing I have done and completely worth 7,000 roubles (a little over $100) but you do have to purchase entry tickets separately. The tour was 2.5 hours which was plenty. Actually you do not have to purchase entry tickets before hand if you are doing a guided tour, they will arrange for everything but I did not know it at the time. You have to arrange for guided tour in person at the Hermitage but we did it a day before and took 5 minutes. We had a great visit! Get the guide!"

I've been known to get so engrossed in a painting, that a friend has to retrieve me after they have seen the whole exhibit.. not possible here. the \"famous\" paintings are under glass and there's no place or opportunity to enjoy the great work of art. think, mona lisa in the louvre, under glass, and people 10 deep staring for a nanosecond so they can go home and tell their friends they have seen the mona lisa. same thing at the hermitage x 10.after my river cruise I had booked a hotel for 3 nites so I could spend quality time at the hermitage. never happened. the cruise tours come at 8:30 and fill the bldg. the general public enters at 10:30 on depending on when they arrived to line up for an hour to purchase a tix for 800 roubles ( $16 CAD) this tix allows u to visit the main bldg. only. u can't buy tix in the line for the next day. one day only. u can't leave and return on your tix the same day.SUGGESTION:: BUY YOUR TIX ON LINE IN ADVANCE. I PAID $23.95 CAD FOR TWO DAYS IN A ROW, NO WAITING IN LINE. THIS TIX ALLOWS U ACCESS TO ALL FIVE BLDG.I found arriving at 1 pm and leaving a 6 pm closing time gave me the most access to the exhibits, eg. I found the room of french renaissance art and got lost in several pouisson's. I gave up on the Italian masters. if u do not have a guide there r wands or purchase (500 roubles) in many languages. the women at the desk speak fluent English, which i found funny because the info desk staff do not. the wand will introduce u to the major exhibits.If u only have a day i suppose u could enjoy a few paintings, but the unique exhibits r hard to find. it took me 55 min. to find the byzantine exhibit. (none of the guards speak English and they will point left and say \"right\")u can take pix sans flash in all exhibits except the byzantine and I am at a loss to know why and there was no one to ask. it took equally long to find the Siberian art and artifacts and I had a map. it's just soooooo big and the elevator does not take u to the byzantine exhibits on the top floor altho it goes to the top floor -- it's a matter of finding the right staircase in an enormous barn w/ hidden staircases. it's worth it, however, the Siberian artifacts r kept in a special cold room and there is no where else in the world u may see them. unfortunately most art is labled in Russian. the Russians just haven't caught up to tourism yet. for 500 roubles extra u may go to either the sparkle treasure room or the gold treasures room. u must have a guide and tours r offered in several languages at different times. I took the sparkle room tour - the hard part was trying to find where they sold the tix when no one speaks English. in the sparkle room they have a bejewelled reliquary (12thcentury) to hold a piece of the true cross, a phenomenal 12th century statue of a monk holding a jeweled bible. my favourite was a glass engraved w/ Anne of Cleaves (henry VIII 4th wife) name. while I enjoyed what I found and experienced, the inability to sit in front of a painting and explore it thoroughly was frustrating. the crowds were frustrating, noisy and disinterested in art. even the rooms, unlike varsailles, have pieces of furniture of a certain period stored in them, but other than Peter's throne room, none of the furniture belongs in that room. it has been collected and stored in a room in the hermitage so u never get the sense of the real winter palace when occupied by the romanoffs. fortunately, for the most part, lenin left the hermitage unharmed to show the peasants the debauchery and extravagance of the tsars while they starved.I am glad I went for four days, however, the louvre, the british museum and the museums on museum island in berlin r better organized and more tourist-friendly. the hermitage has a lot of art, but it is poorly displayed and is sorely lacking in languages other than Russian by both the labels and the employees. Russia is trying, but it has a long way to go."

It was almost as I imagined when I read Nicholas and Alexandra with the kids before our trip, only more opulent than the imagination can bring up! The Palace itself is quite a site and then you get to the Hermitage and you can see something wonderful from almost any great artist you can imagine. Catherine the Great started the collection and it continued from there, so it is quite a show! Don't go to the city without a stop here, but bring a guide so you know what you are looking at and what importance it may have had. We brought our kids (12-14) and they enjoyed the visit too. We had just under 2 hours here, but you could easily use more if you are an art nut!"

It's also a good idea to get your ticket in advance on the Internet.On the downside I'd say it has the worst signage and guidance of any such museum or attraction I've ever encountered.

Our guide walked us around some of the most impressive rooms with many dedicated to works by famous artists such as Monet, Van Gogh and Renoir. Rooms were full of stucco, gold leaf, sculptures and treasures amassed by the Tsars over many generations. The only downside of the visit was that it was too crowded and it was virtually impossible to stand and spend quality time appreciating the many treasures here. You definitely need good walking shoes as the Hermitage is laid out over a vast area."

Get there for opening hours and get your ticket at one of the vending machines in the courtyard. Or, come in the afternoon when all the groups from the cruise ships are through.Taking pictures is possible, but I didn't bother - there is simply too much to photograph.Take comfortable shoes - you'll be walking several kilometres.All in all - one of the places you've got to see!"

We learned a lot about Russian history from visiting the rooms dedicated to the life and history of the Czars including Catherine the Great and the last ruling family. Magnificent Russian Art is exhibited in the Hermitage, an Art which rivals the best western painters that we were familiar with. We simply could not enlist everything that we have viewed.

There were tons of prams so that made it quite difficult to maneuver around exhibits and moving from room to room through the narrow doorways. Also, there were not a lot of places to sit so be prepared to be on your feet for hours. While I'm fully aware it was summer, it wasn't just warm inside - it was downright hot and sweaty.

An extraordinary art and historical experience made even better by these 3 tips:1) Go on a Wednesday evening, after the crowds have subside and the cruise boat people are gone.2) Hire a good guide to maximize your time.3) Don't miss the general Staff building with the very best collection of Impressionist paintings in the word.Go early and you may be the only person in a room of Picassos or Renoirs or Matisse or Degas."

There are a lot of staircases to negotiate but they are all beautifuly designed with huge amounts of marble and gilding. When we come to the artefacts, words fail me. It is said that if a person spent 10 seconds looking at each one, 24/7 for 24 hours each day it would take 10 years to see them all.So a 3 hour visit allows you to get an overall impression of the total beauty of the place and even that will involve walking for about 3.5 miles.When in St Petersburg, do not miss it!!!"

Without doubt you can't visit the whole collection in one day (actually they say that if you spend one minute for each work in Hermitage, you need about 120 years to finish your visit). So with a little search you can find good plans and suggestions for the museum highlights. I personally suggest a deep visit to \"Loggia of Raphael\", a copy of Raphael's famous gallery in Vatican. Da Vinci and Rembrandt are \" don't misses\" of this museum. Don't bother yourself for a visit to Ancient Egypt, because it's simply descent and you can spend more time on more valuable parts."

We pre-booked tickets online thinking we wouldn't have to spend at least 4 hours queuing on a Wednesday morning/afternoon. Got there and there were lines that were snaking from the inside of the museum and pouring out until the end of the Square bridges (at least 500m). What shocked us and everyone in line was that there were only a handful of ticket booths dealing with pre-booked and on-the-spot ticketing purchases. The staff working in the booths also had total disregard of dealing with the issue promptly and basically took their their with the tickets (imagine ~5-10mins per person). We were in line for almost an hour before the lady in our booth decided to shut the line without any reason. Everyone was just furious and despite looking for other staff for help. there were none on the square and the ones inside just shook their head saying \"NYET- I DONT KNOW\". This is the Hermitage you're talking about but the standards of service was just disgusting and 3rd world. Having travelling the world to various huge museum, we've never experienced such bad service and lines. It wa slike queuing for food stamps in the USSR days so it was an absolute joke. Inside it was a maze with hords of tour groups everywhere (expected in a big museum). Interiors were well-kept and delightful to observe, but nothing amazing compared to other big museums such as the Lourve or Sistine. Masterpieces were also mediocre and you had about 10 seconds in line to view masterpieces with a hundred people around you snapping photos. Maps were also lacking as there were only a few measly pieces in French lying around. Again, staff was no help (get used to the word 'NYET', and 'I dont know\"). Some volunteer staff working inside the museum guarding the art pieces were nice however, helping anyone who was lost inside. (Be prepared to get lost). Unless you are a SERIOUS art buff or have a PHD in art history or some sort, I'd say skip this as it is better off spending at least 8hrs of your time in St.Petersburg exploring elsewhere."

This was because the online price is considerably higher than the ticket desk price- it would have been something like $66 (\u00a342) dollars compared to R600 (\u00a36.50) for myself and two teenagers- and reviews on here suggested that the queues are not that bad. They are horrific. We waited over two hours in a line that barely moved to get to a slow ticket desk queue followed by a quicker entry to museum queue. A girl standing near us fainted. The queues for terminals were as bad and there was absolutely no signage- even in in Russian- to show which queue is for which. (Previous experience had shown that terminals often didn't work, weren't in English and didn't produce free tickets so we didn't bother with that massive queue). Major renovation and building work is going on so perhaps that contributed to the chaos.  To get free entry for children and students produce their passport opened to information page - not a copy (keep a copy of passport and visa at your hotel). There was a map available in different languages but we failed to figure out how to obtain one (and were past caring after two hours) and used the very good information in our Lonely Plant St Petersburg guide instead. But I don't think they were difficult to acquire as most people had them. Either way you need a map. This place is VAST and the room numbers don't always appear to follow a sequence that I could discern.Once inside you need to leave your main bags in the cloakroom. You can take a small bag and handbag with you. We took a bottle of water and food for which we were very grateful after a few footsore hours. You can't eat in the rooms but downstairs by the entrance is a corridor with seats and no one seems to mind as long as you don't make a mess. I sent my son to attend to the bags while we waited in the short but slow moving inside queue for the ticket desk. There is a toilet near here but queues for the ladies can be very long and there are other toilets inside although all seemed to be on the ground floor (called the first floor in Russia). The imperial state rooms and private rooms of the tsars are on the first floor (second floor in Russia) and you go up via the spectacular Jordan staircase. At the foot to the right are toilets and a lift. There were a lot of people in the museum and the Chinese tour groups in particular are large and over-excited but the rooms are so vast that it is not a big problem. We calculated that our four bedroom house would fit about five times over in one room alone. I have visited a lot of stately homes and palaces over the years and nothing has ever compared to the sumptuousness and extravagance of the Romanovs. I wondered what the impoverished, hungry people of the revolution thought when they first entered the glittering, golden rooms to seize power from the provisional government.As this was the last day of our holiday and we were tired and had already seen a lot of paintings, we pretty much ignored the art, other than a quick look at the most eye-catching pieces, and just focused on the rooms on the first floor of the Winter Palace and a little bit of the adjoining Hermitage. Inside you don't really notice when you move from one building to the other and it is really easy to get disorientated. We spent the final hour on the ground floor. Coming back down from the first floor we accidentally exited the museum and had to be re-admitted on the other side of the inside corridor. This was not a problem once we found someone who could understand us. Make sure you hang onto your tickets. A more careful reading of the map would have shown the internal staircases and lifts the ground floor. This floor was practically deserted and had very interesting and exquisitely curated collection of early Siberian and Scythian artefacts including several naturally mummified bodies, including a horse. There was limited information in English, especially about the bodies.As ever in Russia, there was very little information in the museum in English- usually just a few short lines under a longer piece in Russia. There are audio guides available (in most places they request R1000 deposit but will also take a passport. You only need one deposit no matter how many guides you borrow). I did pick up a newsletter by the museum director talking about the museum during the siege of Leningrad. Despite starvation rations and terrible cold, the staff continued to work quietly on their research whilst facilitating the evacuation of a million artefacts to safer territory in the Urals and Siberia. This heroic devotion to duty and preserving Russia's heritage is a huge source of pride to Russians, echoed across the city. It doesn\u2019t mention the many staff who were purged under Stalin such as the armour expect suspected of harbouring weapons. I felt that this was somewhere I would like to return to one day in slower time, in a quieter season with a tour or an audio guide to take in more. Older visitors or those with limited mobility might prefer their first visit to be done in this way. One visit is nowhere near enough and, despite the irritation of queuing and so many people, it was breath-taking and easily takes the title of the world's best museum."

If you are fortunate enough to visit St Petersburg (don't forget your umbrella, regardless of what the skies look like) you must see the Winter Palace and State Hermitage Museum. Amazing architecture, wonderful exhibits and some incredible paintings by world reknowned artists will provide you with an unforgettable experience. Avoid the afternoons and visit early if you can, especially in summer as the museum will be crowded and can become quite hot and stuffy. Also, be prepared to do a lot of walking and climbing of stairs. The walk up the main staircase in the Winter Palace is something for your memory banks for the rest of your life."

So maybe we were tired and it influence my review, but we spent about two hours there and I was ready to leave after one.The place is indeed incredibly big and there are very beautiful rooms, but there are uninteresting rooms too. There are so many different things that it is hard to find everything interesting. Some will prefer the historical rooms, other will prefer the art, but if you are not familiar with the place, you can get lost easily.In a lot of way it is similar to the Louvre in Paris.It is a must-see in St.Petersburg, but allow time according to your interest. A quick one-hour tour would have been enough for me."

The exhibits are remarkable and the palace itself is stunning, and I'm not even a museum person. My recommendations are this:1) Take a tour. The place is just too big to do in an day/afternoon by yourself. Having a tour guide enhances the experience by streamlining you to the most important things, or to the things you would most like to see. If nothing else, at least do a little research beforehand so you're not just wandering around aimlessly, only to find out later you missed something important or that you would have liked to see.2) Buy your ticket online. If you go with a guide, you will likely be able to use the group entrance and save time. If not with a guide, BUY ONLINE in advance and you can go up to the left side entrance and trade your voucher for tickets. We found this out last minute while waiting in a 1000+ person line in the rain and it saved us at least 2 hours. Thank god for international data plans. If nothing else, get there early, there WILL be a line. And they are closed on Mondays, so look at the schedules in advance."

Fortunately, there are staff throughout the museum to offer direction and help, although not all of them speak English.My favorites are the Jordan Stairs, the Pavilion Hall with the fabled Peacock Clock, the stunning loggia of Raphael, the room with Canova's neo-classical sculptures, and of course, Da Vinci, Michaelangelo, Caravaggio, Rembrant, and any celebrated master you can think of. If you are a fan of impressionists and post-impressionists, do visit the General Staff Building which is included in the ticket. Absolutely amazing palace and art collection!

The tour starts at 1pm each day and gets you past all of the queues. Our group was only 3 people which was amazing as it was like a private tour. It also meant we could dodge around the large tour groups and see more of the very extensive collection. Our guide, Tania, was absolutely amazing. She was extremely knowledgeable and full of interesting stories and anecdotes about the paintings and artists. She was also very frustrated on our behalf that some of the more interesting pieces were missing, most likely on a visiting exhibition elsewhere, but if she hadn't mentioned it, we would never have known. Nice that she was honest. The hermitage is enormous and would be extremely hard to navigate without a guide. We're travelling on a tight budget but I think paying an extra 1100 roubles to have a guide is well worth it. Similarly if you don't know much about the artists or stories behind the pictures it's a fascinating way to learn more. The tour didn't include the 20th century collection across the road in the General Staff bulding but we still had an hour and a half after the tour to explore the must see collection of Renoirs, Picasso's, Van Gogh's etc.I really enjoyed this tour, it was the highlight of our week in Russia."

Queues for the manned booths were even longer!If you have a credit card I\u2019d highly recommend buying from hermitageshop.org under \u2018tickets\u2019. You don\u2019t need to print out the emailed voucher. At the Internet Purchased ticket collection booth you can just show a mobile phone with the voucher loaded on screen. For purchase confirmation ID they were quite happy to accept my foreign driver's licence. With a ticket in hand you can walk pass all the other queues, straight into the building proper and head to the security screening. I\u2019m sure it saved me at least an hour of queuing!I\u2019d also recommend buying the 2 day pass. It\u2019s only 25% more expensive than the single day pass but allows you to browse the museum without rushing. Or the worry that you\u2019ll miss some highlights because you spent too long elsewhere.It\u2019s probably best to eat a large breakfast before hand. I passed the ground floor cafes during lunch and they were packed. Some with people standing in the hallways while eating a purchased takeout lunch. I am quite sure outside food/drinks are not allowed in the gallery.The descriptions of the art and room curation was a mixed bag. In rare cases such as the Egyptian Eastern Collection everything was only in Russian. Others had extensive curation both in Russian and English using touch screen computers. While most rooms had English and Russian item descriptions. Some rooms also offered RU, EN,French and German curation that were printed on boards. Annoyingly not every room in the Hermitage was clearly numbered so it made navigation more complicated than it needed to me.Inside I didn\u2019t find the crowds too bad. There were always plenty of empty rooms next to the crowded ones. The large tour groups usually collected together, so skip those rooms and come back later when they are gone. Unlike other famous museums such as the ones in Florence or Paris, the tour groups are not infinite. If you\u2019re patient enough, the groups will dissipate and you\u2019ll often have a famous masterpiece all to yourself.I also bought The Hermitage Guidebook for 700\u20bd. It is probably not worth buying unless you want a keepsake. There is no numbered contents which made it extremely annoying to use. It\u2019s only usefulness while in the museum was for finding the location of highlighted artworks and the maps at the back of the book."

Be prepared to spend your day there and even if you do all you get to see is a portion of this great museum and Palace. The evening before I was in Palace Square, a beautiful sight, wide open spaces. I just stood there mesmerised by all that vastness. The next day it was chaos, buses, tour guides, masses of people lining up at 9.30 a.m. (all ticket offices open at 10.30 even the electronic ones), the queue is much smaller though if you go to the electronic ones, but I would recommend to book your tickets on the Hermitage website. It is a little bit more expensive but certainly worth it as you don't have to line up. Once through the doors there is the cloakroom on your left side, you have to leave your backpack there, so make sure you have a small handbag to take with you while you are visiting the museum. Cloakroom is free of charge. After security check you're in, you can then opt to buy a booklet or an audio guide, take your id with you so don't have to leave a deposit . You are now ready to start visiting these immense halls and galleries, starting of course from the Jordan Staircase made first by Rastrelli's and then Stasov. A tiring but wonderful day!!!!!!"

This place is huge, impressive, and seem so familiar if you've travelled around europe already.The building itself, the winter palace, is a joy to look at. Beautiful colours and architecture!The museum housed therein is monumental. it's so big, a day will never be enough to see it.. So pick what you wanna see!Also, I found it hard to navigate in there, but then again, I always do in large museums.However, if you've travelled europe a bit and visited your share of museums, this all seems extremely familiar. Interior architecture reminds a lot of the vatican museums, and the exhibits are basically interchangeable, except the paintings of russian tsars and emperors, etc.The grand staircase and ballroom, however, are just jawdropping. The place sure is worth a visit! A full day if you're into museums, a few hours or half a day if just interested in the architecture."

It was a Wednesday when the museum is open until 9 PM, so many others had the same idea I did. In 3 hours in the museum, I barely had enough time to walk to the highlights noted in the museum map and the Lonely Planet, much less pay attention to the details of individual pieces of art!"

This was the easiest, due to visa restrictions. In retrospect, this was the right decision. Being on a tour meant that we could get into the Hermitage at least an hour before the doors opened to the general public. After it opens, it becomes almost impossible to see anything due to the sheer amount of people. However, the place is so amazing that it is really a must-see. If you want to do it properly, you need at least a full day, but I am glad we could go, even if it was just for 3 hours. Being with a guide also meant she could point out the most important pieces, explain the history behind them and take us quickly from room to room without having to constantly look at the map to find our way. You are not allowed to take bulky jackets or rucksacks, but there's a safe place to leave them if you need to."

The place is huge, crowded, and all of the signage for directions are in Russian. Also, you need to know a lot of history to appreciate some of the collections. The collection of art is absolutely amazing, so many Rembrandts from your art history classes are there. The mechanical clock is also astounding.Book as separate group tour of the Treasures of the Hermitage- the highlight of St. Petersburg. You get to see so many amazing jewel encrusted pieces from Russian history and Catherine the Great's possessions, as well as a Faberge egg donated to the Hermitage by Putin. Those group tours are limited to fifteen people, but be prepared to be astounded by the grandeur and scope of the treasures.There is a crummy cafe in the Hermitage by the gift shops that takes dollars and euros as well, but the lousy sandwiches will keep you from starving, given that you will likely spend the whole day at the Hermitage."

We also had a guide so if you have the chance to get one, better do so since it helps to have someone explain the history behind the works as compared to just looking around. Be there as early as you can so you can get space in the cloakrooms which get full quite fast, especially if there are multiple tour groups from cruises visiting at the same day. We only saw toilets in the ground floor so better use them beforehand."

Similarly to the Louvre, the saying goes... if you were to spend a minute looking at each exhibit on display in the Hermitage, you would need 11 years before you\u2019d see everything. Just know that only a very tiny percentage of art and paintings is on display, the rest in storage and of the items on display, you will only get to see a fraction. What you do come away with is the overwhelming beauty and scale of the Hermitage. Buy the books after the tour for future reference and information on what you saw!! The paintings I saw... wow! The furniture, chandeliers, ceramics, tile work... wow! The Diamond Room... double wow!! In this museum, it is allowed to take photos unlike many of the other Cathedrals and Catherine's Palace and Peterhof so click away... except in the Diamond Room where it is not allowed. Be patient as the crowds in the summer are huge and try and go early if you can. I was with my small Travel All Russia group so it was easy to manoeuvre around. Wear comfortable shoes and hydrate as you need at least 4 hours minimum!!!!"

A handful of others might have better works, depending on how you judge these things.But the Hermitage probably is in the top 10, and it probably has more quality items than any other art museum. That means that it's an amazing experience to walk through, and you'll never see more than a tiny fraction of it all unless you move to St. Petersburg.I can't say I ever saw a Rembrandt before, and the place had a room full of his works. I've heard that many of the works here were more or less stolen, or at least purchased under shady circumstances.Our visit was on a Sunday, and no matter how big the place was, it was definitely oversold. It felt like a football game, particularly when I was caught in something of a mob of Chinese tourists who surged forward as a group and surrounded me. (Rules on personal space must be different there.) Their attention was focused on the picture shown, a work by da Vinci - I think. At least, I remember it this way when dodging the crowd.One interesting point about the place is that photography is allowed. Most galleries tell you to at least keep the flash off, but they don't seem to care here. Therefore, I've got several photos of some great areas in my album; I just felt like snapping away when I saw something interesting, and it was almost all interesting."

For me the winter palace was the more important of the two. You can see great art in one of many museums around the world, the palace is very special. Was disappointed with the impressionist art which moved to new building, collection was quite thin. Also did this with a personal guide. Not sure how good the audio guides are. I used in one museum in Istanbul and was very disappointed. Other choices are group tour wherre where you wear earphones and the guide talks to the group via her mouthpiece. Seems very effective. Of course, private tour is best but more expensive. If we spend the time alone, it would have been difficult. Just navigating through the crowds to check your coat and bags could be an ordeal. The guide made this more easier for us. Can get through the Hermitage and see a great deal if spend 5-6 hours with guide. More time if you are really into the art and want to spend lots of time looking at each picture. Other advantage of a guide is that you get into the museum quickly. We observed the queue which could require 1-2 hours in line before getting into museum."

Buy your ticket there and be prepared for a 2 hour queue. It felt great to walk straight in!! Of course it's amazing and busy. We bought a two day pass to use on consecutive days. I think on your first visit it's worth doing it as a private or small group tour just to familiarize yourself and get background information and a bit of an idea about whats what. The State apartments are awe inspiring. Then you have time to go back or see more at your leisure."

We were fortunate to mostly see the most important artistis, but really the place overall is so over-powering that such crowding shouldn't let you down.A fantastic tour guide can make all the difference in your experience here.

I would recommend visiting this attraction by booking it through a tour company. Number one reason is that you have a tour guide who will show you the highlights and explain what everything is (unless you are well versed in art). Secondly, and maybe most importantly, they take you in early - a little before it is open to the public. You can still encounter crowds but nothing like in the afternoons. The line-ups we saw when we were finished were crazy long. I bet people spent hours queuing for a ticket. If you wear a big jacket or take a knapsack, they insist that you check it in. An absolute must for tourists."

It is incredibly beautiful and has the most amazing collection of wonderful art and antiques of all ages and from many countries. My personal favourite was the room of filigree and highly decorated bouquet vessels. I agree with a previous reviewer, explanations were missing from many exhibits/pieces and not all were in English.We were lucky to have VIP tickets so didn't have to wait in the very, very long queue to purchase tickets. If you can get them via your hotel or a guide I would advise you do. The queue to get in is horrendous. If you can get a shuttle service to and from it is a good idea. Taxis are not easy to come by when you want to leave. Try not to take a large bag or items you need to leave in the locker room, it also has a queue and is a tedious exercise.Don't expect good food, it is very average.Regardless it is an amazing place to visit. Don't miss it."

As Ada, our guide, told us - if you look at each exhiit for half a minute you will need 11 yeras to cover the current exhibition, nothing to say about numerous art pieces that are kept in the palace cellars."

            "review": "The Worst At Its Best.. This museum gets a poor rating for its lack of layout and crowd control. It's truly a beautiful museum with incredible works of art. But there's little way to enjoy when you're fighting crowds, selfie sticks, and being pushed around by the masses. As an independent traveler who doesn't tour with groups to be told what to look at, when to walk, when to stop, when to eat... this, like most major sites in St. Petersburg becomes a challenge. Shame that one of the most stunning museums in the world gets lost to the crowd. Why I preferred the State Russian Museum over the Hermitage. It was less for tour groups coming of cruise ships, etc., Granted it's collection is not as vast nor is the interior as opulent but you have the museum experience. What I didn't like about St. Petersburg is the mass amounts of tour groups. Who take precedence over anyone else. You might be the first in line, but expect to be pushed out of the way by a Russian tour operator so the sheep can follow. They'll be pushing you out of the way as well. Apparently countries with a large population that can now travel freely and have the money to get off the mainland seem to not understand the etiquette of travel. We're all in it together and just because you're with a tour group doesn't mean you're any more special. One just couldn't relax in this museum. The line to get in was at least a quarter of a mile thick. It was the most crowded and fight for space museum I've ever been expereinced. Same reason I avoid the Louvre. It's a must see but an impossible to see. Witnessed people just walking by art work and talking photos. No thought for composition or if in focus.... just to have it taken. A bit of a nightmare. Another thing is that the museum is so large and so crowded you lose sense of the flow and what room to walk into. There's no markings with direction. You just get jumbled around with the others. Most of the art work is also poorly lit. Glare seems to be an issue and you can't get a clear look at a painting. But I don't think the Hermitage is concerned with the art. I get that they just want to pack in as many people as possible to make money. It's not about the art at this point. This is the same case with Catherine's Palace and the Peterhof. Mass tourism at its worst. My suggestion is to order tickets online which I did. Saved hours of waiting in a line. Can't imagine having done that to only walk into a bad dream. Remarkably some rooms were not crowded at all. The tour operators are on a time schedule and won't allow all to be seen. Only what \"they\" think you should see. Why I just never do tours. I might miss out on some but I get so much more by the element of surprise. Case in point, is the Hermitage annex across the Palace square. In an old building with a modern interior. This is where the modern art collections are kept. Here you'll find what a museum should be. With educated and well mannered people. It allows you to gaze and have a calm amazing experience. I only saw one tour group here but they were on their best behavior. Bless the Spanish. This is highly recommended to see. Especially after the pandemonium of the Hermitage. Depending how you travel, the Hermitage might be perfect for you. Many seem to be OK with crowds, being pushed, and being herded along. Not for me. No thank you. Been to many museums throughout the world and the best experiences were the one's where I could look at art, take it in, and have a moment with a piece. With the Hermitage I couldn't wait to leave. Unfortunate."

When we arrived at the Hermitage it was packed and we had to wait to go in. Once inside, the Hermitage is a beautiful museum with lots to see and lots of beautiful rooms. It was very busy, but we had an amazing guide who made sure we saw everything of significant interest . You would need more than a day to see it all, a huge building with many interesting and wonderful exhibits. A must visit place!"

            "review": "Buy tickets online!!!! Arrive early!!!. This is my favorite museum in the world, but if you are going during peak tourist season, I cannot stress enough how important it is to plan ahead. Ideally, you will buy your tickets online and arrive roughly 30-45 minutes before opening to exchange them for paper tickets and get in line. Make sure you get in the line for ticketed patrons. This will at least get you inside ahead of the giant tour groups. From there, it's on you to stay ahead of them. They travel in massive packs and huddle in front of the most famous paintings, making for a miserable experience if you are there to see the Da Vinci. The audio tour for the Winter Palace is recommended. The Hermitage has a mobile app that allows you to download an audio tour for $$. Just know that it is a) different from the audio tour you rent in the lobby, b) at the time we visited, it was full of errors. The tracks did not match up exhibits. Therefore, at this time, I recommend that you rent the audio tour inside. Again, just get there as early as possible in order to have the best experience."

The artifacts are purely as ornate as you might imagine. It has been shared that some of the finest work from 700AD cannot be replicated with today's best jewelers, etc. How the details on a set of ear rings could possibly have been made to such an intricate way, without tools or lenses is just impossible to comprehend. The relics alone are astonishing. There is an additional diplomatic collection worthy of a peek. The Hermitage is a busy yet expansive museum. The gold room made it an amazing day.

I enjoyed the works of art but my only criticism is that the place is a little worn. I would expect such a place to be in better condition.

Buy your ticket online or from one of the automatic ticket machines on the left hand side once you are in the first courtyard. Choose your strategy: I did one trip that was more of a walk through the many galleries and the staterooms without much stopping and a second more selective visit. The Rough Guide has a whole chapter on the Hermitage and was very helpful, also make sure you pick up a floor plan as you go in. The Rembrandt and Da Vinci rooms are particularly packed but if you hang around for gaps between the tour groups you can get a good look. Personally I would not have liked to be part of a tour group (you can always eavesdrop on other people's tours). My highlights were the staterooms, and the Rembrandt gallery (rm 254) don't forget the impressionists are now across the square in the General staff building which is included in your Hermitage ticket and you MUST visit!"

Even people we knew who had tickets, and were with tours, were asked to wait outside for an hour or more to get in. The Gold room is great with its collection of Faberge jewelry, and numerous other valuable collections. On the down side our guide to the gold room spoke no English, so we had to have everything translated, which made the tour cumbersome. The guards also objected if you wandered to far from your designated group. We arrived early so got to see some rooms in relative privacy, but after noon the place filled up and especially in the Da Vinci and Rembrandt Rooms were stuffed with people.Set your expectation that you will not see it all (that would take years) and enjoy what you do see."

Our tour guide said if we looked at everything for a minute each, it would take over 15 years to see all possible exhibits. Being able to see art displayed on massive palace walls was incredible. The room that has walls entirely full of portraits of military leaders really left an impression on me. The silver room of the Winter Palace was quite striking. There is so much detailing on the walls, the floors and the ceilings in almost every room; it was sometimes more beautiful than the art displays.I highly recommend getting a tour that will come before the museum is open to the public, especially if you're looking to see popular things like the Rembrandts. The crowds are massive, but there is air conditioning here and there. Having a knowledgeable tour guide just makes the experience richer, we got so many details about Russian history that were never taught in my schools. The peacock clock alone is worth a visit here."

Being from the United States, we have \"The Hermitage\", which is our seventh president Andrew Jackson's home and plantation in Nashville, Tennessee. It is a nice thing to see. I was never sure that I would make it to Russia to see \"The Hermitage\", but in fact, I did make it there, and can say if you do have the opportunity to go to Russia, you must go to see \"The Hermitage\". The art is the essence of this simply beautiful place, but what I did not expect to see and to fully enjoy was the architecture and the details of this magnificent structure. Every where you look, besides the art is the art and design of unbelievable quality and craftsmanship in this home for some of the world's most greatest pieces of work by gifted and talented artists. To be able to catch a glimpse, even for those short moments, and to be able to capture that for yourself, well, that is what travel is all about. Take the opportunity to enrich your life by a visit, and you will have your own memories to take home with you. It was all like a wonderful dream as I write this, but yes it was for real."

The local guides are very proficient in getting small groups to the items of interest quickly and spotting gaps between groups to get us up close to allow photographs. I did find the hermitage crowded, and overwhelming with so much to take in even the architecture and decor was stunning. I am of the opinion that the crowds were part of the experience as I do feel that it is unlikely to be less crowded at any given time. It is simply not somewhere you can go for an individual wander on your own, there is not a lot of information on any of the items, so a local guide is essential."

The Hermitage is open till 9pm on a Wednesday. It was a different story altogether. Only took a few minutes to buy a ticket. The crowds had disappeared & I spent the next few hours viewing masterpiece after masterpiece. Often I was the only one in front. The previous day I could barely see Rembrandt's Prodigal Son because of the crowds. I had it to myself for a few minutes on Wednesday night. The absolute highlight of the visit was seeing the Peacock Clock in operation. It is wound once a week at 7pm on a Wednesday night. Again there was only a small group there. Don't miss the the Impressionist Collection in the building opposite the main museum. Superb collection. My tip would be to go to the Impressionist museum in the morning. Buy a ticket ticket that covers both museums. Que to buy tickets is much smaller there. See the Impressionist exhibition. Have a lunch break then go over to the main gallery later in the afternoon.

We spoke with a lady that had been picked as she had neglected to zip her purse for a moment. The thieves are good at taking from \" easy prey\", you can avoid the hassle of police reports, etc. leave your backpacks or check them as they are not allowed. No flash photography ever. I chose to take my small compact camera and was glad I did as my large digital with zoom lenses would have been cumbersome with the crowds."

The art is sectioned into rooms of Dutch, French, Russian, etc, etc and are well laid out.The room layout is a bit confusing but each room is numbered so you get to understand the guide map soon enough.All in all well worth the visit... and I want to go again... it'll take a full day to get around everything (which I didn't have last time)."

When it was housed in her palace, that was icing on the cake because the palace is an masterpiece of art in itself.The Hermitage's art collection is formidable, and extensive. I don't know if I found it to be on par with the Lorvre or National Gallery of Art because it seemed to be so eclectic and didn't seem to hold together. Certainly, there were many wonderful pieces, but there were also many just so-so pieces as well. But, when taken together with the palace in which they are located, then the museum as a whole takes on an entirely new persona. With the building included, this is one of the world's greats.This museum is a must see."

However, the museum is a well worth a visit but you need a few days to walk around the opulence and take it all in. A lift is available as stairs are in abundance but not much good if you are in a wheelchair. The coach also takes you to a souvenir shop of their choice.

If you go in a group, ask that the group go early (very early - just as the place opens) - because then you will be able to move around without so many additional tourists. If you go on your own, be there when they open for individuals. I suggest that you study the floor plan and exhibition sections before the time and decide what is your interest.

Despite not being knowledgable about art, I really enjoyed making my way through the museum and looking at the wide range of artworks on display. What I was even more intrigued by was the grandeur of the palace/museum. Every time my tour group entered a new room, a collection of \"ooh\"s and \"ahh\"s ensued. This is a must see for everybody who visits St. Petersburg! Some tips: It can become very hot and stuffy inside, so make sure you wear layers. They do not allow bottled water/drinks into the museum. Photography is allowed without flash. Someone in our group was pick pocketed in the Hermitage, despite only being inside during public hours for 1/2 hour.

The collection of this museum can easily take on Louvre or the British Museum. Not to mention, that since it was originally a palace (and several other estates of great Russian nobles), you can not only enjoy the art collection, but take a tour back into the history and walk the halls just as russian emperors once did. Totally worth a visit! Tip: since it is such a titan of a tourist attraction, it is crowded AT ALL TIMES. Another tip: the museum is close to several other major attractions (as in: the biggest Cathedral in St Petersburg and Kunstkamera- the very first museum in Russia / not for the faint of heart)."

The entrance prices are not cheap but the upkeep does not reveal investment.

My wife and I had a personal guide so we did not wait at all since there were only 2 of us, the other guided groups had to wait their turn since there were so many of them, still they got in faster than those queuing for tickets. The Automatic ticket machines also had a large queue, at least in the morning. I thoroughly recommend purchasing tickets on-line and if for some reason you can't here's a tip: the tickets include the \"General Staff\" Building across the square there is a ticket office there too check if that has a queue at all, if you arrive from the Nievsky Propect Street, you pass under that building first anyway. Unless you are an art academic with previous knowledge about this complex, I suggest you get yourself a good guide, you need one to appreciate all the architecture, the interior architecture, the interior decoration and just to know where you are.Do not miss the display at the \"General Staff\" building - basically a chronological history of Russian art.To appreciate all the art there you will need a week! We spent 3 hours with our guide at the Hermitage Museum and Winter Palace, then went over to the \"General Staff\" building (keep your ticket, this is a separate entrance), after a short coffee break at Shokoladenitza on the corner of Nievsky prospect, for another 90 minutes. We still felt we haven't seen it all. We chose a Wednesday visit, entered at 15:00, left the Hermitage at 18:00, entered the \"General Staff\" building around 18:45 and left at 20:15, possible only on Wednesdays when the complex stays open till 21:00"

Housing one of the largest and most impressive art collections in the world, it showcases major works by major artists such as Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Raphael, Rembrandt and more. One of the guides said the collection is so large that only 20% can be displayed. Another said if you spent only ten seconds looking at each painting or sculpture, it would take years to see it all.As overwhelming (and crowded) as this sensory overload can be, it is well worthwhile visiting even if you only have a few hours to spend there."

The gilding alone is worth the visit, and it is a pure demonstration of why the starving populace of Russia rose up in revolt. It is hard to contemplate the splendor, the riches, the elaborate workmanship without actually seeing it. And there is no possibility of seeing it all. In one guide book I read that it would take 11 years to actually look at everything that there is on display. So go! That said, at the peak of tourist season it is a huge crush. Go early, book online. But.... Coming armed with a print out of your purchase does not get you in. You still have to stand in line. A shorter line, but a line nevertheless. There was only one woman working this booth! It took us 45 minutes to exchange our online purchase into an official ticket. There are no signs to tell you which line is the right one only a few women asking to see the printed proof of pre purchase. Without that, there was a line that looked be a two hour wait. And once we had a ticket we still had to stand in a security line, and then getting in we were ushered into a back entrance and so the sequence of our visit was incomprehensible. And if you want to see the jewels - that is a whole different ticket, new lines and one has to do a guided tour. If you go with a group, you still won't be able to avoid the crush, but you can skip the lines. Really my best recommendation is go early and be the first in line."

Follow the advice of the seasoned travelers - get tickets on the internet (note - the 2 day tickets are for 2 consecutive days - if possible - go for Tuesday and Wednesday - the Museum stays open late on Wednesday - and the crowds go home.)Tour groups flood - FLOOD - the museum in the morning - it's horrid. So plan to do the less visited first floor in the AM - maybe a Gold or Diamond room tour - then head up for the headliners after the tour groups have gone home for lunch! You really don't want to try to see the Peacock Clock, say, over the heads of 300 people do you?Also - your ticket from the internet will include the Impressionist and 'Under the Eagle' collection at the brand newly renovated Staff building - and the renovation is an absolute must see. Glass walkways 2 floors above the heads of other tourists. Seriously.Cafeteria in the Staff building was inexpensive, and relatively good food. Avoid the food in the Hermitage proper at all costs. It's positively the worst ever. Pack in - which is fine - but be aware they won't let in back-packs. Plastic bags are fine however.You must see this museum - just plan your visit in reverse - important stuff last - after 2:00 PM - and you'll have time to stare and contemplate and enjoy."

The building itself was a residence of Romanov royal family for several centuries. The exhibition is divided into several time periods - and you can see a lot of portraits of Russian famous people, and historical paintings, and the evolution of Russian arts in the period of Romanov dynasty. All the building is the masterpiece of luxury and arts. if you are really interested in painting technique you will be without any option excited by the exhibition. But it is not only art itself but a part of a great period of history of growing empire. Good guide can really make some sort of time travelling adventure for you, as you will see the living palace and a people, most of them are on the paintings in exhibition crowded the halls, waiting for emperor and his family, talking e.t.c.This part of history was tragically ended, but it shadow cover some people in Russia nowadays as they wish Empire to be reborn. Though there are two groups wishing Royal Empire and Soviet Empire. This museum will give a foreigner more understanding of light and dark in Russian history and maybe more about the country and people types. Anyway it is a great experience. And it must not be missed. Have a good time1"

You can buy tickets for both buildings at either location. I recommend the English guided tour for the impressionist wing as place is vast and collections are moved all the time at the moment. As this is very new arrangement, apparently they are still trying to find best way to make space work. Everybody very helpful, but their English is often very basic so do your research in advance and know what/ who you want to see.

Due to limited time in St.petersburg and other things to see, we only visited the amazing Winter Palace and its State Rooms. I am far more interested in architecture and how people lived than art, The Winter Palace from its frontage on the Neva river makes a statement in its gren colour to impress. The opulence and extravagence of it all, certainly must have stunned visitors; either court or ambassadorial. From the vast winding staircase things just get more impressive - gilt and marble and massive chandeliers. The sizes and dimensions of the rooms are awe inspiring. Two thrones; a superb 1812 Gallery with portaits of Russian military heroes, Malachite room and the magnificent Alexander Hall to name a few.. The private church is stunning. I have never seen a palace to match this one in pomp;but like the vast majority of St. Peterburg looking to the west of europe and forgetting real Russian style and tradition. Before or afterwards try to see the slightly strange but absorbing Russian film on DVd \" Russian Ark\" and you can put togehter inyou mind how stunning the place was when it was used; for instance as the first ball of the Season in the Nicholos Hall.Take your time and stroll taking it all in."

Only from the side were they visible enough.I had problem the information system (if any) as well, since they do not tell (or show) they have a large collection of Manet, Monet, Kandinsky, Sisley, etc., but in another building! You won't see it unless you ask - and show something to them, because unless you speak Russian, they won't know.

You can find most things easily, good and informative. But what could help you the Hermitage app, on your phone, we don't get lost, not like in the Louvre. There is some collection that has been moved to other building (General Stuff Building). The staff - except in the information desk - doesn't speak English, so they just show you it's closed. It's a good strategy, if you show them what you looking for. That's how we could look ie. French impressionists and other exhibition. To get in the museum is quite and unecessary difficult (for exemple they close one entrance, but they don't close it and after you walk there they just say and show it's closed so you can walk back and find the other entrance). The museum shop - like many in St Petersburg and Moscow) in the museum, you have to have ticket to go there. In the General Stuff Building there's no museum shop, so if you have one day ticket, you use the museum shop in the Hermitage. The enter into the museum is quiet chaotic, they could learn a lot from the Louvre.The collection is amazing, the State Rooms are wonderful, and after 1-2 pm there is no huge crowd (except the main highlights ie. peacock clock) If you want to see the peacock clock while it moves, you have to be at least 5 minutes early and wait 5 minutes after hour. It is not automatic, so it's depend when the staff starts it. We missed it, first it was 5 minutes after hour, and second time it was over few minutes before the next hour."

The building itself is a masterpiece. I suggest choosing your highlights and zoning in if you have limited time. This is like the Louvre. It needs 3 days (the galleries are over 20km I'm told). This place is very very crowded so I went with a prepaid prebooked tour group, having only one afternoon for it. I maintain this was a smart idea. Beware pickpockets.

Expect massive overcrowdedness, and imagine admiring the Old Masters behind five rolls of tourists. I made such a visit years ago and came away quite disappointed. I visited the museum again this June and came away with a very different experience. I was on an excursion organized by Princess Cruise. We were allowed into the museum one and half hour before the usual opening hours, ie, well before the other visitors. We formed into small groups of about 25 and led through the rooms by the local guide. During most of the time, the small group of 25 was the only people in each room, allowing much space and time to appreciate the decor, and the artwork, and to take photos. Jewelry lovers would certainly love the exhibits in the Gold Room. I am sure we had not visited all the rooms and the entrance fees must be higher. Yet, the extra costs are certainly worth it.

No way can you take the time to truly look at and appreciate the beauty in just a few hours. This is a place that you need to visit several times for at least 3 hours per visit in order to really look at and savor all the beauty offered to you. The artwork includes paintings, sculptures, tapestries, glass, jewelry and many other items. It is very crowded so it makes it difficult to get close viewing at times. Also, pickpockets love the crowds so beware. It is not air conditioned and with so many people, it gets extremely warm so dress comfortably."

The items on display are priceless royal treasures from Tsarist times and confiscations following 1917 revolution. Far too ambitious to think you can see the total collection even in a full day. Half a day allows for visiting rooms with the best known exhibits though you will have to be patient. Exhibits such as the Golden Peacock Clock are continually surrounded by tour groups all babbling but it is possible to get good views if patient. Take time to admire the ceilings, chandelliers and marquetry floors. If you are lucky, you may even spot some of the 50 cats that reside at the Hermitage. Catherine introduced cats to keep the rodent population under control so that rodents did not destroy her treasured collections. There have been cats there ever since.

We spent 10 hours there over 2 days and were bowled over by the beauty of the rooms and the breadth of the available artworks. Our only problem was caused by the fact that we had planned our trip based on their website information which was out-of-date. We found that the modern art which was supposed to be on the 3rd floor had been moved to another building or was not on view due to renovations. This meant re-planning our trip where we were inevitably tight for time and also purchasing additional tickets to enter the venues where the art was now on view. The newly accessible General staff building has been imaginatively modernised but its modern art collections, which have been extracted partly from the Hermitage, are poorly distributed and badly signposted entailing lots of walking along endless corridors. More of the Hermitage's modern art now appears to have been moved to the Russian museum which is a distance away from the Hermitage. This is not obvious from the Hermitage website."

Everywhere you look there is gold leaf and amazing furniture.The guide then took us to highlights of 3 of the major art collections and rooms of the small Hermitage to show the difference between the generations. Excellent commentary.The next day we returned to do the Golden rooms - this has to be specially booked and has timed entry. This is a must see. Ancient gold jewellery finds, collection of incredible Chinese gold hair combs presented to royalty, diplomatic gifts of amazing wealth and craftsmanship. Bejewelled swords , crowns, jewellery, horse rugs embroidered with 115000 diamonds !Even my husband was amazed at what was in these 2 small rooms. Same guide took us to the mummy rooms and a couple of other interesting exhibits while waiting for entry which were different from the previous tour.These 2 tours barely scratched the surface but if you have limited time take a tour that shows a range of collections otherwise it would be easy to be bogged into a limited collection due to the crowds.Suggest use a guide familiar with the museum so that you do get variety and if you have a personal guide research what you want to see before you go and they will be able to move you more quickly around the museum - this was obvious with both our guides that they knew shortcuts and ways around the traffic jams"

This building is magnificent and every room is amazing in decor. We settled in quickly despite how busy it was and just took it all in . Make sure your SD card for your camera has enough memory because you just want to take photo after photo, like I said every room is different and has its own marvels. The Russians are very proud of there museum treasures and you will see why when you visit . We are looking to go again ."

Also missing are a really good guidebook and map, and the two apps you can download failed to do so, both whilst in the building and on trying several times that evening in the hotel. Signage is poor, in both Russian and English, with exhibit description more interested in whose collection the price was acquired from than its actual provenance. Disappointing. Advice: Make sure you book tickets online before you go - queues are hundreds deep, but with my internet-bought ticket and a copy of my passport, I walked straight in. Also, ignore the main cloakroom downstairs which is hard to access due to the sheer numbers of visitors. Use the 'small' cloakroom up the stairs just before this, signposted for school groups: completely empty (and free)!"

The Winter Palace as you'd expect was mobbed by tour parties, not least around the Da Vincis. So it's a fantastic but wearing experience. But our decision to persevere by checking out the more modern collections away from the building proved inspired. It may be because we went at lunchtime but it was virtually like a private viewing. Using the very same tickets we were able to view Monet after Monet, Degas after Degas Cezanne after Cezanne, Van Gogh after Van Gogh... You get the picture. Unbelievable.

Our local guide took us on a fairly fast tour of the museum since we had other things to see in the city as well. Unfortunately this museum is so vast you would really need a week to see everything. First the positives. The museum itself is gorgeous. You used to be a palace so the rooms are beautiful and well laid out. The artwork presented is an unbelievable collection. 2 of Leonardo de Vinci's 7 existing paintings are housed here. Rafael, Rembrandt, you name it, it's there! The museum is laid out pretty well as far as finding your way around and there is a safe coat and bag check area, restrooms, and a very nice souvenir shop.Now the negatives and why I rate this 4 stars instead of 5. The crowds are utterly horrible. I realize it's summer and prime tourist season but the museum needs to control it alittle better. The lines to get tickets and to get into the main entrance are awful. And once in, there are several small doorways that are used for entrance and exit and pushing and throwing of elbows was common to see. Unfortunately this made the experience very exhausting. It makes me want to go back in the winter time when there are no crowds (or so our guide told us) and see the museum again."

Visit with a guide, if possible to get the full history of the place. We were lucky to manage to get tickets for a performance of Swan Lake in the Tsars theatre in the evening"

Tips for avoiding the queues and getting into the museum.1: go on a week day, aim to get there for 10am to purchase ticket not from the ticket office but from the self service machines that take cash or card. There were no queues at this time of the day then you can go into the shorter queue for paid for tickets on right hand side and wait till 10:30 when the doors open. Note if you have kids then the machines don't have the ability to give you a \"free\" ticket, once in we beat the people needing to buy tickets and asked nicely for a child's free ticket.2: you could buy them online but they are more expensive and there were no queues at the self service machines.3: no rucksacks, plastic bags, coats (although some people did have coats on) or bottles of water are allowed in the museum either take a small bag or buggy (if have kids as we had) and load with snacks, get lunch outside once finished. 3: buy bottle of water in cafe before going around.4: we followed lonely planet guided walk which took us 3.5hrs. Took us to the best rooms. Just have to elbow your way past the tour groups and keep track by looking at the room numbers above the doorways.5: there are plenty of WCs lonely planet and map next to the ticket office show them throughout and further around the museum there are no queues."

After about an hour we decided to leave the main Hermitage museum and cross the square to the separateHermitage building housing the French impressionists (separate admission fee). That was truly excellent with the largest collection of impressionist we have ever seen with a separate room for each of the main French impressionists. It was not crowded and I would highly recommend it even if you don't want to face the mobs at the main Hermitage. That evening we also saw a beautiful ballet at the Hermitage Theater. It is a small intimate theater so you are very close to the dancers. There are no reserved seats so I recommend getting there about 45 minutes early to get a good seat, first come first served."

I would recommend covering those pieces that are most renowned, like Michaelangelo's crouching boy, Da Vinci's paintings, the Grand Stair Case, the peacock clock!!!!

The day that I visited with friends in May there was a huge line outside: there must have been hundreds of people waiting and I have no idea how long people stood in the queue. Secondly if you are an English speaker I would advise that you get an audio guide - these are not expensive and really give you a lot more information about the museum. The alternative (if you don't have a detailed guide book) is to rely on the few English language signs which you find inside. Please note that you need to leave some kind of ID with the vendor of the audio guides, to then be picked up when you return the audio guides. Alternatively you can leave a cash deposit in place of ID. Lastly, you have to put any coats and bags (even handbags) into lockers before entering the museum's galleries. Make sure you have cash for this."

There are so many paintings, if you stopped to look at each one for 1 minute it would take you nine years to see every one. When Hitler approached the city which he later sieged for 900 days, half the paintings were crated and shipped to Siberia, the other half hidden in the cellars.

The sheer quantity is mind boggling! We went in May so not over-crowded but even so, we were glad to have a guide and pre-booked tickets. Queues were very long."

It was a thrill on every level--art, architecture, design, history and sheer size. The place is huge! There is no way to do justice to this museum on a cruise ship visit! We had a \"special pass\" on Holland America to let us visit the key galleries prior to the huge crowds (which are there EVERY day); therefore, we were able to see far more than most people will see in a day, but we still just scratched the surface! The ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian collections are nice, but there are better ones in other parts of the world--use the time for the more significant collections.The building is beautiful--inside and outside. The rooms are jaw dropping! Spoiler alert! We were not aware that the Impression art collection has been moved to a different building in the Hermitage collection of buildings--with it's own entry fee and line at the ticket booth. It was a shame (it had been high on our list) that we did not get to see it, but we can wait for a future trip. That may be far easier said than done! The visa situation and the logistics of getting around can be very challenging. The visa is very expensive, but you do not need one if you are on officially sanctioned tours and are staying on the cruise ship. Not everyone will feel comfortable trying to navigate the city on your own. Do your research on this issue and what you want to see--there is so much to see that you need days/weeks! There are some areas of the city that are best described as \"rough.\""

May 9 celebrated 70 years since the downfall of the Nazis, so three cruise ships (Celebrity Solstice and Aida) all had to go to the hermitage on the 8th. At 9:30, the early entry time for tour groups, the independent queue was already a mile long and we had to push past them. Large bags and wet anoraks are verboten, so roll up the wet stuff as the two cloak rooms for 5,000 people have another long queue. Hesitating at the cloak room meant we lost our tour group but caught up with them later by joining and contacting another Alla rep. with mobile phone. If you spend only one minute per painting you need ten years to see it all, so the pace is brisk; the toilets are down a long stairway, so if you are mobility-challenged you have a problem. Why see it ASAP? Sometimes six cruisers are in town and if you wait until the Indian, Chinese and Brazilian middle classes have exploded, you will find the queues impossible to beat as it is a mad push already. 50 Rubels/US$ and the toilets cost 30 Rubels, have them on you for the two-day excursion as your guide may not have any. The attendant may take your Dollar? There is no ticketing system like at Sans Souci (Potsdam), where a quota is enforced inside by giving you a ticket, which also has the entry time printed to stop flooding. Booking with Alla meant not having to pay AUS$120 each for the Russian visum, being picked up at the pier after immigration, seeing all the worthwhile sites in and around St Petersburg for two days in a small bus and getting a guide with excellent English, ear phones and two meals, one in a stolle pie shop and one in a restaurant. And there is a choice of a Comfort Tour, which we wrinklies took, there is also a more demanding Grand Tour."

Think that they should set aside special days for schoolchildren also so that they have a better educational experience. But, they really need to pace the groups going in (like some other museums) so that there is not so much madness and perhaps people will act a little less rude to one another trying to push through everything and get closer views."

The Treasure Gallery may be seen only on guided tour - tickets purchased at the museum ticket office - and has a fascinating display of golden artifacts found in the Caucus dating back to the 6th Century BC. There is also a dazzling array of jeweled artifacts belonging to Russian royalty. The French Impressionists have been moved into the newly renovated General Staff Building on the opposite side of the square from the Winter Palace.

If you go in by ferry from Helsinki and stay less than 72 hours (and buy a $25 per person transfer package from the ferry line) you don't need a $250 per person visa. To put this in perspective, our ferry transportation, stateroom, meals and drinks for the round trip cost only $440 for both of us (i.e. less than the cost of two visas). The toughest part was figuring out how to use the Russian St Petersline ferry website but it was well worth the learning curve. I had previously tried to book the ferry tickets through two different U.S. agents for the ferry company but they were heavily marking up the trip. Also, we stayed at the upscale Kempinksi Moika 22 hotel on the two days between ferry rides and, due to a pre-paying discount and a favorable exchange rate at the time of booking, it was less than $200 per night. Since the hotel is less than 1,000 feet from the Hermitage it is a great location!Prior to getting to SP I arranged for a private tour guide and driver through Stan Jacox (an American ex-pat) http://www.tickets-and-tours.com/. The total cost for two days, with admission tickets was 440 Euros (also substantially less than quoted by the US travel agents). Also, by using a guide we avoided lines at several locations. I highly recommned Stan's service. He met us upon arrival and again at the end of our tour and was very helpful."

There are 4 of them, in Russian and English, and no queue. If booking via internet you have to go to a booth to get tickets and there is a waiting line, similarly if you buy from ticket booth in the museum you could loose at least 30 minutes if not more. The ticket machine takes card or cash. Once you have the ticket, there is an express entry line so minimal waiting to get in. Make sure you pick up a museum map, in several languages, near information counter before you pass ticketed entry point - without one you will not have a clue where you are at. Room numbers are clearly numbered and staff will help you if lost. Another thing, there is no longer a charge to take photos or video. Cannot use flash and only several rooms do not allow photography. We arrived at opening time 10.30am on a Friday in May, entry was a breeze. Remember you must check in coats and backpacks at before entering ticketed area and no drinks are allowed to be carried in. Toilets are only on the ground floor (4 locations) so keep that in your planning. Do you need an audio guide, personal choice. We didn't and found enough English explanations to improve our knowledge. I overheard some of the tour guides who would have bored me to tears. There is a lot to see and everywhere the building interiors are stunning but don't miss the Palace Interiors section. Cafes (2) on ground floor meet basic needs but service may be slow at busy times. We needed 5 hours to cover 60-70% of the building, think 3 hours is the minimum time for 'highlights'. Everything here is grand, loved it and has my highest recommendation."

Marble everywhere as you would expect, artwork to suit every taste. It is hard on the first visit to just take everything in. Due to it's popularity, organized tours get entry ahead of those waiting in the entrance queue, so suggest that this is the way to go initially."

It is well worth the time to check out the official website and trip advisor posts BEFORE visiting to plan and make the most of your visit. The immensity of size and volume of works is daunting. If possible don't bring a back pack or coat/ jacket, this helps to avoid the cloakrooms which are very busy. A pre paid ticket from an official source is a big advantage as otherwise there is a big queue. Tickets are great value for money but single entry only.There are some rooms much more crowded than others due to the popularity of the works present - the second floor rooms 254 and 227 in particular as tour groups zoom around and can be pushy. A visit to those between 1 and 2pm is less crowded. Other areas are much less crowded and more enjoyable as a result. Staff told me winter time is very quiet and a good time to truly appreciate the exhibits. The impressionists are now located across the square in the General staff building. The layout is a bit confusing but was very uncrowded the morning we went increasing the enjoyment! Picasso and Matisse works were not on display at the time we were there which was a shame but c'est la vie! This is a visit even for those who do not particularly like art, the rooms are amazing, the selection of exhibits from ancient civilisation and there ate appartments are equally captivating.... Just go!The restaurant was busy, we didn't use this. There a 2 or 3 WC areas not just at the main door. Make use of the really good museum plan!"

Like many of the other reviews, we also found the museum to be a bit overwhelming but mainly because of the huge number of people that were there on a Friday. In every single room, we'd bump shoulders with many people so going from one room to another took forever. Once we got out of the winter palace, it became a lot less crowded so we were able to go thru the museum portion quite easily. We didn't spent too much time looking at each painting, more focusing on the architecture of each of the rooms which are all quite grand. Its tough to pick which hallway was my favorite since each hallway has so much detail, especially the columns in the various museum rooms or in the grand staircases of the winter palace. We also arrived late to the museum (2:30) so that may have contributed to the crowd and was also a reason for why we didn't spend too much time looking at the art. We did save some time by buying our ticket from the hotel (Hermitage Hotel) which was very helpful. We also didn't get an audio guide due to the time but we did notice that the first desks in the winter palace were out usually but if you went into the museum and up the staircase, there's another desk where you can more easily get one."

Well, both pieces of advice turned out to be very helpful indeed. I booked via the Hermitage website and booked a two-day ticket (these will be for two consecutive days, you won't be able to go one day and then again three days later). The other pieces of advice were: The cafe is terrible and expensive and also you won't be able to self-tour. The former was totally wrong, the cafe is brilliant and serves MANY different, delicious items of food at reasonable prices, the second was half right. We decided to buy a Lonely Planet guide to St Petersburg and their suggested half day tour was very easy to follow. And mostly, we just used the museum map and had no problem finding what we wanted. The buildings themselves are stunning and do take the time to walk around outside to admire them. On the first day we spent 4 hours on the 2nd floor (that's Russian and US 2nd floor, in the UK we'd call that the 1st floor), where all the beautiful Winter Palace state rooms are. In 4 hours we did NOT see the whole floor but we guided ourselves and we were very happy to do so with the Lonely Planet guide. On the second day we explored the first floor (UK ground floor) and again, we guided ourselves with a map without difficulty. We again spent 4 hours walking through just that one floor. In summation, you need TIME - if you had locked us in there for a week we would still have not managed to see everything. As to the exhibits, I don't really know whether I can describe adequately my feelings as we walked around. \"oooh\" and \"aaaaah\" upon entering almost every room, as not only the exhibits in the rooms, but the rooms themselves are art. Those ceilings, walls and floors could be in an exhibition all by themselves, never mind the near fantastical collection of every type of antique you can imagine in multitudes of versions: Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Japanese, European of all kinds, Russian Empire\u2026.jewellery, paintings, statues, holy relics, porcelain, furniture, clocks, tapestries, weapons, clothes, every precious metal and stone and whatever else comes to your mind. They have it there. And then some. Also a separate mention should be made about the prehistoric exhibition showing VERY ancient Siberian finds. Trust me, you will struggle to find a collection of such ancient yet stunningly preserved artefacts almost anywhere in the world. Practical information: If you have a pre booked ticket, you'll get in FAR QUICKER than queueing - the sheer volume of people will make you doubt your sanity. If possible, travel a little out of season and avoid weekend visits to the museum. The less people in the museum, the more you will enjoy it. In the summer months you will feel like a sardine, no kidding. There is a cloakroom for coats and large bags, which they will insist you use (as in most Russian attractions) and it is free and very convenient. Upon entry, buy a bottle of water in the cafe (they won't let you take any in and there is a security scanner for bags and people, no point trying to conceal any), it is well worth it as wandering the halls for hours is thirsty work. There are many toilets inside, you won't need to worry. And, if I did not already say it, you will need TIME. :) We loved every minute in there and could not recommend it more highly."

This surely has to be the most magnificent museum with the largest art collection in the world. The building is enormous and I'm sure you could visit every day for a month and only see a small part of it. We visited some of the more famous works of art including the famous peacock clock purchased by Catherine the Great in the late 1700's. It's an automaton featuring 3 beautiful birds - an owl a peacock and a rooster, all of which are guilded and enclosed in a huge glass case. Works from all the great artists through time are represented here both in artwork and sculptures. Some of the most incredible marble sculptures are here and also the worlds most famous paintings. The rooms themselves are truly magnificent. For most visitors to St. Petersburg only a short visit is possible - but make the effort and go as you will not regret it! Spend as much time as you can but a minimum of 2 hours so as you can see a small section.For those interested in seeing more of this building there is a movie called \"The Russian Ark\" - the only movie ever filmed in one take, which all takes place in the Hermitage with the actors all in 19th century costume. Filmed in 2002 it portrays historical figures from 200 years of Russian history."

Even though you have a full day pass, if you use an exit by mistake you can't get back in to collect your ccoat and bag. But to visit St. Petersburg without visiting the Hermitage and seeing this magnificent collection of art would be unthinkable for me. Their large outstanding exhibition of Impressionists can only be described in superlatives. I was aware of their ideosyncratic passion for beaucracy and their passion for bossing people around, but if you love magnificent art and the immense pleasure it gives, allow at least 2 days in the Hermitage, it is simply a fantastic place.

While November is not a high point in tourism in St. Petersburg, it was still very busy. We went in an hour before it closed - putting us on a tight time crunch for seeing this massive museum. It was nonetheless an experience that I was not to pass up, and a great way to defrost form the cold Russian air. However we had gone to the Dutch and German exhibit to see the massive paintings and portraits, which of course were very impressive. What impressed me the most about the Hermitage was the breathtaking architecture of the place, especially the ceilings. Worth a visit if you are in St. Petersburg - but I advise to take more time than just an hour!"

Personally, if you're not local, I think this is the only way to make the most of what the Hermitage has to offer and to fully appreciate the artwork on display. If you are able, book through an 'official' vendor as tourists are able to enter the museum earlier on certain mornings than 'regular' visitors. This is a bonus as the museum does get very busy and can be quite crowded in some areas despite its huge size.The paintings and sculptures are wonderful but so are the ceilings and the flooring! The level of detail on the ceilings left me gawping at regular intervals! The guided tour around the Gold Room is strictly in group order and, whilst fascinating, I'm not sure that I would spend the time I did in this one area with so much else to explore. Well worth a visit but do wear comfy shoes as there's a lot of walking involved."

Buy the adult tickets at the machines on the left of the courtyard (you need cash with notes no larger than 1000 roubles) then by pass the queue as ticket holders to enter the museum and get the free kids tickets at the ticket offices. If you want to join a tour or arrange a private tour you go first to the Excursion Office under the arch as you enter the courtyard and on the right hand side. You can only buy tickets at the machines or the ticket office for the same day. If you want to buy tickets ahead of today you have to buy them online (very annoyingly!). We decided to arrange our visit by one adult who wanted more time to see the museum going a day ahead alone. This meant that the second visit with the kids could be more efficient and speedy to accommodate their more limited interests and one person in the group could take everyone else around the main sights without getting lost! Well worth doing. It is also worth looking at the website online and seeing what is there and making note of the location of the main things you want to see and planning a route accordingly if time will be tight or interest of younger members of your group are limited. The Impressionists are now housed in the Geneal Staff building across the square and it might be best to go there first as we found no queue for tickets which included all the Hermitage for adults although we had to get the free kids ones again in the main building after we had finished in the General Staff Building. You can take small backpacks into the museum and thereby bring water and other items children may need. The cloakrooms work excellently for leaving things for free. Toilets Marem rather far and wide so best to make ur everyone goes before you leave the cloakrooms! Cafe services are adequate but not great."

I think I enjoyed wandering around, especially by the grand staircase, even more than seeing the exhibits. The atmosphere takes your breath away.Take advantage of special exhibits and the restricted rooms - an extra fee - if available. You won't be disappointed.One of the most orderly museums on the continent, once you get out of the entry hall. On the downside, security is very tight. There is an x-ray baggage check, and some prohibition on photos and even taking notes in restricted rooms. Some other English speaking folks got into an argument with a guard - and didn't win. The cafe food (only food available) is ordinary.Only a very, very small percentage of artifacts and art is actually displayed in the museum; most of it is stored away behind hidden doors. In that respect, this is a typical Russian machine that controls everything, including access.{ September 2012 visit - one of the highlights of my life! }"

It would be very useful to buy the audio guide or get a guided tour when inside. We used the audio guide and found it useful. As in most museums you have to check your coats and backpacks.

Walking along like a herd of cattle in a straight line, you can see the magnificent artwork in each of the rooms. However, venture too far off and your tour group or family will be washed away along with the people. Good luck finding them as this museum is massive. Be sure to keep little ones close by. Every room has a silent and stern faced looking Russian lady making sure no one touches anything. We accidentally (on purpose) touched the curtains to look out the window and a silent alarm rang. The stern faced lady still didn't say anything but we knew we should quickly move along. If you go with a tour group you won't have much time as they do herd you along. I recommend going on your own so you can take your time. If you have kids (depending on their ages) let them wander and set a time and place to return. This way everyone gets a chance to see and read whatever they want. Do some pre-reading and you'll really appreciate all the beautiful art inside this museum."

It is necessary to include in the museum visit masterpieces such as \"Benois Madonna\" by Leonardo da Vinci, \"Judith\" by Giorgione, \"St. Sebastian\" by Titian, \"Lute Player\" by Caravaggio, \"The Return of the Prodigal Son\" by Rembrandt, \"Lady in Blue\" by Gainsborough.

Plenty of English signs, too, in these rooms. Try and follow the map closely to make sure you see each of the rooms in this wing of the palace.A map is your best friend in this place. It's worth sitting down the night before and ticking off a few of your must-sees - for me, Rembrandt's 'Old Man in Red' was a real highlight, but overlooked in the short map/guide provided by the museum. Students get in free, but I would have happily paid the full adult fee to see this fantastic palace. The extra photography fee is also well-worth it - some reviewers have complained about poor lighting, but on a clear and fantastically sunny day in March, we had no problem with glare on the paintings.Top tips: Don't bother bringing in bottles of water - these were taken away at the security entrance. Water, soft drinks, snacks and a small selection of sandwiches are available in the cafe, and we were also able to bring in our own food.The impressionist and post-impressionist works are no longer on show here as of December, although the Picassos are still housed on the top floor. Had we known this before our visit, we would have planned a trip to the gallery in which they are now housed too, but even this couldn't detract from a very special day."

First of all you have to pay for every single compartment in the museum separately, and the sum of 1400 rubles is not cheap by Russian standards. The gallery section is certainly rich, but anywhere near the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, and certainly does not compare to other world class museums like Louvre, Riksmuseum or Prado. A compartment of the museum you pay for without knowing what it is, only because you are mislead by the grand name of Hermitage. This section is called the \"staff building\"... don't bother paying to see it as it is virtually empty. The famous Diamond Room and Gold Room are the worst disappointments. You pay separately to see any one of them, then you find out you cannot stroll around a look at your leisure... you are driven around in timed groups with a guide who explains only certain pieces of the exhibits, the whole tour takes 40 minutes max, then you are chased out of the room by the guards once the guide is finished. you are not allowed to stand and look at anything on your own!!the worst surprise was when I doscovered that the famous collection of the Tzar's Faberge Easter Eggs if not in Hermitage.. actually not in St. Petersburg altogether!!

You will find lengthy queues anytime. We were there on a weekday in February (winter) and the queue was still long. If you buy your tickets online you get to skirt the crowd for a fast-track entry - saved us half hour easy.The museum is huge and actually comprises six buildings all relatively close together on the Nevsky River embankment. The main building is the Winter Palace. As a former palace, it has many rooms and is perfect for use as a museum. The building is well-maintained and the palace rooms themselves are worth the visit. The museum hosts an extensive array of antiquities, including a great Eqyptian display. There is also a fantastic amount of artwork, with a nice display for the impressionist fans out there, including Renoir, Pissarro and Sisley. There's also plenty of Russian works to admire.This museum deserves it's place as one of the world's big four museums, amongst the Louvre, British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum in New York.Don't worry about a guide unless you really want in depth history of a smaller number of pieces. Displays are well-labelled and there is just so much to see a guide might inform you, but will slow you down as well. Be prepared for a long day or multiple visits.Visited February 2013."

It was made in the Hermitage Palace in one day - showing the palace history. In one scene you see Peter, then Catherine, then a ball, etc. Try and catch it.I loved the entrance staircase (Jordan) and the 80 meter long straight one. The room containing paintings and the malachite huge urns is probably the best in the palace.But my favorite room was the Concert Hall, with it crystal chandeliers, that wonderful parquetry floor and with those statues surrounding the room about 5 metres off the ground. Quite different.I have never been a lover of Modern Art,' paintings, but on the 2nd floor overlooking the Square there are several rooms full of them. Their vibrant color just blew me away.Brian, from Perth. W. Australia."

I have read bad reviews about queues and weather.. I went on a March Wednesday in the morning and did not queue much at all.I had planned to spend a full day inside but even then did not think I'd go through it without toilet breaks! I had a quick lunch at a cafe. The toilets are not lcated around the museum so you would need to make your way to the entrance (this is also the case with the Russian Museum). The Hermitage is not always the easiest to navigate (the path in the Prado in Madrid, while may not have been as big, seemed to effortlessly guide the visitor through the galleries all the way to the exit!). I did both the special guided tours of the Diamond and Gold room. Personally I enjoyed the Diamond to much more as it covers most of the things in the gold plus more. The gold room is a shorter tour and suits lovers of Persian/Asian relics as it contains diplomatic gifts from Iran etc. You need to purchase photography passes separately and even then some galleries so not allow photography. There is no photography in the diamond and gold rooms at all.The gift shops inside the Hermitage are a bit lacklustre. Given the attraction it is, they could really do something more with that offering/revenue stream."

In the public mind, the the image of the Winter Palace (now a part of the Hermitage complex) is indelibly linked with the tragic fate of the last Tsar of Imperial Russia. In the Soviet era, it also became an icon of the Revolution, first through an Eisenstein film. The Hermitage possibly displays less than 10% of its treasures, and although that is richer than most museums, what lies hidden gives rise to mysteries and conspiracy theories, all of which adds to the abiding charm of the Hermitage.You will hear whispers that if all their paintings are displayed, it will be by far the richest in the world -- Dutch and Flemish baroque masters, Italian Renaissance, Impressionists...Even some of the rooms themselves, especially the Malachite Room, Throne Room and Guard Room are visual treats. The Malachite Room has an added charm of transience, because of just that hint that it may be decaying. Overall, the impression is that of grand, decadent opulence of a bygone era.Perhaps its history is intertwined with the host city, whose name changed from St Petersburg to Petrograd to Leningrad back to the original."

It is a Baroque masterpiece and highly worth seeing just for the stunning arched ceilings. The audio tour, though expensive, is worthwhile for its explanations of many of the most interesting rooms. However, the Hermitage also has an app with good information. You have to pay extra in the app for certain audio segments, however. High points include the Rafael Loggias and the Pavilion Room. Come early, even in the off-season, and buy tickets ahead of time. Otherwise, you will wait in a mammoth line to get in the front door."

I found myself staring up at the ceilings and admiring the staircases more than anything. It was nice to see famous paintings by old masters close up & see the quality. We arrived early Saturday afternoon in February and went straight to the ticket machine for foreign visitors. \u00a34 each plus a bit extra to take photos, what value. We then joined a queue and got shouted at by a Russian gentleman, (get used to that), who was pointing out that they were Russians queuing for their cheaper tickets and we could go straight in. You are then ordered to the cloakrooms to put your coats in. Even this is impressive with room for about 5000. You pick an archway, a lady whisks your coat away and gives you a token. They work so hard. Next through a bit of security, show your ticket and you're in."

No other toilet during the 4.5 hour walking tour. Also the museum is TOO hot in the summer. We did not pay the fee to take pictures but even if we did it would be impossible as there was so many people and the group was moving too fast to manage to see the Hermitage in 4.5 hours.

The old masters, Faberge, Dutch, Spanish, French, modern art, sculpture...it has it all. I highly recommend a visit to the Hermitage, but be prepared to be overwhelmed!

You have to purchase a separate ticket to any of those two collection rooms.

When I traveled in mid-Sept. I did not wait 10 minutes to buy my ticket, and then the museum was only a bit more crowded than I liked. One problems with any museum is trying to see everything, now that you are there. Not a bad idea to research what they have and compare it to what you really want to see, and even then your list will still be overly ambitious. Also this museum is tricky to navigate, the numbers are not sequential, many rooms and areas and passageways are closed. The palace itself is beautiful and worth appreciating on its own and when I visited, the temporary exhibition was a lot of incredible costumes from the 19th cen.for skinny women who wore size 2 shoes.When I tried to buy a ticket for the Gold Room ( actually refers to the Mongols, or Golden Horde ) I was told that the last English tour had already departed and I could not join a tour in another language. I objected loudly and demanded to speak with someone in charge, who told me the same thing. I continued to object, until, surprise, surprise, she relented ( not good naturedly) and told the ticket seller to sell me the ticket. She told me to hurry, as a group had just departed. I did hurry, but could not find the group, and so had to tour the Golden Horde exhibition all on my own with no crowds, no blah blah talking from a guide, and no rushing. How lucky can you get?"

The other big attraction is the peacock clock, which is an automaton which crows on the hour every hour, and is spectacular to behold.What is most breath-taking about the museum, however, is its HUGE art collection, including a large collection of Van Dyke pieces.In my opinion, this is simply the best museum in the world, but do put aside a day to get around it all, as there's so much to see and do.

We visited the State Hermitage Museum twice on our trip to St Petersburg.As we were there during the Russian January holidays (1 - 10 January) there were long queues in front of the building. But don't just join the queue. Go through the gates to the courtyard of the building. Here you will find ticket machines (on the left and right side) to buy your entrance tickets (400 rubble per person and 200 rubble for making pictures. The machine also gives change). With these tickets you can walk up straight to the front door. The people in the queue are waiting to get inside and buy a ticket at the counter of the museum.The first Thursday of every month is a free entrance day. The queues are long. The museum opens at 10.30 am.please note that there are 2 queues - one on the left side and one on the right side. For some reason, most people choose the left one, but the one on the right is much shorter. Go there!The museum itself is fantastic! I can't describe the beauty and grandness of the rooms. The art is from all over the world, from Da Vinci to Rembrandt, from statues to Egyptian mummies. You need to visit this museum once in your life!"

Our tour for 4 people was excellent. Since our tickets were purchased days earlier, we were able to enter the Hermitage before other tours and the general public. The early entry provided us with a less crowded and less hurried view of the palace. We were consistently ahead of the large tour groups traveling en masse allowing us to have a close-up and more personal visit. Visitors need to allow at least 3 hours to see everything. To ensure that you have a more pleasant experience, I highly recommend arranging for a small group tour that provides tickets and an early entry. A guide is invaluable. Standing in long lines to purchase tickets and wandering the Hermitage on your own might prove less interesting since you may not understand what you are seeing."

The Hermitage Museum offers to its visitors not only uncountable paintings, art and historical exhibits, but also the glamour of the buildings themselves - comprising of former palaces. We visited the museum on a Wednesday around lunch time and avoided big queues for tickets and in the cloakroom. We will surely visit again once in St Petersburg as the collections are so many its impossible to see everything in 1 or 2 visits."

In the main season I believe you can stand in line for two hours and then be packed into an overcrowded museum. We however had zero queue and there were maybe a couple of hundred visitors there with us. It's huge - think Louvre - and you can't possibly see everything in one day. Lots and lots of magnificent paintings, tapestries, and palace halls. After two hours I couldn't take any more in, buy a two-day ticket online!"

Either go to the machines in the courtyard to buy tickets or book on line and print out your voucher. Take this voucher to the small box office inside the gate and exchange for tickets. Then take the tickets and get in the tickets only queue. This could save you an hour in the cold! Get there before it opens, say 1/2 hour."

This year, to improve our chances, my wife who is Russian, bought Internet tickets so as to avoid the very lengthy queues (as it advises on its own website). You have to exchange the Internet tickets for 'real' tickets on the first floor of the museum. Seems straightforward enough but the 'officials' on the doors will not let you in; insisting that you queue with everyone else!! You pay a premium for the Internet tickets for absolutely no benefit. Now, as an Englishman, I am more than prepared to queue but not when a premium has been paid to avoid that privilege!!! Needless to say, I was not prepared to queue for at least 2 hours in temperatures below freezing. The museum really needs to get its act together regarding ticket sales and queues - very poor experience for three of our four attempts. Last year was great - took the English tour with our own guide but the brilliance of that experience has been totally wiped out by everything else we've been subjected to!!"

Not only one thing, but everything you see in the palace is so beautiful, nicely crafted and maintained in an awesome way. It even shows how much rich heritage of the russia is worth watching.

We didn't have a guide, but decided to buy an audio guide, which turned out to be of limited use.. There weren't all that many pictures we wanted to look at that had an audio guide symbol next to it, and in the area with all the made up palace rooms there wasn't any. We had a sort of tick box list of things we wanted to see, and we managed to find them all. The great thing is, unlike other big museums I've visited, there aren't huge crowds of people everywhere, and you can get really close to the exhibits. Loads of Picasso. Didn't see any Chagall though! There are also brilliant views from the museum over the river. A must see in St Petersburg."

First let me say I was not a normal visitor to the Hermitage- I was a guest of the museum in a program for art professionals for a two week program- so I was there daily for 2 weeks and saw more that I can remotely convey here.The main striking theme- The Royal Russians where the original \"shopaholics\" with a huge bank account and amazing taste.The building is a prime example of Russian Royal taste- a bit over the top- If you can, be waiting at the door when it opens- before the tour buses arrive and know if you go in summer it can get HOT- really HOT and a/c is uncommon (even in the museum- and the crowds can make this worse)While most visit on tour buses I was fortunate enough to spend full days inside the guts of the museum touring the backstock of the shopping sprees attending lecture classes held by world class curators. (Worth noting the worlds largest Rembrandt print collection resides here- most of it not on display- all the art and artifacts art like this).Normal tourist and guests alike will be dazzled by the amazing highlights Rembrandt's Return of the Prodigal Son, Matisse's Drummer Boy, Picasso's Absinthe Drinker - (note there are unpleasant acquisition stories on many of the works show- ie stolen from Russian Jews) - but the art remains and is worth the effort- all the effort it will take to see through the crowds-While I loved the museum I found the 'outside' experience a bit of extra work- Unless you stay and eat at expensive (for Russians prohibitive unless mobbed up) places- the quality of food for the average person is about as far from French or Italian as possible- lots of soup in the staff kitchens (The average wage of a curator is well under 20K a year- these people speak no less than 4 languages, often 7 or 8 and spend their lives dedicated to art). - and desserts which are perfect looking and empty of all flavor (really odd). Queuing at bodega for a few choices of food is common still- and outside cultural spots and places catering to tourist don't expect to always find English."

First, you are in the most beautiful palace (better than Versailles in my opinion). The art collections are amazing- they are edited and you don't see 50 million pieces of art/sculpture- you only see the best, maybe 40 pieces or so per collection (French Impressionist, Rodin etc). For me, the Louvre had too much- I just want to see the best. You can walk right up to anything- the paintings aren't roped off. The Peacock clock (animatron) was a favorite of Catherine the Great and is one of a kind. The octoganal exhibition glass displays of artifacts is very beautiful. The portraits (which in most museums are boring to me) were so beautiful- Christina Robertson was an amazing artist and the portraits are true works of art- I have never seen portraits like these. On my second trip, I booked a tour of the gold treasure room- it was beyond expectations. There are gold earings, jewelry, crowns etc from B.C. that look brand new and are so intricate there is a magnifying glass to see the detail. For me, I have never been very interested in objects that old but these artifacts are so amazing- in present day, I can't imagine how they would be created much less a couple of thousand years ago. I have traveled the world and the Hermitage is in my top 3 to see- I could go here every day and it overwhelms you with all the beauty and art. Same goes for the city of St.Petersburg- so beautiful. Buy your tickets online - it is closed one day a week and the lines can be long. Enjoy!"

We both enjoy fine art and have visited many of the fine art museums of the world, starting with The National Gallery in London, The Tate, The British Museum, The Prado, The Louvre, The Metropolitan, Boston Museum of Fine Art, The Van Gogh Museum, The Rijks, The D'Orsay, The Vatican and many, many others. We have great appreciation for art and art conservation. We enjoy historic architecture. We travel nationally and internationally primarily to view great art and history.This trip to The Hermitage should have been the apex of a year of planning. However, it is sadly rundown. You can tell that the monies that might have been available went for the Olympics, the Mariinsky Theatre II, and the war. Perhaps more money might be directed to the upkeep of this beautiful building and its amazing collection if more people wrote less fawning reviews and demanded the upkeep that this place deserves. It probably should be designated a UNESCO site in trouble. The Russian politicians will not direct any monies to this museum until they are shamed into it.As several people have noted, the blazing sun (especially on the Rembrandts) through ancient glass has oxidized most of these paintings. You can practically watch the colors changing into muddy brown before your eyes. I am sure that The Hermitage has qualified conservationists who love their collections, but I am also sure that none of the admittance money is going into conservation or improvement. The galleries are either very cold or very hot, not the best conditions for preservation. There are many panes of broken glass, and loose floor tiles. The frames for the windows are flaking and rotting. These are just the things the casual visitor can see, what you can't see must be horrific. We visited in early October, so the hoards of people were not a problem for us, although it was still crowded.The third floor (which is difficult to find, probably deliberately so) does have a nice selection of Impressionists and modern art, and it is very well conserved under moderate lighting and temperature. I wonder if this part of the collection is the \"stolen\" art and may have to be returned in some time. Perhaps the Russian politicians are worried about the condition of this art and so devote better care to this collection. The collection of dancing Matisses has been moved into another, separate building which we never saw. Perhaps they have oxidized completely. In any case, the practical necessities of this site are pretty demanding too. The booth in the garden square where you collect your e-tickets was completely obscured by stacked building supplies, with the small informational sign tipped over. We spent a fair amount of time looking for it, once the rude informational clerk at the receptionist's desk directed us outside, where an half hour search started. The cloakroom (where you must leave your coat) is across from the toilet rooms, of which I availed myself. Even though the museum had just opened that morning, the wastepaper baskets (full of VERY USED toilet paper) were toppling over and falling on to the floor. My husband, who was waiting for me in the hall, was gagging from the smell. These were the only toilets we ever saw in the building, other than a few next to the cafeteria. If I ever return to this museum, the wearing of Depends underwear might be advisable.The cafeteria was terrible, with some bolted down seats that reminded me of prison seating. The food offered was terrible too, and we were glad to leave the place.There was a wonderful collection of the last tsar and tsarina's clothing, along with some poignant remnants of the children's things. It is ironic that these items were kept in glass and in very low light, so that this collection of clothing will probably outlast all the paintings. The part of the museum that is dedicated to some of the tsars' living areas is quite nice, and so is the throne room. I would like to have seen the area that The People's Will bombed, but couldn't figure it out. It was good that we'd seen The Russian Ark several times, so that some of these rooms very familiar.I wish there had been some explanation of The Hermitage's staff's roles in World War II, but sadly there is none here, although you can read about it in some books. The little gift shop areas were one bright spot, where most of the clerks have been allowed to smile and to chat with shoppers. Their collections of \"Faberge\" egg pendants and cloth Christmas tree ornaments were quite nice and we bought a large variety of things as gifts for the people back home. I highly recommend the gift shops, as their selections were very good and the prices reasonable. Too bad the entire facility isn't run by the people in charge of the gift shops. I can tick the box that I've seen The Hermitage. If you have grandchildren who want to see the Rembrandts some day, tell them to look in a book."

I can't really add much to the reviews, but it is certainly worth going in mid-Winter as that is the time when you can appreciate everything without being crowded out.It may be bitterly cold outside but this will be the only opportunity many people will get to relax in such grandeur. Obviously, the residents of St. Petes are used to freezing temperatures and everything still functions, even when it is -30. The more adventurous might also consider staying with a family, rather than a hotel. Many people have several careers of which Hermitage expert/guest house (or flat) owner/translator are quite popular choices. If someone can plan what you might want to see beforehand at least you have a chance of seeing most of the \"treasures\" without being conned by some of the guides."

I highly recommend taking the time to walk through the rooms that this palace is comprised of to really gain appreciation for its significance (the two throne rooms, Peter's library, the gold room, the white room, the long halls, etc.) Don't forget to look up (at the ceilings) and down (at the ground). It's quite a walk through history."

The size and scope of this place is overwhelming. We were thankful that we had a tour guide with us to let us know where to go and what to see. Each and every room is a sensory experience, not only for the art, but also the decor.My only disappointment was in a very nice gift shop within the museum. I picked up an item of interest to me to see the price, only to find the \"made in China\" label inside the article. That item was not purchased, since I had hoped to buy something made in Russia. We did not convert any cash in Russia, so were unable to purchase items in the cafe. There is a restaurant where we could have eaten with credit card, but did not want to take the time.We were cautioned more than once that pick pockets frequent the museum, so you need to ensure your valuables are in a safe place on your person. We did have to turn our coats into a cloak room.The museum is celebrating the 250th anniversary."

The Hermitage has so many articles: however unless you can read Russian the descriptions in English (where they exist) are very short. It can be difficult to navigate- the floor plan we were given was in Korean, which was as much help as if it was in Russian- and the downloaded app was close to useless.Despite this, I would never miss this experience. The opulence that the ruling class enjoyed is staggering. And the amount of art in the form of paintings- it is such a wow factor.Tip: buy an Internet ticket and avoid the queues. We found one day to be sufficient, but this would depend on your dept of interest in the culture.2nd tip You can't get a pass out for lunch and the cafe is abysmal so have a big breakfast. Plenty of toilets."

If there is a need to assign numbers to attractions in St. Petersburg, the Hermitage, of course, in the first row. Visit the Peter and not visit the famous Winter Palace just can't. This is how to visit Paris and see the Eiffel tower. Yes, Yes I'm not mistaken - not the Louvre - and it is - famous Parisian tower, because the Hermitage, in a sense, is a symbol! Too much history associated with this place, not to mention those countless treasures in the literal and figurative sense that there literally at every step. The Story itself though lives in the building, striking in its grandeur, luxury and beauty. For those born and raised in St. Petersburg, it is not difficult to navigate in huge abundance of facilities and collections, because none of us probably will not say how many times he had been there, if we have in mind that it is almost a tradition to spend the weekend at the Hermitage with family, friends, strangers, or just walking. But those who came into town not too long - you should rent an audio guide and not to seek for one day or for a couple of hours - get around it. In Peter's still a lot of other interesting places and spend all their time at the Hermitage would be wrong. I think, just to plunge into the atmosphere of history, luxury Golden time to dream, just to wander through a few rooms. This can also be quite enough. And if you gear - then you need to come specially to dedicate a few dais."

It is also important to buy a camera ticket if one wishes to take photos. Without a ticket one is not allowed in with a camera and it will be detected by the x-ray machine and failure to purchase the ticket means returning it to the cloke room, and this puts you again right at the back of the crowd of people waiting to get in. The splendour and array of various types of architecture in the Winter Palace is astounding. One needs at least 3 hours to explore the rooms leisurely to take everything in - but it is worth it.

My first suggestion is to focus on 2nd floor (per Russian way of marking, in Europe it would be 1st ). When you come up from main stairs and you choose to go to the left side of that floor where you can find numerous paintings and exhibited items, related mostly to the Tsarist Russia in 18th and 19th century. In this group I am including \u201cPortrait Gallery of the Representatives of the Romanov Dynasty\u201d, \u201cSuite of State Rooms in the Winter Palace\u201d etc.Practically do not miss those rooms - 193-197, 270, 271, 282 289, 304, 305, 307, 308, 151, 153, 187 \u2013 176, 157-167.This is by my opinion \u201cmust see\u201d in order to better understand Russian history&life of this period, which should be maybe first goal of foreign visitor . Ofcourse note that even for above listed you would need to be quite fast to visit it in 3 hours.Finally, if you just wander around this 2nd floor, you would be fascinated with any other part of permanent exibitions on this floor, such as Dutch or Italian arts."

He took out the kes and showed me all the secret drawers and safe places of that masterpiece. I was excited!Today after 20 years I still discover something new everytime I come there.

The whole place was absolutely stunning.If you are mobility-limited, do be aware that you have to walk long distances, that there are very few lifts(not usually handy, either!) and not too many places to sit down. However, don't let that put you off, it was well worth all the effort and the resulting sore feet. Would go back tomorrow!"

This city is beautiful and the Hermitage is the gem of it all. Plan to spend many hours ... or days ... because there is much to see. Tickets were not difficult to get after a very short wait, and many guided tours of different durations and in different languages are available; both in person and via audio. We were pleased to find such a casual inexpensive cafe where we could SIT and enjoy good food. The cafe is near a couple of museum shops that have a wide assortment of books and other items. There are small souvenir kiosks throughout the hallways, but the actual shops have much better selection and English speaking staff. This is a huge place, so mentally prepare. The rooms are incredibly ornate, the artwork encompasses sculpture, paintings, furniture, and every other imaginable form. If you care about museums, you MUST visit St Petersburg even if it is only to see this magnificent museum!"

The entire place is stunning however the 2 most important rooms with some of the rarest items in the world is a must. We did both and are still left speechless with the collects. Both tours around the private vaults took about an hour and were stunningly beautiful. Some of the best pieces I've ever seen. You can't take photos which was a shame however the rest of the building is hit and miss depending on the guard who's around. Expect to spend hours in this place we arrived just before 12 and didn't leave till it closed at 6 and when they say it closes at 6 they push you through the doors out no later than 6. You have to leave all your stuff in the cloak room however there are several cafe areas so make sure to take your money. Once you have left the cloakroom and gone through the turnstiles you cannot come back. There is 0 chance of getting back in. The rooms are beautiful and the collections are impressive but expect to get lost as there is no set route however take note all the rooms were numbered and they can be found above each door of the room you are in. Would say everyone needs to go look at this. It costs around 1000 rubles for the entrance ticket and the private extra rooms but totally money well spent for a whole days worth of entertainment"

We hired an audio guide which is excellent and if you listened to every description of all the pieces / rooms it features I'm sure you'd be there for a week! If you have a good guide book that devotes a few pages to the Hermitage that would probably be good enough.We focused on the palace rooms eg Romanov living areas, throne rooms, they were spectacular! We also made sure we saw the Renaissance and Impressionist art. It was vast to have so many awesome artists under one roof was breathtaking.

If your first visit to the city, go on a guided tour, but try and return later (in the afternoon when it is not so busy) just to soak up the atmosphere. Don't just look at the exhibits, but at the architecture as well. A complex of four buildings, including the Winter Palace, it is a gem in its own right, regardless of its treasures. There is too much to take in with just one visit. Note that re-admissions are not allowed, so you will need a new ticket if you cannot stay on solo after a tour - but it is worth the extra expense. The main staircase is a dream and my other favourite room is the Pavilion (with a really super English clock that makes me proud to be British whenever I see it!). On this visit I paid extra to visit the 'new' Treasures Gallery but quite honestly it was not worth it. Apart from the miniature replica of the Crown Jewels by Faberg\u00e9, there is not much in the display case devoted to his work. Additionally, while some Scythian treasure is on display, the best pieces are in the Gold Vault (for which an additional fee is payable). Unless you are in St Petersburg for an extended visit, the is enough in the main museum to see. During the main tourist season, it is very busy."

It was a gift to the late Catherine the Great from an admirer and it had been manufactured in England. On the hour it starts chiming, play music and all the mechanical birds would start moving their wings, absolutely delightful.

What is really striking is the incredible wealth that must have been held by the Emperors and Empresses that collected this treasure over the 150 year period of their reigns. Beginning with the Empress Elizabeth, and greatly expanded under Catherine the Great, the collection spans antiquities to turn of the century Impressionist paintings. All of this collecting ended in 1917 when the Bolshevik revolution happened and the Tsar Nichaolas and his heirs were all executed .When you realize the backdrop that most of the works collected were already recognized masterpieces and that they were collected methodically, you being to realize how widespread was the reach of Russian power at the time of these Tsarist regimes.Having only a half day to devote, we narrowed down our tour to the Western Art collections. There were 25 Rembrandts, including, We saw two DaVincis, and a Michaelangod sculpture. Catherine the Great had a great interest in the classical renaissance paintings, and even recreated Raffaeollos Loggia. It seemed as if we had entered the Vatican Museum, with such a collection.After moving through rooms of Titian and the Dutch and Flemish masters, we came to the rooms were the impressionists had been collected. There were several Monets, a room of Gauguin from his days in Tahiti, several Renoirs. The only disappointment was the collection of Matisse is being moved, and was not available for viewing.

The sheer size of the Hermitage is mind boggling. You will need days to see everything. It s an extraordinary place in its own right, even without what it is home to. Some of the most famous works of art in history are housed here - many instantly recogniseable works from many of the great masters. My favourite - the Remrandts. A must see, even if just for an afternoon."

Prepare to do a lot of walking and working yourself around the many other visitors. We were only there about two hours, but we got to see the highlights, including the Rembrandts. We were able to take photos, no flash, please. If you love art, you must make a visit here."

The size and cost of this summer residence is mind boggling. Another fact that is so strange to me is that the Communists did not destroy this treasure. The murdered tens of millions of people eradicating the royalty and anyone resisting communism and yet preserved this incredible symbol of royalty. And, of course, are still spending a lot of money preserving the place.The preservation of the art is rather primitive and thus the results of temperature changes, light and etc. are damaging the paintings and artifacts."

I think preparation and the right mind set are key to enjoying a tour here. Be prepared for a lot of walking. It's also crowded (it's a popular choice for visitors unsurprisingly) even before it opens to the public. You will almost certainly encounter other visitors that will violate your personal space, bump into you repeatedly, step on the back of your shoe, ignore queues, talk while you're trying to listen to your tour guide and find other ways to be irritating. Bring just a little patience and don't let these annoyances ruin your stay especially if you don't have the luxury of visiting again any time soon. Unless they are picking your pocket or committing some other crime, ignore them. You are going to see some of the finest works of art in the world. You will be rewarded for your virtue. My family was in St Pete's for 2 days on a 9 day Baltic cruise in early September so we knew there wouldn't be a lot of time here. The tour company, SPB did a great job of managing our expectations and focused on the most popular exhibits except the Impressionists. We had a little free time at the end of our 2.5 hours to either shop, take pictures outside or head to an exhibit that was not included on the tour, like the Impressionists. By the end of the tour I was feeling a little overwhelmed. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if it were a lot longer.There is a cloak room to leave large bags and coats. We were fortunate the weather was fabulous so no overcoats were worn by our group of 16 but nice to know it's there. There are signs instructing visitors to turn off the flash on your camera or prohibiting pictures all together but they aren't always visible when the rooms are filled with people. Take a second and look around or ask your guide if you aren't sure. I thought it was helpful to check out the website and do a little research on the exhibits but more important to know what would be included on our tour because you can't just wander around this place and hope to run into what you're looking for. However, our tour guide anticipated some of us might want to see the Impressionists and provided a little time and directions. Signage is not great so I was happy to have her directions."

The palace is huge (over 1000 rooms) and beautiful, every room is different, in terms of decor and every room has beautiful artwork on its ceilings. There is an enormous amount of art, furniture, jewelry, clothes, carriages etc - over 3 million collectibles! You would need a week or more to see everything. The palace in itself is beautiful and very grand. So even if you are not a museum enthusiast, this is definitely worth doing. An important tip - as soon as you enter there are kiosks from where you can buy entry tickets. Just go there and buy and you dont have to stand in a queue. We saw a lot of people waiting in a queue, God knows why! We just strolled, without any issues. They also ask you to buy a ticket if you have a camera - not required. Everyone has cameras and no one asks for a ticket for that."

Absolutely must not be missed, but far too big to take it all in; you'd need to stay there for many years to do that, so just get from it what you can. Our visit was a 3 hour guided tour around the Western Art collection. It was great, but after a while the shear volume of grand art started to become overwhelming and I found myself barely glancing at some of the 'Grand Masters'. Next time I'll definitely arrange a private tour guide rather than joining one from the ship so that I can see what I want to... would have loved to have a sampling from all the eras rather than just one collection. But even without the objects, the palace in which they are kept is absolutely stunning, The highlight was the \"Amber room\". On entry to the museum our guide told us that low cut coats could be worn, but on our visit that day even thin bomber jackets had to be deposited in the cloakroom (unless they were rolled up very small and tucked under the arm, as did any bags much bigger than a normal SLR camera bag. It's big, it's grand, it's stunning, and must not be missed if you get the chance."

The fact that most displays were beseiged with tour groups forced our guide to herd us through their pre-arranged route. We went through quite a few statesrooms which showcased the extravagrance of the former Emperors and Empresses. Then we were ushered to see the 18th century still functioning automated Peacock Clock (a video of the movements was recorded and showed on a flat screen TV next to the display), Leonardo Da Vinci's famous painting The Madonna and the Child, and Rembrandt's The Return of the Prodigal Son. We pass through a lot of canvas paintings, sculptures and artwork but missed out on the Picasso collection and works of Matisse, Monet, Cezanne, Van Gogh and Renoir probably because they are the most patronized. Will definitely have to return and spend sometime in the future."

We had a wonderful travel experience, the service of the ship (from St. Petersburg to Moscow) was excellent, foods and drink were good, all activities were just right for different level of travel people. The tour guide did very good job to help find hotel, taxi and metro/subway for our extended stay."

Having been to the ''Louvre'', ''Buckingham Palace'' and even the ''Peterhof'' in St Petersburg which in my opinion are much better attractions. I went through with a group and we were let in 1 hour before opening time and even then it was shoulder to shoulder with all the other tours that had been also let in early!!!!! There is no doubt that this is a magnificent attraction and no trip to St Petersburg would be complete without a visit. But it definitely isn't up there with similar attractions in other cities around Europe. (Versailles, Schoebrun et al.) The gloomy look on the female guards (affectionately referred to as the '' Dragons'') do nothing to add joy to the occasion. The winter palace and the wonderful collection of art and artifacts is impressive. But the underlying story of Catherine and her conquests and young lovers adds a lot to the intrigue of the whole attraction. Don't be put off by my review as no-one can possibly go to St Petersburg without going through the ''Hermitage'' but don't go along thinking it is the greatest attraction in the world. It's not!"

I was chatting last night at the Opera (Tosca) to a Dutch tourist, and he had had the same experience as I had. If you love art, you cannot imagine the impact. A Picasso room, a Van Gogh room, etc. Get the map once you are inside - free and very helpful. One idea is to start at the top floor - it is a bit easier to grasp the layout. I had made the mistake of booking on both Treasury tours: the Diamond Room and The Gold Room. The first one was 1.5 hours and very good but I cancelled and got a refund on my ticket for the second Treasury tour as I was too tired to immediately follow with the second tour. These Treasury tours show you the real wealth in the Museum; and are worth the extra 300 Roubles. There were only three in our group (English speaking) and the guide Anastasia was excellent. For the entrance: I queued up for a ticket but maybe next time I would buy one on line. If you have an internet-booked ticket the place to get your ticket is just inside the first large set of gates. There is a lot of queue jumping to buy on the day so do not expect any order at that point. You do not need a guided tour or audio-guide for the main part if you know anything about art. It is less tiring to go at your own pace. Enjoy. Plenty of cafes to have a break inside. All large bags,liquids, and all jackets/coats have to be left at the cloakroom. Buy your water inside at a cafe."

As stated in other reviews, the rooms themselves are pieces of art to enjoy! I recommend finding a guide or purchasing the audio guide which can be rented inside the museum. Each time we have been here, we were only able to spend a few hours since we were traveling with our child. This time our daughter was 11, and she enjoyed it with the audio guide. I would love to be able to go back and spend much, more time in the Hermitage! Oh, I do recommend eating before you go, the cafe food was not that good and as museums go; overpriced."

We did scan the main attractions first as a group (of five friends) but we split up along the way to focus on what was of most interest to each of us. My husband spent a lot of time in the Greek/roman type sections (I know, weird ha?). Our friends really just wanted to see the main sights but I wanted to linger. I feel like I saw everything I wanted to with no sense of rushing at all. I spent ages in some galleries and palace state rooms, dawdled over a special exhibition of clothing (including clothes of the family of the last Tsar- slightly unnerving...) and bumped into my husband for a brisk walk through the basements in the way out. I loved it- make sure you read something about it before and get an audio guide. It's nice to know about tables of food coming through the floor so as to avoid nosey servants, beautiful clocks (check out the video - the peacock clock really is exquisite), small creatures amongst the vines on a beautiful silver wine server, and where all those priceless treasures come from. Take time to enjoy it if that's what your into or just do the highlights with the map and an audio guide. Ps take a snack in your pocket. I was told food was really expensive and you might be there all day."

Nevertheless we had to wait 40 minutes in line to purchase tickets. I tried the electronic machines to the right as you enter the courtyard but they wouldn't take my credit card or cash. I would advise you to purchase a voucher or tickets advance to avoid this wait, but the weather was nice so it was no big deal. There were numerous tour groups and drain at the same time we were. So we decided to go to the top floor and work our way down to avoid these groups which turned out to be a good decision. We feel we saw a lot in three hours with a break downstairs in the cafeteria to sit down and have something to drink. The self-guided tour worked for us following the map that the museum gives you at the entrance along with the help of the various women sitting in the rooms as guards. In many instances tours are good but in an art museum we like to go in her own pace and perhaps inspect different works more closely then a tour would allow. We also saw various impressionist paintings which we had never seen or read about so it was interesting to see them."

So I made it a special destination. Suspecting that a group tour from a cruise ship would not be to my liking, I went through the expensive visa process and flew to St. Petersburg, budgeting four full days for the Hermitage, one day for Peterhof and the Russian Museum, and one day for other city sights. That turned out to be just about right.Though the museum is large, certain parts downstairs are probably not of interest to many visitors, and so the main parts are manageable in a few days. They put out a very impressive app with maps and 360-degree panorama views of many of the rooms. Though I studied ahead of time and had a plan for each day, I ended up just wandering all over the first day and then deepening my exploration the remaining three days.The museum impresses most as architecture. Many rooms have spectacular walls and ceilings. Also, the relationship between the museum and the city and water around it is interesting to observe. (There are many, many windows.) The spaces decked out as period rooms were a bit tawdry (seeming so especially since I had just visited the Louvre's renovated period rooms a week earlier). The painting collection has its strong and its weak points, though certainly it is one of the top ten in Europe. Alas, it is a very difficult collection to enjoy, for two reasons. First, because of all the windows, there are substantial glare issues in most rooms. For some major paintings, there is not a spot in the room where one may have a view without this issue emerging. And second, more than any other museum I have visited this one is frequented by tour groups. Thus while searching for that perfect spot to see a painting you may very well be run over by a group of tourists. Some areas, like the Rembrandt rooms, are wall to wall tourists from opening time to closing time.It was interesting to read the cards. Some objects were listed as in Berlin until 1945. Others were transferred from other Russian museums, so that this one could be an especially impressive showplace.All in all, I was delighted to have my four days at the Hermitage. (If you go, buy two-day passes on the Internet ahead of time, and if you intend to visit for four days make two separate two-day pass transactions.) I think I was in every room that was open. And I probably will come back some day. But I would advise this as being a venture to undertake only after gaining a strong foothold in other European museums. Get to know the Louvre and the National Gallery and the Prado and the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie and the Uffizi well first. Then think about spending some time in St. Petersburg."

We had a wonderful visit and wanted to share a few tips 1. If you have specific pieces you want to see get a guide. You can find a reasonably priced private guide by doing some research on TA. We hired a young woman with fluent English for $35 USD/hr. She had a degree in art history and was extremely knowledgeable. This allowed us to go directly to the pieces we wanted to see and not follow the normal route. For example, we saw the peacock clock with maybe only 5-10 other people in the whole room. By the afternoon when we walked back through the room was packed.2. Buy you ticket from the electronic machines to bypass the large line. It seems like not many people realized you could do this. They are located to the right as you walk into the courtyard where the main entrance is. Anyone can use the machines. One is cash only and the others take credit or cash.3. Don't bring a bottle of water. You will have to surrender liquids at the security because of an incident where a radical threw liquid acid on one of the Rembrandts.4. There is no climate control and very packed during the summer months. There are no 'good times' to go although like most tourist attractions first thing in the morning or closer to the closing time is somewhat less crowded."

The Hermitage is one of the largest museums in the world, with three million works of art (not all on display at once), and one of the oldest art galleries in the world. Like so many historic sites in Russia, this place has been through the mill. Over many war-torn years, large portions of the collection have been stolen or sold. Portions of the collection have been added by donations and various other (sometimes not so admirable) means. During Russian Revolution, the looting of the massive wine cellars by Bolsheviks fueled weeks of riots and continued unrest that was later termed \"The greatest hangover in history.\" Later, hard-liners in the Soviet government did not pay much attention to maintenance of art, which was officially labeled as \"bourgeois\" and \"decadent\". During the 1920s and 1930s, under the rule of Stalin the Soviet government ordered the sale of over two thousand works of art, including some of the most precious works from the Hermitage collection. After WW II the war the government attempted to compensate for its recent losses by transferring to the museum some of the art captured by the Red Army in Germany. The most highly-priced part of the booty were originally taken by the Nazis from private collections of German (Jewish) business elite. These paintings were considered lost until 1995 when the museum unveiled them to the public as \"Hidden Treasures.\" The Russian government maintains that these works provide just a small compensation for irreparable losses inflicted on Russian cultural heritage by the German invasion in WWII. The State Duma (legislature) actually passed a law forbidding the return of disputed works to their owners on the grounds they were guilty of financing the Nazi regime.We saw many iconic works of art that, before today, I had only seen in books. Hours later, we went to the Hermitage Treasure Collection. Our Hermitage Treasure guide was an immaculately dressed woman of about 60. The woman spoke only Russian, but through eye-contact and her enthusiastic delivery, she helped make our tour exciting. Our guide translated as we viewed an incredibly rich collection of the applied arts, including works by Faberge and Imperial jewelry."

It is very crowded and at times you wish the sea of people would part so that you could have a better look at certain things.

Could have spent entire days wandering the corridors exploring all the artwork and relics. It's great to get to see such masterpieces in an atmosphere that still feels a lot more comfortable and less structured than most western art museums. A refreshing change! Also there is a temporary exhibit on with some of the last royal family's clothes and they are all perfect examples of great craftsmanship and good preservation. Some of the ball gowns are very modern and stunning in shades of black and red whilst there were some cute additions like the little leather boots some of the boys in the family wore and their tiny replica rifles. Also the Picasso gallery was quieter than any other gallery of it's type I've ever seen and it's lovely to be able to take photos of such classic masterpieces for memories (as I've been to quite a few places where it's no photos allowed whatsoever). Beautiful palace - wear comfy shoes though as you will want to be on your feet all day checking out all the things on display!!!"

As a Russian, it was the first time I've ever been so close to the imperial part of my history, and I must say it struck a chord :) Several rooms have been restored to the way they were in the 18-19th centuries, and you can imagine how magnificent the palace of an emperor looks like. 2. There's a very very interesting collection of Central Asian and Siberian art mainly covering two periods: the first states (very broadly around 500BC) and the Mongolian empire (13-15 centuries). If you in any bit take interest in those regions, I suggest you have a look. It's on the ground floor."

The art collection parallels any other major world museum with works by the Old Masters, Impressionists, etc. the State Rooms are also amazing.

The same with several people from the staff we asked during our tour.I missed Kandinsky and the russian avantgardes.

They will be happier and no so tired at the end of the visit.Please, provide good maps with updated info and tell your staff to learn a little more about your museum.

            "review": "Go to see the Winter Palace. Beware if you're in a wheelchair.. A must see, of course, but I advise focusing your time in the Winter Palace building. The architecture, the sheer grandeur, is breathtaking. The awe factor of the other buildings, architecturally speaking, goes down, way down, from jawdroppingly fabulous in the Winter Palace to buildings that have no decoration, that are humdrum, walls that are as plain as your bedroom at home. If you have only a few hours to spend, there is no question, stay in the Winter Palace - see what is Russian. The art that is housed throughout The Hermitage is obviously world class, but there is no doubt in my mind that if you are an international traveler visiting The Hermitage, you already know art - you've been to The Met, to the Louvre, to the British Museum - you know Monet from Manet, Rembrandt from Renoir. The great art museum near your home has pieces from the masters, but it does not have the Winter Palace. Focus all of your attention there, unless there is a particular masterpiece that you must see - Rembrandt's 'Return of the Prodigal Son' comes to mind, pretty fabulous to see that in the flesh, most definitely. So, do your research online, decide what pieces you must see first hand, and after that, focus on the Winter Palace building itself. You will save yourself loads of grief. This place is MOBBED, the most crazed sea of humanity I have ever experienced, as horrific as the Vatican Museum, the Sistine Chapel - we are talking insane numbers of people. You will have palpitations, you will feel faint, you will break out in a cold sweat - mobs of tourists! So go, but plan your visit wisely. Research the heck out of The Hermitage before you go. Have a game plan. Do not wander aimlessly, it is just too big, and you will waste your time. A final note, if you are wheelchair bound, you won't see a thing (I know). Your view is blocked by all of the people since your vantage point is low and no one cares about you - no one steps aside to give you a view of the paintings. They want to see for themselves and the crowd mentality prevails, survival of the fittest, which isn't you. Not to mention the oddly placed elevators. Go with someone who can aggressively make way for you or grow a thick skin with a loud voice. It's a beautiful place, but the crowds are suffocating and seriously detract from the overall experience."

It is not impossible to see it all..you just need a whole bunch of inner energy, good walking shoes, a full understanding you will go up and down stairs, and expect crowds. We went on a Tuesday, the kids were back in school and the place was packed. Don't bring knapsacks, and keep yourself safe from pick pockets! That said, you will find this place totally awesome! We had a Russian historical guide...I was a River cruise...who trail blazed us through rooms so grand, so opulent, so customized with specific exhibits. First, were Royal Russian czar and wealthy families dresses and men's clothes full of customized brocades, beadings, feathers..women with 17 inch waists and tiny, brilliant shoes. We moved to brilliant columns and ceilings you can only look up with dropped jaws! Gold leaf as far as your eyes can see, marble and malachite, ebony furniture a from the late 1800s thru early 20th century. Amazing if you are decorator or just appreciate the finest in decor! Keep going to the European Impressionists..Cezanne, Renoir, Van Gough, Gaugain...visit walls of Rubins, Picassos..hosts of cubinsists amongst the old masters. Be prepared for an amazing Egyptian and Greece exhibits. There is a limited place to eat. Once in, you can not reenter with purchasing a new entrance pass.Give yourself the time and if you have few days to visit, go back. Google the site. I plan on buying some fabulous books on this place when I get home. Too much great information and the pictures tell the story!"

Every single section is being monitored by old Russian ladies, so be careful, do not cross the red line or touch the works of art. I have seen a very young boy being scolded :)"

However we thought we'd take a chance and visit later in the day, thinking that perhaps the crowds would have cleared out. We were right. By 3:30pm the queues were gone, the cruise passengers away, and we went directly to the cash desk to buy tickets. There were still a lot of people mulling around, but it never felt claustrophobic. The downside, of course, is that there is so much to see here that a 2.5 hour visit is just not sufficient to do it justice. We didn't even visit the top floor, for instance. Note that when going in you have to go through a metal detector. They won't let you bring in liquids and I had to leave my pocket knife too. That caused a slight delay as I had to rush to the cloak room.We focused on the 1st floor state rooms, which was a good choice. The first floor is a good choice if limited on time."

One had to move around a fair bit to get an ideal view (cancelling reflections) of some/most paintings. The palace that houses all this is well, exquisite, and on a larger scale than I could have possibly expected. We walked miles both days, enjoying every incredibly ornate ceiling, painting, sculpture, at every turn more beauty tempted and met the eye. Absolutely wonderful.

Luckily we were first through the doors as soon as the museum opened so this was a big bonus.Even if you are not into art this museum is not to be missed. Our guide told us if you stopped at every painting for 1 minute it would take you 11 years to see everyone. The main hall is fantastic with a great staircase leading up to the first floor. Not many museums allow you to get up close to the paintings from artists such as Rembrandt and Van Gogh. We did not see every room but what we saw was fantastic.Be mindful of pick pockets wherever you are in St Petersburg and we were told that a gentleman had his wallet stolen while in the Hermitage."

If you go in summer time, get prepared to HUGE l\u00ednes, even if you buy your ticket by internet ( 19\u20ac for one day or 29\u20ac for two days; closed on mondays , they OPEn at 10:30 and close at 18:00). If you go by yourself, try to find someone of the staff members: they will HELP you skip the second long l\u00ednes of guided tours to get to the main entrance. Get your audio guide on second floor ( shorter line than on first floor, costs aprox. 10\u20ac and they ask your passport) I loved Rembrandt's colection: \" The lParabole of the Lost Son \" is as visited as is Mona Lisa at The Louvre. So many other beautiful colections : Murillo, Raphael,etc. ...only a few Gaingsbourough or Fragonard's.... The halls and corridors with exquisite and opulent decoration. Don' t miss th e zar, zarinas and princess costume's room: is gorgeous! Food store small and far from the halls."

I'd recommend joining a guided tour, otherwise you'd be lost after 10 minutes. But, if you have plenty of time, getting lost in such a wonderful palace is not a bad thing, isn't it? Do yourself a favor and buy the tickets online in advance (their official website http://www.hermitageshop.org/tickets/) - that will save you a lot of time! The ticket lines could be pretty long during the tourist season (and I'm not even sure if there is such a thing as a \"low season\" in St. Petersburg)."

            "review": "Beautiful art!. This place is gorgeous, and if you've been to the Louvre in Paris, you will definitely notice the similarity between the two museums - both huge, both located within beautiful palaces, both potentially somewhat confusing to first-time visitors without a tour guide. (To be honest, though, the Hermitage feels a little less organized. The map is slightly harder to decipher than that of the Louvre. In fact, I would say that if you've been to the Louvre, you might be a tiny bit disappointed with the Hermitage. That was how I felt, but I'm not crazy about art, so...) I won't even go on to describe the works of art that are contained within this museum, because there is a such a vast range of them. You'll also definitely want to pay attention to the interior design of the rooms themselves, since they are absolutely magnificent and each has a lot of history to it.As for the technicalities:If you find a good timing for your visit to the Hermitage Museum (i.e. weekdays, early on in the day), you won't have to deal with too much of a crowd. When I went in July 2014, the fees were as follows:Normal entrance: 8-ish euro (400 rubles)If you can provide proof of being a Russian/Belarusian citizen, you pay 1 euro less.Children under 18 and students (must provide student card) go in for free.You are supposed to pay extra to take photographs (4 euro), but honestly, the place is always fairly crowded and nobody bothers to check whether you have the ticket that allows you to photograph. Personally, I didn't pay extra and would just take my phone out occasionally to take a picture or two, and nobody said a thing to me.You'll want to put most of your stuff away into storage, since they don't let you in with large or even medium-sized rucksacks and bags (handbags are an exception, I think)."

Reviewers are not joking about how much there is to see, but it is totally worth it. Part art museum part palace exhibition you will constantly be jumping back and forth between tour modes. Entry is free on the first Thursday of every month and while the line to get in was long I wouldn't say it was any longer than any other day of the week. Definitely worth waiting to save the cash as tickets can be expensive. If you do plan on going another day of the week I'd recommend buying your tickets online to help skip the long lines. My only other recommendation is to get your fill of water and food before, as they make you throw your water out upon entrance and the prices inside are absurd. Other than that it is an amazing experience and a must do in St. Petersburg!"

I was hard pressed to see a famous painter not represented, maybe Signac. Amazing architecture. Amazing wealth. Understandable why the Russian Revolution happened. Same can be said for Catherine's Summer palace. We were fortunate to have a guide who was truly well informed. Others on the same cruise didn't. She informed us not only about the history, starting with Peter The Great down to living behind the \"iron curtain\" and working for the KGB. The food both days was to say the least very disappointing, and I am not a picky eater, discerning though, but you won't starve. A word of caution, believe everything you hear about pickpockets. They abound. Our guide cautioned us that that they are the best in Europe. On our cruise, one Aussie had her card stolen from the inside pocket of her purse. Within an hour, there was 8K wracked up on their card. This happened on the 2nd floor of the Hermitage, not anywhere near the stores All my pictures of St.Petersburg were taken with one hand. The other was holding on to my wallet inside my pocket. Avoid any kind of crowd, watch for swarming. Don't be tempted by vendors selling books while you are waiting in line. Enjoy yourself, it truly is a feast for the eyes."

On top of that, the lines for individual tickets can be well over an hour long. This is why I highly recommend taking a group tour with a company that has access to the group entrance. It will save hours of time.The other issue is that the museum does not have climate control. Expect that if there is any sort of crowd it will be hot and stuffy.

Well thank you for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, because nowhere else in this world one can enjoy Rembrandt and Rubens under the direct sunshine, but, really, this arises a couple of questions - either the museum management is crazy and totally incompetent, or what we saw were not the originals (I personally would prefer the second, otherwise this is a genocide of artwork). No conditioning whatsoever, the smell of sweat is killing, the women sitting in the rooms are looking at their watches every now and then and their gloomy faces are expressing \"when is the lunchtime, sick and tired\" (though the latter can be true for the whole country - every russian seems to be aggressive and mad at life). The collection was amazing really (but again, were we seeing the originals?). The palace is breathtaking. But... we left angry at the open windows, the hit, the stinking, the angry and aggressive museum staff. At the closing hour we took a sit on the benches in the front yard and heard the loudspeakers announce closing of the museum. Under the impression of the museum staff behaviors and the russian behavioral style in general, we started joking that perhaps now there will come an army of militiamen with dogs to drive the public out. And guess what... several militiamen came out (where were the dogs?) and got the people out of the museum territory. :))) ... Who said soviet union is no more?"

No wonder the peasants lived in poverty. Nonetheless, not to be missed. Special mention needs to be made of the Gold and especially the Diamond Rooms which one can only visit on a tour and photos are not allowed there. Most spectacular snuff boxes one can imagine, as well as the jewel encrusted swords etc. It is amazing that one could go right up to the priceless treasures on the walls. There are too many of them to protect adequately, I suppose. Other museums in Europe also don't allow photography so this is a rare opportunity to just imbibe the art.

With 5 cruise ships in port and many river cruise ships as well in port, the place is packed. Our Gate 1 tour guide did a great job keeping our group together and explaining the many artifacts, paintings and rooms to us. Some many artifacts that if you saw each one for a few minutes, it would take you nine years to see them all. Also when we left, Gate 1 had the bus there, which is so easy. The driver handles the traffic and you sit back and enjoy the sights."

Fantastic as usual and very special.A tip-there're terminals in the museum yard, to the right from the entrance-don't waste your time in the queues, they're very looooong, buy your tickets in the terminal and be happy. There were very few people at those and veeery many people in the queues. One more thing:the collections are numerius and the museum is huge, so plan beforehand what you want to see to make your visit unforgettable. Otherwise, you risk to turn it into an endless and senseless wandering along the corridors and rooms of the Hermitage. Please don't let anything spoil the impression from this amazing temple of art!"

I recommend getting a private guide for a few hours (from your hotel, cruise ship, etc) as it is well worth knowing where to go and see what you are interested most in seeing. A guide will also allow you to enter without queuing in what can be monstrous lines. The most fantastic special clothing exhibition was on when we visited....saw items worn by the Tsars and Tsarinas, the princes and princesses, especially loved that we were able to see those of the last Tsar's and his family.

If possible/practical, seek the support of a knowledgeable and experienced local guide to ensure your visit to this magnificent museum is 'time well spent'. Simply 'wandering' through the museum might result in you 'missing' the best of what The Hermitage has to offer (the museum is huge and suffers the effects of being a tourist 'hot spot' - extremely busy!).We arrived early with our tour guide and were taken to those areas of the museum which were of greatest interest to us - seeing (close-up) the Leonardo's, the unfinished Michelangelo sculpture and works by Canaletto and Caravaggio - stunning. Of course we also saw many other works of art - too numerous to specifically mention.Whilst the spectacular of the Museum's rooms were in themselves, unforgettable, the 'highlight' of our visit was our private party tour of 'The Gold Room' (which required visit pre-booking - made by our local guide) as this area of the museum is jaw-droppingly special and should be planned into your schedule (wherever possible).I can only 'highly recommend' a visit to The Hermitage (even if you are 'not' really into art) as the impression this visit (minimum 3 hours) will imprint in your memory, will undoubtedly be one to treasure!!

The most productive and impressive way to explore the museum is to find a good guide and discuss with her/him in advance what are the most impressive collections in the Hermitage, then overlap with your own wishes and concentrate on one or two collections per visit, otherwise it's too much and too tiring to grasp a bit of everything.My favorites are Dutch and Russian art, and for those who aware of ancient Greek mythology, Greek collection will be extremely interesting."

We were on a tour, coming from Scandinavian countries, with 6 other friends.I am NOT into art, being called Hagar or Attila at times, but there is a bit here for everybody, even me.First, the area/buildings - and around it is impressive. Lots of buildings, spread over quite a lot of city blocks. It was crowded, and as usual, people that MUST preen in front of everything and get their pictures taken to prove that they were there. Conceit or Ego?Lots of art treasures, Russian culture and costumes, tons of paintings by renowned artists, plus some modern ones - you know, the paintings that if you hung it upside down, nobody would know the difference. To me, it was a bit of overkill, place was crowded and just too much bumping and jostling. Also, this is not really to my liking, too fast-paced, and the fact that you only get the description at the END of the room doesn't help me to understand it. We enjoyed the mosaic Malachites the most - as it is unusual and we had not seen anything similar to this. We also saw some more green amber, which is very interesting in how they 'create it'.If anybody is interested in seeing EVERYTHING in the Hermitage museum - warning! If you came here 6 days a week for 8 hours, you can probably see ALL the pieces in about 28 years or so, assuming one piece a minute.Interesting that one display of a chess set with the board - pieces are set up incorrectly! With all the Russian chess grandmasters, you'd think that someone could set a board and pieces up correctly!"

From the glory period of St. Petersburg, there are lots (and lots) of fancy clothes, furniture, and personal effects on display. It\u2019s almost as if some curator was rummaging through the remains of the Hermitage storage bunkers and started putting everything on display. There were some interesting paintings, such as the ball commemorating the 300th anniversary of tsarist Russia in 1914. Little did they know.There are nice collections of 700- to 2000-year-old Eastern European and Central Asian artifacts\u2014things not likely to be seen in other museums outside of Russia. However, it is not very easy to get to these collections. The Hermitage is so large that it\u2019s really easy to get turned around despite the free museum maps that are available at the ticket counter. Visit tips: buy tickets online if you can. The special exhibits (such as the gold room) are times and sell out early in the day. Arrive early to be near the front of the queue for picking up/buying tickets. We luc out by going the day before when the museum entrance was free (first Thursday of the month, usually) as the lines to get in were super long. Non-flash pictures are allowed in much of the museum. Expect to walk a lot; the museum is vast and you will want to check out everything. Like much of the country, the museum is not really wheelchair friendly.And the nitpick? There is a definite lack of air conditioning in this museum. I know that it's not uncommon for there to be no air conditioning. However, in this European city with one of the top collections in the world, it seems that the comfort of the visitors (not to mention maintaining the collections) would be up to world class standards."

No doubt about being one of the greatest museums.Do not compare it with other museums, just buy the ticket and enjoy.But before you buy the ticket: at the hotel we stayed, they offered tickets without staying in line but for double the price.It is up to you to consider this option.We did not buy from the hotel and stayed in line maybe 15 minutes.Groups have anyway a different entrance and they already have the tickets.Most of the visitors are Russians,except the groups.There are a few options to buy different tickets so be ready when you reach the counter.They do not understand English too well so the decision what kind of ticket to buy is yours.Check even before you get there which day of the month the entrance is free.This time it was the first Thu. of August.It was closed on Mondays.Students entrance is free.Locals pay much less than tourists but this should not bother us.The other issue to take into account: you are not allowed with food or water under no circumstances.Do not try to fool them.There are coffee shops inside the museum that serve lunch menu so it's OK.You are not allowed to carry bags and you have to leave them at the storage room(no fee) but another place you have to wait in line !Come without bags !More: for how long do you think you can walk and wonder around the museum? It is not easy and you will need at least three hours.There are few chairs along the museum halls for a rest so you might consider going down to the c/shop each time you are tired.I saw toilets only on the ground floor.For the regular visitor I suggest to take the free museum plan.In this plan they pointed out already for you the most well known works of art.So now you have a start point which will take you to all the important works you knew about or did not.The plan is very helpful and clear and besides, the staff watching the visitors can be helpful too.At some points you will have a view to the Neva river.In case you know what you want to see than the same plan can be helpful because it explains where are concentrated the works per period or by culture. You can take pictures but not with a tripod.You can buy a combined ticket for two days(two entrances)And before you leave: don't forget the souvenir shop.I am sure you will find something there.Enjoy it !"

I bought tickets online for 2 day visits. You print off the voucher and go to the little booth just inside the entry to the Winter Palace from Palace Square and the voucher is exchanged for tickets. You do need ID such as a driver's licence. Then go past the long line (30 min wait) and into the line for groups and people with tickets and you go straight in - wonderful!The museum is vast so you need to work out what you want to see. There are two areas with French impressionists one on the second and the other on the third floor so do not miss the third floor which has a more extensive collection including two rooms of Picasso. I found the Russian culture area interesting . Needless to say the other collections are great as are the interiors. "

But hands down this was the most challenging art appreciation experience I've ever had, due firstly to the hundreds of tour large groups, many of them completely without manners. Every time a tour group swarmed my way (about every 5 minutes) I felt like a sandcastle in a tsunami. I was bulldozed this and and that by the groupies in their endless quest for photos of absolutely everything the leader showed them - family photos, selfies, videos, and who knows what click click clicking away like a cloud of locusts. I found myself escaping to obscure rooms such as the Byzantine on the third floor just for some peace. Beyond the crowds, which were exhausting, the paintings were hung in rooms with absolutely no lighting consideration. Many many works were difficult to see due to the glare of sunlight from the windows(!). In the busy rooms (like the Rembrandt rooms - resembling the floor of the NY Stock exchange more than a gallery), it was steamy like a sauna - another thing I felt a bit queasy about in terms of art preservation.Hoping for a break - it was too crowded to sit down in the cafe and the loos were inadequate, with long lines at the ladies.My colleague visited in March and she said it was nothing like this - with only the odd tour group - so that would be my recommendation. Avoid cruise season at all costs."

The Pros: To me, better than Peterhof for exploring architecture and grandeur, the rooms are incredible and I was more impressed with the ceilings and detail than a lot of the art! That being said, there are whole wings of secret impressionists that no one even bothers to look at because they are all lining up in some ridiculous queue to take flash photography (!?) of the Da Vincis. The Cons:THE TOUR GROUPS!!!! I was wandering on my own and felt like I was consistently being pushed against the grain and bashed up against the wall to avoid throngs of people coming at me from all directions. If you can figure out when the busiest times are, AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!!! Tips:1. For really good contemporary art - walk across the square and you'll find their other wing, which holds awesome exhibitions (manifesta was on when I was there) as well as Kadinskys and Matisses. Bonus: it is literally empty, no tourists at all. Also, just because it is not on the audio guide or a highlight on the tour map, doesn't mean it's not there. If you're going for the art - spend 2 minutes googling their collection and you'll be amazed at what is there but most don't know about.2. Order your tickets online or at the kiosks out front. I have no idea what people were standing in line for an hour. I literally walked up to the machine, got my tickets and walked straight in. "

Because of this, long QUEUEs are formed at the opening hours, i.e., currently, at 10.30 am. If you arrive there even 30 minutes earlier, you may still expect a long queue, unless ... ... unless you are part of an organized group, as groups have some priority and a reserved preferential queue. BUT if you are alone or just a few individuals, the \"trick\" is getting the ticketsfrom the Automatic Ticket Machines, on the left side while entering the garden gate. But be careful: the machines do NOT accept credit cards, but only NOTES. Thus, bring with you enough cash in notes to pay: 400 rubles per person, PLUS - (strong suggestion!) - just 200 rubles in addition to buy the permit to make photos (without flash) in most parts of the museum. It is definitely worth of it!"

We stayed at the local Renaissance/Marriott which allowed us to bypass the lines and buy our tickets quickly. Saved us 40 minutes! You can spend the whole Day here, but given the moderate interest of our group we spent about 3 hours. Everybody loved the Winter Palace. We down loaded the iphone audio App which provided adequate information. We followed the recommended path and took lots of pictures. We then found ourselves in the Hermitage which is stocked with all sorts of artwork. Most interesting for the kids was the Da Vinci art, the hall of sculptures from early in the century and the Egyptian mummies. As non art connoisseurs we agreed to walk thru the halls quickly and stop when we saw anything interesting. I recommend bringing along water and sandwiches or snacks."

If you would spend 30 seconds looking at each one of them on an uninterrupted 24/7 base, you'd nee about 8 years to see it all. Don't blame me if the math is not accurate, I haven't bothered recalculating it myself. We only had the opportunity to spend 2 hours in this museum. Beautiful rooms and great works of art. Probably the most impressive art display I've ever seen. If you want to attempt a serious visit, my tip would be to plan 3 guided visits of about 3 hours each. Event then you still will only see a very limited portion of the exhibited work. Impressive!"

The best thing for me were the ancient and near-east antiquities -- but thats just my preference; this collection is highly limited; but still ok. The paintings especially were not displayed properly -- slightly better than an adhoc arrangement in my books; the curator needs to be sacked an replaced. Many of the paintings had far too much light reflection from lighting indoors or from a poor positioning with regards to windows. You would never find this in the Louvre for example. We bought our tickets online as we were advised that the queue becomes very long. However, as we came on a weekday, the queue was small."

Visiting all the sights of St Ptersburg was absolutely awesome as my grandchildren would say. The Hermatage was spectacular and only complaint I have is that we were rushed through it. To walk into a room of Rembrants and have 10 minutes to enjoy them was upsetting. The original city and what was built between 1703 and 1850 it truly beatiful.The wealth that was required to build the palaces,residences and collect the great artwork must have been huge. The more recent additions to the city between 1930 and 1990 I am guessing, reflect a much different image. Grey concrete 10 to 15 storey apartment buildings,poorly maintained, reflect a very depressed time in the history of St. Petersburg. The 900 days of seige during the second world war and the Stalin era I feel truly sent the city into a downward spiral. But putting all that aside it is truly worth a visit. We arrived at the winter palace,and walked into the Amber room just as the sun came out from behind a cloud. The light,reflection of light from the amber and the music being played took your breath away.Truly something that you have to see. I could go on and on but I repeat if it is your dream,it is worth doing and possily before 2018 World Cup which may change a lot of the city."

I've wanted to visit the Hermitage for over 20 years after realising in art history class that most of the artwork that I admired was on display in either the Hermitage, Prado or Louvre. The other two crossed off my list, the time had come for the Hermitage. It seems that most foreign visitors to the Hermitage are a part of an organised tour, but the museum offers english speaking tours for those who aren't a part of a group. So far, so good. However buying the ticked for the english speaking tour is then quite a challenge as it's nowhere to be found on the price list at the ticket office. And the nice old ladies manning the ticket booths don't speak english. We ended up finding an information stand behind the ticket booths and asking them to write in russian what ticket we wanted to buy (english speaking tour).The tour with the museum guide was very informative. The museum itself was packed with organised tours, so at times it was challenging to see the actual artwork. Most of the galleries don't have any place to sit down and admire the art, they probably want to keep the large groups moving through the museum. Finally, one of the key artworks of the museum, which I wanted to see, had been moved to another building because of a temporary exhibition. By then we were too tired to go buy another ticket for that building. Despite these challenges, the museum is well worth the visit."

Impressionist works of art feature my personal favourite, Monet, plus Matisse, Picasso, Gaugin and van Gogh. But it is not just paintings, sculptures by Canova and Rodin are highlights, jewellery, furniture and silver cannot fail to impress.Unfortunately the place is too big to cover on one 3 hour tour.

Ours hit the works of many of the great masters. It has plenty of those. Not being a student of art history, so consider the source, I think its only shortcoming is the lack of a signature work or two. You won't find a Mona Lisa or David and the handful of others of that acclaim but you won't find that level of classic work many other places. Be aware that if you are there mid-summer, the crowds are horrendous and if you have a schedule to keep, a good guide is essential . Our young master from Alla Tours got us to the old masters in a most efficient manner. If you like to leisurely peruse the great works of this great museum, come off season."

The setting is also beautiful - the rooms are really ornate. Chances are, whenever you go, it'll be busy - take a guide if you can (you get to go in via the tour guide entrance which is quicker) as they'll be able to give you the run-down on the best pieces and can guide you to see other parts of the collection at the end."

You must go on a tour as entry is very difficult on your own. The palace rooms where the artworks are located are so vast that one only catches a glimpse of many as you walk through several main hallways. One must be capable of scaling many stairwells and walking very long passageways otherwise it could be a difficult experience. It reminded me of the Vatican Museum in terms of the both the grandeur and the distances one must walk. The building interiors so opulent (including a room made of gold), that you begin to understand a bit more about how the Russian Revolution came about. The art works are priceless and include works you have only dreamed about ever seeing in person. You are allowed to get dangerously close to the art and sometimes you wonder how its survived all the years. The collection astounds and the architecture amazed and the furnishings are something you never forget. Your mind races as you reflect both on the works of art, the palaces where they are housed and the huge plazas outside where you can almost imagine the history of the starving and poor trying to imagine what might be inside these buildings. Its something everyone should be lucky enough to be able to see.. it really should help us understand both the beauty of art and the reckless and greedy excesses of the rich in all periods of history, including the present."

Painted a year or so before the artist's death in 1669, you can't miss this giant work when entering the massive room. Rembrandt captures perfectly all the emotion of a moment when you don't deserve forgiveness yet someone important to you forgives you anyway. So stunned by this work, I forgot the crowds.So it is with the Hermitage. Gorgeous surroundings full of truly stunning works. Highly recommended."

Six ships docked that day in St. Petersburg and it seems to me that all passengers entered the museum! It was so packed you couldn't see or hear anything or even walk from one corridor to the next! It was hot, frustrating to get close to a painting you wanted see and take photos, everything was a struggle! After the first hour I felt faint and went out to get some oxygen!

You will have to pick it up from a kiosk where only 1 cashier is serving all the people who have also booked online. She goes on lunch break between 1200 and 1300 when nobody else will take over. Other people will push to the front of the queue because it says in Lonely Planet that your voucher \"allows you to jump the queue...\" (if you try to put them straight they will not understand Russian. Or English. Or French...) Tickets bought on the day cost 400 RUB (11.25 USD approx). The queues for the cashiers were long (students go free with ID) but there are several ticket machines with instructions in Russian and English that take cash and credit cards and had no queue at all. It's also worth noting that all food and drink is banned inside the museum (as are umbrellas). We saw a couple of people in organised tour groups with bottles of water but most had to surrender at the airport-style scanners as you enter the museum.You'll forget all the hassle once you're inside though as you get swept away by the art and interiors. If you need your own space try the Siberian or Caucasus collection. The church is currently closed for restoration.

To stand in front of any of their works is something even someone who hasn't a leaning for art must appreciate. There building also has other interesting features for example the Throne Room where the Tzars made proclamations and the theatre where private performances were given. The place is full of things to see and it would take several visits to get through them all so perhaps it is better to take a guided tour and be shown the highlights."

We really enjoyed our visit to the Hermitage, but we were part of a cruise tour, and really felt rushed to get through the place in the allocated time. The palace is awesome and this history fascinating. I would strongly recommend getting in a tour group or getting the audio tour, which is available in multiple languages. You really need the history to get the full appreciation for the place. It was awesome to see the Rembrandt works, the prodigal son in particular. The impressionists are here too but I don't think the devote as much space as I would have liked. You cannot see everything in this place so set realistic expectations before you go. Do the research and go see what is of the greatest interest.But this place is a must on any trip to St. Petersburg."

            "review": "Get the most out of your Hermitage visit. The Hermitage is a stunning place and it should be on everybody's bucket list. Here are some tips on how to make your visit here the most pleasant.WHY WORTH SEEING: it was the winter residence of the Russian royal family and one of the best art museums in the world.BEST TIME TO SEE: FOR EVERYBODY - in summer the best time to see the Hermitage is on Wednesday after 5PM. Not very many people know that every Wednesday the museum is open till 9PM, as a result - even in summer you can see the place without huge crowds of people. 2 or 3 hours is more than enough to see all the highlights of the museum (which I marked on the Hermitage map attached). DO NOT STAND IN LINE FOR THE TICKETS. Once you enter the courtyard of the palace, in the corners you'll see ticket machines with almost no line. Buy your tickets there! Those machines even accept bank cards. Another option - buy your tickes online: http://www.hermitageshop.org/page.php?pagename=ticketsFOR ART CONNOISSEURS - plan on coming twice. First time, come on Wednesday night, as recommended above. Second time, come in the morning and visit the Gold and Diamond rooms plus the new building of the Hermitage, where Matisse, Kandinsky and Malevich are on display. Unfortunately, it's impossible to buy tickets to the Gold and Diamond rooms in the machines, so you actually have to stand in line for them. That's why I recommend seeing them on a separate visit. For that, come to the Hermitage quite early in the morning, about 9:30, before it opens, and get in line. At 10:30 the museum will open and you can buy tours of the Gold and Diamond rooms in English. Those have set timing, and you will be told when they start (it's different every day). It's likely that you'll have some free time before those tours start, and it's the perfect time to check out \"The Staff Building\" or \"General Hearquaters\" (a yellow building with an arch), where Matisse and others are displayed. Then come back to the museum for your Gold tour, the groups gather after the entrance turnstiles. THINGS YOU MUST SEE. I have attached the map of the Museum to this review. Below I will list the things that are worth seeing in the Hermitage. Just print out the list and the maps, and you will find those things easily.1ST FLOORTo start with, the whole first floor is meant to exhibit ancient art. So skip it, if you're not interested in Greece, Rome or ancient Asia. Egypt - the egyptian collection consists of sculptures, bas-reliefs, sarcofagi and a mummy.7 - the part I would recommend the most. Here you can see stuff found in a burial in Siberian excavations. It includes a mummy and THE OLDEST CARPET IN THE WORLD.8 - hall of Greek vases. Don't miss \"Regina Vasorum\" - the Queen of Vases - under the glass case. The room itself is beautiful, too, designed specially for the collection of vases.9 - the hall of Roman sculpture with a gigantic statue of Zeus.10 - the statue of the Venus of Milos, purchased by Peter the Great.2ND FLOOR All the main highlights are located here. Go up the main staircase and turn left to see GALA ROOMS, including the Ball room and the Throne hall. Then move on to see the room with the PEACOCK CLOCK (the most beautiful room, in my opinion).Then move on to the part with art and see Italian (Da Vinci, Titian, Michailangelo, Raphael, Carravagio, etc.), Dutch (Rembrandt, Hals, etc.) and Flemish (Rubens, Van Dyck) art.There are some private rooms here, such as the Malakhite hall and others, all marked on the map. Among them you can see some sitting rooms, the library, and the dining room.1 - if you like the impressionists, these rooms will be interesting for you. Here you can find some pieces by Degas, Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh and others, all broght here from Germany after WWII. 2 - not a highlight, but interesing for those who like history. In this room you can see a good collection of knights' armour.3 - known as Raphael's loggias, but basically is the exact copy of famous Raphael's loggias in the Vatican.4 and 5 - French art of 15th, 6th, 17th and 18th centuries. The interesting thing about those rooms is not the art, but the fact that those were private rooms of Catherine the Great (see how modest she was!).6 - staircase leading to the main collection of the impressionists.3RD FLOOR:All rooms marked in pink house the collection of French art of 19th and 20th centuries: the Salon art, the impressionists, post-impressionists, fauvists, Pablo Picasso and others. Please note that Matisse got transefed to the \"Staff building\".PLEASE NOTE:- You are not allowed to bring in big bags, backpacks, rain coats and drinks. You will be asked to check them in the cloakroom.- Photo taking is allowed, but without flash. There is no need to buy a photo permit, because nobody ever checks if you have one. It's not allowed to take photos in the rooms with temporary exhibitions.- The Hermitage is probably the most handicapt accessible museum in St. Petersburg. There are elevators which are marked on the map. If you can't find one, you can always ask somebody.- There are a lot of WC's as well, all marked on the map.- Once you checked in or threw away your water bottle, you can buy some in the cafe on the 1st floor. - To visit the Gold or Diamond rooms, you have to buy a separate ticket. Even though they are called \"room\", each of them consists of 4 or 5 rooms, which is lots of gold and diamonds. So unless you are obsessed with jewellery, I would recommend to see only the Diamond room, because it has gold, diamonds and other precious metals and stones, religious items, diplomatical gifts, things found during excavations in Greece and the shore of the Black sea. - The cafe in the museum leaves much to be desired, so those those who want to spend the whole day there - take some food with you and just buy drinks in the museum cafe. However, there is a decent Movenpick ice cream stand next to the cafe.- Right now (Summer 2014) in rooms 155, 156, 190-192 and 195 there is a very impressive temporary exhibition or royal gowns and the uniforms of people employed by the royal family. Totally worth seeing."

The Hermitage is a must see for Petersburg; the palace itself (even without the art) would be a day tour. They say that if you spent 2 seconds with each piece on display it would take a week to see it all. I don't doubt it, so plan your visit! I did a quick walk through of the european art section and spent most of my time in the downstairs display, which includes archeology and finds from Siberia, as well as the very popular exhibit of clothes from imperial russia.Be forewarned- this place is always very crowded in Summer and is also very hot inside. (Air conditioning is not common in Petersburg.) Buy tickets at a kiosk in the courtyard rather than at the ticket counter- save 1/2 hour! Musueum store is lovely but overpriced. Knowing this I still bought souvenirs there.Definitely worth the visit!"

Unfortunately we were on a guided tour and only saw a fraction of what the museum has to offer. There are some amazing pieces in the hermitage especially from Rembrandt and di Vinci that I have been waiting to see. I have been to dozens of museums in Europe and this completed my top ten in the world. That being said I was not impressed at all!First off the appearance of the building is in bad shape. The workers of the mesuem are in street clothes and can barely be identified. Not to mention they happen to be extremely rude and verbally abusive to visitors. I witnessed one screaming in Russian to a child, the mother was horrified. Granted the child was petting a marble Lion but still uncalled for. Back to the condition of museum inside. It was dirty, dusty, and obviously unkept. On the chandeliers in one of the main rooms, the candles are missing, falling over or leaning. It was a beautiful chandelier that weighed two tons but it looked awful, dirty, and unkept. I felt a lack of pride in the way the museum was kept. I debated giving this review two or three stars. Here is how I came to my decision. There are maybe five museums in the world that are 5 stars. Another 35-45 that are 4 stars. Rounding out the top 100 would be 3 stars. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the condition it was kept and overall sense I received from the workers and their lack of pride in the place."

As it is a former palace, and the Nazis were stopped outside the city, it is well-preserved and a beautiful place to stroll through. Like I said, the crowds were terrible, but in the middle of summer in St. Petersburg, what would I expect? They didn't diminish my experience, I truly enjoyed my visit. :)"

Can stay here for days---the architecture alone is worth exploring. But with limited time in St. Petersburg, one is torn between the museum or the city itself (like Art Buchwald's comedy sketch, \"The 2-Minute Louvre\"). So, the advice is to prepare in advance---know what art you want to see, e.g. the Amber Room (destroyed in WWII and recreated in 2003). Then, you'll have more time to walk St. Petersburg---to feel the city's soul. Later, a canal boat ride, at sunset with wine and cheese, gives a nice overview."

We visited the Winter Palace with SPB Tours who had arranged an early entrance (9:30am) for our small group before the palace opened for regular visitors. This palace is so huge with many rooms that the guide gave us a fast paced commentated tour to enable us to see a good portion of the buildings. The artwork is organised by region, time period, and country with rooms being devoted to each. The collection is unbelievably large with important/famous artists' works. One can only marvel at the budget at the disposal to Catherine II, the collector of these pieces. Being an art history major, our guide focused on certain rooms (we missed the Egypt rooms), certain artists, and certain artworks in a room. There was no lingering at any one spot. With this fast pace, we saw paintings, marble sculpture, tapestries, ornate staircases, rooms with gilt wall trim, and even a hall done up as a copy of a space in the Vatican. While the paintings are labelled in English with the artist's name and name of the painting, and are hung like those in an ordinary art gallery, we relied on the guide's commentary to tell us what we were looking at and its importance to the art movement. Even though we walked miles in that building, I am sure we didn't see all of the rooms during our 2 hour visit, but we did see the \"must see\" paintings usually listed in tourist guides for this attraction. Going on a guided tour with early entrance was great because we weren't pushing crowds, the paintings were not obscured with people's heads, there were no delays in going from room to room, and it was relatively quiet in them."

Do not miss the wondrous Peacock clock! Even if the actual clock is not operating a continual video is displayed nearby. The Renaissance Italian room features works by DaVinci, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Monet, Van Gogh, and Picasso which can be viewed in a fairly short amount of time. A recent worthwhile exhibit is the clothing display. I highly recommend a viewing of the movie \"The Russian Ark\" in which a ghost resides in the Winter Palace and visits many of it's treasures, including the gorgeous Jordan Staircase. Speaking of stairs there are many between floors. If you are able take a lift to the top and make your way downstairs. I did not see many wheelchairs or ramps and the museum gets quite crowded which makes it a challenge to navigate. Buy a skip the queue ticket available online. Note that large bags must be left at coat check and bottles of water are not allowed in any museum in Russia. Non professional photography allowed but no flash."

If you are an art lover it will require days to absorb. Fortunately our guide Olga's training and foresight allowed us to escape all the lines and most of the crowds, and her knowledge of what art was where allowed us to pick and choose, so that we emerged exhausted but fulfilled. The Russian art mostly has moved across the plaza and to the Russian Art Museum, as has much of the collection of French Impressionists. The place was vast and ornate, with loud reverberations and beautiful, intricately decorated inlaid floors, walls and ceilings."

The Hermitage Museum must be the Number One sight to see in St. Petersburg, Russia, for any person who takes the time and makes the considerable effort to visit this amazing city. I know it was number one on my list, for many reasons. Yes, there are other attractions greatly worth seeing -- Trip Advisor says the Church of Our Savior on the Spilled Blood is number one. With all due respect, Trip Advisor is wrong. The latter is a spectacular work of art in the form of a Russian Orthodox Church. There are many such churches in Russia, and quite a few of them are as beautiful, or more so, than the Church on Spilled Blood in St. Petersburg. But there is only one Hermitage Museum on the face of this Earth. At last reckoning, this is the largest museum on the planet. That of course doesn't mean much, if the things housed in it aren't worth seeing. But this Museum contains enough priceless and unique masterpieces of the very highest, the most supreme quality and importance, that it must outrank almost all other museums. The collection of Rembrandt paintings alone is staggering. Not just the number, but the amazing value and significance of ALL the paintings by Rembrandt on display. One painting \u2013\u2013 The Return of the Prodigal Son \u2013\u2013 is thought by many, myself included, to be Rembrandt's greatest work. It was certainly one of his last, and was the fruit of all his years of effort, experimentation, growth, and spiritual development. I could sit in front of it for hours. But this is only a tiny drop in the ocean of this museum's wealth. And beyond that, the collections themselves are housed in the Winter Palace of the Czars in St. Petersburg \u2013\u2013 itself an amazing work of art, filled to the brim with history and historical art and artifacts beyond description. Without question, the Hermitage Museum is the one thing no one should miss seeing in St. Petersburg."

They stream through the Hermitage, group after group, making it impossible for the genuine art lover to have any sort of experience. Their sheer crassness and frenetic picture-taking (why don't they just buy a book on the Hermitage?) will drive you crazy. If you really care for art, you MUST be there on a Wed. evening wnen the museum stays open late. The barbarians all depart by 5:30 PM, and you'll virtually have the place to yourself. However, given the sheer size of the collection, you must give yourself another day and then visit the highlights on Wed. evening."

During our visit they had a temporary exhibition that showed clothes worn by people in Russia from 1700 up to the present day.

We were part of a tour group with a very tight schedule and, even on a timed ticket we had to wait outside for about 15 mins, during which time various people 'accidentally' brushed past us touching our back pockets to see if we were carrying anything of value in them. Once past the chaos around the cloakrooms, toilets & ticket barriers the museum was amazing and it is so vast you can't take in everything on a 2-3 hour taster tour. From ancient to modern art and antiquities there are exhibits from throughout history but mainly focusing on the amazing works of art. Audio guides in different languages are available as well as guide books but as we were on a guided tour we had a constant commentary as well as being reminded to move swiftly along due to other groups being in the area..I loved the temporary exhibition of court dresses and uniforms from the monarchy era but were not allowed any time to look at them as we had to keep moving.Go to admire the priceless collection of art but, if your tour allows you to wander freely with an audio giude i would suggest that this would be a more enjoyable experience as it will give you the freedom to view what you want to see rather than their personal choices.It is a very hot, crowded and tiring on the feet attraction with a number of stairs to climb so i would not recommend it for people with mobility issues or children as there are not a lot of seats to sit on. Again there is the issue of thieves patrolling round and our fantastic tour guide was happy to point them out to us & to remind us to be vigilant at all times."

I went to the Hermitage twice during my visit to St. Petersburg, and I still haven't even come close to seeing even a small portion of their amazing art collection. First, a word about the long waits to get in: If you are not planning to do any of their special room tours (Gold Room etc), it is very easy to avoid the long wait in line: As you walk into the palace garden square, on either side, there are ticket machines. These machines charge slightly more (400RUB) for a ticket, but it was completely worth paying slightly more to avoid the very long line. Once I had my ticket, I was able to simply walk past the long ticket lines (using the group/ticket-holder line), drop my backpack at left luggage, and head inside.While the museum was packed during my visit, since there are so many rooms and exhibits, it was actually very possible to escape the crowds and still see some incredible art.The Winter Palace rooms and Italian art collections are great, but they are (of course) always packed. I found most of the first floor was infested with giant Chinese tour-groups and hordes of cruise tour groups, and sure, they have some great exhibits on the first floor, but I tend to prefer pre-Renaissance art and artifacts, so I gravitated toward the second floor's Byzantine and Oriental rooms (all fantastic, and the artifacts from the silk road are very cool -- The Hermitage branch in Amsterdam currently holds a lot of their best silk road artifacts though, and that is well worth a visit if you're there too). The other area I particularly enjoyed was the ground floor exhibits on ancient cultures (including a room with some amazing 2000+ year old Siberian finds).Many of the collections on the second floor had very few people in them, and even the babushkas were more friendly. A few of them even smiled at me. On the ground floor in the ancient exhibits, again, I was almost alone for most of the time. The museum's collection of Greek and Roman and Egyptian artifacts was great, but it was worth escaping the crowds for some of their lesser-known and more unique rooms."

Best to do with a guide as there are so many tourists that you can get lost and not see half of what you want to see. With a guide you can get to the art you want in double fast time. You also beat the queues to get in as you can get in through a separate entrance. Would totally recommend the hermitage to all. We took 3 teenagers and they all loved it."

The signage is non-existent, the cafes are awful, and the toilet facilities are totally inadequate. Good luck with finding the cloakroom where you left your coats. But if you can endure the discomforts, this is a truly outstanding experience. I suspect that about 3-4 hours in one day is enough for most people--the brain can't take in much more. Plan in advance which paintings you want to see, and leave the rest for next time. This is a set of palaces as well as the world's largest collection of paintings. Be sure to take in all the state rooms, and marvel at both their beauty and the shameless display of wealth and power they represented."

The State Hermitage Museum and Winter Palace is one of those place. Even before we enter the museum, we had made up our mind that we needed to limit ourselves to certain regions of the museum and we did. However the valuable collections within the museum overwhelmed all of us. We all agreed that to do justice to the site we must spend at least 2-3 days to stroll through the place. I believe that the museum can be better appreciated if the collections can be arranged into small sections with different interest in mind. The visitor can have their choice of only the section they are deeply interested in."

Take the voucher and go straight to the front of the queue waiting to get in at the front entrance. The steward will then let you pass.

Buying the tickets is incredibly easy from the machines in the first courtyard and we could not understand why people were queuing. We first visited the main halls of the winter palace. It is incredible to see the lavishness of the tsarist palace. It was so interesting and very beautiful. There is currently an exhibition of clothing from Russian history which we enjoyed.We are a group of language students and art is not exactly our thing, we found it very interesting but difficult to find our way to the pieces which we knew due to the scale of the palace and lack of signage, therefore we did not manage to see many famous works. Additionally there is a very small amount of English information about the pieces, we have all studied Russian but the vocab is very specific and therefore we could not read or understand much of it.I would definitely recommend a visit but suggest getting a tour would be the best way to see the aspects that you want to see. Or alternatively be prepared to walk a lot and spend hours there. Also there seemed to be an extra charge for photography but everyone was taking photos regardless."

You don't get one Van Gogh, you get a roomful. Two rooms of Picasso, a number of rooms ( I lost count) of impressionists and so and so on. You can get up close and personal-- very few protected by glass screens or any other protection, so you can get as close as you want to see the detail. Not all the display conditions are ideal-- the light coming in the big windows on a sunny day causes glare here and there, but that doesn't detract from that fact that literally billions of dollars of art are on display. We tried to book online, but had no joy, but in hindsight probably didn't matter much-- you still need to convert your voucher to a ticket when you arrive. I think best bet is to use the ticket machines inside the courtyard-- simple to use, and you then get in an express queue. We arrived at 10.20am, and were in the museum a few minutes after opening at 10.30. Probably also worth going to the displays you want straight away( there are hundreds of rooms) to beat the tour groups, which tend to move like locusts through the place. Overall, unbelievable art, must see."

Our guide, Alexi, was fantastic; his command of the English language & his knowledge of the arts was extremely helpful. We were thankful he was our guide for both days.As you climb the staircases to enter the museum let your mind wander and you will be momentarily transported back in time to opulent Tsarist Russia. The Hermitage has an immense collection of art and ornately decorated period rooms where you could spend hours at each location. It is a fantastic must-see museum on a par with major museums in other countries; perhaps even better. We were there on an overcast & rainy Tuesday morning at the end of May and it was crowded. Those of us who had raincoats and/or umbrellas had to check them downstairs before we were allowed to enter the museum. Later in the day, at the end of the tour, when we went back downstairs to retrieve our personal belongings, it was chaotic. There were literally hundreds of people moving in every direction trying to retrieve personal items, checking personal items or looking for rest rooms. (This could happen if the museum is crowded & you visit on a day when there is inclement weather.)Bottom line: This is one of the museums you must visit.

The Palace building itself is impressive, the architecture and the rooms are incredibly opulent - always look up and check out the ceilings! When I was there, there was a temporary exhibit of clothing from the Tsarist era. For me this was the most interesting bit - it made the people come alive. You cannot see everything so get a map beforehand and work out what you want to see. I recommend buying a guide book. There are plenty on sale at the various shops and kiosks both within the museum and around the city. The pictures in the book are far better than you will ever get on your camera, and if you have the book then you don't need to worry about taking photos and can actually look at the art! As with everything in St. P, go early to avoid the tours from the cruise ships. Booking your ticket online beforehand (you will need to print it) does help beat the queues."

It can get very crowded, and one can only see a limited number of the many exhibits in any given block of time. Unfortunately, the lighting is often poor, sometimes inadequate for appreciation of the paintings, while in many rooms light streaming through regular plate glass windows reflects off the works. (How long can they go without fading?) Despite the negatives, however, the museums are a must see in St. Petersburg."

Gorgeous building that is being taken care of very well, and inside it's equally as gorgeous, if not more. There is just so much to see and soak in that you can very easily spend a day or more there. Not only is the artwork collection magnificent, but the building itself and the grounds are meticulous in details and history. One tip to visitors, do not wear big coats, or you will have to check them in the coat room. Plus it's quite toasty in the building. We found a couple open windows and rushed to stand by and get some cooler air. Between the hundreds of people in the building and lack of air circulation, the heat was a bit distracting from all of the treasures surrounding us, but you will find pieces that will amaze you and check off those bucket list items, of things to see with your own eyes."

The collection includes an interesting sculpture by Michelangelo and numerous excellent paintings by the masters from Raphael to Da Vinci. We particularly enjoyed a couple of rooms devoted to impressionists, including Degas, Pissarro, Monet, Cezanne, and Renoir. As many have observed, it is impossible to visit the entire collection in a day or two, so having a guide is valuable. We visited selected parts of the second floor for roughly 2-3 hours. At least on the day of our visit, early admission was invaluable since we saw crushes of people trailing our path. Photos without flash are permitted, but paintings are typically covered with glass panels, producing some reflections. We visited the Gold Room, which often involves an extra fee. The collection in the Gold Room is mostly devoted to ancient gold ornaments, dating back before the earliest Greek craftsmen. As one of the Peter the Great's Winter Palace, the Hermitage is also an impressive architectural visit in its own right. In this regard it cannot compare to St. Catherine's Palace for opulent decor. Free bathrooms are best accessed at the beginning of the visit."

All the rooms take your breath away.While we were visiting there was a special exhibition on - costumes - you could spent hours in this one exhibition alone marvelling at the work that went into each gown.qThe Art is fantastic - best exhibition of Impressionist painters outside Paris.Spent a day here and then go back for more!"

I went there 5 minutes before the museum opened and there was a huge queue for the kiosk, where you get your ticket. Although I didn't need to queue more than 15 minutes, I found out that if I just had bought the tickets from the vending machines, I would have just walked to the machine, bought the ticket and walked in. So no need to buy the ticket beforehand.Plan before you go! I knew what I wanted to see, but I didn't plan the route to go. So I ended up bouncing back and forth the Palace. So think beforehand what you want to see and plan the route you will walk beforehand. There are maps available in the net where you can see what is and where. Also you can download such apps for you tablet or mobile. And take into account that the place will be crowded, even from the opening time of the museum.Go beyond, after I had seen what I wanted, I found a very interesting gallery of Siberian history, where there was almost no one else."

I'm glad I can say I've been in it, but once is enough!"

This we did on our first visit, but the second time, a few days later, we found only two completely empty rooms!! No information as to why, or where the paintings had gone (is this the biggest art theft of the century?!), I have tried visiting the Hermitage website and emailing visitor services but the email is bounced back (asking the website manager if the address is incorrect produced no response). This seems a very cavalier attitude for a top-class public attraction.Secondly, our Lonely Planet guidebook assured us that there were plenty of toilet facilities aside from the obvious ones by the entrance. However, according to the Hermitage's own map, there are 2 further loos on the ground floor, *none* on the first floor and *none* on the second floor. The problem is heightened by the fact that there are only two lifts for the main building, only one of which goes to the second floor. Signposting for these facilities is sporadic and unclear. I suffer from bursitis which makes walking difficult, and trailing along the long long corridors searching vainly for a lift (or even a staircase!) was very unpleasant and spoiled the whole experience for me. I hate to think how a seriously disabled person would manage. The cafes are laughably inadequate for the number of visitors; don't bother with them. A world-class institution should do better in the 21st century. And WHERE ARE THE MATISSES?"

Centrally located, it was once a home of the Romanov dynasty and now houses 3 million items, which it has been estimated to take 12 years to see every single object. One of very few palaces or museums where photos, without flash, is allowed - hooray. The Hermitage contains some truly magnificent artworks and sculptures, Rembrandt, Davinci, Michelangelo, Rafael, Monet to name a few. There are also numerous other items to see not forgetting the wonderful internal structure, decorations, tapestries, parquetry floors and so forth. We went one evening when the museum was especially opened for us and so no queues, but I understand during the day it can be wall to wall people inside the Hermitage and therefore long periods of delays getting into the Museum. Whatever it takes, a visit to St Petersburg must include the Hermitage Museum."

Buy the two day combined entrance ticket on-line which allows you entry to the Hermitage and also to five other museums within the next five days - not two! At the Hermitage join the queue for visitors with tickets and proceed to the Information Desk where your voucher will be checked against ID and you will be directed to a special kiosk to collect your tickets. This process took just a few minutes. Once you have passed through security and the turnstiles hire the audio guided tour which comes with a map and suggested route and enjoy! Don't worry about getting lost, there is ample signage and even if you do get a little lost it is a wonderful place to be lost in and you will eventually find your way again!! Allow at least a day and take time out for a snack/meal at one of the cafes on the ground floor. Also don't worry about the crowds. It does get crowded at times but the tour groups move quite fast and it goes from being crowded to just about empty very quickly. We also went on a guided tour but that was not particularly good. The guide appeared to be knowledgeable but spoke very indistinctly. The audio guide is better. Your combined ticket also allows entry to the Winter Palace of Peter the Great and the Menshikov Palace, both well worth visiting and the latter has some stunning interiors, and there was hardly anyone else there when we visited!"

Instead of adding my praise to the millons of others who have been awed by this museum I will give you a helpful hint on how to make sure you are able to get in. We decided to go on the most crowed day, Sunday and during the White Nights. The museum opens at 10:30 am. We got on line at 9:00 am and were among the first on line. By 10 am the line stretched across the plaza to the Peter monument. At about 10:00 am the outer doors were opened and the line moved forward to the inner courtyard. At that point, groups and those with internet tickets were let in first. Finally, those without tickets. We finally purchased our tickets at around 11:15 am. So, unless you are going in the middle of the week in the middle of the Russian winter, get on line early or buy internet tickets or join a group.Inside the museum, expect crowds especially in the Rembrandt rooms. The rooms are very warm so dress appropriately. You an take pictures of the paintings (without flash) but quite honestly given the glare that comes in from the windows, you are better off buying a book of prints. Given all that, the Rembrandt rooms alone make this museum special. We found the ancient art rooms (Roman and Greek) to be less crowed and quite stunning and the original Winter Palace rooms on display are by themselves worth a visit.The cafeteria was crowded but quite efficient and served sandwiches and beer and pastry. The sandwiches were pre-made but quite good and the pastries were excellent. Finally, do not expect to be able to exit the Hermitage and re-enter. The ticket is only good for one entry per day. This means you cannot enter in the morning, exit to have lunch and then get back in. To do that, you will need to purchase another ticket."

There were at least five other ships that we were aware of that docked that same day, so that probably had something to do with the fact that it was soooooo crowded and chaotic at the Hermitage. This made it difficult to enjoy the amazing art in the museum and decor of the rooms in the palace. Plus, our time was limited so we were streaming in and out and often going against the flow of foot traffic. I was particularly taken by the beautiful parquet floors with their intricate designs. I would suggest visiting in the early a.m. when visitor traffic might be lighter. Either way- it is well worth the time to go there."

You simply must purchase tickets online, to bypass the lines. Print your voucher, and stop at the internet ticket kiosk just inside the main gate. They'll give you your official tickets, and photo-permission stickers. Then walk on up to the left of the long line of cruise ship tour groups and head straight to the coatrooms. We did the two-day tickets and still felt like we were just hitting the highlights. My husband and I are both art historians and museum professionals, so were just fine without a guided tour. We could have benefited from some cartography training to follow the maps though. We spent a lot of time lost, and I spent quite some time in lines for the restrooms, of which there aren't many. And good luck finding them when you need one- I'd recommend using the ones down by the coatrooms before you start into the main galleries! We went on a Thursday and Friday in early June, and found the Thursday crowds to be quite reasonable. There was barely a line to get in, and I was thrilled to be able to spend one-on-one time with many of the masterpieces. Friday was a different story! Just stay out of the path of the tours (they won't stick around in one place too long, so just let them march through and go back to whatever you were looking at).The only true negative for me was the condition of many of the paintings. You can definitely tell which ones had received conservation treatment and which ones hadn't. Thick layers of darkened varnish obscured many of the subtleties of color, but with a collection in the millions what can you really expect? I'm jaded by my profession though- a casual viewer is unlikely to notice or be bothered by it! Whether you're visiting for the art, architecture, or interior design, you won't be disappointed!"

I purchased tickets through the Hermitage website and selected only the main museum option> there is an option to include all of the corresponding palaces if one chooses. The coupons were printed out immediately along with a diagram of which entrance to use.There is always some confusion in Russian monuments regarding entrance locations (reason to have a pre-arranged tour). Finally we were able to locate the correct window to submit our vouchers for entry tickets. We did not have to wait in line nor was there a line on a Sat. around 10 A.M.We did not wait for the 2 hour tour in English (additional charge), but decided to wander with our floor map. The Winter Palace is HUGE!!! even though the rooms are labeled, we constantly felt like we were in a labyrinth (not like in the Louvre). The sheer size of the buildings are overwhelming and after 2 1/2 hours, we called it quits. There is a fabulous \"period\" costume exhibition of actual clothing of the Tsar's royal family members and children.

The building is its own work of art. We got early entry tickets through the tour that we booked with Alla Tours. I'm not one to pay extra for that type of thing (or to get up early unnecessarily), so I probably would not have gotten early entry if it hadn't just been included with the tour. But I must advise that it is almost a requirement for this museum. It was incredible when we were virtually alone in the early open hours, but it soon became very crowded, and we were amazed at the huge lines that had formed outside by the time we left a few hours later. I don't know how to get early entry on your own, but definitely spring for it if you can."

The winter palace, the building in which it is housed, was a former residence of the czars. Its stunning beautiful, but more impressively, it is MASSIVE. The current configuration has 2 MILLION square feet of floor space. Never have I been lost that much. So of course the collection is huge. Some really interesting and diverse historical artifacts. The Vatican Museums and the British Museum will always my favorites. But then for me it is the Louvre and this place. And then everything else is a weak imitation. FYI. The Russian transportation system is pretty good. Took the 4 fast train between Moscow and St Petes. Didn't have to fly Aeroflot and got to see some cool Russian country side. And the metros in the city are easy and cheap once you have a metro map in both english and russian."

We chose to go on the Hermitage and Gold Rooms ships excursion..This place is huge and beautifully situated on the banks of the River Neva. Of six buildings of the main museum complex, five, named the Winter Palace, Small Hermitage, Old Hermitage, New Hermitage and Hermitage Theatre, are open to the public. Our guide advised us that there was a charge for taking photographs and quoted us in US Dollars and Euros. I had changed money into Roubles so asked to pay in Roubles (Roubles 175 and this covered it). If you have roubles and don't ask they will take dollars or euros off you. We were also advised that no large bags were allowed inside, nor bottled drinks \u2013 story behind that being in 1985 Rembrandt's painting Danae was damaged by a man who threw sulfuric acid on it and cut the canvas.Our guide, who spoke very good English, gave us headsets and actually did a very good job of keeping us all together. As we went through the various Halls eg Hall of Peter the Great with its beautiful decorations, the Gallery, St George's Hall to name just a few - we were told about the history/stories behind it. We visited the room with the famous Peacock Clock and there is a video showing how it works. Our guide was very amusing and kept us all interested. Next we were taken to the Gold Rooms and surprisingly it was not crowded, so again we could appreciate the wonderful pieces of jewelery and artifacts in gold covered with priceless gems. We spent about 40 minutes here. We then continued on to the Art - Dutch, French, Italian, Impressionist etc and saw paintings by Picasso, Van Gogh, Matisse, Leonardo da Vinci - his famous Madonna Litta and Benois Madonna, Gaugin, Titian, Raphael, Rembrandt. Our guide was very good because he spoke about various paintings and as we had headsets we were able to wander around the room and take photos (without flash). I was particularly interested in the Art so the time spent was too short for me, but to be fair, I did see what I wanted and obviously with a group of about 25 our guide needed to move on. For me this was a wonderful experience, however, we were not allowed time in the Museum shop.A word of warning - on the ship's organised tour (and probably private tours) the guides are obliged to stop off at a Tourist Shop. This lasts about 20-30 mins. We were not allowed time in the actual Museum Shop. I wanted specific postcards of various paintings, however, in spite of being told that the Tourist Shop will have these, they did NOT. I told our guide this and he apologized (as he had told me I could get them there) and suggested I look in the shop at the port. Fortunately I was able to get some but not all of the ones I wanted there.If and when we come again, I would opt for one of the private tours by SPB Tours as these have small groups of about 8-10 people and they also arrange visas etc. However, I was very pleased with the one we did. Such a beautiful place.Definitely not to be missed. Absolutely fantastic."

The magnificent paintings, sculptures, rooms and artefacts are outstanding. We paid for tickets for early opening at 9.15 and it was still packed. However our wonderful guide was able to navigate us quickly through key rooms of interest taking sufficient time to explain the history and origins of the paintings etc we were looking at. Works by Rembrandt , Michelangelo, Monet, to name but a few all came alive under the expert explanation which we would not have understood or fully appreciated without the guide. The place is huge you can easily get lost. The 3 hours we spent was no where near enough but long enough for us on one visit. You will need to check in large bags and long coats so be prepared for queues at the cloakrooms."

The museum building is wonderful, the contents are spectacular and the only reason to not be a 5* review is that it is tricky to navigate yourself around and the crowds are just ridiculous! We had prebooked on the internet and followed the instructions to go to an area under the arches to collect our tickets - unfortunately this is closed, so looking around we saw a sign to go into the main building to collect our tickets - however that is where the signage finished... We had to walk around and have a look to finally come to the information desk which is where you actually get the coupon to then go to a desk to get your tickets. Even with this messing about, it is a _LOT_ better to prebook rather than stand in the very long line to buy tickets.The food inside is not good... I suggest eating a very big breakfast, skipping lunch and when you leave, have an early dinner as the \"cafe\" is minuscule and does not really have much available."

I also downloaded the Hermitage app and had a map of the museum that I made notes on and used to plot a route that incorporated everything on my must-see list. I think this is one museum where it's best to be organized and not wander around in the hopes of spotting what you want to see (unless you have unlimited time or are prepared to come back). I paid to see go on the Gold exhibit tour (the Diamond one was already sold out by the time I made it to the front of the queue) and that also broke up the day nicely. It was incredibly interesting, the tour leader was infinitely knowledgable on the exhibit and was definitely one of the highlights of my day."

The dancing hall is one of the few large rooms we saw devoid of art so you were able to appreciate the room itself. The large peacock clock was also neat, though we were not lucky enough to see it \"go off\". Our guide mentioned that it is set at a secret time for fear that the Hermitage would be inundated with visitors otherwise.We visited the Hermitage as part of a 2 day tour so I had not bothered to read up on it beforehand. I was, therefore, quite surprised at how much western european art were there (some notables being the Rembrandt room, Madonna and Child, and Cupid and Psyche sculpture). It would be wonderful to spend more time in the museum since there is just so much to see but the crowd will probably wear you out first.If you are doing a tour, I would recommend one with headsets. There are so many people there that it would be very hard to to hear your guide even if you are in a really small private group. We had early entrance but it seemed like everybody and their brother was there so I'd hate to see what it's like when it's \"really\" busy though perhaps it was unusually so because the museum is closed on Mondays and we went on a Tuesday."

The joy of the visit starts as you enter the huge palace square and see the wonderful facade of the winter palace,the Alexander Column and the great sweep of the General Staff Building -magnificent. A visit to the Hermitage requires \" military \" planning and we made three visits this year & two in 2011 -starting with obtaining the tickets online. This saves you time on your first visit and as you need more than one visit - the second or third are a breeze as you are in the fast lane. An early start is best -opens at 10.00hrs but there is an entrance at 8.00hrs. if you pay extra. Once in you have to decide what you want to see-this is a huge collection & the following may be of assistance for your first taste :* Jordan Staircase* State rooms including the two throne rooms, gold drawing room, boudoir, malachite drawing room and a selection of different rooms from various czars including the library.* Impressionists - fantastic collection on the third floor* Peacock clock* Rembrants -magnificent* Two beautiful paintings by Leonardo da VinciIf your interest is the collections of the Ancient World,Far East & Russian icons then you will not be beaten by the guided tours that are whisked around at speed .Our strategy was let them in & out - then have a quiet look before the next horde descended - and this May ! You need a map to get around & you will still find it difficult to get to the rooms you want - but this is an opportunity to see other things. A Marvelous collection and one of the best museums in the world."

Just when you think you've finished one section, there's another and another and another......it's surreal. There were long lines, and we did use the kiosks, but word of caution, make sure the one you jump on takes credit cards (some do not). Also, they do not work well if it is raining (for real). The currency readers have a hard time with humidity and keep returning your ruble notes (as we found out, when we mistakenly hopped onto a kiosk that did not take credit cards...and yes, it was raining).We also found that the lighting in some of the rooms was quite bad. I'm not quite sure why that was. I work in a historic home where I am from with original paintings from the 1800's and we keep the lights off for tours, using only the window daylight for lighting to preserve things, so maybe that is why they keep certain rooms darker.Our tour books complained about the 2 cafes in the Hermitage as far as pricing and food quality was concerned. I think that given the size of this museum there would be more than 2 cafes (which were quite small), but, knowing there were only two and that the offerings might be questionable, we had a big breakfast before going in. When we decided to see what the cafes were like we went off of the main lunch hour (after 2pm) and had no problem with lines or seating at the internet cafe.Actually, we had a small pizza, sandwich and an awesome piece of cake (which they were bringing in from a local bake shop) with our coffees for about 25$, which was about right for museum prices, so I don't know what the tour books were so down about.Bring comfortable shoes, have a plan, eat well beforehand, and enjoy yourself. You'll not see a more impressive collection of artwork under one roof anywhere else. And, we made this mistake: Even though the Faberge Eggs were manufactured in St. Petersburg, they are not in this museum collection. You have to go to the Kremlin Armory Museum in Moscow to see these little beauties!If you are in St. Petersburg for a week, you can hop the Sapsan (high speed train at 6:45am or 7am or so) and be in Moscow in 4 hours---it'd be a quick day trip, or if you are planning from home, like we did, we tacked it on as a final 2 nights out from St Petersburg) to go see them."

We were travelling on our own - not part of a group tour and had booked tickets online, in order to avoid queues. The booking process was simple, but collecting the tickets was not. We were first sent off to entirely the wrong place but after a bit of perseverance we were issued our tickets from booth 5 (KACCA 5 for anyone planning an imminent visit).Inside the museum, the various gallery attendants were mostly the grumpy, unhelpful, over-50's type that we have come to know rather well on our short tour of this unmemorable country. We were looking for one particular painting, but none of the attendants seemed to know where it was and we were sent off on various wild goose chases before finally giving up. We also wanted to visit the Islamic gallery, but it was closed for renovation although some items were apparently displayed downstairs in a temporary display. Except they weren't. On the plus side, there were some lovely paintings displayed, however the lighting was poor and a number of artworks were very hard to see due to either too much lighting or not enough.In general, we felt the place exuded that good old Russian 'couldn't care less' attitude that has characterised our visit to this country. What a shame. It should and could be one of the great galleries of the world."

There are vending machines where you can buy tickets and just bypass the queues. This will not allow you to get student or resident discounts, but the fee is not that high (400 Rubles). There is also a permit for private photography, but nobody really cared, so you can pretty safely ignore this regulation. There are plenty of cloakrooms - don't rush to the first you see, as this will naturally be the most crowded one. There could be more toilets in the museum. Now for the collections: Splendid. Probably the best and vastest collection I have seen. The only one that it compares to is probably the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The comparison with the Louvre or the Prado is a joke really: Both are much smaller in what they display - let alone their archives being much smaller as well. The collection is impressive: Excellent Antiques, 2 da Vincis, 25 Rembrandts, numerous Rubens, Goya, Picassos, Manets, van Goghs, Monets, Manets ........ very easy to spend several days in the museum if you want to see it all - including interesting collections on russian pre-historic development. There are audio guides in various languages. Also the presentation seems to be quite stable: I used a guidebook from 1972(!) which was still a great tool for some background information and for finding various pieces of art."

So leave any unnecessary stuff either in your room or on the tour bus. Pictures are allowed so be sure to bring a camera.

This could have explained the queues, but it seems from other reviews that this is usually the case. That said, it only took us about 40 minutes of queuing. If you prebook, you get to jump the queue. We paid an extra 200 rubles to be able to take photographs though. This is quite common in Russian attractions, we noticed. The museum was quite crowded, but we managed to dodge the tour groups and found quiet spots. The Hermitage offers a very nifty iPhone app that operates off the museum wifi network. Look for it at the entrance and download it there, where signal is strong. It tells you where you are, and labels each hall. It helped us find the bathrooms, as well as the exit. Avoid the bathroom in the main lobby near the cloakroom as it's crowded and not very clean. We found quieter bathrooms on the upper levels that were better. You are required to check back packs etc into the cloakroom. You are also not allowed to take drinks into the museum. All handbags and purses go through a scanner. Carry your valuables on your person as the storage cloakroom doesn't look very secure. We spent about three hours there, and that was enough, as it was very crowded. We found the artworks very interesting, especially those by the masters like Picasso, Matisse and Gaugin. We also enjoyed the Egyptian civilization hall."

In the press of bodies while trying to retrieve my bag and coat someone managed to steal the lens right off my camera which was on a strap around my neck and only out of my hand for a minute while reaching to grab my bag.

This service is free.I do not recommend this for people who have small children. My observation when I was at the museum observed a peaceful serenity... in all honesty I do not recall seeing any children at all! The museum itself is very large and you could easily spend most of your day here.

You must leave coats in the cloakroom, which takes time, so go without if you can. We went on the Gold Room tour as well, which is very interesting. The museum is open until 9 pm on Wednesdays which gives you more time, although it was busier that day. We visited every room over the 2 days and saw so many beautiful and interesting things away from the crowds. The audio guide gave useful facts and information about the paintings. Don't forget to look down,as the intricate designs in the parquet flooring are amazing. This museum was the highlight of our trip!"

Everybody coming and going through the same door!!! If you had to make a fast exit due to illness you would be out of luck.The collections are magnificent as is the interior of the building but was ruined by the number of people that are allowed in at once, you just cannot appreciate the art around you because you are swept along in a tidal wave of people. Officials of the museum really need to step back and see what can be done to improve this situation."

You are not allowed to take in any liquids, which is fair enough. But it is almost impossible to get a drink of any kind in the museum. We found one coffee kiosk with 2 people serving and a huge line of customers most of whom -like me- gave up because my time ran out. The only seats I could see we're for the security guards.

Almost no English speaking staff. Extremely crowded which cannot be controlled unlike the afore-mentioned museums.In terms of collection I would say the other museums mentioned above are much better and comprehensive except the peacock clock which is the most beatiful and intricate clock I've ever seen in my life and perhaps the royal attire collection.I'd say if you have been to the British Museum, etc., but you would like to see Russian art, then visit the State Russian Museum instead, even if you would like to enjoy the interior of Hermitage due to the fact that it used to be a palace-- because you may visit the Catherine Palace in Peterhof instead.In any case don't pay extra for the Old Winter Palace beside Hermitage which is totally a crap."

In the St Peter and Paul church, with its extraordinary profusion of gold leaf, we were unexpectedly given a short a capella concert of Russian church music by five black-cassocked Orthodox monks which was superb and deeply moving. Then, in the exquisite palace theatre in the Hermitage we attended a magnificent performance of Swan Lake by the St Petersburg ballet company which was magical. Next morning, room after masterpiece-laden room in the Hermitage Museum itself. Absolutely unforgettable."

This is an absolute must experience in St Petersburg, whatever interest you are in Hermitage has something for you.A few tips to best enjoy the whole experience. 1/ go \"early\" meaning opening time 10.30 am; I did and there was absolutely NO queue ! 2/ pre purchase your ticket online, ideally take the 2 days one (it includes the picture taking and 4 other sites). Print the voucher and bring your ID.3/ check before hand which expo is on and the different areas. Hermitage is huge so you might as well start with what interest you the most.4/ personally big fan of paintings (European) so went straight to 1st floor (which has THE most sumptuous palace rooms) then 2nd floor. If I was to redo it I will start with 2nd floor and chances are that I would be alone with the Matisse, Renoir, Monet, Picasso and the list goes on! To do so, take the corridor on the right after ticket check/ before staircase, keep going straight and at the end take a right. Further there is an elevator that will take you straight there. You can then enjoy the 1st floor and if you still have energy the ground floor (Egypt / antiquity). Enjoy!"

You do need a whole day (and preferably more), and don't be fooled by the understatement of some of the basic guide materials. Rooms which aren't deemed important enough to have a highlight on them in the main plan can still turn out to be stuffed with some of the best paintings produced in Western Europe in the last 500 years. Do get an audio guide. Some of the observations are relatively banal but as a whole, the coverage is admirable and you really won't know what you are looking at without somebody, real or artificial, whispering in your ear. If you can, buy your tickets in advance on the internet - this comes with the camera permission you should technically have to take pictures (always without flash) with a little blue sticker to show you've paid the fee. And take the odd break in the cafe just to get your breath. It's a huge visit."

Some practical info though: Definately try and book online, you can stroll straight past the never-ending queue. You have to go through the first door to reception who will endorse your email confirmation, then towards the cloakroom to booth 4 if i recall, who will give you the actual ticket! Very long-winded, but this is Russia! Also beware: If you don't get there early, you will queue once to get in to buy a ticket - as you do, no real issue with that, BUT then you will queue for what could be hours to deposit bags and coats if you need to - the problem here is they don't have anywhere near enough pegs for the shear volume of people coming in - so you may be waiting for someone who has finished their visit of the Hermitage to leave! When we left at about 2pm, there was a long queue of about 40 people just stood waiting in front of a bored-looking cloakroom attendant sat at the desk who jumped up when we presented our coat token, and a very relieved and thankful American couple at the front of the line said we had made their day! (No idea how long they had been waiting but I wish I'd asked them now!) My advice - either get there at opening time at 10am or try and not wear a coat, or bring loads of bags/umbrellas etc with you, then you can walk straight into the museum (Difficult, I know especially in the rain and in winter)."

            "review": "Art? What art?. I'll explain. The moment you enter the Hermitage, you'll have real trouble enjoying all of the beautiful art it has on its display, because the building is an art in itself. So, some useful advice for first-time goers:It's essential you get your online tickets beforehand if possible to guarantee your immediate entrance. Even though it's possible to buy the tickets on the spot, the queues might be long, depending on the time of the day. Then comes the queuing for the cloakroom and so on.You also need to determine the length of your visit. You can basically run through all of the rooms and make it in half a day, or really dedicate your time. Lonely Planet has a very useful route suggested which maps all of the highlights of the museum. You can find it in the St. Petersburg chapter of their Russia guide. Anyway if you're really short for time, or just are aware that it's simply too much for your attention for one day, have a look at the map museum provides and check out the rooms with the highlights. If you've been maybe to the Moscow museums, or the gallery in Mikhailovsky palace, then go and see mainly the ornate state rooms and large galleries with tapestries. And the golden peacock, of course. I would try and see the main sights on your first visit and dedicate yourself to the art on display after the bling loses its initial shocking effect. I found it much more overwhelming on the first impression, than, let's say, Louvre or British Museum. Anyway a gorgeous museum, and a must-see in St. Petersburg. And their giftshops have an amazing collections of really pretty souvenirs. I recommend malachite jewellery or crystal-ware."

The Hermitage museum is fantastic on at least two levels(a) it was a Palace and quite a few room have been left in the style of a Palace(b) its a great art gallery with a very broad collection of art. In Planning your visit I would suggest the following(1) go on a week day and buy your tickets from the ticket machine in the inner courtyard. You can then enter almost immediately. In any event the fastest way in is to buy your ticket from a ticket machine dont get in the queue to buy tickets.. Remember you need to pay a separate fee if you want to photograph of 200 roubles...The Museum is open longer on a Wednesday.(2) They have a rule ..No Pass outs..Pretty well adhered to. The Cloak room is before you enter the museum so if you are going to need to get anything from the cloak room whilst doing your tour, such as medicine or spare camera battery take it with you dont leave it in your bag in the cloak room(3) Focus on the layout when you enter. As others have said it can be a frustrating building to get around..particularly if you want the toilet or a coffee. You can get free a basic museum guide and you will see the museum is 3 buildings...the quite large building you enter... a skinny building it adjoins and a third building..Focus on how these connect because to get to toilet or coffee you really have to get back to the main building you enter(4) Focus on what you want to do. We focused on the official Palace Rooms and some areas of art in visit 1 and other areas of art in day 2(5) we found a book with a Rembrandt Painting of a red man on the cover very helpful as it had a separate section showing the official Palace rooms and gave major details of the paintings(6)dont think you can do this place justice in a few hours... you simply cant so dont be overambitious in your plans.. I would estimate 3 days minimum to do this and then there are another Museum across the square in the former military quarters,(7) we found the staff friendly and helpful but they dont speak English ( except for a few) and we didnt speak Russian so communication at times was difficult, for toilets, food and how to get to other rooms, but they tried to help and often showed us where to stand to photograph, pointed out other rooms where an artist was if they saw us interested in a particular artist..."

Not entirely sure how any review can do justice to what is surely the most spectacular museum in the world.Where to start? the collection of artwork, from Picassos to Monets to Van Goghs to surely everything else in between is phenomenal. Egyptian antiquaries, Greek/Roman pottery, the collection of statues from all ages, tapestries the size of houses, Far Eastern relics... Suits of armour, paintings, honestly, a list of endless things to see.We went for two days (admittedly, not full days for a couple of reasons), and we still didn't see everything.And yet, even to discuss such artwork is to almost miss the point. I never imagined going to a museum with that line-up of artists, and find them coming second to the venue itself. The most incredible building I've ever seen, and the most beautiful building we saw in St Petersburg (which is saying something, given the preponderance of palaces). Every time you walk into a new room, there is something new and beautiful and amazing just in the ceiling-work, or the walls, or even the floors, or all three. Amazing architecture, varied, intricate, beautiful, breathtaking. Honestly, removing every single piece of art wouldn't diminish the place, such is the grandeur and beauty within. To add in world-famous art is simply the icing on top of the cake.There are a couple of things worth noting, though, if you are a first-time visitor -1. Russian bureaucracy is epic, and is perfectly demonstrated here. Be ready to queue, and plan everything in advance. Firstly, get your tickets online and skip the massive queues just to get to the ticket office (and when you do, make sure you go to the information desk to get your pass signed to go to the ticket office, where there will be a queue with people randomly pushing in.2. You can't take your coats inside - if you are going in a group, split up, and dump off your coats in the vast cloakroom to save time.(we ended up queuing in the ticket line before being sent away, and then the entry line before being sent away, which might only have cost us 15 minutes, but was enough to frustrate).GO early, spend lots of time there. It will be busy, people will push past and around you, and groups will randomly materialise from nowhere to stand in front of you because they can. Rooms will randomly go from full to empty and back again in the space of 3 minutes. It is crazy and beautiful and an absolute must-see."

The free cloakroom facilities were much appreciated and the architecture and exhibits were fantastic. You need stamina and plenty of time to make the most of the visit and it's worth doing some research beforehand to ensure that you focus on the parts that are of interest to you - there's too much to see and take in in one day, so you need to accept leaving some sections out or returning for multiple visits."

But because of mismanagement, it has lost all its museum power to provide a good experience for visitors. Personally, it leaves a bad impression and bad memory to me. This is easily the most chaotic museum I have visited. There is no control of visitor flow or order for queue. It is like a flea market with people frantically pushing and jumping the queue. There is not enough info or signage inside the museum and when there is one, it leads you to someplace closed!! No AC, no ventilation, the place is hot and stuffy and crowded.Finally, the staff here is the most grumpy and unwilling staff that I have encountered in my years of travelling. Every member of the staff was rude, unhelpful and openly displaying their dislike for foreign visitors. When ask about a direction, they will simply point to the signage without utter a word or even look at you. But the signage is not relevant to the one I am asking about, Such arrogance!! Probably should just shut down this place if they are so unwilling to accommodate visitors, they act as though they were doing us a huge favour by letting us see the collection we'd paid handsomely. The cloakroom area is crowded with people waiting at the booth nearest to the entrance because the next booth or the booth next down the hall wouldn\u2019t take any coat. Note these booth staff are either chatting or simply just sitting idly. The staff manning the functioning cloakroom keep shaking her head and huffing and sighing as if taking and hanging the coat is the hardest work on the planet.I decided to join the expensive guided tour which gave me a bit of general information about the collection and winter palace. Finally the guide is the only person that I have met in Hermitage that still has a bit of sense of humour in her. After the tour, I rewalk the guided tour route and appreciate the collection in more details at my own pace as one simply has to make the best of a bad situation."

            "review": "breathtaking environment, above-average collection. I have just visited the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg. It is true that the full collection would take many days to view each item - but that is not how the average person enjoys a museum. I picked the 'stars' in the collection and had a very satisfying afternoon. The musuem has a very fine collection of grecian vases, classical and post-renaissance sculpture, with one or two outstanding items such as Canova's Three Graces. It also has an excellent collection of Italian, Dutch and Flemish old masters, with Rembrandt and Reubens very well represented, again with a few thrilling highlights like The Return of the Prodigal Son and two exquisite small paintings by Leonardo. They also have a minor but still-pulsating statue of a crouching boy by Michelangelo. There are some lovely French impressionist and post-impressionist works, as well as a good selection of Picasso's works. But most of the sprawling collection is overwhelmed by the sheer, almost orgiastric opulence of the succession of exhibition rooms. Marble, precious stone and metals of every hue and in gob-smacking quantity, in doors, furniture, walls, window frames, columns, ceilings.You can really imagine the Winter Palace, that was the main residence of the reigning Romanov dynasty for 200 years, at the centre of a vortex that sucked the riches of the Russian empire and transformed them into marvels. It even puts the Versailles palace in the shade. So it is well worth visiting the Hermitage to see the setting itself, what used to be the Winter Palace and the Old and New Hermitage that now make up the museum. As for the collection itself, it has some fine highlights, but I have seen better at the Louvres, the British Museum and the Vatican Museums."

You\u2019ll need a drink, because it gets warm in there.The art is stunning, but the rooms and furnishings are equally gorgeous. As part of the cruise package, we got to go down to the Treasure Gallery. It\u2019s a lot of ancient items made with precious metals. No photos are allowed in there. The Hermitage docent is required to speak in Russian, and then our guide would translate into English. Humorously, the docent corrected the English translation several times (speaking to our guide in Russian, of course). It was really warm and stuffy in the Treasure Gallery. Having to say the spiel twice takes a long time, so we finally tuned them out and wandered around on our own. You can\u2019t leave until the group does, so that contraband water bottle came in handy (out of sight of the security cameras, naturally).The Hermitage is wonderful and if we get back to St. P, we\u2019ll try to spend a lot more time there."

The da Vincis are dull, the Caravaggios wicked, the Breguels in a corridor, almost abandoned are superb, the 20 c collection breathtaking. But these did not make the collection so special, it was the ambience, the history of how Catherine amassed such works, the dedication of the Babushkas, the history during the siege of the city in WW2, the cats,What did I take away from my visit. I think that a bit more explicit respect of Russia articulated clearly to the Russian people would go a long way to recalibrate relations between Europe and Russia. Quite clearly, they are equals with a magnificent cultural, artistic and intellectual hinterland. We need to engage as partners and move on, together. Get your act together Europe."

The rooms, staircases, and architecture are a feast for the eyes and worth the visit even if the rooms weren't filled with art. Speaking of the collection - amazing! That said, we found the docents difficult to communicate with. We had purchased our tickets online and downloaded the map app for our phone. Still, we couldn't find what we were looking for in many cases. For example - there was a Kandinsky room on the map and app, and yet, it wasn't there. We went to the appropriate numbered room and there was not a single Kandinsky piece in it. We asked numerous docents, each of whom sent us somewhere else. We never found them. Perhaps they were on loan or in storage, but we were not able to have that communicated to us. Like many non-US museums, the art could be better conserved. Still, it is an amazing place to visit. The collection is superb. We spent two days visiting and it still wasn't enough to see everything. My favorite was the spectacular golden bird automaton!"

The Main Staircase, The Peter Room, The 1812 War Gallery and The Large Throne Room were our favourites. When it comes to art, we all have our own favourites, but whatever your taste it will be well catered for, the world\u2019s greatest artists are all represented many times over and this may be your only chance to view these particular pieces. Photography is allowed but we recommend you buy a book e.g \u201cTHE HERMITAGE\u201d by Alfa Art Publishers, which contains the history and a description of the Winter Palace and its contents. It also contains hundreds of photographs that you would love to have taken, if only you had the time and opportunity.

We got a softly spoken, abrupt and frankly boring lady of advanced years as our guide. The tour is scheduled for 1.25 hours. After 35 minutes of looking at the gold up to the first century AD, which was admittedly, amazing, we went, with several other tour members, to look around a bit in the next room. Oh no we won't. A very large, aggressive and threatening gentleman bellowed that we must \"go to group, stay in group\" and marched us back. Well, not all of us; 3 of the group walked out. The rest of the trip we were closely monitored by this gentleman.However, this would have been fine if the Gems room had not been such a huge disappointment. We weren't expecting the Crown Jewels, but this was basically, personal dress jewellery from a variety of people with a few other pieces, displayed in basic cases.Hermitage is a must...but invest your time in the place .....not the tour."

There is no air conditioning and windows are left open. Masterpieces sit in direct sunlight. The Impressionists are kept in on the top floor, under fluorescent lights on white particle board. The curators should be sent back to school. Your enjoyment of any museum is dictated by the way you see the art. The Hermitage leaves much to be desired.There is no restaurant, wine bar or amenities of any kind. There's one place you can buy awful, stale, overpriced sandwiches and sit in a hallway to eat. If you are familiar with the Louve and think you are going to find the same level of food, wine, coatrooms, restrooms and museum store, think again. The Met, the Louve, the Prado, The National Gallery of Art, the British Museum and the Philly Museum of Art are all much better in every way. The Hermitage doesn't even have a Vermeer. There is impressive art, but the overall experience I had at the museum completely distracted me from the collections.One of the biggest disappointments was The Treasure Rooms. I thought that would be the highlight of the tour. However, once we arrived at the museum, we were told it was an additional $278 USD per person to visit the special gold and diamond Treasure Rooms. Since there were 3 of us, we passed on yet another version of the \"Russian shakedown of American tourists.\" What I would recommend is that you pay the extra money to get early entry. We arrived at 8 am and had the museum pretty much to ourselves for about 2 1/2 hours. Once the cruise ship people start to roll in, the galleries were so crowded you couldn't see a thing. We left about 3 pm and there were approximately 1,000 people in line. What these poor folks thought they were going to do in 2 hours in one of the largest museums in the world is beyond me.Should you go? Well, if you are in St Petersburg, then yes. It's why you go to St Petersburg. The other attractions are very interesting and all, but the Hermitage is the highlight. Just be prepared. Go early and don't get your hopes up too high. Remember, it's Russia."

It is not only an art museum, but a palace as well. Because it is so massive and usually you are with a tour, you are pushed through the place rather quickly. We would have loved to have spent more times in certain rooms. (We would enjoyed more time with the impressionists and post impressionists for example.) Second: We saw several people having difficulty with all the walking and the lack of places to sit. Each room has a Russian lady who seems to be the guard. They get tired of sitting so they go off to visit with friends. Then, you can sneak over and sit for a moment. I did that a few times. I did see people who left their tours so they could find a place to rest. There is special help for people in wheelchairs, but you have to contact the museum. There is more than one floor to the museum.Third: Besides having the most paintings on display in the world, there were other outstanding pieces of artwork that I saw people just walking by without really looking. There was some blown glass pieces that were just beautiful. There were huge Empire-style vases made of semi-precious stones that took years to produce. The wood patterned parquet floors flooring and the mosaic flooring were beautiful as well. The ceilings were amazing too. It is just a remarkable place! After talking to others in different tours, the guides can make a difference on what is emphasized. Some are more knowledgeable than others. Our guide knew little about the vases and yet our friend's guide new about the vases in detail."

The palace sits upon one the largest squares I've ever seen. Interestingly, there weren't any food or souvenir vendors on the square the day we were there. That certainly added to the regal atmosphere. We had purchased tickets online as was recommended. For these tickets you must turn in the voucher at a kiosk located outside the palace. It is right inside the middle archway. We did not enter this way and had some trouble claiming our tickets, but the staff worked it out. Once inside there are several tours to choose from. We did the tour of the palace rooms as we could not resist the splendor as we caught views of the main staircase. We were not disappointed! We were there for the peacock clock demonstration which was wonderful and I highly recommend. Each room in the palace was more beautiful than the last. Most impressive were the floors. Each room had its own design and the floors were made from the most beautiful woods. We also took the time to view the Dutch painters as this is a part of the world we aren't very familiar with. The Rembrandts were amazing and we carved out time to visit one of the many gift shops to purchase a copy of one of his paintings. We elected to do the museum with the audio guide and were quite pleased. We prefer the freedom of moving at our own pace and the audio guide had more than enough information. The employee at the audio center spoke excellent English and was a tremendous help getting us set up. Because of the size of the building, it can feel overwhelming, but truly worth the time."

However, although the French Impressionist wing has a significant and well done collection, the guides treat it as an option in favor of the more traditional, and Russian artifacts. I suppose this is to be expected.The highlight for me was seeing the extremely large Badakhshan Vase, which towers 6 feet above visitors heads, made from the brilliant blue stone lapis lazuli from Afganistan."

After seeing most of the other major art museums in Europe, the Rijks, the Louvre, Vatican Museum, Uffizi and Prado, this museum was on our hit list. The art itself is very beautiful and interesting. There are lots of pieces to see. Unfortunately, compared to other museums, they are a little lacking in some areas. The crowds were enormous and it was difficult to move around the building. There were way to many people in the rooms and since you generally have to follow the same walking pattern around the building for the first bit, it was very frustrating. There is no AC in the building so that with all of these people, you better check your coat and have lighter clothing on because it rapidly becomes a sauna. I don't believe that this is good for the preservation of the art. Lastly, people get much closer to the art here than a other museums which I don't believe is good as well.Overall we were disappointed with the museum, its collection is vast and can certainly require a 2 day visit, but I don't think we could handle the environment. Definitely not the best museum in Europe for us."

This museum alone would make the trip worthwhile if you have an even passing interest in art. This is far and away the greast art collection in eastern Europe and can legitimately be mentioned in the same sentence as the Louvre and Prado. The setting itself in the Winter Palace is simply overwhelming; despite the dozens of magnificent canvases in many galleries I find myself lost in the archtecture of the building itself. The collection of western art is encyclopedic from Greek statuary to the early 20th century masters, plus there are nooks and crannies on the upper floor where you can find unique things such as thousand year old Armenian illuminated manuscripts. I have heard horror stories about immense lines amd crowds during the summer, but going in the off season (I was most recently there in mid November) is a different story. I got to the entrance at 1020h. (opening is 1030h) and there were exactly 6 people ahead of me and for much of the morning there were rarely more than a few people with me in a particualr gallery. A few minor points; there are only a few places to go between floors, this can lead to much time spent backtracking. Bathroom facilities are also rather sparse apart from those near the entrance and cloakroom. Eating options are also quite limited and a bit pricey. These should discourage no one; just be prepared."

Our guide had an idea of what we wanted to see so was able to maximise our time there. The place is huge and you really need to know your way around if you don't want to waste time. Some of the treasures are so breathtaking it's easy to lose sight of the stunning architecture which houses them. We visited the gold room and the diamond room which were separate additional tours but well worth the extra cost and time. The art exhibitions rival any in other major cities with many very important pieces. We could have spent a jaw dropping week here and still gone back for more!"

When you have a group of 5 people and rather limited time it makes a perfect sense to hire a private tour guide to get the most of this beautiful museum and its collection.Our Russian friends recommended Irina Seits as one of the best in the business. She exceeded all our expectations. Irina expertly guided us through the most interesting exhibits (given our time constraints) and was able to answer all questions related or unrelated to Hermitage in surprising depth.What stands Irina apart from other tour guides we've hired before is her passion and enthusiasm about the history and excellent American English -- she spent a year in Utah as an exchange student.In short, Irina was able to enhance our experience of Hermitage so much that it became a highlight of our trip to St. Petersburg.The fee was much less than what you would pay for private guide in Vienna or Jerusalem.We can highly recommend Irina Seits to anyone who wants to makes the most from a visit to Hermitage or other museums in St. Petersburg.Irina can be reached at irina.seits@sh.se or at +7 921 754 1646"

My friends andI traveled to Russia on the Gate 1 Russian River Cruise in September/October 2013, and I would highly recommend this tour. It is a good value for a complete experience. Before I left, I had many questions, so I wrote this review to help others who will be taking this cruise.Ship: Our ship was the MS Zosima Shashkov. The ship was built in 1986, has been refurbished, and is in very good condition. Clean, comfortable common areas, lounges, and bars on 4 floors. There are 2 large dining rooms. Our room was small\u2014just big enough for 2 single beds with a table between them and a window above. There were shelves and a closet to store our clothes and other items. Space under the bed to store a small suitcase. The bathroom had a toilet and a sink, and a shower curtain that wrapped around when you used the shower. Sure, the entire sink area got wet when you showered, but there was a high shelf over the toilet that could hold things that you didn\u2019t want to get wet. It was a way of saving space and it worked well. Each bed had a built-in light in the wall. There was one 220-V outlet with 2 places to plug in items. The small refrigerator was plugged into one of the sockets. Be sure to bring a 220-V adapter for charging electronics that are 220-V compatible, and a converter if your item is not 220-V compatible. If you have many things to plug in, bring a multiple tap to provide extra plug-in space. At the reception desk, they lent out 220-V hair dryers, but wanted them back after each use, so if you can bring your own 220-V hair dryer, you will save a lot of time. The ship offered wi-fi internet in the Small Bar at the front of the ship. Connections were spotty and depended on the ship\u2019s location. Sometimes we had good connections and speed. We soon realized that we could almost always get connected when we were going through the locks.Food: The food was excellent! They offered many authentic Russian and local dishes on the menu. Meals were attractively displayed, tasty, and varied. There was more than I could eat! Breakfast was buffet style, with a variety of omelets and sausages, sweet rolls, fruit, juice, and yogurt. Coffee and tea was available throughout the day. For lunch and dinner, we selected our choice of soups, entrees, and desserts from a menu for the next day. There was usually a salad or appetizer. There was enough variety to please everyone at our table. We received a bottle of water at the lunch and dinner meals. Wine, beer, and sodas were complimentary at the dinner meal. For ease with the menu orders, we were required to sit at the same table for all the lunch and dinner meals. This was a nice way to get to know some new people.Tours: Many shore excursions were included in the cruise package. Each one included a local guide who spoke English and provided abundant information. Headsets were provided to listen to the guides with ease while we walked in various areas. We had a great guided tour through the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. The museum is so large that the guide was very helpful to get us to see the best artwork. Additionally, each group had our own guide from the ship who constantly watched out for us on the various tours. Katya, our group guide, was always at the end of the group, smiling, and making sure that we kept up. She was willing to take our picture for us at various sites\u2014and she is a good photographer! Tour busses were comfortable. Some extra tours were available for an extra cost. There was something for everyone. I highly recommend the Catherine\u2019s Palace and Peterhof Park tour, Rivers and Canals of St. Petersburg after dark, Moscow at night and Metro Tour, and the Armoury Museum of the Kremlin if these are available. We were not able to book these tours before the cruise. We signed up for these optional tours during the cruise. My only complaint about the tours was that I would have liked to spend more time at some of the sites.Tips: Bring some one dollar US bills to give tips of $2 to $4 to the local guides and bus drivers. You can tip them with Rubles that you get at an ATM machine, but these ATMs usually dispense large bills and sometimes it is hard to get small bills in change. There are many local tours along the way. For the cruise staff and tour director, either bring US dollars or get Rubles from an ATM machine to pay these larger amounts at the end of the tour. Many street vendors take US Dollars or Euros as well.Entertainment: The staff provided enjoyable shows with talented singers, dancers, and musicians, all in native costumes.Activities: A variety of activities were offered during the cruise. One could participate in Russian language class, learn local dances, music, and culture, watch history movies, attend a tea ceremony, meet the Captain on the bridge, or be in a talent show. Throughout the cruise, there were times to attend very informative talks about the ports which we would be visiting. Some fun events included a pirate scavenger hunt and a dance contest. The optional Vodka Tasting was well worth the extra cost as there were delicious appetizers to go along with the vodka and special entertainment. Dress was casual on the ship. Some people dressed up a bit for the Captain\u2019s Dinner, but it was not required.Staff: All of the staff members were professional, friendly, and helpful. Tour Manager, Tanya, was friendly and answered any questions we had along the way. She seemed to be involved in everything!Visa: We used the tour\u2019s agency to arrange for our visas. It worked out well.Flight: We flew to Moscow from JFK Airport on Aeroflot Russian Airlines. Our flight left JFK 2 hours late and we were concerned about our connecting flight to St. Petersburg since that flight was due to take off before we landed in Moscow. To our amazement, when our group of about 30 deplaned, we were greeted by a Gate 1 representative who quickly guided us through immigration and customs and got us to our connecting flight in record time. We were surprised that they held the plane for our group, even though we were very late arriving. From then on, we were very well taken care of, and felt much more at ease. Tanya was waiting at the gate in St. Petersburg (and it had been a long wait).I highly recommend the Gate 1 Tour. It was an enjoyable way to visit St. Petersburg and Moscow and sites in between."

That's why NO BIG BAGS OR BACKPACKS in the museum in purpose to prevent possiblity to damage precious decor of the rooms. After a act of vandalism happened in 1987 wnen Rembrandt painting was damaged by the acid brought in the water bottles - bottles of water are not allowed, too. But in the lobby there are 2 cafeterias and 1 internet-cafe, so if you get tired and thirsty you can come down and have some coffee breake. Then continue your discovery of Leonardo and Rafael, Caravaggio and Tician as well as French Impresionists, Egiptian mummies, Greek sculptures or just find a window where Nicolas II crabbed on the window glass his nickname.Make sure this museum is good for well fit visitors: 5 adjucent bldgs, 2 stories and almost no banches for rest except of lobby."

You can\u2019t see everything and after spending a few hours there you feel overwhelmed by the size of the complex and the many rooms of beautiful art work, sculptures and furnishings. We visited with our tour group and were taken to all the main attractions in the Hermitage complex. We spent the majority of time in the Winter Palace. The Jordan Staircase, Throne Room and The Raphael Loggias and The Malachite Room were my favorites. The green stone in The Malachite Room was mined in the Ural Mountains and the color is so rich and brilliant especially when the sun was shining in. If you have an opportunity, make sure you view the Hermitage at night. It is truly magnificent. I would also suggest that you eat prior to arriving, the food choices are limited and it is very difficult to find seating especially when the tour groups arrive."

The cost is reasonable, but it really is so large that like The Lourve, you can't do it all in one day. You need to pick what you want to see and then decide if you can do more.The exterior looks a bit tacky - bad paint jobs. The interior however is everything you expect - gold, gold, gold everywhere.You can easily just stay in one area and forget to see what else is in the museum.The modern pieces are so diverse. I didn't realize they owned some of those pieces. You literally can touch the art - don't - but unlike other places it's so accessible and not behind layers of glass and rope.Totally worth it if you like art. I'd skip the tour guide as you may want to spend more time in areas than others. The map is really helpful... and do not hestitate to ask security (well, the stern old women standing to make sure you don't touch the art) for directions."

Fine French furniture, a room full of Rubens, another of van Dyke, a fine Gainsborough, Van Gogh, Monet, aplenty. A really fantastic collection covering a huge number of periods and subjects. Absolutely wonderful from this perspective.However as usual in Russia the labeling of exhibits is poor and you need to take your own book (which doesn't cover everything, so good labeling is still essential). Signage around the museum is also poor. I also felt that some of the paintings desperately needed cleaning.Being November there were few visitors, which was good.There were two special exhibitions which required extra payment to get in an we could not get into either because the tours are fixed and the only English language tour that day had finished and we were not told about when we specifically inquired at the kiosk on arrival; which rather annoyed us.I also felt that the museum is trying to do too much in one place. Why not have the types of exhibits in different places. Paintings in one museum, furniture and porcelain in another, armour and medieval weaponry in another, etc etc. There is lots of room in other palaces etc."

Alternatively buy online in advance a voucher which needs then to be presented inside to the administration desk - allowing you to queue jump and then join the front of the ticket queue! All a bit beauracratic, and if you have a camera be sure to buy a further ticket for 200rubels. And do take the opportunity to take pictures as the summer palace at Peterhof doesn't allow it."

Some tips from recent experience:1. Work out in advance what you most want to see, and where it is in the museum. Plan accordingly.2. Buy tickets on line to jump the queues. Consider the two day ticket (valid the first day you visit and the day after that).3. Be aware that once you are through the turnstiles you can't re-enter that same day. 4. Consider going through the left hand turnstile to get to the absolutely incredible displays of Russian and Central Asian archaeology. Probably like nothing you have ever seen before, and you will have the rooms almost to yourself. 5. However, if you follow step 4, be prepared for a long, circuitous walk to the better known art exhibits.6. Be prepared for lots of long, circuitous walks in any case.7. Do not miss the Gold Room - an extra ticket you buy on the day. Accompanied tour only. Fantastic.8. Be aware that there is only one cafe and a small, hopelessly overloaded coffee bar for the whole gigantic museum.9. The Hermitage opens into the evening on Wednesdays, and is less crowded later on.10. Be patient, pace yourself!11. Do not miss visiting the Hermitage, in spite of its challenges!12. Take time to check out the museum shops."

Great time is after 11am, and continue over lunch break which appears to be taken by all organised tour parties. DONT miss the Greek, Roman and ASIA displays on the lower floors.

The collection is sufficiently varied (from Greco-Roman sculpture to 16th through 19th century paintings) and the building itself so incredibly beautiful, that one doesn't tire through sheer determination to see as much as possible. Imagine an entire room filled with Rembrandts, two breathtaking da Vincis, marble staircases, two-story high halls with granite columns, restored palace rooms equaling those at Versailles, and a room generously trimmed with malachite.

We spent about 3 hours there and only saw a fraction of the contents. The only negative is that for a building of this size the cafe facilities are very poor. Remember to check in your coat and bag as you cannot take them into the museum. The signs indicate that you cannot take cameras in but nearly everyone was taking pictures.

State Hermitage (Russian: \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0301\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u042d\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0301\u0436) is located in the city center and one of the largest and oldest museum in the world. This prominent museum was founded in 1764 by Catherine II, also known as Catherine the Great. The museum has six buildings: the Winter Palace, Small Hermitage, Old Hermitage, New Hermitage, Hermitage Theatre and Reserve House. The first four buildings are partially open to the public as museums. Before we came to the Hermitage Museum, we only knew the Winter Palace was the official residence of the Romanov Tsars, but we did not know it is part of the museum. The museum has more than 3 millions of collections.We entered the museum from Winter Palace, and there was a long queue. All hand carried items must be checked with metal detector. No liquid is allowed inside the museum. They have a cloakroom to store what is not permitted. It is wise to bring as little as possible when visiting the museum. A special ticket entitles you to take photographs or videos for personal use. There are a total of three floors of rooms for exhibits. Due to the limited time, our guide skipped the ground floor exhibitions. Once we entered the ground floor we saw the beautiful Jordan Staircase that brought us to the first floor. We saw numerous collections, including ones on Western European Art (13th to 19th Centuries), Modern European Art and Oriental Art. We were surprised to see huge collections of Picasso, Matisse, Monet, Van Gogh, DaVinci, Rafael, Renoir \u2013 to name a few. I don\u2019t understand why most of the attractions we visited in St. Petersburg did not have any information in other languages except Russian. There must be millions of tourist yearly visiting St. Petersburg. Luckily, we found English descriptions of the displays in State Hermitage Museum. The museum closed on Monday. If you have limited time in St. Petersburg, remember not to include Monday in your stay."

Once inside I changed camera discs and realized that the one I brought was a full one and not an empty one so I started deleting pictures off of the full one to be able to take pictures, it is not a place you want to be without a camera and it is good that they let you take pictures inside. My father went 30 years ago and ran out of film; he scheduled a trip the following year so he could film the rest of the Museum and Palace. It is that good. The paintings are worth the effort alone without all of the other things to see. Catherine was very astute when it came to acquiring paintings and she ended up with a great collection of Leonardo Di Vinci, Michelangelo, Van Gogh etc. I loved the 2 Madonna with child but my favorite was the Prodigal Son. The sculptures, the Egyptian artifacts, and the Palace itself is fabulous but the best of all was the \u201cGold Room\u201d I thought it was going to be all gold leaf but it is the Russian Treasury. Some of the items are absolutely gorgeous and priceless, rings, broaches, artifacts of gold and diamonds and precious jewelry, it is something that not everyone gets to see who goes inside the museum, it is limited to only a few so be sure that your tour includes it because next to the paintings it is the highlight of the visit to the Hermitage. Again it is something you cannot miss if you are visiting St Petersburg."

Spread over five palaces.Our entrance opened to a grand magnificent staircase. Red carpeted. The steps had a very low rise about 3 inches . So a very low slope. It increased the grandeur of the staircase. So low steps that I stumbled as I was not habituated to such small rise steps. Our guide spoke though microphone and we used earpieces. Only thing I remember that I just ran after our guide though this humongous installation. It was crowded. All guided tours following the same set rooms to traverse. I do not think I could hear our guide clearly through our ear pieces. it was so noisy. I do not remember a single painting now. It is a vague memory. After our guided tour, my wife left with the group to go for the cruise boat. I stayed over an extra hour. I stayed on the main floor. In the Antiquities room. It was far from the madding crowds' ignoble strife. Could see the sculptures, jewelry in a leisurely way.I went to St. Petersburg mainly for the Hermitage. But I was left unsatisfied after the trip. I have to go back someday. Would take print-out of the lay outs of the rooms from the internet [they did not have printed maps on our day of visit]. Would go in fall ,or late fall . [Not in murderous winter]. Stay a few days just for the museum. Start from the opposite direction of the guided tours to avoid mayhem. If I take another cruise , I will take after-cruise stay over for a few days. Well, let me dream."

The Hermitage, like most of the 19th century attractions in St. Petersburg, was destroyed during WWII, and the Soviets rebuilt it and the others (obviously, at great expense) to replicate exactly their previous appearances, gold leaf, amber and all. The art collection is absolutely superb. We toured with a guide, so we had to follow her and be content with what she pointed out to us. But she made a point of directing our attention to the most significant items in the museum. So we feel that we saw enough to understand the scope of the collection, without leaving the museum completely brain-dead. Perhaps if we have occasion to visit St. P again, we will do the Hermitage on our own and really take our time. But we were amazed and impressed by what we did see. This is indeed a \"don't miss\"."

What was particularly astonishing was that everything had survived wars and many other traumas, but still appeared to be in pristine condition. I was most impressed with the knowledge and friendliness of the staff, who invariably were keen to explain any queries that I had,Our tour guide could not have been more helpful, as we had no difficulty in entering the Hermitage, possibly as it had just opened.

It's a huge expanse, covering a number of buildings, with views of the square and the Neva river. We had pre-booked our tickets online, so avoided the queues. Despite visiting on Saturday/Sunday, we felt we had the place almost to ourselves. Tour groups went through very quickly, so we were pleased to do it ourselves. Guides who could speak a little English, were very knowledgeable and helpful. We had a 2 day ticket, which was needed, despite us only being there 4 days!The art and other artifacts were amazing, breath taking and quite spectacular. We took both pictures and brought cards, from the areas which prohibited taking pictures. Lovely caf\u00e9, clean loos, expensive gift shops!"

Definitely consider the extra options of the Gold or Amber Rooms. We saw the Gold which was an excellent collection of gold jewellery through the ages.The museum is immense and the building alone worth the visit- especially the mirrored hall and the staircase. If you have limited time, a guide would be helpful. However if you have tackled major museums before and chose your exhibits, the Hermitage is easily manageable on your own. Just don't think you can see it all! There is an excellent app you can download which provides live information about most of the exhibits - we did this onsite at the cafe with wifi."

We knew our river cruise was providing a tour of the Hermitage and found that almost all tour groups follow a set itinerary that covers the old masters, the throne room and the Palace rooms. We particularly wanted to see the French Impressionist collection which is huge, so we went a day early, purchased our tickets online (to save a lot of time at the ticket window) and were able to spend as much time as we liked enjoying the paintings we most wanted to see. If you are going with a group you will pack a whole lot into about 3 hours. Be prepared to walk up many flights of steps and use the restroom before the tour starts because the restrooms are on the lower lobby level. No matter what you see you will be amazed at the size of the collections and the casualness with which they are displayed. Windows were open to the outside air (thank goodness) when we were there or it would have been very stuffy inside. If you are a museum gift shop aficionado be aware that there are many spread throughout the museum and the ones by the lobby area may not have just the thing you saw upstairs. If you have the flexibility to buy when you see it, do so or you may have to find your way back. There are good maps that are available when you first come in, we were able to use the map to find what we most wanted to see. I noticed though that the next day when we were with a guide we bypassed those maps - if you want to explore after your tour you will need one!Enjoy this amazing museum."

Make sure you're rested and have good walking shoes, this is a commitment and a test of stamina. It really gives you a sense of the opulence of the era.

Buy your ticket ahead of time to shorten your time in line. Beware of pickpockets in the coat check area (one of our party lost his wallet there). Consider engaging a guide unless you have allocated vast amounts of time to your visit and are willing to just wander around to see what comes into your vision. A knowledgable guide can maximize your return on time. We spend a day and half there and only scratched the surface. Don't forget the third floor. While not collected by the Czars these early 20th century pieces are a delight to the eye and heart. Think about how you will deal with food. The cafeteria is only fair and the lines long.

In late September the crowds were tolerable.... I have heard that in the summer months with the ships coming into port that the crowds are impossible. So, enjoy and don't get to frustrated with the crowds. Very worthwhile spending 2-3 hours even if you are not an art major!"

Elizabeth, according to our guide, was blonde and blue-eyed, slim and tall with long limbs, who loved masquerades where she dressed in men's clothing to show off her long legs, and balls where she never used the same dress twice and nor did her guests as she forbade them. \u00a0Her balls and dinners lasted 4-6 hours so that at the end of her days \u00a0she became fat and clumsy.The Winter Palace and Hermitage was located along the river Neva and it did have a great view of the river.On the way down, Natalia showed \u00a0us one of the famous cats of the Hermitage."

I would go first to the Winter Palace rooms, then the Siberian Artifacts and the Russian Culture sections, as these cannot be seen in any western European Museum.

Our guide knew exactly were she was going and explained that she was only showing us a selection of some of the most important items. My advice is not to go it alone unless you have done your research in advance on what you want to see. If you hire a guide or tour company make sure you ask what exactly you will see on your visit. I did notice some people had one on one private tours so if you are really interested in only certain items you may want to go that route and customize your visit. Remember this is also a former palace turned into a museum. It's beauty alone will keep your interest. It reminds me of the palace at Versailles without the expansive gardens."

Unfortunately the schedule fell on Monday, where the museum does not open on that day. So i worked hard to deal with the tour to change it to Sunday. I made it and thanked God I have insisted that way. The museum was really great. And you can also take picture inside the museum. It was a grand place where you could see a lot of things with their own histories and unique stories. The walls, ceilings, doors, everything were decorated very beautifully. You would see a lot of state of the art works. All were done in details. You wouldn't be able to stop taking pictures unless you run out of battery or memory. Don't forget to watch the golden peacock.. If you are lucky enough you would see something different there. Press your luck! Spend your time leasurely.. Don't forget to look up to the ceiling and pillars.. You'll be amazed how at the old days the tzar was very rich!"

I would recommend an organised tour as we didn't have to queue for tickets and it seems that the tour guides organise their groups so that everyone gets a fair bite of the cherry in busy areas."

For an additional $5.00 you can get entry for 2 consecutive days, which you really need if you've never been there before. The Hermitage is closed on Mondays, but you can go on Sunday and Tuesday with this ticket. It really saves time because the lines are quite long to buy tickets onsite.The 2nd floor is mostly the residence area, with beautiful living rooms, studies, bedchambers, etc. It's much less crowded than the exhibits on the 1st floor and it's nice just taking your time and walking through without getting pushed and bumped by other tourists. There's an audio guide you can rent which is very informative since there are not a lot of display signs. I think you should see 1 floor per day, because it is a massive palace that takes a long time to get through. There is a wifi zone in the basement near the cafe that's always jammed pack. Don't count on eating there unless you don't mind spending 30 minutes in line for a cheese sandwich then have nowhere to sit because of the crowds. It's a small complaint that can easily be avoided.

Our guide took us to specific paintings etc, making sure we saw the highlights. Left on our own I think we would have just wound up wandering around.

If flash wasn't allowed, then I didn't take any pics, since my flash sometimes goes off on its own. If you're in St. Petersburg, this is pretty much a must-see, to whatever degree meets your interests.

We were told that if you were to spend one minute gazing at every item on display at the Hermitage, it would take you eleven years to see everything!They have the a lot of paintings by the old masters: Rafael, Rembrandt, Da Vinci etc. Their collection is amazing! They have paintings, pottery, jewelry, furniture, toys etc..One of my favorites is the 18th century mechanical Peacock Clock. The figures of a peacock, cockerel and owl form an elaborate mechanism that has all three figures moving when it is wound up. It is apparently the only mechanism in the world that is still in its original working condition. Unfortunately, it was not wound on the day we visited. Kudos to the Russians for doing such a good job of keeping this wonderful museum in such pristine condition. You would never believe by the condition of the carpets on the floor that thousands of feet trample by on them daily!"

While both places are outstanding, the Hermitage in our opinion is not as superb as the Louvre, simply because of the number and nature of artifacts and paintings on display in each. Having said the the Museum is beautiful, well maintained and offers a great variety of art, most of which cannot possibly be seen even in a few days. So, in fact, a half day or, better a full day, visit is needed and then one need to limit one's viewing to specific sections of the Museum. Retaining a guide is really strongly advisable. The Museum tends to be crowded at all times but one gets used to all the shuffling feet.We were advised to watch out for pickpockets both inside and especially outside the magnificent baroque buildings. A \"must\" visit when in St Petersburg."

When walking up to the museum and first seeing the familiar building, on the river, with it's green and white fa\u00e7ade, it's absolutely awe-inspiring. The exterior architecture is iconic - and the interior provides a beautiful space to display art, sculpture, furniture and other exhibits. My only disappointment was that some of the exhibits that I have seen and loved in the past - the Faberge eggs and the carriages - are no longer exhibited. The Faberge eggs are owned by various collectors and the carriages are in the Hermitage Storage facility. I love Russian history and missed these exhibits....... though we certainly still enjoyed the Russian culture and the Treasure Galleries.Be aware that The Hermitage is open until 9:00 pm on Wednesday nights - so a lovely way to spend an evening! It's also interesting to read about the history of the museum before you go - to provide some context about how the art was collected, the various exhibitions, the Hermitage during the WWII. The Hermitage website provides excellent information."

I have heard nice comments about the museum, but even going with high expectations, still it surpassed them. We had the luxury at this time to spend 2 whole days in the museum.But since it is one of the biggest and best museums in the world, still we didn't see everything. Especially if you don't have much time, is key to select your main interests and then most probably a guide could really be helpful.You have to make choices. I was happy on visiting many rooms on Russian history and the huge collection on impressionists. I was amazed for example by the number of Picassos they have and the 2 huge Matisse they had, almost ceiling to floor.The building itself is an attraction in itself. The Palace is located in the margin of the Neva River in Saint Petersburg, giving a wonderful view from many rooms. The collection was started by Catherine the Great in the XVIII century. I love photography. So for me, an additional attraction was the security staff which is composed of senior ladies with no uniform, carrying their own bags with them and sometimes quite bored of being there. Often they mingled with visitors and you couldn't say who is visiting and who is protecting the Museum property unless you see their badges. So many interesting expressions!...It is advisable to go early and to by tickets in advance. My husband bought them via internet and save us from being in a long line.Museum shops are great. Irresistible are the many different eggs on Faberge style."

We were on a Holland America cruise ship and booked through them to go in the evening when the museum is closed to the general public. The advantage of this was that it was no-where as busy as during the day. It was still crowded as we were only able to go in specified rooms but we were able to view the artworks more easily.During our 2 days in the city we did an excellent tour with SPB tours which included a visit to the museum. I had read one review that said that she saw exactly the same rooms during her evening tour as in the day tour, and I was hoping that it would not be the case with us but it was. We were taken on the stock standard tour, and saw exactly the same rooms. The advantage of going in the evening was that we had the place to ourselves. Still crowded, but no-where near as much as in the day time. If I had to do it again, and had the time, I would visit on my own with a good map, so you can see the other rooms that are not on the standard tour.A word of advise, we visited in July and it was hot and stuffy inside, so no need for a jacket. This was surprising as so many art galleries have air conditioning to preserve the paintings, but the hermitage?? The place is so cavernous it would cost a fortune to air condition it. No idea what the inside temperature would be in winter though, so probably only need it in summer.Enjoy the museum and palace, but I must say I enjoyed the Louvre in Paris much more."

The collections are comparable to those at the Louvre and the Metropolitan, and has few local art, since, as explained by our guide, there is a separate museum of Russian art, which hosts those pieces."

We bought our tickets online which avoided the queue as we could go to the eticket box under the archway entrance off the Palace Square. The two children (under 12) were free.It is no wonder this building is so famous as the architecture and history are stunning and on top of that it is full of amazing art work and Egyptian antiquities. We spent hours there and only touched the surface.We paid for the audio tour rather than have a guided tour which allowed us to listen at our own pace (which was good with children) and also listen in detail about artworks which particularly interested us. I would recommend it.Although there were a lot of people there it did not seem crowded. We were able to move around easily. Our ticket included a permit to take photos.There are some food options but you cannot take food or drink into the building but you can into the grounds."

From personal experience, we would rate it even with The MET, Moma (both in NYC), Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, The Van Gogh in Amsterdam, The Philadelphia Art Museum, The Uffizi in Florence, The Walters Art Museum (Baltimore) and the Getty Art Museum (LA). The scope of the collection is mind boggling and palace location accentuates the experience tremendously. The saying is a picture is worth a thousand words. So I will be quick about this and get to adding photos. If you come to St. Petersburg, you must see this museum! TIPs: bring your camera and extra chips (you will need them) and try to go with an organized tour. Added Note: There are many other artists featured beyond what I have photos attached. Chagall, Rembrandt, Leonardo da vinci, Titian, Rafael, and many others."

It was almost impossible to appreciate any of the individual works because of the jostling & oxygen deprivation.

After traveling 30 hours, lost luggage, and the other stresses of getting from the Caribbean to Russia, even jet lag did not diminish the experience of seeing the French 19th/20th century works I had heard about. On the way to the 3rd floor, one sees the opulence of the Imperial era in the collections and the decor of the halls and other rooms. The royal palaces of Spain and France cannot compete. A study of the flooring alone is overwhelming. I maxed out at 4 hours and barely scratched the surface of this extensive collection. My research proved accurate: plan on at least 2 mornings for this place. Get there at the museum opening time to avoid the hoards of bus tours and lines at the ticket office. I did not get the audio tour for my first visit, as I wanted to take my time with the Picasso's, Monet's, Matisse's and Gauguin's. My second visit will be with a tour, just to see some of the rest."

We were touching distance to works by Degas, Pissarro, Cezanne, Van Gogh, Gaugin, Picasso, Monet, Renoir etc etc - walls & walls & rooms & rooms of them! It was a real OMG experience. As it was August it was very busy but our guide was brilliant at navigating the hoards & masses so we could get up close to some fantastic pieces. Only complaint was we did not have long enough to more than glance at the various pieces - it was whistlestop but fabulous. Saw the Amber Room as part of the tour but for us seeing so many paintings & statues we had read about, all in one place, with what appeared to be minimal security (I'm sure this wasn't actually the case & certainly no-one tried anything!) was just fabulous. Best time to go would probably be from end of September until late spring when the cruise ship season is over. It was raining the day we went but v warm inside & I bet it would be uncomfortably hot if the sun was shining so think carefully about what you wear. Raincoats / jackets are supposed to be checked in on arrival (big queues) so take yours off as you go in & roll it & carry under your arm. Also long queues for the facilities afterwards (for men as well as women) so bear this in mind when drinking anything!"

Even a good look would take days, though I imagine museum fatigue would set in after 2 or 3 hours. It would be great to have the option to go in for a couple of hours over several days and pick different parts each time. If you're doing it on your own it would be well worth planning what you really want to see and heading to the main things quickly. Go as early as you can as the crowds can be terrible, especially around the really famous stuff. Alternatively, go with a small organised tour that gets you in before the main opening as we did (see SPB Tours) and accept their choice of route and highlights to keep you ahead of the crowds... you might miss a few things you'd prefer to have seen, but just getting to see the palaces when it's quiet is a real bonus and any good guide should pick lots of interesting things."

A little work and reading ahead of time is well worth the effort. Understanding a bit of the royal history can be valuable in putting events in order and understanding how people and things link together.We hired a private tour guide for our group of 4 and I would highly recommend this. We were admitted early before the crowds and we could see the long queue outside and were very grateful for the little bit of extra time inside when it was quiet and we could see some things without lots of people around.I relish the history and thinking of what life would have been like in those times. What was it like for the royalty? And what was it like for the common man? A person can not visit Russia and feel the trip is complete without visiting the Hermitage. So many treasures.

First of all the Hermitage is on a grand scale. With 3,000,000 objects in their collection don't expect to do anything but scratch the surface, even if you spend a dedicated day or two. Our tour lasted 3 hours so all we saw were the highlights. Our tour started before the general public was allowed entry. By the time we were half way thru our tour the crowds were everywhere. Our guide navigated her way from room to room pointing out highlights along the way. We were not disappointed. The museum gift shop is very good - we bought a canvas reproduction of Rembrandt's Return of the Prodigal Son that we had seen earlier. One of our friends back home had asked us to take a photo of the actual painting which we did (no flash permitted in the museum) but we also bought the reproduction that they just loved! When we left the Hermitage it was still raining and the lines to get in we're very long! Glad we didn't have to wait to get in earlier. Bottom line- the State Hermitage is a \"Don't Miss\" if you are going to be in St Petersburg. Plan before you go so that you use your time wisely but expect lots of people trying to move about and appreciate the great works of art."

We were very fortunate to have a wonderful English speaking museum guide for the Gold Room tour, usually your tour guide interprets for the museum guide. The gold items and the workmanship of items that date from 4BC was remarkable. No photos in the Gold Room, However most everything else you could photograph without flash. No backpacks allowed and the coat room will not check them.  The visit to the storerooms was remarkable. I behind the scenes tour of hoe thing are stored, cataloged and rotated into what is on display in the museum. If you are planning to visit the Hermitage allow plenty of time and if your guide can get you in early all the better."

We knew that the size of the Hermitage is overwhelming with huge amounts of art and sculpture (although the great majority of what it owns isn't even on display). As a result, we signed up for a special tour titled \"The Gold room and the Hermitage\"; it was not cheap but it allowed us to get into this justifiably famour museum at 9 am, rather than the 10 am opening time for the public. The wide hallways were fairly empty and the four gold rooms - full of extraordinary items of jewelry, gifts to the Czar and archeological finds - were completely empty when we arrived. This made viewing the exhibits, with the assistance of our guide, a real pleasure. Our guide happened to be a fan of the Dutch paintings so we went there next and experienced the large crowds for which the Hermitage is known. Then, we went to see a DaVinci and other iconic paintings; the rule of thumb is that the more well-known the item, the larger the lines and the less time to actually see it - in fact, the harder it is to see. By the way, for those who are unused to crowds and the pushing, shoving and pulling that often results from being in the middle of them, be warned. These diverse crowds are pretty pushy. They are not a reason to miss the Hermitage but if you have any way to minimize exposure to them, take it.Recommendation: wear very comfortable shoes. There is alot of walking down long corridors and after a visit of several hours, you'll be exhausted. Even more so if your shoes don't provide support."

Of course there were crowds of tourist everywhere, but I guess it goes for any big / the biggest attraction of a city. You have to walk a lot so please consider that, and not many chairs to rest on.

A huge art gallery housed in a magnificent building steeped in history really should not be missed. Just blindly pitching up at the door and going with the flow does not mean it is impossible to appreciate (it's what we did) but a few tips will help you make the most of it. Firstly, don't expect to see everything. The collection is enormous with, for example, two or three galleries devoted exclusively to Madonna and Child paintings. Do a bit of research and target what you want to see or pick a few galleries at random rather than plan to do the lot. As for tickets, if you haven't got them online beforehand, and it is probably a good idea if you do, use the automatic machines to skip the line for the ticket office. We waited twenty minutes in a reasonably short queue to get served in an attempt to take advantage of a student discount, unsuccessfully as it turned out due to lack of documentation. If you want to take photos you should pay 200 roubles (GBP4) for a permit. They give you a sticker to wear but everyone seemed to be snapping away, sticker or not. As you leave there is a little post office which is a great place to pick up stamps at face value. A 25 rouble stamp is required for international postcards. For us, the best artwork there was the building itself and it is a bit of a shame that more isn't made of its history of the building and the events witnessed within its walls. There are a few rooms in the western wing that make reference to the Romanovs and the library appears to be authentic but the majority of the building is purely there to display artworks. There are beautifully painted ceilings, marbled staircases, some impressive chandeliers and suchlike but it would have been nice had more rooms been fully restored to their imperial splendour. That being said you will still be able to say you have followed in the Tsar's footsteps and at 400 roubles (GBP 8) a ticket you can't really complain about that."

You are allowed to take photos, and the building has sufficient natural light to make this worthwhile, but the guards will shout at you if your flash goes off accidentally (yes, personal experience...).Every visitor will have their favourite room or period. There is a lot of Christian iconographic art, and a fantastic selection from the Renaissance masters (Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Titian) as might be expected, but some unexpected treasures too: intricate glass vases from Venice, delicate ivory figurines from 14th century France, beautifully enamelled dishes from 16th century France and Italy. My favourite paintings were a conventional but sombre and imposing \u2018Crucifixion\u2019 by Alonso Cano, and the spooky 'Die Insel der Toten' by Arnold B\u00f6cklin.You can rush through the Hermitage in a half-day at a push, but it really needs a full day to absorb the sheer volume, range and quality of this collection. If you have enough time and can stand the queues outside and the crowds inside, I would advise breaking up your visit into two half-days. Either way, the experience is overwhelming.Hint: I happened to have my sight-seeing day in St Petersburg on the first Thursday of a month, not knowing that entrance to the Hermitage is free on that day. This is not a bonus. I had to queue outside for over two hours. Russians love their art, and they love it even more when it\u2019s free. Go any other day of the month, and pay!"

Getting In: If you have an online ticket, about 20 feet inside the gate will be a kiosk with a small line to exchange your voucher for a ticket, that includes photography. However, if you don't have a ticket, DO NOT WAIT IN THE LONG LINE. instead, go about halfway past the gate to the building, where it opens up to the sky, and far to your right and also far to your left, are credit card (or cash!) self service ticket machines. I went on a Saturday morning in August, and I had overslept, and between the 2 credit card/cash self service machines to buy tickets or the kiosk for online purchasers, the lines were 1 person, 1 person and zero people. Meanwhile, loads of people were in these huge lines that extended forever it seemed. The only disadvantage of these approaches is that the only way to buy tickets for the Gold Room is in the long lines, even if you bought what you could online."

I have only been there once so I do not know if this is the norm. It was not very busy at 11 but by 2 it was so crowded that we had to wait our turn to see some of the most popular exhibits. The museum has an exceptional and varied collection. We rented audio devices that were comprehensive and gave good explanations of both the rooms and their history and the collections that are now displayed within them. We were happy to not have been in a group and could go and see those things that we had researched beforehand. Even if we had been alone in the museum, we could not have seen every piece in the collection in one day. I recommend getting there as early as possible and seeing what is important to you early and then spending the rest of your time wandering around. The audio guide does not enforce any particular sequence. You press in the number of the room or the piece of art and you get a comprehensive explanation. You are free to wander around at will for as long as you like. Non-flash photographs are allowed. There are nice views from the windows but the lighting is not great for photography. There are plenty of restrooms and the restaurant is in a location where you can visit it and then go back to the exhibits. The museum diagram is free and you will be lost without it."

We bought our tickets online which means that photography is free and you don't need to line up for tickets. We also arrived at 10am (10.30 is opening time) which basically put us at the front of the queue for entry. Be sure to exchange your computer printout for your proper ticket in the little office under the entry arches before you cross the courtyard to the main doors- you will need your passport as ID. Arrive rested, hydrated and wear hiking boots (hey, kilometres of marble floors are tough on the feet!). You cannot bring drinks into the museum, and larger bags, jackets etc. have to be checked into the cloak room. I took a handbag instead of a backpack to save the bother. Wear light clothing and a cardigan to layer in summer as some rooms are cold and others quite hot. There is a cafe in the museum and whilst the food is good it is wildly expensive and the service was terrible for russian PR or an insight into soviet history - depends on your mind-set! If i went again i would smuggle in a packet of biscuits to eat in the eating hall. I definately recommend doing your research before you get there and printing out a list of things you would like to see ESPECIALLY which room number they are in. We could only find a map in french, but i doubt an english map would have been any more use as it only lists which regions are covered in which rooms (eg. Rooms 207-238 Italian). This is probably fine if you are an art officianado, but not much help to the rest of us! You definately need to grab the museum map as you will get lost without it. The first floor (ie. the one that you enter the building on) has all of the services, cafe, and some nice souvenir shops. It houses historical artefacts from ancient egypt, asia and other places- similar in content but not as big as the british museum collection. Having been to the british museum i wouldn't have bothered with this floor at all if i had have known. Also, mummified remains creep me out - and there are several. The second floor (up the grand staircase) is STUNNING but be warned that the map and info booth have almost ZERO information about the rooms and architecture, so if this is what interests you, come prepared with the room numbers of what you want to see before you arrive. Do not try and see everything - the number of tired and grumpy couples I saw on the verge of divorce was a bit funny! I do wonder if the 2 day ticket for slightly more money is a better choice to break it down into maneagable amounts. I don't have children, but i can imagine that it could be tricky to keep them amused for long enough to get around in one visit. We lasted 4 hours."

We tried to get to certain sections, but there are no maps on display, some rooms aren't numbered, signage is confusing, and some staircases on the paper plans were closed. When we politely asked for directions, staff wouldn't give any. We paid for the audioguide, but that was a waste of money as there was little or no information about most of the collection - at least not in English.Finally, every single member of staff we encountered was rude and unhelpful. Few were willing to speak to us in English, and the people in the rooms were jobsworths, behaving as though they were doing us a favour by letting us see the things we'd paid handsomely to see. One kept chasing me down to tell me not to use flash when I hadn't been. And the cloakroom staff we just as bad - huffing and sighing as if taking bags wasn't part of their job description. And the staff were getting their own coats on half an hour before it even closed!It's a lovely building, but the information about the collection is poor and the customer service non-existent."

Apparently most cruise ships' passengers visiting St P are allowed special viewing times. This means that you won't see everything - because your time is limited by the Museum Authorities (and remember, this is Russia - not known for flexibility!). But you'll see SO much that you will love it and will probably feel that you could not fully appreciate more. Also, there are so many fewer people allowed in at these sessions, you really can get close to the art you've dreamed of seeing and spend all the time you want enjoying particular pieces. The city itself is beautiful - go there for the Hermitage, the rivers, the palaces, the cathedrals. Don't go for the weather!"

The magnificence and splendour of these are almost beyond words. The ingenuity of man to create beautiful and opulent buildings is amply demonstrated here. Even though the museum is extensive in area it only can display some15% of the artefacts which it has in its possession. The story which you will be told is that if you spend one minute in front of each item it will take you 4 years to see everything.When you go you will be shown around at a furious pace and you will be astounded at what you see from contemporary paintings to masterpieces by Rembrandt and Leonardo. Artefacts from all over the world and items by Faberge and other masters. Do not miss the Gold Room which has some of the most beautiful items you will ever see including a horse blanket made from spun gold and silver thread and decorated by 150,000 yes 150,000 diamonds. Seeing all this wealth and riches goes some way of beginning to understand the foundations of the revolution...with so many people literally starving outside these walls whilst the ruling class dined of gold plates! again though this is another must visit place but allow a lot of time for the trip."

You might want to loot at a Divinci, but you can't because a tourist is blocking it with her tablet. and the tourist beside her is holding his tablet at the ready. This museum desperately needs a no-photos rule.Longer hours would help spread the massive crowds.1. You can buy tickets online, in advance, but make sure to do it at least two days ahead, because that is how long your confirmation email will take to arrive.2. You can buy tickets at kiosks in the entrance courtyard, although the lines may be long3. You can buy them at the ticket booth, but the lines will be very long.Ticket does not allow you to go out for lunch,and return the same day.The cafe in the museum is woefully overcrowded, totally inadequate to the crowd.The restrooms are terribly inadequate, and not kept in repair.The app you can download is merely a map with room numbers and less info than the fold-out map they offer.

Then we toured the Dutch rooms, Rembrant, French rooms and Impressionist rooms including Monet, Pissaro, Van Gogh, Gaughin, Picasso etc......would recommend reading about it before going though as due to the large crowds you really need to keep your eyes open for all the famous paintings otherwise you could easily miss them. The hanging gardens on top of the palace roof are lovely as well so keep your eyes peeled for great views of these and of the River Neva as you wander between the entire buildings of the Hermitage!Apparently you need to be careful of pickpockets who operate inside the place, but we were fortunate as the place was closed to the general public.

Buy your tickets online first, print out the receipt and get in the short queue between the arches to collect your ticket. This then allows you to go to the front of the big entrance queue. This will save you time and patience. 2. Make sure your ticket includes use of your camera if you want to take photos as otherwise you need to check it in the cloakroom. 3. Ensure you are fully hydrated because you cannot take in water and after a number of hours you will need it. We were told there was a cafe inside yet, due to lack of observation skills or art overload we could not find it. 4. It is closed on Mondays. 5. If you are not going on a tour get a map from the audio desk just up the main flight of stairs when you enter. The map is great and really helped us - obviously didn't help us find the cafe though. The rooms, art, sculpture, building and even the gift shop were all fantastic. If you are a photographic fanatic leave your tripod at home your 1000 lenses in their bags at the hotel bring a camera with a telescopic lens that takes good photos without a flash and enjoy the moment and commit it to memory as your photos will do less justice than your memory."

Make sure to pay attention to the details of the palace as well as the art. Make sure to save time and buy your ticket online in advance if you are not part of a group. Tour group crowds in the summer make it a challenge to see some of the art. My strategy was to start on the top floor with the French impressionists, since not all of the tour groups make it up there. When I was here 30 years ago, it was the dead of winter in the Soviet Union, and I had this world-class museum almost entirely to myself, so the difference was very significant. Don't miss the Rembrandts in Room 254."

I have never struggled so hard to concentrate on stunning art when assailed by stunning architecture, nor struggled so hard to concentrate on stunning architecture when assailed by stunning art. The Hermitage is mind blowing. You could spend days there...BUT...you can't, because you cannot take food or water in (that's right, no bottled water or drinks of any kind) AND there is no food or drink available inside AND its really hot and incredibly crowded in parts, so about the most you can seriously manage if you are fit, well-fed and well hydrated when you start is about 4 hours, before you have to leave for refreshments AND there are no pass-outs, so once you leave you will need to buy another ticket if you want to go back in. I think this must be some form of Russian moderation mechanism, so you don't get too overwhelmed with culture and/or don't enjoy yourself too much. It compares terribly with the Lourve, where you can break at lunchtime for a great restaurant meal in the museum and then continue in the afternoon on the same ticket. But then you can probably summarise the Russian versus the French character right there.Perhaps another example of it is the curation, which is puzzling sometimes. In some of the huge ballrooms which can easily accommodate thousands of people they have some relatively obscure works, while all of the amazing collection of French artists - Monet, Renoir, Gaugin, Pisarro, Rodin etc etc - which are extremely popular, are squeezed into a suite of relatively small rooms on the third floor, which become crowded like the toilets at a football game when the tour groups get there. Again, it's probably just the Russian way and not surprising they relegate the French artists to such conditions!Don't let the imposed hardships put you off, in a way it adds to the intensity of the experience. The Hermitage is simply one of the top collections in the world and must be seen to be believed. The Winter Palace which houses it is also quite stunning. Make sure you pre-order your tickets on-line, as this allows you to walk past the unbelievably long queues and straight in. I simply can't understand why everyone doesn't do this. there is a short queue at the little kiosk after the entrance gate, clearly marked \"Internet Ticket Pick-up\" (or similar) in English, where you collect your ticket. This queue moves fast because half the people in in think it is the queue to buy a ticket and when they find it isn't they go away. pre-booking the ticket also allows you to take photos without extra charge, but not in the temporary exhibits. You need to put large bags (backpacks) in one of the free cloakrooms before going through security (where they take your water away!).So, a unique experience and a uniquely Russian experience. The Hermitage is one of the best cultural experiences of my life; totally worthwhile and completely mind blowing. More than 4 hours might just be too much anyway."

The rooms numbers are at the top of the doors. If you like museums , don\u00b4t miss it."

Since it is so famous, the crowds and collection can be overwhelming. Try to get to the museums either right when they open or late in the afternoon. A private tour is nice but expensive. I've gone to Saint Petersburg in August, March, and the winter months. One of the best times for me has been going in March. The Hermitage and other museums aren't as crowded and since it is off season, prices are lower."

Museum was packed with people, it was hot inside, no ventilation, no good info on how to move around, grumpy old ladies working in the museum making it even harder for us to try to enjoy the visit. At the end we just wanted to leave and did not get to see what we planned. Best would be to avoid going there during the summer."

Millions of curated pieces, including priceless masterworks, pack a complex comprised of multiple conjoined buildings. I am not an art expert (but I have stayed at a Holiday Inn Express) and had trouble keeping everything straight. Still, our guide helped immensely as she described and explained what we were seeing. For visitors with mere hours to spend, a guide is an absolute necessity. Much of the museum complex is grand, but parts are pretty bland and borderline shabby. This really doesn't detract much from the overall impact of this fantastic collection. If at all possible, make sure your tour provides entry before standard public hours. Viewing hundreds (thousands?) of painting was much easier and more pleasurable before the crowds built later in the day.On balance, this is a \"must see\" attraction for just about any visitor to SPB"

Don't be put off though even a short visit will take your breath away. The building it's self is magnificent and the contents of the many rooms are joy to behold. Try to do a little research before you go to help guide you to your own particular interests and get there early in the morning when for an hour or so the place is reasonably quiet before the crowds arrive. If it is possible for you go in the winter when there are far less visitors, but be prepared for sub zero temperatures. It is impossible to single out any particular room to visit as they all have their own unique character but a visit here will leave you wanting to return for more."

The museum is huge so make sure you take a free map. And only bring a small bag or you will be forced to use the cloakroom. The shops are lovely and good value. However there was only one small cafe with premade sandwiches and chocolate bars. The museum is missing a trick by not providing better restaurant facilities. A wider postcard selection would be good too. I would also have welcomed more information on the history of the building and some basic history of art information beside painting...perhaps in a similar manner to the Rijks museum in Amsterdam. "

Advise heading left to a less congested entrance. Backpacks have to be handed over. There were only a few people going in this way and we were soon able to get upstairs and more or less straight into the malachite room (AMAZING) and other state rooms. You have to do a bit of creative thinking to avoid the swathes of tours that can take over!

I'd recommend paying for an audio-guide if you're interested in more detailed information about the different rooms of the palace.I have visited it several times and on the most recent visit found the museum becoming more of a host to art exhibits (which cannot be photographed even with the purchased permit) than a display of the luxury of Imperial Russia. I was more interested in the history of Russia/St. Petersburg and beauty and opulence of the palace and its room than imported paintings, so I was quite disappointed in this respect."

I spent 2 days slowly going through the museum and still probably only saw about a half of the magnificent collection.Impressive impressionist and french modern collection if not housed in a rather less impressive floor of the building. Couldn't believe that they open the windows to air the rooms with -20 degrees snow outside...The cafe and internet areas need considerable customer service lessons and the booking for the gold and diamond room should be clearer, but otherwise without doubt the best art museum in the world."

Even non-art lovers must visit - just for the impact of the architecture! Like The Louvre or the Uffizi, you could easily spend a full week in this museum and still find things to wonder at!Top tip for wheelchair users:Just about every palace and museum in St Petersburg has the most beautifully restored parquet/inlaid floors and paper slippers/shoe covers are required to be worn by all visitors. Having hired a brand new wheelchair on board The Arcadia, we were (very fortunately) allowed to go around The Hermitage because it had new, clean, light coloured wheels. People who had older, black rubber wheels on their chairs were being refused entry. You do not argue with Russian matriarchs working in Museums and Palaces!!! If you plan to visit with a wheelchair, I would highly recommend making some white towelling or cotton wheel covers that can be slipped on to protect the floor from being marked by your wheels.Unless you are semi-ambulant, you will need some help to get the wheelchair up about half a dozen steps but once you have accessed the museum you will be able to use lifts. There may be an alternative side entrance that would not involve steps but please check before your visit.The male staff were very helpful and allowed us to use the goods lift between floors but there appears to be little awareness/consideration for the needs of wheelchair users in St Petersburg. Hope this helps!"

I would recommend the online tickets for two days ( it's so huge I don't think it's a good idea to try and see all in one day). If you have a small budget, you can visit it for free the first thursday of the month, but you should be prepared since there are very long lines to get in , and because of this, the attention and the information is not the best."

The paintings are the best collection probably in the world and the Russians keep buying as much as they want. We went to see the gold galleries in the vault- it is rather alarming to be locked in by one of those doors you see in films about bank robberies where it is a round circular door with a bar which they twist round and round- actually too warm in there but the objects are unbelievable.We have spent 2 whole days there and only saw a tiny amount. Cafe gets full and only takes payment in Roubles. As I walked down the Jordan Staircase I could not help thi nking about the Tsar and Tsarina walking down the stairs in full evening dress.

I had been before on two occasions 3 years ago and I could vaguely remember the place. Unfortunately the overwhelming numbers of visitors and the administration somewhat dampen the pleasure of seeing some of the world's greatest art. Visiting is strictly controlled but the sheer numbers of foreign and Russion visitors made the experience uncomfortable. July weather was hot and sultry and there appeared to be no proper air conditioning in the vast complex of the Winter Palace that holds the Hermitage museum. I question whether this is ideal for the works of art on display, and particularly, the priceless paintings.One is not allowed to photograph inside without a permit, which costs 4 euros /5 US dollars. But it is better to buy the illustrated guide books than to try to photograph works on display above the heads of visitors!On the two tours I took with a guide, the same route and 'highlights' were included. This is good if one is not familiar with the works of art or wants a 'quick' run-through of what is important, but for me, knowledgeable on paintings etc, I found it frustrating. Better to wander yourself perhaps and focus on what one likes best.Understandably the show works are the Italian 15th/16 century (Leonardo, Raphael, Titian), the Dutch 17th century (Rembrandt), Flemish (Rubens and Van Dyck) and the Impressionists/post-impressionists and later (Monet, Cezanne, Gauguin, Picasso and Matisse). These last are displayed in hot, crowded rooms on the third floor. There appeared to be no air control and I found the experience distressing - mainly for the paintings!But, having said this, the Hermitage is a must if visiting St Petersburg and it does contain some superb masterpieces."

The 3rd floor was also a pleasant surprise as the crowds were thinner than the 1st and 2nd floor. They also had an amazing collection of several famous artists. If you like Picasso, Gaugin, Matisee, Renoir, Monet or any other contemporary artists, you will definitely love this floor! Not to be missed!PS: buy your tickets on-line to skip a VERY long line!

We spent a couple of hours running after our guide, trying to keep the group together, and fighting the crowds. It is a beautiful museum, and well worth a visit. But a lot is lost in the perfunctoriness of the visit. It is a staple of St-Petersburg.

As a museum of international renown this seems a shame. Where a translation was available, the provenance of the artefacts was sometimes imprecise. The staff in the shops, cafes and galleries were very pleasant and helpful, but the cafe did not really live up to the overall feel of this fantastic museum."

It is fantastic and I feel privileged just to have seen some of its masterpieces . It's very crowded and can get very hot , but, you are encouraged to move on at a reasonable pace so you can enjoy some of the world's greatest artists- how did Canaletto produce that perspective. ??? Walk back and forth a few times-absolutely amazing. Catherine the Great was most certainly a woman of great vision. Thank you for a wonderful experience !"

Much quicker and then you go round to the proper entrance at the side of the River Neva and go in there. The machines do not take credit card, so have roubles ready. It is 400 roubles per ticket and you may need a permission ticket for photos for another 200 roubles.The first Thursday in every month has free entry!When I went there were no English guide maps left which was annoying so I had to make do with a French one as I can read a tiny bit of French.Many of the info signs for the exhibits are in Russian only, which again is a pain.I loved the corridor with the portraits of the Tsars and the Tsarinas.

Bags greater than 20 x 30 inches, umbrellas and raincoats must be checked in. The Staterooms are the main attraction and are simply sumptuous - they take around 45 to 60 minutes to see.

Fortunately I managed to shepherd my two grandsons through, but I saw virtually nothing. Every painting of note had so many people in front of it that seeing it was impossible. It was so hot that I was afraid of passing out. Also, photography is permitted, so everyone was lining up to take photos, even setting up easels in the traffic paths. This is, of course, a fabulous museum, but joining the crowds in July was not the thing to do. Go only off season when, I assume, you may actually be able to see something. Maybe the authorities should consider controlling visitor traffic as they do in Peterhof."

If you get to the main yard you have gone too far. With ticket in hand go to the right of the main queue and walk straight in. This must be the best museum on the World. It is fabulous. We got a two day ticket which means you have to go on two consecutive days. We spent a good 5 hours and have only covered half of the exhibits. We will return tomorrow to finish the job. As well as the main exhibits there are some brilliant temporary ones such as the one on Freemasonry in its early stages in Russia. Take a bottle of water and a snack with you. It's thirsty work and although there is a small cafe area there the food will not tantalise your taste buds. This is the highlight of the city and ranks alongside the likes of the Alhambra in Granada."

We loved the architectural beauty of the Hermitage, and the collections were impressive, but the viewer/user experience left MUCH to be desired. We were herded/hurried by our Russian \"english speaking\" guide Elena, through the rooms so hot and stuffy, all five of us agreed it would be a long time before we returned. I have travelled to many different countries, and always go to see many museums, so I have a lot of great national museums to compare this to; and this was so far below our experience we have had for example at the Louvre (I have returned 8 times there), the Vatican, or at the British Museum (4 times) that we would not go back until Russia and St. Pete's spend some time and money addressing the problems such as no air conditioning , no apparent place to stop and get coffee/ food, information kiosks poor, excessively long lines, lack of restrooms, and stuffiness, no fresh air flow. Even though large and small windows were there, they were not opened to the beautiful cool summer weather outside as Versailles does. Our Emglish speaking guide sanctioned by the hermitage \"elena\" didn't truly have command of English, so I whispered to my daughter more detail about certain paintings as we were viewing. I was glad to leave Hermitage and sadly that shouldn't be a viewers experience after spending as much money as we did."

Beautiful rooms, beautiful parquets, non protected, overcrowd of paintings and pieces of art. You want to enjoy the Ermitage, just choose a few rooms per day to enjoy, do not go like the other tourist that just pass by like suitecases ( not to say cows) that are more into tuning their cameras for which they forgot to turn off the flashes than to appreciate the art richness of the place. If it is only to say you were there just buy the entrance ticket as a souvenir. If you really want to enjoy choose your visit pace and thema yourself and you will have a great experience even though you will be surrounded by hordes of suitecases visitors. I wish for the Russian that the future conservator of this musee will be more attentive of putting less art pieces inside for the people to enjoy them more than to go there as a must stop to be able to say I was there. for the people who enjoyed piece of art parquets go fast there because I do not believe they will resist the tourists since nothing is apparently done to protect them.

            "review": "If it's on your list of \"places to see before you die,\" then see it. I've visited every top museum in the world. The Hermitage was a disappointment. The lines are extremely long to get in. To avoid this, you need to get your ticket on-line and bring your passport for security purposes (I presume). You will be paying more than a Russian citizen, so you might as well get in first. I felt sorry for those who were standing outside in all kinds of weather, however. I did not go on a tour, so it was nice to move about at my own pace.Second, it was difficult to know how to get to the 3rd floor. When I tried the elevator, a museum worker told me the elevator didn't go to the 3rd floor, although another worker had told me it did. The woman denying me elevator access didn't speak English, but her rudeness and the abrupt \"dosvydanya\" was clear. I finally found a stairwell amidst the construction leading to the 3rd floor, after a lot or walking.Third, the Rastrelli gift shop closes before the museum on a Wed., when the museum stays open until 9:00 p.m., so if you want to buy anything, do it before it closes. I had wanted to buy an item for about $300 and was disappointed to see the doors locked, probably by 5:00. I returned the next day with my old ticket to see if I could simply be allowed into the gift shop, located beyond the turnstiles (strangely enough). No chance. No one at this museum, including administration, had the wherewithal or imagination to figure out how I could buy this item without standing in line and paying for another ticket. If you want to experience a \"cold war\" atmosphere in Russia's supposed age of \"freedom and democracy,\" try bending one of its rules. When you get to the point when you're wondering, \"Who do I have to bribe to get them to take my money?\" you're having a \"cold war\" experience.Fourth, the Hermitage is extremely huge. Therefore, it's necessary to have a map with you because a staff member in each room will be, by and large, cold, rude, arrogant and unhelpful. No one appears to speak another language other than Russian. This museum knows it has a captive audience, so why be user friendly? I should add that the National Heritage docents in the UK do their jobs FOR FREE, and couldn't be more obliging, whether speaking another language or not. The UKs' standard of living is higher than Russia's, so that could explain the attitude differences. Still.Fifth, the Winter Palace was not lived in by the Tsars after the assassination of Alexander II, taking place where Church of the Spilled Blood now stands. Also, it was shelled during WWII, so massive restoration had to occur. The library of Nicolas II interested me as it most closely represented his actual library according to 1900's photo in the room. However, other rooms looked completely different, with few original furniture items/pictures surviving revolution and war. Better to use your time trying to locate the stairwell (NOT THE ELEVATOR-- unless you want a Russian reprimand) to the 3rd floor to see the ca. 19th C. works there.Sixth and last, the beautiful peacock clock is supposedly set to go off at 7:00 p.m. ONLY on a Wed., or so we had thought. However, the staff in the room could not communicate this to us. We inferred it when a large group of tour groups stood around the exhibit at 7:00 pm, waiting, waiting, to no avail. I guess somebody forgot to wind the clock. The video nearby was helpful to get an idea of what a piece of art this is."

The Hermitage was meant to be the highlight of my trip to St Petersburg but unfortunately it seemed that every other tour group in the city (including huge numbers from a cruise ship) chose the same afternoon to attend as our group. The groups follow the same route and, as a result, the visit was three hours of being pushed and shoved by other tourists, no time to look at any works properly and feeling faint in hot, overcrowded rooms. It is important to mention that the Hermitage is huge and there are many hundreds of other rooms which were empty but if you only go to see the most famous stuff be prepared for a crush. In the Impressionists gallery, the crowd was so bad that I could not even enter the room and gave up. The Rembrandt room was so overcrowded that I had to leave because I felt faint. I do not think this situation is really anyone's fault as everyone comes with the same good intentions but I suggest that you visit early in the day before the tour groups get there in such big numbers and try and focus on less prominent works to get the most out of your visit."

Our tour guide was an art major in college, so you can imagine his passion for the works of art. We toured for over three hours and saw a small percentage of the paintings. It really is hard to describe. You really need to experience it yourself. It is just a ginormous museum with thousands and thousands of paintings. What a collection. It gets very crowded due to all of the tours, so if you can go on Wednesdays late in the afternoon, it will be a more enjoyable experience.Catherine's Winter Palace is also a must see. Catherine enjoyed gold. You will get a sense of it during the tour. Definitely worth the time to tour."

The ceilings, the floors, the walls and stairways are a majestic sight to behold; not to mention the art and artifacts on display. Don't miss the DaVinci Room, the peacock clock, the Picasso room, the Renoir room and the Michelangelo statue. A couple words of warning: Do not disobey the \"Do not photograph\" signs and don't touch anything. There are women that watch every move you make and are not friendly when they approach you for violating a rule. Also get there as early as possible; another good reason to go with a guide because the museum gets very crowded and it is hot inside. The museum bathrooms are free and they are also clean."

Once you get in, buy your tickets(and photo license) from the machine, because inside there usually is long line.

We went around 6pm and there was no line for tickets, no tour groups and no crowds. The Peacock Clock is wound only once a week on Wed at 7pm, so that was the only crowded part of the visit. The Museum is huge, so make a plan and decide ahead of time what you must see. Be selective, the distances between rooms are vast, some rooms are so crowded with paintings that your head will spin as you try to take in each piece of art."

Print your voucher and bring it with you to Sct Petersburg. On the day of your visit, you go to the museum to exchange your voucher to real tickets, and then you can enter. We experienced NO queues because we had done this. Otherwise queues were long. Use 4 hours if medium interested in art and very beautiful palace rooms. I really loved the Jordan stairs. My father loved the very old Pazyryk carpet which was also beautifully displayed in a rather dark room. Unfortunately information only in Russian. Use more hours in the museum, or even two days, if you are very interested in art. Mainly European art. If you are not interested in art, or if your are a 7-year-old child, then just use around two and a half hours to see the overwhelmingly pretty Jordan stairs in room 192 and the other extremely beautiful palace rooms such as rooms 204 and 197 which really rival the art exhibition. If still up for more, go see the interesting portrays of women in the French sections, in rooms 322 or so. If many in your group, try to split up and walk no more than in threes. Bring or buy your guide book. It didn't seem desirable to follow a guide for hours with a big group in this huge museum. There is plenty to see in your own pace. Cafe not recommendable because of boring and dry sandwiches and the very noisy location. Ok for a quick cup of coffee. Not expensive, though. Eat before and after visit. Buy ice cream just outside the museum. A lot of people but possible to see and navigate. We were not pushed around. Free wardrobe where you have to leave bug bags. Photos ok in most rooms, but never with flash. Benches in every third room or so. Elevators, so available for wheelchair users."

We tried to visit the Hermitage on a rainy day, and waited in line for more than an hour to buy tickets, and had at least another hour to go when we decided to abort our plans and try another day. The ticket line is very slow to move, and people are only allowed inside in small batches to be able to queue again at indoor ticket windows. Later that night, we then bought tickets online, and asked our hotel concierge to print the voucher. There is a desk under the entrance archway where the voucher can be swapped for the tickets. A passport or identity card is needed to verify the identify of the person who purchased the tickets. Our child (age 5) was also given a free ticket when we exchanged the voucher. n.b. online tickets are more expensive, but it was well worth the speed of entrance, compared with that loooooong line.if you buy online, use the fast track line and directly enter the building. Inside are several free cloak rooms where you can leave coats, large bags, etc. There are also toilets, although the ladies side had very long lines, so be prepared to wait. The museum does restrict what you can carry inside, and you have to pass through security like an airport (baggage screening and security screening to get inside). Interestingly, the sign said no high heeled shoes (stiletto heels). Presumably this is because of the many hard wood inland floors.We found that the most interesting aspect of the Hermitage is the fact that it mixes both historic rooms of the palace, some of which are furnished with period pieces, with other rooms where artwork and sculptures are displayed. The mix is fascinating, as this is both an art museum and a palace. Some of the rooms had amazing gilded ceilings, chandeliers, and intricate inlaid floors. Cameras were allowed. Some people had stickers showing a camera (for a fee?) and many others didn't. We asked, and were told that cameras for private use were OK to use, with no flash. If we were a professional or had significant equipment, then we would need to purchase a permit. Despite many signs showing no flash allowed, many visitors shamelessly used flashes throughout the museum. Given the priceless works of art, this was very selfish behavior.The interior of the museum is very warm in the summer, with only a few windows open throughout the enormous property. We easily could have worn shorts and t-shirts, despite being chilly outside. Dress accordingly.We did see a cafe outside in the courtyard, but didn't see any refreshments inside.The enormity of this property cannot be over-emphasized. Each floor had hundreds of rooms. Our 5-year old child barely made it around one of the floors, and the started to melt down, so we had to leave. There are relatively few places to sit (some benches in rooms from time to time), and the site is very crowded with tour groups constantly passing through. Some of the museum staff were very strict, asking us to keep moving along, not to take up too much of the bench seating (when our child reclined), and not to get too close to the windows (when we were quite warm).Regarding other reviews mentioning pickpocketing, we did find that the rooms with famous art were exceedingly crowded, and at one point, we saw two teenage boys who were loitering in a room and checking out the visitors as they passed through, literally eyeballing bags. Nothing happened to us, but we could see how the environment could be prone to issues. It seems prudent to leave anything important back in your hotel safe.We did find this a fascinating site, but it takes a careful planning and stamina. Plan accordingly!"

The Hermitage is really large, but we got through without any problems. We did our tour early morning, but as the time went on it did get crowded. I'm not a huge art buff but I really was glad I did this tour. As time was limited I think we stayed just under 3 hours but of course its a personal thing how long you wish to take. It was a warm day and as the Hermitage is an old building it gets a bit stuffy with crowds. You have toilets at the start and again I saw some near the end of the tour also. Did not see many during the tour of the Hermitage. Lifts were available also. They don't allow flash photography where there are oil paintings. A tip for shoppers. I purchased a lovely print on canvas which looks really well, Vincent Van Gogh - Landscape with Horse and Ploughman year 1889. This worked out at $30 and was packaged for me also to carry. I got it home in the package rolled up and it did not get damaged. I would however have preferred a circular carrier. They have cardboard ones with handles. But it did the job. They had a huge selection of prints really wonderful, so well priced.I found the Hermitage shop to be good value. It had all the usual stuff, fridge magnets etc and good value also.

The English audio guide (350) is absolutely worth it for the upper floors as there's limited English-language signage throughout the museum.--(well, really, throughout Russia--lol) We went at 2:00 and crowds were beginning to thin. Once in, we simply made sure to go in the opposite direction of tour groups and did fairly well at having breathing room. Day two we did the bottom floor--the audio guide doesn't cover this floor.

I must warn you that in mid-June the museum is EXTREMELY crowded in many spots with tourists elbowing and jockeying to photograph their favorite pieces (and often not very courteous about allowing others the opportunity to enjoy the same). Based on our experience, be prepared to experience very crowded conditions in the galleries displaying the daVincis and the Rembrandts expecially. Unfortunately, pickpockets are known to love the Hermitage as well, so be aware of your belongings at all times. We did not have any trouble, but a friend of ours had his trousers expertly slit with a razor in an attempt to access his wallet (unsuccessful but embarrassing). Our guide made traversing the galleries easy, but the lack of English direction markings and no comprehensive maps would make a trip alone a bit daunting.

The reason being that this museum is visited everyday by literally thousands of tourists.Rules to know, this is ideal ground for thieves and pickpockets, make sure you hang on to all your valuables. If you have bladder problems, the wait for the ladies could easily be half an hour. If you have problems with other peoples BO put a peg on your nose.

The museum is in the Winter Palace so you get to see the incredible opulence of the royalty. Every ceiling, staircase and pillar is so carefully and artistically designed and sculpted - imagine the expense required by the royal family in a city of poverty. No wonder it finally culmulated in revolution.I'm more of a history person than an art person, so what interested me were rooms 188-198 on the second floor, where the attraction is history, not art.Russian royalty once partied and feasted in these begilded, bedraped, and bejewelled chambers. In 1917 February Revolution, the Provisional Government met for the very last time in the green-pillared Malachite Hall (room 198), before being arrested in the adjacent dining room. The building faces Palace Square, where Lenin\u2019s Bolshevik forces assembled before storming in the Winter Palace and deposing the government. The museum is in the czars' old Winter Palace, the green-and-white building between Palace Square and the river.Tips:- Make sure you take a compound map of the Hermitage before passing the ticket barriers, as there are none to be had after them - and you'll be hopelessly lost without one.- Adult tickets purchased at the normal ticket counter would cost 400 roubles (approx. USD12). Students have free entry (show your ISIC!) but still have to line up at the normal ticket counter to claim the free ticket before entering.- Online purchase of admission ticket is available for adults and cost USD17.95 instead, and you get a voucher printout that can be exchanged for the ticket itself on the day of visit (you don't have to know your date of visit when you buy online, as the voucher is valid for 6 months). The exchange is done in a priority queue, separate from the normal counter. Tickets purchased online include a free photography permit (normally 200 roubles).- If you buy an adult ticket online but have students with you, these students together with you can join the priority queue with you despite them not having reserved any online. ISIC must be shown.- No one checks whether you bought a photography permit when you snap away- There is a Hermitage app on the Apple AppStore, although it's not very useful, it's free, you might want to check it out."

For someone who visited most other great museums of the world, our visit to the Hermitage did not even come close to the Louver. Part of this is due to the fact that most people who arrive on cruise ships are allocated only 2-3 hours there, and they all arrive about the same time which make the visit extremely crowded (think of a visit to Versailles these days). In addition, the place is not air conditioned and can get very stuffy. But putting all this aside, I still found the Hermitage rather boring. There are very few important world famous pieces there and it's just not the high level as the Louver and d'Orsay. JMHO"

You certainly do not need a group and since a typical group had about fifty travelers in it, they looked pretty miserable, being herded through the already crowded halls. 3. Use the museum website to plan ahead and just mark on a museum map what you want to see. If you don't want to be rushed, allow one day for the Old Masters, and the second day for the French Impressionists, ancient art, and anything you happen to really like4. Use the Audioguide. It's about $12 and is a really an art education (plus a tour of the winter palace)5. If you're going with another person or persons, agree to meet at the end of the day at a certain time and place. It is VERY easy to get separated (envision a Rolling Stones concert letting out). In order to avoid constantly keeping an eye out for traveling companions and not seeing any art, we all deliberately split up for the day and met a few hours later"

The Hermitage is of course a must-see in St. Pete, both for art-lovers and for who has no idea of whats going on and is just following the tour guide. The collection was started by the art-lover empress Catherine the Great (who loved Da Vinci, so you'll see 2 of his 14 known canvases), and was extended over the years with donations including the fantastic Schukin collection, with a lot of Picassos. I also loved the hall with Canova's sculptures, Matisse's Dance and the fabulous Gainsborough Women in Blue. Having that said, the bad part of Hermitage is that it's located in Russia, which means TERRIBLE staff, almost nobody speaks english and the unfriendly russian ladies taking care of the rooms are never prone to help you. Seriously, these people seem to hate the foreign visitors. To get inside is a MESS, they don't have organized queues, people just gather in front of the gates and fight their way when they open. Therefore, my rating is ONLY for the collection and the building itself, staff and service are just TERRIBLE."

There has been so much said about the magnificent collections and incredible views of the museum that I do not have enough words to explain my emprissons by the art. You must go there! However, there are some aspects that do require improvement or you must be prepared to deal with. The first thing, which is more of a comment as there is not much to be done about it, I think that the tickets should be sold for 2-3 days entrance. The collections are so big that, despite their amazing content, my friend and I just passivley walked through half of them as the brain can't process this much art in one day. Now recommendations with comments. Make sure that you wear VERY comfortable shoes as there are many rooms and you \"have to\" see them in one day, but there are very rare benches standing in the corners of the corridors, so you always have to walk and cannot stop to contemplate looking at the picture (if you stop, you will be pushed by the crowd). The bathrooms are terrible and so few that there are always long lines, then it is not very clean (although alright)- this was already mentioned by other reviewers. The cafeteria, another complaint of the reviewers, is bad. Very few tables for such a huge museum, and a small variety of food. I won't complain about the prices though as everywhere in the world the prices in the museum cafes are higher. My friend and I paid 450 rubles for 2 sandwiches one green tea and one water. It is about 13USD- even cheap for some museum cafes. TO wrap up, I wrote all these to help you prepare for the difficult parts as they can really spoil the whole event, but you still must see the Hermitage as it is incredible!"

There are boundless treasures to be seen in this museum. Of course they won't tell you that after the 1917 revolution, much of the artwork and assets of anyone with means in the country was confiscated and nationalized - which serves as the foundation of all their modern artwork. In any event, the museum is phenomenal and should not be missed. Amazing history."

If you want to avoid the hotel can book VIP ticket for 1500 rubles instead of normal ticket of 500 plus. You get the enter VIP way. Second for photography additional ticket is required 200 rubles please pay worth taking photographs. It is divided into three parts hermitage , winter palace and small hermitage. If you want to see all it can take more than one day. The most beautiful I liked was the peacock clock made of gold and silver. Also the ancient history has an excellent collection. Also the throne room worth taking pictures. The staircase is opulent. Also must see Russian room which is unique part. The cafe is really nice to take a break on ground level. I don't think you need a guide as it is very organized as books and audio guide is available. The cost of indivisible guide is around 1000 rubbles per hour and min 4 hrs. You can bargain if you can speak Russian. Tours in group much cheaper. Also the museum shops are good to shop. Please take camera coupon worth 200 rubbles. Our guide name was Janna aleksandrova , an English teacher around mid forties, number +7 981 799 79 29. Email is Alexa-zhanna@yandex.ru."

The Winter Palace and Hermitage are amazing to see in themselves, plus all the art treasures own display, including Da Vinci's \"other\" Madonna which you can actually get up very close to as opposed to the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. Allow 2-3 hours to see the best of it. And be prepared for the huge crowds in every room and the sheer enormous scale of the place."

Unfortunately we went during 'White Nights' in June so the crowds were out which made it very warm inside the hermitage where a few open windows was the only source of air. We were blessed to have gone as part of a guided tour (Travel All Russia) which allowed us to cut some of the lines/crowd and gave a great commentary as we walked through all the rooms. I wish i would have had more free time to explore the galleries on our own but at least we hit all the highlights. We paid ~$75usd per person for the Diamond Fund Tour of the crown jewels etc and it was not worth the price, had we bought tickets through the hermitage it would have been only ~$10usd which would have been worth it for the price. My husband and I actually enjoyed the Armoury Tour at the Kremlin which was included in the Kremlin admission and was way more interesting to us due to the variety of items. The highlight of the Armoury Tour at Kremlin was the gowns and chariots on display, there was a room with ~20 chariots/stage coaches that were the most exquisite and ornate things- beyond your imagination!!"

There are 3 lines: 1 for those getting free, on the day tickets, which is by far the longest, 1 for those buying specific tickets and 1 for those with pre booked online tickets. BUT, if you have an online voucher, you still have to line up to change the voucher into tickets. THEN, you line up inside the Winter Palace, which is the pastel green building, to scan your ticket before you can enter, but bear in mind at this point you meet up with hundreds of people in tour groups coming from the rear of the building, the side near the river. Soooo, in essence, give yourself plenty of time. They don't allow you to take liquid into the buildings and there is only one toilet area in the whole building. Which is at the front as you enter, so be warned. Once inside it is pretty well laid out, but so bloody big that you really must have set in mind what you want to see, because you will get lost. If you intend to see most or all of it, you wont do it in a day unless you zip through the rooms. I cannot impress on you the number of people at certain pinch points. Unbelievable, so many in fact that this in itself is a photo opportunity. Possibly due to the time of year. It has some absolutely stunning rooms and an obvious must. A little disappointed with the lack of info on most of the exhibits; where, why, how, who etc, but it didn't spoil it. I could go on and on. In a nut shell: do it. Don't go thirst or hungry or needing the toilet and take time to sit/stand and simply wonder. Have a great time."

We were fortunate to see it at night when it was closed to the general public, and that made it so much more special as the crowds were just three or four groups from our two Holland America cruise liners, and there was no crowding so you could see everything without feeling squashed or fighting others to get a look at a painting or sculpture etc."

The opulance in these buildings which date back hundreds of years, show how rich the rich were and in contrast how poor the poor were. The decor was incredible."

I fail to understand as to how this luxurious palace of Catherine the Great has come to be called Hermitage, normally an abode of hermits who live solitarily. Many visitors rush through this Art Museum in a jiffy but you need many hours and even days to see and appreciate the best collected Artifacts. It is also said that if a connoiseur spends one minute for one exhibit, he would need around six years to view the whole Museum. Such is the magnitude. The Palace itself is an architectural beauty and the pastel shades of white and green chosen for the exterior is eyecatching when viewed from the far off Fort. The Red granite Alexander Column in the courtyard is something unique in its class. It is also unfortunate that this Palace was the first target of Revolutionists in 1917. A World icon indeed."

There is an extensive art collection which is very impressive. 2 hours was the minimum time in which we could have gone round it. There was a lack of English translations around the museum which was frustrating. We got an audioguide which gave us a lot more information at a cost of only 350 rubles which is a hell of a lot cheaper than hiring a guide. This was the main attraction we came to see and were not disappointed. However beware the location marked on the trip advisor map is incorrect. We didn't have any other maps and ended up walking out to a random part of town looking for it. In hindsight it was a schoolboy error, but I'm sure we are not the only people to ever do it!"

The winter palace has been totally refurbished and one gets a good incite into the life of the tsars. It is amazing that the government of Russia has put so much money into restoring an era they wouldn't recognize for years. There is so much to see but very little is translated into English and it is not easy to find out where many of these artifacts originated. Well worth many more visits."

A few tips - (1) We purchased a two day pass online. With your online pass, from the main plaza, proceed through the courtyard (past the lengthy lines) and enter the main entry hall. At the information/reception desk in the center, your online ticket's validity will be verified. At that point we directed to a less crowded ticket box (near the cloak rooms). the cashier generated tickets for our party (first day/second day tickets). One observation, line etiquette is not always observed, be patient and persistent. (2) Our college student was able to get a free entry at one of the regular ticket boxes next to the information/reception desk. She used her regular university ID card, from a well-known school, instead of one of the \"international student ID cards\" that most of the other venues expect. (3) The two day ticket is well worth the additional cost. It allows you to break up your visit and avoid \"museum fatigue\" - this is a huge site. (4) A beauty of independent travel is the ability to enjoy the palace and collections at your own pace. We repeatedly found ourselves leisurely marveling at the private and state rooms as tours raced by at a breakneck pace."

Seemed EVERYONE was freely taking photos everywhere with cameras and phones without paying extra for the privilege. Only can't photograph what is marked no photo. No flash on paintings, only flash for statues. SUPER CROWDED. Turn immediately right upon entrance and use ticket to pass through turnstiles. Absolutely get a free map in your language which shows the three floors and color codes and numbers the rooms according to what era-nationality painters you wish to see. The room numbers are above almost every door and are for the room that you are presently INSIDE, NOT the one you are entering. Also, the Winter Palace is amazing architecture and history itself. The mechanical gold Peacock clock functions ONLY on Tuesday. Check for the time. Recommend starting on the third floor and working down to avoid the massive crowds and annoying tour groups who act like they own the place. Internet cafe good for lunch and a sit down.

If I had the choice though, I wouldn't go here again. There were so many tour groups that it was often difficult to get close to any of the paintings or sculptures and the staff were characteristically unfriendly. Also, the caf\u00e9 was absolutely dire so make sure you eat before you go. My advice would be to go to see the impressive building from the outside, and if you are going to Moscow as well as St Petersburg then the Tretyakov Gallery is far more impressive."

Today in St. Petersburg we had a half-day tour of the Hermitage, something of a continuation of the \"gilt trip\".from yesterday's tours of the Catherine Palace and Peterhof Palace. I think I\u2019m going to have to paint all the ceilings when I get back home, plain old white ceilings will seem so vanilla, after all this. I guess I can do that after I install the new fountains I\u2019ll have to order for the garden (s); once those are finished I can tackle the parquet for the floors. The Hermitage is one of the world\u2019s great museums, the problem with the ship\u2019s tours however, is that you get herded through the museum like cattle. It\u2019s the only option unless you hold an individual visa - like most passengers we were under the ship\u2019s visa which only allows you ashore as part of the ship sponsored tours. Since we didn\u2019t have a tour this morning we had to stay on board, border control is very strict. Anyway, while you wouldn\u2019t want to miss seeing it, the Hermitage in the summer is hot, crowded and rushed. You come away with a general impression of the wonder of it, but there\u2019s not time to really learn about anything in depth. The commentary was along the lines of: \u201cImportant visitors came up this staircase, here\u2019s the throne, here\u2019s a picture of Alexander the Great (no it\u2019s not Napolean), now we\u2019re going to see Tintoretto \u2013 please move to the right, we have to squeeze in with this other group.\u201d Like a high-speed car chase through Manhattan and then you can say \"There! I've seen New York!\"I\u2019m kind of surprised at the museum; not having climate control, allowing works by famous painters like Raphael to hang in direct sunlight, the crowding in front of the most renowned works by painters like Tintoretto, Reuben and Davinci. They don\u2019t make you wear shoe coverings, and the priceless parquet floors are getting worn and pitted. There were many people even taking flash photos, although the signs say not to \u2026 nobody stops them! I guess the government has more critical issues to address than art preservation, but it was surprising after being in museums like the Smithsonian or the British Museum in the past.Don\u2019t get me wrong, the Hermitage is spectacular \u2013 I just hope they get a bit better at crowd control in the future. About 5 million people live in St. Petersburg (20% or so are illegal immigrants, which is hard to understand with the tight border controls), but about 10 million a year visit as tourists. Especially by cruise ship. Makes for some real chaos when there are six or seven ships in port at the same time.We also swung past the Sts. Peter and Paul Fortress, but there wasn\u2019t time to go inside \u2013 at least I saw the exterior. There are so many great works of art & architecture in St. Petersburg that you just can\u2019t see it all in a short trip, but you do get a sense of the importance of this city on the Neva and it\u2019s place in Russian history. (Did you know that EVERY Tsar was assassinated? They lived well, but paid a high price for it in the end.)To see the rest of my blog about this trip please visit http://sailorscruisenews.blogspot.com."

Located at the center of the city at the very end of the Nevsky propect and right by the Neva, you can't miss this impressive white and green building. (the museum is housed in the winter palace)It's easy to wander for hours in the museum without still having seen the main attractions. I advise you to start with the second floor and get the chance to navigate directly among the royal apartments. Then depending on the time or on your tiredness, you'll either choose to climb the stairs to see the masterpieces of famous French painters (Picasso, Gauguin, Matisse) or to go downstairs and enjoy the Antiques.Plan on spending at least 3 hours in this museum, entrance fee : 400p"

We were advised at all places with these conditions to protect our wallets.Anyway, the Hermitage is huge with many buildings and it contains some spectacular collections.

HOWEVER, I would recommend going on the day it is closed with a private guide. This way, you will avoid the stupid masses. The idiots who aren't there to see and appreciate art, but rather are there to simply check it off their list of places they've been and to take endless pictures of themselves and the art. I realize that this is the way things are now, but seriously? Sorry, I digress...The collection is absolutely amazing. The buying spree they went on before the Bolsheviks was one helluva spree! From Da Vinci to Matisse to Chagall to Picasso. ALL of the big names are here, but it's also the vast collection from lesser known artists that were the most stunning (Mikhail Vrubel!). This place is HUGE, so choose your collections carefully and don't forget to take in the grandeur of the Hermitage itself. If you don't have a guide, be sure to get an audioguide. Although they're a bit spotty in certain collections, overall, they're really good. They also have a lot of info about the building itself."

I will only say that if you're in St Petersburg for any length on time, this museum is a MUST and if you're taking a tour, I highly recommend SPB Tours because they use 16 (max) passenger mini bus. Our guide was outstanding because she gave us so much information it was unbelievable not only while we where in the museum but through out the whole tour on places we visited.

I have wanted to visit the Museum for many years and finally got the chance when we cruised the Baltic Sea. The collection is housed in the Winter Palace of Czar Peter the Great. Perhaps because my expectations were so high because of the reputation of the museum, and because I have had the opportunity to visit so many great art museums, I found myself greatly disappointed. Because it was a residence, albeit a grand one for a Czar, it is not well organized for viewing the collection. Added to that, I thought the collection was not well displayed to be able to enjoy the experience. In most of the museum the art is over shadowed by the beauty of the Palace itself, and it is without question a grand palace. We might have had a better experience if the number of people in the museum had been better regulated. Entrance to the museum is theoretically time controlled by a reservation at a set time. Apparently there capacity control is not well managed as it was very overcrowded making it difficult and in some cases impossible to see some of the more popular pieces. Shocking to me, considering the value both historical as well as intrinsic, was the lack of temperature and light control. Natural lighting from large and extensive windows have got to be taking their toll on the collection as well as making for poor lighting for viewing. The rooms were overly warm and they opened windows in the galleries to help cool the spaces. All that being said, the art is great and I would not have missed the experience. I would heartily recommend a visit to anyone who has a love for art. Just something you have to do."

The floors, the walls and he ceilings have the most amazing decorations/paintings etc. So much wealth. It took my wife and I two days to cover all the ground and we could not look at everything in the detail it required. We were able to get into one of the treasury rooms and the gold, silver, and gems on display was far richer than I have seen anywhere else (except the hope diamond). The Louvre fades when compared with the Hermitage. We also saw the Peacock clock work (Wed @ 19:00) and it was amazing - you can find videos on YouTube.On the bad side: very few tours in English, enterprising Russian offering tours in English for a lot of money ($100), rude Russians working in the Hermitage and rude Russians visiting it. Fortunately there were not too many of them (all seemed to be old, so a hangoer from Soviet days?). Once in, you cannot leave (so you have to eat within and its not good value or good food)."

If you're a museum \"fan,\" allow at least one full day, or more if you can afford it. Best time of year would be outside the spring-summer period. Best time of day would be as early as you can possibly start. The masterpieces in the collection are absolutely stunning, too numerous to list here. Guided tours are your best bet, though that would limit your time available to wander through all the floors. Check the dozens of web sites and books that discuss the Hermitage collection, and prepare yourself before entering. This is not the kind of place that lends itself to zipping down the hallways. There's just too much to see. I would recommend this only for grownups. There's just far too much for kids to see without getting seriously bored and cranky. If there's one site in St Petersburg that you must visit, this is it. There is a special section called \"The Gold Room,\" which is fantastic, and requires an additional admission fee. No photos in this section, and it's easy to understand why. Small groups only, and each group is escorted and guided by two associates. Then you leave. Very tightly controlled, but an absolutely amazing collection. Again, grownups only for this and the entire museum, unless you have a serious student in your household who's able to absorb the grandeur and history without getting bored."

Please, for the love of everything that is holy, purchase your ticket online, on their website and have a print-out of the ticket with you in hand!!! I did just that, without expecting what I saw upon my arrival at the Museum. It was a cold rainy day, perfect to go to the Museum. I get in the front arch, leading to the entrance and there was probably more than a thousand people waiting in line. Yes, a thousand! I just could not believe it. I took a picture from a window inside and counted more than 600 people and it wasn't the full line. Being a witty traveler, I decided to go see what was going on at the front of the line. I saw two lines. One, over a mile long and the second line... Empty. Why? This line was for people with tickets. So I go in, and inside, the signage is not clear. There are many ticket offices, for different purposes. They do have employees that can guide you to the accurate line-up. So i just picked one line and this employee came to me, seeing me with my print-out ticket in hand. She told me to follow her. A few minutes later, I had my real ticket in hand and could start my visit. Litterally an 8-minute process, while people outside were waiting hours, in the cold rain to get in. The Museum itself is an absolute masterpiece. Every room is more overwhelming than the other, it's just spectacular. It's worth the wait, if you have to wait in line for your ticket. Even if you wait 2hours, it's worth it. I have read that this museum has so many artworks and masterpieces in it, that if you spent only a minute in front of each, you'd spend 11 years in the Museum. When they say it's one of the biggest museums in the world, they are not kidding! Plan at least two hours to do the quick room-to-room tour. If you enjoy art, then it can be longer than that! So remember: purchase your ticket online at http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/ and you'll thank me later!"

Our guide provided all the necessary history and details. She also navigated the maze of rooms for us...saving us time and keeping us from getting lost. Our guide also arranged an early entry, so we were able to see much of the museum before the serious crowds entered.It is a DNM (Do Not Miss) sight in St. Petersburg. Visit with a guide and go early. It is warm in the museum, so leave your jacket on the bus. There are several nice gift shops, a coffee shop, and restrooms on the entry level. There are stairs in several places. It may not be handicapped accessible ...if that is an issue, it would be best to check with the museum before you go.Also, be careful of the souvenir hawkers across the street from the entrance.

Also, in general, the architecture and decorations in most of the galleries are eye-popping. The surprises were that much (though certainly not all!) io the Impressionist and Dutch art was of lower quality than we expected--the Metropolitan Museum, Chicago Art Institute and Louver/Musee d\"Orsay all tend to have better examples of a given artist's work. Also, the lighting on the paintings is almost uniformly poor, including the fact that many hang next to windows, fully exposed to sunlight. Another highlight is the main gift shop, which had better, superb quality amber jewelry, mother of pearl and filigree, lacquer boxes and other items than we found elsewhere int he city."

Also, hordes of tourists make it advisable to get there early and try to allocate multiple days to exploring the collections. A guided tour might be a good idea your first time through, just to collect all the little tidbits, but then wandering through at your leisure (at least, as much as is possible with all the other tourists in the way) is the best way to soak it all in, I think.

You could easily spend days visiting all the paintings and treasures, but half a day with a good guide will show you a good selection. There is an excellent museum shop, but after purchasing a small piece of jewelry I saw it for a quarter of the price in the nearby market. Be selective, go to the market first. It is outside the Church of our Saviour on Spilled Blood."

This time I just concentrated on the Picasso and Matisse collections. They are both staggering in their quantity and quality. Just walking to these collections takes you through magnificently decorated state rooms and past innumerable other works of art that it is hard to tear your eyes away from. My recommendation for someone visiting St. Petersburg for a few days? Don't even think of trying to 'do' the Hermitage in half a day or a day. Your brain will explode! Instead, decide what periods / collections you really want to see and set aside a couple of hours for each day of your trip. That will enable you to at least scratch the surface!"

The extravagance of the place is stunning. It is hardly surprising that the common people revolted when they saw how much money the Tsars were spending on a roof over their head. Whatever the rights and wrongs of spending so much public money on a building, it should not be missed on any visit to St Ps. Every inch inside seems to be covered with some form of carving or gold leaf. Extravagance gone mad and I've not even mentioned the world class art or museum. Our visit was finished off by a coral recital in an adjacent building. We so wanted to spend longer here and we must return - I just wish the visas were easier to obtain!!"

Not only is the exterior of the palace soooo photographed and world-famous, especially if you are lucky enough to be there on a sunny day and when there's no remodelling happening, but the inside has double the wow factor as a museum. What riches and treasures are contained within! So many periods of art and history with each artist almost in a room of the palace of their own. To be in the presence of such greatness was magical! We spent over 3 hours there but could go back several more times and still be wowed. Coats and bags are cloaked at Reception so expect this. Stairs are involved to get to all rooms but elevators exist if you have a Guide and can locate them, otherwise there are museum experts sitting in every room to assist. Car parking is across the other side of the very large square out the front, but disability access is available. There's a souvenir gift shop, of course, with books about everything you want to know re the Hermitage. Eat before going in as there's no food inside. It's located very close to the centre of the city and where most tourists would stay in hotels, so very easy walking distance. We cannot say enough about how impressed we were with this world-class museum with priceless works of art from the very best of artists around the world. Having an excellent Guide made the experience far more exciting than it would ever have been if we'd just been there on our own. Luckily we were also not in peak tourist season so not feeling overcrowded."

The buildings, the scale and the collections are very impressive.I therefore thought I'd pass on my best tips to ensure you get the most out of your visit.- buy your ticket online before you go. Then exchange your voucher at the kiosk within the entrance square. This allows you to queue jump.- if you have the time buy a 2 day pass. It's only a little more money but allows you to split up your visit.- time your visit so that you do not coincide with the hundreds and hundreds of tour groups who are also visiting. If there aren't many coaches parked out the back and front, then go on that day! It makes a difference!- as the tour groups seem to go in the morning or the afternoon, go to the popular sections at lunchtime. We went into Italian artist section twice, the first time in the morning, where I almost wanted to scream with claustrophobia. The second time around lunch, we had whole rooms to ourselves. What a difference!- finally there seems to be a quieter entrance to the winter palace. Go in the main entrance after purchasing your ticket and instead of joining the queue of people to go the the barriers on the right. Go up the stairs to the left (also marked as entrance). Go past the indoor shop and post office and up the stairs and you are in the Winter Palace, long before any other group will have made it there."

Unfrotunately, I had only a few hours there so I would love to come back! What is a bit confusing is finding your way around - I didn't find the signs very helpful."

My husband and I have wanted to visit the Hermitage for many years, and it definitely lived up to the expectations!We bought tickets in advance on the Hermitage website which allowed us to skip the very long queue in the courtyard. (And queues in Russia are something to avoid if possible - they're unpredictable and frustrating!)The crowds were impressive even in May, so I cannot imagine how it would be in the peak of summer. I downloaded the Hermitage app onto my iPhone in advance which was nice in that it gave an overview of some of the top pieces you should not miss. (It would have been more helpful if included a GPS based map to guide you to the pieces.) We got the English language audio tour which was helpful. However, if I were going again I would either plan my visit in more detail using the virtual tour on the Hermitage site, or hire a private guide at the museum. The map that comes with the audio guide is awful (or at least we struggled with it, and my husband made easy work of mastering the Moscow Metro to give you an idea of what we're used to). We purchased a map at one of the book shops but still had quite a time finding our way to the Picasso room. Overall, it was an amazing visit to an amazing collection of art. Don't miss it!"

I took the optional tours to the gold room and the diamond room which cost 300 rubles per person, and for me the gold room was a bit of a disappointment especially as on the tour of the diamond room also showcases gold artifacts so if you have to choose it's diamond every time.I could have spent the day in the diamond room alone."

Especially people that don't have that much interest in arts can fairly quickly get a feeling for different styles and artists by just visiting this one museum. You can do it in about an hour if you just skim through the most important stuff, or spend a whole day immersing yourself in everything.During summer season, the lines will be long.

I also, with great pains using the Hermitage website, made a spreadsheet per room to identify where all the art pieces were that I wanted to see. (By using the virtual tour and comparing numbers to actually gallery numbers on museum map.) Keep in mind, some of the famous works will be out on loan. But masterpieces abound. What can you say? Plan on going with others with same level of art appreciation as you. Leave the non-art lovers at home. Some of the greatest pieces of art in the world. I spent a total of 8 hours and this was rushed. If you have a ticket, barge through the line and small front revolving doors and go to the information desk where you can exchange your voucher for a ticket. (no help directing you this way.) Check your coat and backpack and then (with pre-planning) know which way you'll go from there. Pre-planning with gallery numbers is a must but you will still lose your way. Make use of the guards in each gallery. Some don't know any english but many know some. I experienced a wonderful classical vocal group singing in the reliquary room. Off-season visit was still very crowded, especially at inadequate entrance and in popular galleries (where tour groups go.) Get there at opening. I went directly to Leonardo da Vinci paintings on day two and was the only person in the gallery. See my photos for more information. If you found my review helpful, please click on \"yes.\" Thanks."

You simply cannot say that the Hermitage is better than or worse than something else--it would be a failure of language. It would be like reviewing a \"kilogram\" and saying it is too heavy or too light. That said, there are some things that could affect a visitors experience. Lines could get long, feet could get tired, food and water are rare and expensive. Adjust for these by going early (or in the bitterly-cold off-season), resting periodically and planning for water appropriately. Do so and you will experience the Platonic Form of museums."

It is a one-off, so it is worth doing.But after that, pick your art style, pick your country. There are some fantastic archaeological remains from the Steppe in a very out of the way part of the museum - on the first floor but you have to go up to the second floor and down again to get there and there is only one way in. These are from tombs in the permafrost, so lots of wonderful textiles, wood, even some tattooed skin. If you want more gold, get the additional ticket you need to see the Scythian gold.You need to pace yourself in the Hermitage and if you don't know what you want to see, you can just wander aimlessly.

On April 2nd, there were not too many visitors and we were able to see most of the main section of the museum in a 3,5 hour visit. Don't forget to close your mouth when you keep looking at all the various ceilings, gold leaf walls and more than anything the inlaid wooden floors that stretch forever. For me the Da Vinci's were overrated (for very small), the museum itself is impressive. For 200 roebels you can buy a camera ticket and no one will stop you taking pictures, but without flash! Some of the special exhibits are clearly marked and cannot be photographed. Well worth a visit!!"

Book tickets in advance to avoid queues or arrive at 10-30am when it opens, I can add nothing the previous reviews which caused us to visit it remains a must place to spend 3 / 4 hours of your time, top tip there are 3 floors and the third can easily be missed, you need to access it from room 280 on the second floor which is not clearly signed. Pay the extra 200 roubles for permission to photograph and remember to turn your flash off or face the wrath of the large Russian lady which I did."

The size of the building and the enormous amount of art is overwhelming. A bit sad that you after a while rush by 30 paintings by Matisse because you have seen another 30, but still it is an awesome experience. Highly recommend to buy/borrow the audio guide, without you are a bit lost. Perfect way to choose what you want to know more about (just punch in a number by each room/object and listen to all the interesting facts). The very Russian looking women sitting on a chair in every room is kind of an attraction as well."

If you don't, you'll have that moment of shame for the rest of your life when people say, \"Oh, you were in St Petersburg? Did you see the Hermitage? Wasn't it amazing?\" You don't want to hang your head and admit you skipped it and see the look of incredulity on the other person's face do you? Of course you don't.Some specifics: -Wear comfortable shoes. The floors are works of art in themselves and are not built for comfort. There aren't many benches in the viewing halls either.-Buy tickets online. That lets you skip some of the crazy lines and includes photography in the price.-Use some sort of guide. The audio guide for rent at the Hermitage is fine but can be deadly dull. There are professional guides available who speak excellent English (some will self-refer themselves in the lobby or in the viewing halls) who know every nuance of the museum and the art within...but that can be overwhelming. Another option is to get a book in advance that contains the history of the various halls, art, etc. that will let you be as specific as you like. There are plaques in Russian and English for every room and every piece of art, but they are bare-bones info.-Make a plan. It's easy to get hung up in one section or another. By the time you get out of the 18th century Russian halls...you might be exhausted and amazed at how much time has flown by. So decide in advance what you have to see (da Vinci, Monet, Picasso, peacock clock) and see them while you still have the strength.-Take a break. The Hermitage has adequate cafes on the first floor. You'll feel better after a cup of your beverage of choice and an ice cream sandwich...we did.-Young kids? Bring your stroller - See my note above about lack of seating. You are allowed to bring a stroller in and you should if you don't want to be carrying your four-year-old through dozens of rooms.-Take a day. There's just so much to see...the palace itself would be worth it even if it weren't filled to the brim with priceless statues, furnishings, and paintings."

I would personally say that I prefer it to the Lourve. The Hermitage was huge! We made it a point to arrive early at 9 plus am. Except the 30 mins when we took a break for lunch at the Hermitage Cafe, we stayed in the museum till it closed at 5pm and we couldn't finish all we wanted to see! There were simply much to take it. The palace itself, the grand Jordan staircase, all the artwork, the Gold room and its treasures, What a feast for the eyes!! Wish we had more time for it. There were many visitors at the Hermitage but due to the sheer size, we really didn't feel the crowd (except at the Jordan staircase). We took the English audio guide that gave very informative and interesting background to selected art works. we also took the tour to the Gold Room which took about 2 hours. The elderly lady guide gave really interesting commentary. Gave us very good background to the Faberge and lots of other intricate gem pieces in the collection. I highly recommend the Gold Room tour. Book it as soon as you enter the museum in the morning. Limited vacancies. If you are a lover of art and architecture, this is a must see for any visitors to St Petes."

We saw marvelous rooms all decorated with gold and marble. Elaborate furniture and wonderful chandeliers of gilded bronze and crystal. The paintings so beautiful that even I was carried away. One can find anything there. What I would recommend \u2013 do go with a guide. We had our own private guide Olga from the Best Guides Company. First of all without her we would simply get lost in the Hermitage with its numerous rooms and chambers. Secondly we would never find certain things on our own. Like we wanted to see the private rooms of the Russian Tzars \u2013 Olga took us there. So we were able to see for instance the private library of Nicholas II, that as far as I understand is away from the main tour quarters. But the main thing is that Olga told us all those stories about each room, and we felt like we are witnessing the life of the Russian Court with all the balls, receptions and political cataclysms. That was fantastic!Another fantastic experience was visiting the Gold Room. What a temptation for a woman! All those glistening snuff-boxes covered with diamonds. Watches, rings and pendants covered with enamel, rubies and pearls\u2026 Can you imagine \u2013 they have a horse harness decorated with Colombian emeralds and two other decorated with thousands (I do not remember exactly how many thousands, but it was really thousands!!!!) of diamonds. Poor me \u2013 after that any jewelry store would be just a toy shop."

I especially enjoyed the historical artifacts, gaining an understanding of the early culture in Russia as well as the culture that existed at the time of Peter the Great.

Note that you cannot wear a coat or carry plastic shopping bags into the museum so be prepared to check anything you have with you.The free map provided by the museum is useless and I found the map in my St. Petersburg Lonely Planet guide much more helpful. On my second day, immediately after going through the ticket turnstile, I was approached and offered a guided tour for a fee. Having spent my first visit wandering without direction through the vast, somewhat disorganized collection, I knew I needed help and immediately accepted the offer. Since it was off season, I ended up alone with the guide and got a private 1.5 hour tour for $40. If I had the visit to do again, I would have sought out a guide for both days. There are gift shops throughout the museum and the best things they sell are handmade crafts so don't assume that if you see an item you like, it will be available at the main shop near the cafe. The shop near the Impressionist art on the third floor had two really unique lacquer boxes, the like of which I didn't see anywhere else in St. Petersburg. The sales person told me that they were made by one artisan exclusively for the museum shop and since it was the Winter the whole museum only had the two at that one shop."

My main complaint is a very selfish one and is that the descriptions of this incredible archive of objects were all, almost exclusively in Russian. The titles of each object are in both languages, but from my memory that is all. This is a shame, as there were many western tourists during our visit and this makes it a challenge to appreciate the objects. Admittedly, the museum is incredible value to enter (costing the equivalent of a few English pounds for a student), but it was a shame to not realise the story behind so many of these incredible items. A guide, speaking both Russian and English, could be hired, but this would substantially increase the cost. However, given the additional benefit and enjoyment this would provide, I would strongly advise doing so. Additionally, if we'd have done so, I think the rating would be 5/5!The museum itself is quite stunning, being housed in the former palace, which is extremely ornately decorated, with some rooms alone that are worth the price of admission! The displays are diverse, spanning many different civilisations.Overall, a fantastic museum that only has 4/5 because of my lack of ability to speak Russian and my inability to do the research to realise the added benefit a guide would have brought."

It's like the museum inside of the museum, 'cause not just the enormous and great collection is what really worth to see but also the rooms, halls, breathtaking ceilings and floors are interesting themselves.Every time I go there I find something new, moreover, there is some funny statistic of the hermitage which says they posses about 3 mln items there. So, if you want to see every item in the Hermitage and spend only one minute in front of it, you\u2019d have to spend 8 years out there. Just observing the pieces of art!)))Oooopsy! Almost forgot to tell that there is a cafeteria on the first floor with really good hot chocolate! Hah! Someone drinks, someone smokes, I\u2019m desperate chocoholic. The last but not least, is the line to the ticket office, sometimes you'd have to wait! Sometimes it takes really long time!"

One of the joys of wandering around the Hermitage and Winter Museum is that around each corner in each room there is a wonder. there are the well known pieces such as the Da Vinci works but for me finding a room of impressionist paintings with no one in it bar us to literally worship at this art was a joy. Make sure to get in early the more time and space you have the better. No one should visit the city - even on a short business trip without making it to this museum. My advice - read up on the museum so you KNOW what you want to see - so anything after that is the icing on the cake. The qurikiness of the Russian museums - security is one little old lady sitting in the corner of every room with her handbag sitting on her lap and yet - you do get the feeling that if she had to tackle someone ....she could do it better than you!!!"

Although I would not describe myself or my wife as an art aficionado, this place is amazing. When the revolution started in the early 1900's the revolutionaries confiscated the paintings, etc. from the Romanov's and the royalty. They distributed the works to various museums. So, this place is filled with original art work from Rembrandt, Monet, Picasso, etc, etc. We had a fantastic Russian tour guide, who helped our experience so much. I strongly recommend a tour guide who is familiar with the works of art. Our tour guide told us there are 1000 rooms in all, with about 300 open to the public. We probably saw a little over half of the rooms, Most of these rooms are huge, and unbelieveably beautiful in themselves--beautiful marble columns, gold leaf, intricate mosaics, and hand-cut inlaid floors. You walk from one room that you think can't be topped to another one that is even more beautiful. One tip for wheelchair folks. The Hermitage will be described as non-accessible. However, my wife (who can climb stairs slowly) was able to fully enjoy this beautiful building. Once she climbed the main stair case, I was able to push her companion wheelchair throughout the building with no problems. There is at least one small elevator in the building. I don't think it reaches all the floors.Don't miss this."

The grandeur speaks of the former glory. You could literally spend a week in the Hermitage.The next thing my guide to me to see was \"The Church of Spilled Blood.\" The multicolored onion-shaped domes are even more stunning that what you see in Moscow's Red Square.We traveled in the stunning subway system-yes it's true they use golden canndelers!The final stop was at the Winter Palace.Unfortunately the visa system is so complex that you must hire a knowledgable travel agent here to do the paper work.You could easily spend a week in St.P.You'll find the Russians very coordial.This was definitely not the case when I was there during \"The Cold War.\""

The exterior, interior and collections dazzle and, according to one guidebook, if you glanced at each item it would take 9 years to tour the musuem. With that in mind, here are several approaches that prevent becoming totally overwhelmed: Just walk. Soak it in, admire the interior, the views of the river, the fortress. No pressure. Make sure to see the Peacock Clock. Leave when you are ready or have an espresso at the cafe to reenergize. And, you can bring your own food and have a picnic en situ. Choose. You receive a map with the ticker purchase or just after. Have a seat, take a took, select the items that pique your interest, plan a route. Whatever you select, it will take longer than you planned. If what you've selected is important to you -- ignore everything else. Don't stop to examine interesting items, don't allow detours, stick to your plan or accept the consequences. And, there's a cafe to revive you with espresso and food. By the way, the salmon sandwiches only have salmon on the edges. Deceiptful. Yes, you can bring food in with you. At least, we saw people with food they had brought. Plan. The night before (or something similar), research what you want to see. Find it on the map. Once you are their, work with the people at information to plan your route. I am not kidding. We wanted to see the Siberian Collection and an employee started to explain how to find it and said, \"Nevermind, you'll never find it. Follow me.\". He is right: We never would have found it. In fact, I'm not sure what we saw: an amazing collection of items with all explanations in Russian only.Favorites: Peacock clock, the random four-man choir, The Rafael Loggias arcade, the views, the staircase, the light throughout the building, getting lost, espresso to clear our heads and revive our spirits.Least favorite: the bathrooms by the cloakrooms. AVOID. There are better WCs wihtin the musuem. Enjoy. It's a great visit. We are considering returning. And, we visited in winter,. No idea what the crowds are like on summer."

We only had two days in St. Petersburg because we were on a Baltic cruise. This was two days with every second packed with things to do, the largest amount of time being at the Hermitage. Not only are you looking at wall art and sculptures... every hardwood floor, ceiling, door, etc was amazing. The absolute best thing we did was splurge on a private tour. After seeing the crowds and chaos at some sites I can't even imagine how harder it would've been without a private tour. We were in and out and always on the move, not waiting for 20-50 other people."

I knew immediately that it was a better plan to say \"I'll see you all at the front doors afterwards,\" and charge in on my own. The Winter Palace is vast. Yes, it's the place the Bolsheviks stormed in 1917. Today it claims to be the world's biggest art museum. They seem to have a stern old lady sitting in every room, eyeing you suspiciously. I pretty much jogged around, map in hand, desperate to see a few items of great personal interest. I'm VERY glad I did. I found myslef in a room crammed with Picasso Cubist works. The contents of the walls were probably worth ten million quid. No thanks, keep moving. All of a sudden I found myself in heaven, in a room full of Gauguins. Extraordinary. I sat, inches from canvasses, seeing at last where strokes of paint were applied. No photos can substitute for really looking with your own eyes at the lumps and bumps and brush-strokes on the real thing. I felll crazily in love with Renoir's portrait of the actress Jean Samary. She's standing expectantly, as if asking \"can I see it yet?\" 120 years later her charm and character still shine. You'd need a week to see around this place any way properly. Otherwise I recommend taking a beeline for a few favourite items your heart longs to see."

The museum is huge so try to spend there about 3-4 hours and prepare in advance thinking about which sections are you going to see - finding your way through is not very easy! The royal halls with restored interiors (situated after you enter through the main stair are a must in my view, then everything depends on what collections are you interested in.

Anyways....when you are dealing with monkey street performers, I suppose you should expect to get ripped off! if you can't resist holding adorable costumed monkeys, it is still worth it!"

It is almost like steeping back into anither time period, as each room is ornately and individually designed and decorated. The only disappointment for me was that the Egyptian section only had information in Russian, so you had no idea what/who you were gazing at. All in all, even if the art isnt exactly what you are looking for, the architecture and ambiance alone is worth a visit. I am not too much of a museum buff, so this was my case, but I am very happy I went. One last tip: there is a glass encased, very large golden peacock about halfway through the museum in the most beautiful room of all -- one that sits on the corner of the museum and overlooks the river. It sings at 5pm everyday and I've been told this is something to see!"

I've read that you can't possibly see the entire museum but I feel that we saw it all without a problem but granted we didn't spent too much time at one particular art piece, we didn't have a guide and we got there early (we also only saw the main building due to the high cost of the extra rooms). I was disappointed that many of the palace rooms were closed. The pavilion (peacock) room was incredible and I really enjoyed that (though the clock no longer chims). We paid 200 rubles extra for a camera permit (sticker) to take photos inside but I noticed that there were many people who did not have the sticker but they were taking photos regardless, so I guess the photo stickers aren't enforced. We started on the second floor (had most of the things we wanted to see), then moved to the third and lastly did the first floor. The single digit rooms on the first (ground) floor didn't have much to see and the area seemed to be used more for storage than museum viewing, however the small section of Siberian art and culture was interesting. In the museum, most of the major items were marked in English, abet most of the time it was only the title and artist. They also ave an app but its pretty much worthless. It's only added value above the provided map is that it gives you the name of the room for the apartment section but since most of the apartment rooms were closed and others were labeled \"Hall\" it didn't help much. Also, at least for the winter, there was no ticket line so don't bother paying the fee for online tickets."

My most recent visit was on the occasion of my traveling companion's first time in Russia. As she had an interest in Russian history, it seemed essential to visit the Winter Palace. We didn't stay a very long time, as we knew there was too much for one visit. We focussed on collections that were of special interest to us, starting with the Egyptian rooms! I bought our tickets on the Internet, which was the smartest thing to do. We needed to print them, so it was fortunate we were staying somewhere with a printer. On arrival we walked past the very long line, showed our tickets to the folk at the door and made our way to an information desk. We were escorted to the entrance gate and thankfully didn't have to deal with long waits or huge crowds. I find the crowds around the entrance hall very difficult, so my advance purchase helped enormously. Once you are inside the museum, the crowds aren't a problem. One more helpful hint, which didn't apply on this visit. A number of years ago I was escorting a group of pensioners on a tour of Moscow and St Petersburg, some of whom had difficulty walking. In this museum we were able to get a wheelchair which made our visit manageable. I don't know if that is still possible, but if you can arrange it, and you need it, it is certainly worth it. We just asked on arrival. I am not sure I remember correctly, but I believe there was a fee."

It is very cheap/short and less impressive but still worth the trip and very historically significant/cool, just don't expect the Hermitage part 2."

We trully enjoyed our tour to the Hermitage museum. we had a general tour, which included the Gala rooms and the best paintings of the european art, that the museum posesses. Surely, it is not possible to see all of them during one visit, but are sure we saw the best ones. Of course, most of our great impression was to the fact, that we didn.have to stay in long lines to get to the museum, as we have a booked tour with a guide (TJ-Travel company). it was superb - we didn't wait for a second - our diver took us to the entrance, where a special representative of TJ-Travel was already waiting for us with our tickets (our guide phoned the lady, that we are approaching). So, not a seconf waitning, we went directly inside! and after the tour there our guide called the driver (it is not allowed for the cars and busses to park for a long time in the embankment there), he came in 2 minutes, and off we went."

These are normally only accepted at certain ticket desk, (when I visited both times it was 3 and 4) obviously there is normally a longer queue, and remember to purchase an amateur photography ticket even if you want to take a picture on your mobile/cell phone as they are very strict about this. When you pass through the ticket check point they will not admit you into the museum with a camera if you do not have an amateur photography ticket. It is free to store your coat and belongings in the cloakroom. The museum has 2 main cloakrooms; upstairs and downstairs, I would recommend the upstairs one which has only 4 desks but is normally much quieter as its mainly used for tour groups. The downstairs cloakroom is always extremely busy and very noisey. The cost for an audio guide is 350RUB for foreigners and 250RUB for Russian, CIS nationals. Sometimes if they server knows you\u2019re a student they will allow you to pay the 250RUB. I would recommend it, as many of the objects and grand rooms of the palace do not have detailed interpretation/information displays, and if they do it may only be available in Russian. However there are some limited English signs. It is a handheld electronic device similar to an iPhone or PDA, extremely simple to use; all you do is enter the number of the room your in and you will hear an explanation or information by someone with a very British accent. The museum itself is simply spectacular, from a museum point of you this one of the worlds leading and largest art collections with apparently 3 million objects on display through out the hermitage and winter palace. Make sure to have your photograph taken on the famous stairway and look above to see the images and frescos of ancient Greek gods. Its very easy to be overwhelmed by the building and forgetting that each room is filled with priceless art and objects. They are currently renovating certain parts, hallways, stairs and lobby areas so at times don\u2019t be surprised if certain galleries are closed. Services wise, in several parts of the museum there is private stalls selling books, souvenirs and various St Petersburg items, the real museum store is located next to the cafes. The museum store is actually normally priced and even has special offers. I was rather disappointed with the catering facilities available to visitors, just a simple coffee/tea bar and then another self service caf\u00e9. For a museum this prestigious they are losing out a key market being able to cater to good standards. One would expect the hermitage to have several high quality cafes and restaurants similar to that found in the British Museum, National Museum of Scotland and the Victoria & Albert Museum. Make sure you see all of the museum, if you\u2019ve only spent 2 hours int here you haven\u2019t seen it all, I would recommend an entire day! Enjoy it! The place is amazing!"

I actually never had any burning desire to visit St. Petersburg but when friends asked us to join them on a Seabourn cruise of the Baltic Sea, with three days in St. Petersburg, my husband and I said, sure, why not?Definitely the way to see The Hermitage, as well as the palaces at Tsarskoye Selo and Peterhof, is through a cruise ship tour company. Because Seabourn is a small ship, we were docked at the English Embankment, which is a very short drive to The Hermitage. And cruise ships get preferential opening times so we were in before the crowds of visitors.If you love decorative arts, architecture, Western European art and antiquities, you must promise yourself to visit The Hermitage at some point in your lifetime. It houses the largest collection of Western European art in the world. Catherine the Great bought 13 Rembrandts, I believe, in her starter collection along with da Vincis, Van Dycks, Hans Holbeins. Subsequent rulers added to her collection, and even during the Communist regime, collections were added (Matisse's muse donated a large number of his works).But if you're a decorative arts junkie like me, you'll barely be able to see the paintings because you'll be so busy looking at the phenomenal parquet floors, exquisite plasterwork, the marquetry on the furniture, the architecture detail of the rooms.We had the most wonderful young woman as a guide. Her English was excellent, her knowledge of art history, Russian history and the details about The Hermitage and palace complex was entertaining and extremely informative. It's said that if you spent a minute in front of each object at the Hermitage, it would take you 15 years to see it all. It would be well worth the try."

It is a good idea to have some knowledge of what can be seen prior to your visit. Sokurov's 2002 film Russian Ark (96 min) is one way to become familar with the museum. There are virtual tours online, as well as, guide books at large book stores like Amazon or Barnes and Nobles. The Hermitage e-shop sells guidebooks. The museum has it's own website. There is a Hermitage Museum app for IPhones. Once in the museum there are audio tours and English speaking guides that hover around the entrance. Tickets run about $17.95 for an adult, It is $25.95 if you wish to see the Porcelian Museum and Menshikov Palace. The museum is always free for students and children. On the 1rst Thursday of every month it is free for everyone. It is closed on Mondays."

It was possible to take our baby buggy around with us as there were lifts. The process buying tickets is a little confusing if you weren't prepared. Decide whether you want to pay the additional 200R for tour (at stated times), 300R Diamond Room, 300R Gold Room (which are both only accessible by guided tour), 350R audio guide (well worth it). There are other separate exhibitions which require separate tickets."

We called in a the info desk and were ushered to the front of kiosk 3 ahead of the queue and it was plain sailing from there.Judging that two days would be sufficient to do the place justice , however you cannot see everything even if you wanted to.Having read two travel books we noticed that the cafe was'nt great and a better option would be to take your own food, so we bought sandwiches at \"Subway\" on the Nevsky prospect close by and it worked for us.Too see the Gold collection and the Silver collection there is a 300 rouble fee for each along with an English speaking guide who was a nightmare talking so quickly to script and not answering questions that his input was pointless, however you have to pay for the service or you wont be allowed into the rooms. The cafe area is on the ground floor with a large seating area next to the internet service and has two shops for souvenirs."

To be honest, I don't think that was all that necessary. We were in the Hermitage in mid-August and the lines were not that terrible. While we did not have a guided tour (highly recommended, though), we did purchase a book which provided a decent enough overview (it cost about $7 or so, and makes a very nice souvenir).Do not miss Catherine's Hanging Gardens, the peacock clock, the throne room, and take some time to visit the third floor, where the impressionist paintings reside. The floor itself needs some TLC, but the paintings are just spectacular."

However, at 10am there were two lines, one very long line where people were buying tickets on the day, the other (where we were) which had half a dozen people in it. At 10.01 the doors open, and the line we were in were allowed in and allowed to pick up our online tickets. The line with hundreds of people were let in at 10.05 and it was a mad rush, so be warned!!Once inside the Hermitage the first thing you see is the Jordan staircase which is magnificent and provides a great photo opportunity. We bought a two-day ticket and to be honest two days is really not long enough as the Hermitage is massive and there is so much to see, the collections are so diverse that you really need to priortise what you really want to see, if you try to see everything it is unlikely that you will absorb it all.Highlights for us was the art collection, furniture and gemstones."

I thought that it was because during the summer time it can be very busy. Nobody mentioned that for the collections of Diamond and Gold there are limited cards per day. So, we arrived to the museum, it wasn't busy at all, so we thought that we were lucky, but when we wanted to buy the cards for this collection, they were sold out! We missed our chance of seen this collection!!! So, now you know, buy your entrances for the museum and these collections in advance!!!I definitely will come back to this beautiful place.

With the ticket from machine You do not wait but go straigth inside.

It was just a few rooms with show cases full of gold artifacts, each one was explained to us by the Russian Guide and our Guide translated for us. This all become a bit tedious after a while.

Both the Palace and the collections are very impressive. After two days we agreed that there were a lot more to see."

It's a busy place on the busiest Sunday of the summer season when 13 cruise ships are in town. However, the crowds dispersed quite well once we were all marshalled past the main foyer. You may wish to take extra time to go around again on your own, to visit works of art in which you're particularly interested. The architecture, gold leaf and chandeliers were overwhelming. It was hard to take your eyes off the ceilings and the adjoining rooms to even concentrate on the art. We abandoned our tour group to take our time, had a picnic in the gardens to the side of the Winter Palace, grateful to have time to enjoy the space and symmetry of the Palace Square - away from the crowds!"

We spent several hours there. We needed several days. One is overwhelmed by the beauty and opulence of what one sees. The art work is, for the most part, poorly displayed and difficult to enjoy - at least until one arrives at the more modern sections where it is much better. My own feeling is that it is worth seeing but that several days are needed to really appreciate everything that is there. One should initially take a tour and be led through the museum but then go back several times and concentrate on small areas so that you are not overwhelmed by the size and magnificence of the entire place. The biggest down side is that much of the older art is poorly displayed and difficult to see well compared with other museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York or the Philadelphia Art Museum. At the Hermitage, enjoy the building, the opulence, the extravagance. Enjoy the quantity of extraordinary art. Be prepared to want to go back again and again, even if you can't."

Definitely something to do over several days if you have time."

There are more are objects than can be seen in a half day tour, a day or even a week - many theme rooms - Greek, Roman, Art of all schools and masters. But you have to see the Gold Room! This special room takes the use of gold from prehistoric jewelry through the historic empires to the empires of the 1800's. Many gold and silver implements, clothes and weapons are highly adorned with diamonds - perhaps too highly adorned.

But I always went on my own without a tour guide. There is something more to touring when a very educational tour guide is with you who majored in history and explains the detailness of the paintings you are viewing. The lighting and the shades and the colors whether it was vibrant or dull depending on the mood it wants to impart to you. I now get the better picture and I have appreciation for the painting. We opted to concentrate on the Italian Renaissance art and the painting of Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh and Gauguin. There were so many tours you had to be quick in explaining because another group had to move to where you are. You can't just take your time enjoying the paintings. But it was worth it! If you ever go to St. Petersburg, I strongly recommend the Hermitage Museum and Peterhof combination. It's a MUST to see. I also learned something new. The royalty's bed was a bit short for someone of their height and it was explained that they slept almost sitting up. This is how I sleep when I had \"acid reflux\" because of the regurgitation of the food to the throat. So this is just a guess. Maybe they ate so much and they had to sleep after that so it was recommended to them to sleep that way. That was my doctor's recommendation to me if I had to sleep and I ate late. That style of sleeping cured my acid reflux!"

Mostly the buildings hold the art collection (including sculptures, paintings, tapestries, and porcelain) of Catherine the Great. But also to be seen is the sheer opulence of the rooms, with their gilded doors, chandeliers, ceilings, and mirrors. Everywhere you turn are huge urns, vases, or candelabras of porcelain, silver, and crystal. There are wine fountains made of silver which are large enough to bathe in. There are galleries filled with works of all the master painters.A handful of rooms still contain some furniture which includes beautiful writing desks, console tables, clocks. Some have inlaid semi-precious stones. The Malachite Room is particularly impressive. I haven't been to a place this crowded since the Vatican, but it was worth it. You definitely need a day here. Ticket can be used only once (no coming and going). Take some sort of guided tour because the place is so huge, you will want someone to point out the highlights - BUT make sure your group is small, otherwise you will spend the entire time waiting, while 30 people file past a small work by Rafael. The audioguide may be your best bet. There are extra tickets for the Gold and Treasury Rooms which can only be bought the day of, and are extremely limited in number (about 50 per day, i think). So if you are interested in this, plan to go early and be flexible."

I enjoyed the Roman and Greek rooms as they were decorated with the style of the time which was very evocative. The best section was the Gold display, from prehistory up to the end of the Tzars.

We visited the Hermitage with a private guide and had a rich experience. There are different dimensions to a visit. The museum is architecturally rich in a Baroque style. There were a number of grand halls, each different, that would be a treat to all who are architecturally inclined. There is a wonder picture collection spanning several hundred years of European history. Our primary interest was the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist rooms. It tuned out the Post-Impressionists were stronger, since we understand some of the Impressionists were on tour. Even so, the experience did not disappoint. We never got to the antiquities and could see from the floor plan there appears to be a good collection here as well. There is lots of walking and plenty of stairs. Elevators seemed to be few and far between. There is a cafeteria and only one cashier accepted dollars. Since we were with a private tour, this meant we did not need to have rubles this day. Since this is the biggest attraction in St Petersburg, most visitors will seek it out. Definitely do so if you have an artistically appreciative bone in your body (or are trying to nurture one). We did this on a private tour so had more time on site than the typical cruise tour. I can recommend this approach. We used Red October."

You will see wonderful works made by Picasso, Matisse, Rembrandt, el Greco, Caravaggio. Do it independently. The tours take you very fast and they fight amongst them to show tyhe paintings. The audioguides are very good. There is something very few people know. The museum opens until 900 pm on Saturdays! It is wonderful because after 600 pm there are not tours and there are very few people and you can enjoy everything! The museum is practically yours!The archeological part is not the best when compared with other museums. If you dont have time just visit the paintings.Better place for you to buy tickets is the ticket machines outside the museum. Then take the left door (It is faster).

You give your money to your guide and they are supposed to monitor it but they don't seem to. So--it is basically a short tour of great art by masters and I would definitely recommend it.

If possible don't bring any big shoulder bags or backpack or coat, otherwise you have to wait extra to deposit those in the cloak room and get back. Since it is so huge and very little, almost no place to sit down, be ready for a huge tour and bring your own water. In every room, there are old ladies stationed at the corners, who keep an eye on you constently and warn you if you misbehave. And they are not tolerant at all. If you have days in St.Petersburg, then discover the whole museum and you will definitely enjoy it. But if you have limited time, definitely take a guided tour or go around with someone who really knows the place and can show you the best pieces. St.Petersburg as a city which is trying to catch up with European cities, although not succesful yet, but this place is the number one site you have to see in St.Petersburg."

To be fair, the building would be worth seeing even if there was nothing in it! I've never been inside such an elaborate and extravagant building. You may need sunglasses to shield your eyes from all the gold and crystal!Lots of walking, lots and LOTS of people, very long loo-queues, and would be a very confusing if beautiful place to get lost in.

This doesn't even consider Catherines' Palace or the Peterhoff, both of which will \"blow you away.\""

My review is possibly unfair to the extent that because of time constraints we only saw art & sculptures & none of the other exhibits in this museum. This palace is really huge & one would need perhaps a solid week to do it justice. However, the reputation of the Hermitage lists it as a must-see & maybe suggests it is like nowwhere else. Not true in my opinion. We have been to equally good art galleries but admittedly none so large. The fact is that during the normal time for a visit it is impossible to cover more than a fraction of the rooms or contents. It also becomes impossibly crowded at times. If you want to see a real attraction in St Petersburg try the Peterhof for something really different with its gardens & wonderful fountains. Frankly, I was disappointed with the Hermitage & think it is overhyped."

We had booked to go to the diamond room and gold room ( costs extra and must be booked ahead). Neither were worth it. Our guide could not take us through these rooms, and quite frankly the museum guides were boring and one in particular monosalabic. The diamond room has very few diamonds! The exhibits were mostly gold articafts and not particularly interesting jewelery. The diamonds were in crowns or some jewelery and nothing like the Crown Jewles of London. The gold room was more of the above....if you must go to one, do the diamond room.Of course you could stay the day, but half a day is enough as it becomes overload. We ate at one of the restaurants, not expensive but not much of a lunch.....our guide did not want to waste time at restaurants. The Amber room is stunning and free!"

With over three million pieces of artwork, it is difficult to decide what to see. They say if one spent just one minute at each piece of art at the State Hermitage Museum and Winter Palace, it would take somewhere between 11 and 16 years to see everything. This means you have to have a game plan and limit yourself to the amount of time to be spent at this incredible museum.In terms of museum size, the Hermitage is the largest with 24 km / 15 miles of galleries to walk through. In terms of paintings, prints and drawings, the Hermitage\u2019s 12,000 is second only to Le Louvre\u2019s 30,000. Madrid\u2019s Prado has about 8,600 pieces.It is best to have a Russian tour guide to take you around the Hermitage. Two of the biggest reasons are the ticket prices and the queues. Tickets cost 400 Rubles for citizens of Russia and Belarus. It is our understanding that prices for everyone else are unfairly priced. Having a Russian tour guide also helps one to get to the front of the queue. One can spend hours waiting in line to gain entry if you do not have a Russian to assist. The other big reason for a Russian tour guide is that they can develop a \u201cplan of attack\u201d. My husband and I allotted two hours for our visit thus we wanted to maximize our time. Our guide asked us for our input, and she took us around, explaining what we were seeing. The Hermitage says that to take amateur videos and photographs, a special ticket must be bought from the museum ticket office. We do not think this is enforced as thousands of people were taking photographs. Besides, a major London newspaper recently stated the policy is not enforced. For your planning, the museum is closed on Mondays, 1 January and 9 May. Enjoy the very best place in all of Russia!"

The museum collection, while very large, was not as impressive as other large art collections in Europe. They have two small Da Vinci's, two small Rafael's, and several Rembrandt's. We didn't see the impressionist works, though those seem to be their claim to fame. I was expecting more from a place that has been compared to the Louvre. Overall, I highly recommend seeing it.

The works of art in this museum are fabulous but the lighting of some of the paintings is poor. You are allowed to take photos which is a plus. They do rent audio headsets which helps you understand the art in front of you; well worth the money! If you are really into art then you could easily spend a whole day here!

I was even able to get a photo of the grand entranceway without a single tourist. I purchased my ticket on-line and arrived 15 minutes before the doors opened. I was the third person in line. I chatted with a British couple that had been the day before and took the English speaking tour. They recommended the headphones as the tour moved too quickly. I rented headphones and had a lovely day visiting the museum.One small issue, I bought a tea at the cafe and the young man accused me of not paying him. He was very nasty about it. I am 100% sure I did as I was not familiar with the currency so I stood to the side and pulled out my money before I even got up to the counter. I refused to pay him a second time so I waited until a manger came over. In the end, they did not make me pay again. So just be careful when you hand over the money. I enjoyed the building and the room decorations as much as I enjoyed the art. The next day I took my husband back (who had to work the day before). We arrived around 4 and entered for free. It was crowded, but still nothing like people described. And it was free! A must see when in St Petersburg.tip: purchase your ticket on-line at home and print - hotels charge more than 2 times the entrance price to do it for you."

It's not as noble as that of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and no more likely to be fulfilled in my lifetime than was his. I have a dream of visiting every major art museum in the world. In mid-May my wife and I returned from a transatlantic cruise, coupled with a nine-day cruise of the Baltic Sea and all the major capitals of Northern Europe. The highlight of that far off adventure was two days spent in St. Petersburg, Russia. The highlight, coupled with Catherine's Palace and the Peterhof Palace, was the Heritage Art Museum.I have a confession to make. We spent 21 days on the seas and a total of five weeks away from home to allow me a meager two hours to peruse the holdings of one of the largest art museums in the world. Worse, part of that time I was lost, searching for the main entrance so that I might rejoin our tour group and not spend the rest of my life in Russia. But that's par for the course. I seldom go to art museums and not get lost. It goes without saying that the Hermitage (pronounced er-mit-TAJ) is huge, on a par with the Louvre in Paris an the Met in New York. Moreover, it has not been \"twenty-first-centuryized\" as have the most other world-class museums. For instance, only one floor, the former servants quarters of the palace, containing the museum's modern art, has been air-conditioned (not that it mattered since we were there in May when the whole city of St. Petersburg is air conditioned). Here was to be found Matisse's famous Dance, as well as works by Picasso, Braque, Kandinsky, Vlaminck, Derain, Malevich, van Gogh, and just about every other name one might recognize from modern art (plus a few I didn't recognize).Like the Louvre, the Hermitage is a hand-me-down, a onetime palace dating from 1764 before the Tsars moved to the suburbs to spend most of the year away from the big city. Besides the Summer Palace there's also the \"Small Heritage\" (which isn't), the \"Old Hermitage,\" and the \"New Hermitage\" stretching out in an extended linear progression to rival Versailles--which undoubtedly was the tsars' intentions. Like the Louvre, the Hermitage is not an ideal structure to house a billion-ruble (or billion-dollar) art collection. In 1989, the Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei tamed the Louvre. I wish he would do the same for the Hermitage. The main thing the Hermitage has going for it is sheer scale. And if crowds were evenly dispersed among its hundreds of rooms and galleries, this scale would somewhat mitigate its organization shortcomings. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The main galleries are often shoulder to shoulder while the remote venues seem downright lonely. Now, having complained about the museum's many faults, let me dwell on its strengths. If you like the Baroque, you'll love the Hermitage. Management sometimes refers to it a Russian Baroque, and indeed, there is a distinct difference. Russian Baroque is more baroque than its southern European kin. Though I'm a painter and I love looking at paintings in museums, in that regard, the Hermitage is simply too much of a good thing. Leonardo is represented by his Madonna Lita, Titian by his St. Sebastian, Raphael by a couple of his many Madonnas, Giorgione by his Judith. The Hermitage collection also includes works by Tiepolo, Carracci, Caravaggio, Velasquez, El Greco, Rubens, van Dyck, and over 20 works by Rembrandt.Sculpture, on the other hand, was, for me, the most memorable of all the museum's offerings. There was literally tons of it, the best of the best the Baroque world had to offer by virtually every sculptor working at the time. There's even a minor Renaissance piece by Michelangelo, Crouching Youth. Names such as Canova, Rossellino, Bernini, Giuseppe Mazzuoli, the Venetian Antonio Lombardo, Riemenschneider, Houdon, Eugene Falconet, Rodin, and Versailles own A.Coysevox dot the landscape. There was much more as well. The Hermitage, being an old Russian palace, has its share of ornate domestic furnishings from gold leaf thrones (the Russians love their gold leaf) to porcelain sculptural pieces that would look good on my coffee table. There were carriages (more gold leaf), clothes, china, crystal, silver, and tapestries representing two centuries of Russian tsarist extravagance and impoverished suffering by the peasant masses. If you've ever pondered the cause of the 1917 Russian Revolution, you need look no further than the Hermitage or any number of similarly ostentatious palaces decorating this former Russian capital."

When booking a baltic cruise, we were initially disappointed to see that our only day in St Petersburg was a Monday, when the Hermitage is closed. If this happens to you, do not dispair! Tours booked through cruise lines are able to visit the Hermitage on Mondays.... I arranged a private guide for myself, my husband and daughter through the cruise line, and we spent two wonderful hours wandering around eerily empty rooms, gazing at priceless works of art against a backdrop of stunningly beautiful rooms. Even though the place was virtually empty (although we did occasionally come across large cruise tour groups) the guide seemed unable to slow down to a more leisurely pace, and and whizzed by amazing Dutch Masters and Impressionist masterpieces far more quickly that we would have liked. Unfortunately, there are no refreshment facilities and limited souvenir opportunities because the museum is officially closed, and no access to special exhibitions. Nevertheless, a throughly unforgettable experience."

That way, we had a private tour, didn't have to wait in long lines and although the Hermitage was crowded, our guide always seemed to know where there were less people. Every part of the museum is decorated, floors, walls and ceilings, and the artwork on display is priceless! If nothing else, when going to St. Petersburg, be sure to visit."

The exhibitions are mind blowing, but honestly the interior trappings are more spectacular than the artwork. Gilded, ornate decoration is everywhere in vast rooms, with lapis and malachite urns and tables everywhere. The opulence has to be seen to be believed.Do yourself a favor and visit. Outside of summer would probably be better, but if you are in St. Petersburg this is a must see. Go early, as the lines can be very long by lunchtime and you'll wait at least an hour to get in."

What concerns to Italian sculpture of the 15th to 20th centuries, includes \u2018Crouching Boy\u2019 by Michelangelo and \u2018Cupid and Psyche\u2019 by Antonio Canova.

Outstanding are the collections of Matisse, Gaugin and the first Picasso, while I would rather recommend 'Museum of Orsay' in Paris for the impressionists. The museum was very crowded, but the lack of legends in English is a more severe handicap, since we are only provided a map of the museum, the exhibited works are so many to get confused at times, and the attendants only understand Russian. Still a must for a tourist. But my feeling is that a few visits are needed to really appreciate the wealth of this museum"

Also, taking lots of photos helped us remember what we saw; many paintings can be identified on the internet.

It was very hot and uncomfortable to navigate in July when it was literally swamped by tourists. Therefor I would like to advise following:1. Get help - take guided tour or higher a guide;2. Don't take all of it in one visit - select a theme for your visit: see just 19th and 20th century art or just talian art or just Dutch art or come to visit only the staterooms and halls.3. Buy your tickets on the internet to not wait for hours in queues; Please remembers that anyone needs more than few visits to see everything."

I took a few art classes in college and appreciate good art, but I'm no great art student. I loved the Hermitage because not only is it filled with beautiful art, it is itself a piece of art. The building is the winter palace of Peter the Great, and it is so grand that I think it engulfs the amazing art inside. Again, I don't know that much about art, and an art scholar would probably cringe at my comments, but the marble halls and pillars and grand staircases and patterned floors were more magnificent than anything I saw in the city of St. Petersburg. Go to the Hermitage to see the art, but you'll be blown away by the building that houses it."

I am not an appreciator of art, but was blown away by the art displayed here. There are originals by masters such DeVinci and Rembrandt. There was a lot of what our guide called functional art (non-paintings) that was beautiful and interesting. We spent a couple of hours rushing through a museum that if someone spent ten seconds looking at each object of art, would be there for more than three years! If you really want to see the museum, allot the time. Another hard learned lesson. There was only one restroom located near the entrance (supposedly there is a second one somewhere that was closed because the museum is normally closed on Monday.) The point to be made is that if you have feel the slightest need to go, do it when you enter. It is very difficult to find your way back without going through all five of the palaces that make up this museum. The Hermitage also appeared not to be wheelchair friendly."

Words cannot describe the variety, beauty and history of this place. Our Russian english and art major tour guide told us it would take 8 years, stopping at each piece only 8 seconds to see everything. So get a map inside and only go to the sections that you want. You can get an overview in 4 hours but all that does is whet your appetite for more."

It would take 6 years to visit all the rooms in this museum so I suppose you are taken to what is considered to be the \"tourist\" rooms. I would have loved to stay longer but then would have missed the optional tour to Peterhoff. To return on another day meant queuing to get tickets-not available in advance.If you are in St Petersburg do not fail to visit The Hermitage but try and stay all day and \"do your own thing\" if possible then you will see the art that appeals to you rather than what the guides think you want to see. Make sure your video is working and you have plenty of film on your camera chip as you allowed ((surprisingly enough) to take pictures throughout the museamWonderful, wonderful experience just would have liked a bit longer.This tour was part of our Russian waterway trip which started in Moscow and finished in St Petersburg. I would highly recommend it"

The museum suffers from 80 years of neglect under the communist regimes - no A/C, no elevators, not all rooms have been restored, only a minimal of the paintings and sculpture are on display, no silver/gold/artifacts on display to the public, and the number of people allowed to visit each day make it impossible to get close to anything. (We paid 2x the admission price to get special admission to an evening tour to avoid the massive crowds.) Due to the crowds and lack of benches/seats, this tour was exhausting in addition to disappointing. Certainly what is on display is fabulous, but on the whole I was disappouinted. I suggest you buy an expensive book of photos of the art and artifacts which you will enjoy much more than this tour! Our tickets were US$120 each for an evening tour ($240 total) - you can buy a great book for $75 and enjoy it much more!"

One local described it as 'Massacre of the Innocent Tourists'. The setting is simply spectacular and the art collection extraordinary: a visit is essential but they need to do something about crowd control and preferably not allow people to use baby buggies as battering rams. We got a two day ticket and carefully worked out which areas to focus on in an attempt to make it manageable. Quiet contemplation of a brilliant piece of art is impossible because of the crowd numbers, so clearly July and August are times to avoid if possible. The large tour groups barge through on their tight schedule and you wonder if any of them see or enjoy much. All that said, many of the collections are superb and worth the jostling and frustration, and the building itself is impressive. It's still possible to appreciate a piece of magnificent art despite fellow visitors wanting to photograph it and/or be photographed beside it, although this takes some patience! The place is wonderful but the visitor experience could have been a lot more wonderful."

The first day there was no queue and we bought tickets at the ticket machine just through the arches and walked straight in. The second day the queues were huge. Be careful to know where the queue is going before you stand in it. We initially joined one outside the arches that just led to the collection point for the Internet tickets...on further inspection there were several other queues! In general it seems quicker to just use the machines if you just want general admission - and it is cheaper than internet tickets. You can't buy tickets for the diamond gallery or the gold room from these machines or in advance. There is a tour of these once a day in English - a tour is compulsory to visit these rooms. You can queue up to the main kiosk in the very long queue, but we got there at 1030 and would not have got in in time for the 12pm tour. If you go into the area under the arches, on the right hand side there is a door marked tours and group tickets. Go in there up the stairs and to the right and there is another door marked 'museum tours'. You can book on a tour there for the diamond or gold rooms, or a general museum tour. If you take the chit to the kiosk at the top of the stairs you can exchange it for a tour and a general museum ticket. If you have your ticket before you reach the museum entrance, there is no queue and you can just go straight in. The diamond room is fabulous - it contains lots of jewel-encrusted treasures belonging to the Romanovs, including some Faberg\u00e9 and so is well worth it."

I don't care what other information you have with you, GET THE MUSEUM GUIDE. DO IT. I'll wait right here while you go get that guide. You got it? Good. Let me see it. OK, you got it, now we can go in. The guide not only has the most up-to-date information published, it'll also make it easy for the museum staff to redirect you to where you need to go to see what you want to see, seeing as how the museum will rearrange exhibits every now and then...This is a HUGE museum and every tour group in St. Petersburg WILL hit it. My wife and I went straight for the ancient artifacts section and we practically had run of the place for an hour. We loved the ancient stuff and Golden Horde-era exhibits and then we skipped past the 19th century to go to the moderns section. That took three hours, total, and we only saw a third of the museum. A day and a half to *see* everything, and a week to take it all in, if you want to.The architecture of the place is also quite stunning. If you don't like art museums, this place is going to kill you dead. If you *like* art museums, this is mandatory viewing."

By that late in the evening the crowds were really disappearing, especially in the last hour up til the late 9pm closing on Saturdays. We went back first thing Sunday morning and queued at the gate about 30 min before opening, though the line for ppl who already had tickets was nearly empty and we could have walked right in had we arrived right at opening time.We are casual art goers and walked the entire second floor (the biggest one) in just under 3 hours- you can do this if you are not stopping to closely examine every piece, of course, but we weren't running through it, either. Our main objective was to see all the rooms, which are staggering in and of themselves. The next morning we strolled the entire ground floor and top floor in about 2.5 hours, this time stopping a bit more often in some places because we love antiquities. By the way, they have a great collection of Greek art and the stuff from Siberia is fascinating. Very well preserved textiles from 2500 years ago, just amazing."

This way of getting tickets seems to be a new thing as there were very few people trying this but don't hesitate to try it - there are instructions in English as well as Russian.We started with French 20th century art where you can find a lot of paintings that have not been shown in other parts of Europe as there is some controversy about the ownership of many of the paintings. Great paintings if you like Matisse, Cezanne, Gaugain, Renoir etc. We then had lunch in a noisy caf\u00e9 in the palace and then we took on \"the rest\".

I roamed primarily on one floor of the Winter Palace, and I only saw some of the art in some of the rooms as I wandered through ballrooms and up and down royal staircases. If you are an art lover, and appreciate architecture, you will need several days to really appreciate a small piece of what is there. (It is recommended to spend weeks/months to begin to appreciated what is housed here). In the few hours that I had allowed, it barely gave me a snapshot of what this incredible museum held. One word to the wise... go as early as possible, the lines to get in begin early, and the crowds increase throughout the day. Consider an organized tour because they are allowed early entrance (prior to public hours) into the Hermitage which is definitely worth it to avoid the later crowds."

The reason I only gave it four stars is because of the contents.

It is probably my own fault for not researching it more so I'll blame myself for being a little disappointed. The other thing I did not expect was the displays of other nation's material. I found the exhibits in the Kremlin Armory in Moscow more to my liking. That said, the Hermitage is definitely a Must See.

Once inside you queue again for the ticket office to open at 1030 but our wait was nothing compared to those who were later. It is not open on Monday."

The guides get early access so instead of waiting in line for an hour, we were in before 10:30. We were far ahead of the tour busses and a few minutes before the cruise tours. In other words, for about 30 minutes we had the museum to ourselves. The grand staircase, empty. The Russian portrait hall, wide open. The first state rooms, all mine to photograph with only the guard in the room. Things began filling up quickly but not for what seemed a long time. Later we hit the Peacock clock at the time the \"Master\" was winding it. The private guides were all chatting so the word got out about what seemed to be an unadvertised winding. Our guide was as excited as we were to see it. The museum is a great sense of pride for Russians and our guide loved telling the stories of the palace as well interpreting the artwork. We ate the baguette ham sandwiches in the cafe for lunch which were okay. We stayed six hours."

The guided tours seem to skip many rooms and hit only the highlights. There is simply not enough time for one day. Prepare for your visit. There are Ipad applications to getting a book or checking the website. Get acquainted with floor plan and works that interest you. Then plan a time schedule. This is very important because you will need breaks. Standing in a museum and processing all this information and art wears you down. Don't make it a marathon. Don't do two days straight. Have an excursion day or relaxing picnic then middle day and let your mind rest. Tickets can be bought for two days via the internet. Buying via the internet is recommended or use a tour where the tickets and lines are specific to you. Tickets can be bought with or without camera usage. Most paintings allow photos without flash. There are some exhibits that prohibit flash.There is a cafe on the bottom floor of the museum that serves sandwiches and drinks. In this area is also the museum stores. There is a coat check and pack storage in the entrance area. No liquids are allowed in the museum. Bring some classical music in you Iphone or Ipod and listen as you admire.Small vendors on the outside hawk souvenirs, snacks, and drinks. Admiralty was the closest Metro stop."

There are two reasons: one is that they can get you quickly to the most important rooms and displays; the other is that, at least in our case, our guide purchased vouchers in advance for our day and time, avoiding the long lines that form each morning and providing us the most time to spend inside. Our guide was Irina S. with Tours By Locals -- an amazing woman who in five days in and around St. Petersburg saved us many hours of waiting in lines -- but my point here is that even for people used to traveling independently, contracting a guide in advance provides a huge advantage for the precious time you have at what is arguably one of the world's most stunning attractions."

Our guide zipped us in ahead of the huge crowds. The three buildings are massive, so it is really only possible to get an overall picture of the architecture and 1 or 2 collections in one day. We concentrated on the architecture and the Impressionists collections. The collections are the most in depth I have ever viewed. There are three galleries of Picassos! The scope of the art work is staggering, and the architecture grand to the point of being overwhelming. I highly recommend employing a guide.

So read a guide book and plan ahead what you want to see and where it is. It depends on what you like but the Impressionists, the Rembrandts, the 2 Da Vincis are a must and you will probably also enjoy the throne room and, if you like history the malachite room and the little white dining room where the Kerensky government was arrested by the Bolsheviks.

This was our second visit to St Petersburg, the first in 1986 just after Chernobyl blew up and when the Soviet Union was hanging on under \"Glasnost\". Intourist controlled all foreign tourist trade and that did mean we got preferential entrance to the glorious Hermitage. Crowds were smaller and better controlled so we marvelled at the Da Vincis and later the French Impressionists without jostling or rush. Not anymore. Thousands are disgorged each day in the summer season from cruise ships and bus loads are dumped at the museums to be herded round these magnificent collections and wonderfully restored palaces which were nearly obliterated in the World War II siege. Meantime outside in the rain on the day we were there as part of a small tourist group, and by chance it was the main public holiday weekend of the year celebrating Russia Day, ordinary Russians again were queuing quietly around the block the old Winter palace occupies by the river. No change for them; a huge change for all who eventually get inside. Crush, push, shove and some masterpieces badly displayed. Go on a quiet day or after the cruise ship tours have left for the day."

We were a group of seven Canadians who believed that visiting St. Petersburg would be a major highlight of this trip. As a result, I looked into several tours from HAL and other companies, and, after much research, we chose SPB Tours operating out of St. Petersburg. From day one, when I first contacted them via email, I received prompt replies in impeccable English. We wanted a very small group, with a maximum of ten, which we ended up with, as we wanted to see as many sights as possible during our two days. They made it very simple to 'sign up', and they arranged our visas and the required tickets to get us through Russian Immigration Control. We were met just outside by the owner, Viktoria Rother and our lovely guide, Natalya. We had two amazing days, in spite of some high winds and rain that resulted in the cancellation (and partial refund) of the canal and hydrofoil boat rides. Natalya was extremely knowledgeable, experienced and delightful. We saw all of the highlights of St. Petersburg, including the amazing subway system and an early visit to the Hermitage, plus Peterhof and Catherine's Palace. We ate in two local restaurants, and it's true that the meat and fruit pies are absolutely delicious. I could go on and on about this tour. We all felt that it was the very best 'bang for our buck' and all ten of us were extremely satisfied. As our group organizer, I was a bit nervous about arranging all of this but it turned out to be more than worth it. A lot of other ship mates were quite disappointed with Russia and I think that was directly related to the tour they took.  On our cruise, we took a number of other tours and were very disappointed. While they were efficient, we were travelling with groups of over 30 and a lot of time was spent getting on and off buses. (The only line up we encountered was at Catherine's Palace, thanks to SPB's scheduling.). All in all, we are so glad we took this tour. I wish we had signed up for their tours in Tallinn and Helsinki. And, for those of you who might worry about missing the ship, we were back on board well before many of the 'Guaranteed' tours. These local companies cannot afford to risk missing the ship deadline, although if it were to happen, the ferry to Helsinki would have been an easy option. Thanks again to Vika and Natalya!"

It is NOT air conditioned (thus likely endangering the portraiture) by decree of the Grand Poo-Bahs of Heritage and Preservation Wizardry.There is really no theme other than for the third floor concentration of impressionists.Accordingly: HOT, CROWDED, immense and offering endless portraits of meaningless, unattractive and often badly painted nobles. Fighting from within this mass are an astounding number of wonderful works. Roller skates and a self-cooling body suit are musts here. Acquisition of a 'rude tour group and student gaggle' stun ray would be desireable as well. (I wonder at the prevailing view that merely exposing fourteen - year - olds to fine art is beneficial.)

It is slightly more expensive, but the queue does not move that quickly, and you will be out in the open most of your queueing time. We prebought our tickets - no queue. My aunt decided to go back again for a 3rd day - she got there at 10:20am (opens 10:30am) and did not make it to the front of the queue till 11am. To convert your internet voucher for tickets, go to the booth just inside the main entrance gates to the Hermitage (before the queue lines for the ticket offices) - there is a sign on it that says \"Internet tickets\" or something of that sort. - General tour. Useless, don't do it. Seriously. I think it would be much better to pick up an audio guide (quite good) or one of the locals offering guiding services just inside the museum. I thought the general tour would give some information about the decoration/rooms of the museum etc but the guide was really quite terrible. - Gold room tour. Very short (30min), not bad, but please be aware that the Gold Drawing Room is room 304 and not part of this tour. This is gold etc recovered from burial hordes, and diplomatic gifts given to Russia. There is only one English tour a day. - Diamond room tour. 1hr, some overlap with the Gold Room tour. There is only one English tour a day. I didn't do it, but my aunt did and said it was okay. She enjoyed doing it in addition to the Gold room tour. - To buy your English tours, you have to take your normal entrance tickets, and step in front at one of the ticket counters inside (where the people who haven't bought tickets are queuing to buy tickets) and tell them you want to buy the e.g. Gold room tour tickets. You will look rude, but this is what the information people inside tell you to do, not to join the queue. Also, we didn't experience this, but people we met said the first teller told them there were no more tickets, but then they asked again at a second ticket counter (why, I don't know) and managed to get tickets to the tour. - The cloakrooms are outside where you \"enter\" with your ticket into the museum. Once in, you can't come out and back in again, so make sure you have taken your guidebook etc in with you. No water/ food permitted but this seems a little hard to enforce - I think they take away obvious bottles, but my bottle of water was in my handbag, and both days it went through the scanner without any issues. - The museum is closed on Mondays, so if you buy a 2-day combination ticket and go on Sunday, the second day on your ticket is Tuesday. We didn't make it to any of the other musuems on the ticket other than the Winter Palace of Peter I (not that great an attraction). - The musuem floorplan/map handout doesn't really mention the good highlights of the collection, so I would recommend that your bring your own guidebook or pick up a copy of a Hermitage guidebook to help you along. Information ladies should be able to tell you where each highlight painting/ room is located. - The lighting of the pieces is not fantastic for viewing, unfortunately. Ah well. In my opinion, the Vatican is better than the Hermitage, but if you haven't been to the Vatican yet, the Hermitage is very good."

It was quite simply stunning and we all really enjoyed out trip to The Hermitage. The state rooms were fabuous and the collection of art work is outstanding. We did buy a sandwhich in the cafe at the end which was truly dreadful. Wish we had purchased a bottle of wate when we got inside as very thirsty at end of 3.5 hours."

We visited The Hermitage on a guided tour along with seemingly millions of other tourists. To my surprise, photography in the museum was permitted which meant that folks taking pictures pushed in front of others to get their shot, sometimes even using flash at very close range. Unfortunately, this made it difficult for anyone to really appreciate the priceless treasures we were viewing. And so, I came home thrilled to have visited such a prestigious museum but disappointed in the \"teaser\" half day tour and the annoying tourists who invaded my space."

I guessed we were quite lucky as there was no line on the day when we visited (got there at 1045am whilst it opens at 1030am) and got our tickets immediately which we reserved on the internet. We read that if you have tickets booked through the internet, you will be allowed to jump the queue to go straight to the ticket booth. I guess we did not need to use it. Amazing, starting from the Jordan Staircase, all the beautiful statesroom to the glamorous Gold and Diamond Rooms (extra ticket required) which is one of our highlights \u2013 no photos allowed \u2013 you see all the amazing jewels and precious stones and watches etc with a guide (except Farberge eggs \u2013 which are mostly in Moscow, not St Petes). Definitely try to go early and book early as places are limited and visits are by the hour. We had a fantastic guide who was very dedicated, wanting to share so much about the details of all the major pieces and we spent 1.5 hours with her. All the rooms we visited were great in architecture and art pieces and not so crowded on the day that we visited. The cafe was nothing to shout about and small too, so I can imagine that it can really be very packed during the peak months \u2013 so plan to bring a sandwich to save time and costs too (there is a Stolle pie shop at the corner of Nevsky Prospekt). I wish that they would spend more effort on the gift shop \u2013 quite a good selection of gifts and cheaper than most tourist sites gift shops (eg delicate Farberge eggs) if you have the patience to plough through the showcases. Everyone in the museum were friendly and helpful. Also, you need to get everything done before you exit through any gate/ door of any building. You will not be allowed in anymore \u2013 just one entry per ticket. We really forgot and left the main entrance, realizing that the gift shop was within the main entrance. We have to explain and I guess they figured out we could not have been cheating on the ticket when the museum was going to close in an hour. Overall, a worthwhile visit!"

Despite going on a day when we were assured that the public would not be admitted only groups(otherwise\" it would have been even more crowded\"), and starting early the palace was packed. Groups from all over the world it seemed all shepherded by arm/paddle waving guides all having a strict itinerary and timetable to keep. All tourists wearing (faulty) earpieces to get the benefit(!) of the comments and explanations. Herded round to see all the \"Great Treasures\" with your 1 second view of the Leonardos (if you saw them at all), the \"These are the Cezannes/Matisses/Gaugins come along we only have 30 seconds in this room or you wont see everything\" There was nobody in the Cezanne room, a chance to see the genius of his work? No, perhaps only I in my group wanted to, the rest seemed disinterested.Up stairs, downstairs..could you go a little slower, we have someone with walking problems/unable to see clearly (Why bring them then?) Through this gallery - again, but we must now go this way to avoid the crowds, just fight your way through and don't get lost. Yes this is not just an art gallery it houses archaeological specimens too, but who is really interested in them?- you have to see the Rembrandts- well all you can see as there is another group in the way and we only have 3 minutes to do all this room and the next.Finally the only place you did not have crowds- the Gold rooms for which we paid extra, and a different guide. No you cannot just look I have memorised my speech and you have to look at things in the order I describe them. I know all 14 of you cannot see this ring at once, but you can take turns before ..now look at this one of Catherine the great 5000 brooches.I appreciate the popularity of the museum, I understand that the guides have a job to do, and I know that you have to keep to time, but both my wife and I were totally disappointed and felt the whole experience was a waste of time and money.We can see more, better, and in comfort by going online and doing the virtual tour. I felt less crowded and threatened coming out of Wembley among 80,000 than in the Hermitage. If you are an art lover/museum freak the Louvre or the British Museum show how it should be done, if you just want the \"tick this place off the list of places to see\" trip, then go. All in all - for me- a total disappointment"

We saw many themed rooms filled with gorgeous antiques, art work and furniture. We only had about 3 hours to spend there and took in as much as we could. Museums are not usually my cup of tea, but the incredible beauty of the Hermitage definitely held my attention. Photos were allowed in most areas. Female guards were seated in every room and were quick (almost rudely) to let you know when you were \"out of line\". Our Russian guide was very knowledgeable but not the most organized. Headsets were given and required because of the somewhat heavy traffic, even though we weren't there during the peak season. Walking shoes and camera are a must as there is a lot of walking, including several stairways, and many fantastic photo ops from start to fot fond of inish. Not sure about wheelchair access. If you're not capable of walking a lot, or climbing a few flights of stairs, this may not be the ideal place to visit. Otherwise, the breathtaking beauty of this tour should be seen. Fee to museum was included in total cost of the two day package tour here."

One can spend the entire day or even week there. But, to be honest, it can be difficult to fully appreciate and enjoy the exhibits given the crowds. I would suggest to join a small tour group. It seems that they can schedule a time to visit the museum in advance and can enter the museum from another designated entrance. This can get around the problem of waiting with other 'walk-in' visitors in the main entrance. I am sure it will save you at least 1 hour waiting time. Also, it seems that there is no air-conditioning in the museum and it can be quite stuffy in some rooms with a lot of people. Better to have some drinking water ready and wear short-sleeves. You can also take nice pictures of the Plaza from the windows of the museum."

The biggest piece of advice is to chose the day and time carefully! It is ashame greed takes presidents over heritage.

Aside from the fact that the Hermitage has one of the world's largest collection of art (they said if you spend a minute on each piece you'll need 7 years), the structure itself is a masterpiece. It is very big indeed and you will want to go as early as you can and avoid weekends in order to be able to really enjoy the place. Each room is splendid in their own sense and the amount of details on the walls and ceilings are incredible. Make sure you look up a lot as there are always intricate ornaments or tiles or paintings on the moldings and ceiling. I would even recommend bringing a small binoculars if you don't have a zoom camera just to see the details up there. Sometimes there will be large groups of tourists following guides around the place, and they always follow a certain path. A lot of times it'll be completely filled in one room and empty in the next. If you don't mind walking back and forth a little bit you might have a better chance to enjoy more in each room. The Gold Room is definitely worth a visit if you are interested in ancient and historical gems and jewelery. They only let a certain amount of people into the Gold Room each day so again, make sure you go as soon as the door opens and get your ticket.One down side for this place is there aren't a lot of chairs or benches while walking inside. So make sure you wear comfortable shoes and don't have problem walking for hours.This museum is simply incredible. It's worth the time and the crowd."

A few tips on what not to miss: the Russian collection of folk art is easy to overlook given all of the famous artwork, but it is very impressive. Also the \"trophy art\" that Russia took from Germany during WWII in Rooms 143-46 (which was not marked on our map of the museum) is not to be missed. I think the overall quality of the French Impressionists in this collection is better than that of the main collection. Finally, given that it is physically impossible to even walk through all of the galleries in one day, you should make sure you at least see most of the amazing rooms of the palace (these are marked on the gallery map).Also, you should make sure to get your ticket voucher ahead of time on-line. It will save you a couple-hour wait in line. Get your voucher and then show it to the guard at the front of the line. There will be a second line inside. Go to the front of this line as well and they will show you inside to ticket counter 5 where you will get your actual ticket. This sounds a bit odd, but it is definitely the way to go.

Do the Winter Palace section first, then you can wander at will and at great length through the Hermitage \"art\" part. While trying to find our way out (yep, we got lost!) we discovered really interesting things (mummies, Siberian tombs, etc) on the lowest level where there were no other tourists and they were weird and amazing things!Any student gets in for FREE which is a great savings. My 16 year old son used his Rochester High School student i.d. card (from his high school in the USA) and received the discount.I think in retrospect I would get the audioguide at least for viewing the state rooms in the winter palace."

Walking for hours can become boring, so it is useful to have a guide who will let you see the most interesting areas in the shortest time.The rooms are very crowded and although I have not experienced any problem, I was repeatedly told to watch out for pickpockets.Chairs to your use to sit are not very many. Be ready to walk a lot before finding a chair. In the painting area, it is not allowed to drink.There is a \"post office\" inside the museum from where you can buy stamps and postcards as well as send the postcards.Student entered for free while adult have to pay some 10\u20ac."

Every room has so many items of interest and the outside facade is simply breathtaking. The only problem with the exhibits is finding them! Whilst the website appears very comprehensive it doesn't tell you the main thing you want to know- where to find any particular painting/statue or whatever. The signing inside the Museum is equally confusing, we spent a considerable amount of time trying to find the way to the third floor- not easy! Despite having done a lot of research before we visited it wasn't until we had been in the museum for some time that we understood how to see the Winter Palace rooms relative to the art and other sections (they're interspersed with one another but a bit here and a bit there.) But once having found our way around (ideally the first days visit of two minimum) it was very enjoyable."

The only thing I would caution is that in the first week of January, especially, lots of people are on holidays and so the queues are agonising - we stood in line for over 2 hrs at -2C... Part of the problem is that they let people in in batches, as people leave the museum, and tour groups are always given priority so when there are a lot of tour groups arriving the line doesn't move at all...really, really frustrating. You can, though, book tickets online for a little more than they cost at the ticket counter and this guarantees you immediate entry so I would definitely recommend this to everyone!"

The world's largest museum collection started by Catherine the Great and housed in the Winter Palaces in St. Petersburg, Russia. If you are part of a group you will probably have a different experience from mine. As a non-grouper, I found the overall experience to be a disappointment. I am not sorry that I went but it did not meet my four decades of building expectation. START with the ticket line. Huge. Unruly, confusing, people breaking in and out. At the other end of the line is a man with a cigarette dangling from his lips supervising the \"ticket machine.\" Now the ticket machine looks like an ATM and delivers one ticket at a time but only if you enter exact amounts of rubles. It won't make change. That's why the man is there--to feed the correct bills to the machine. If you want entry that is one price; if you want to take photos, that is a separate ticket. Not cheap at R600 for entry and photos. Main cost: an hour or more standing in line on hard concrete floors outside. ENTER. Try to find a map of the complex of three adjoining buildings each with three floors. The guards and docents of course do not speak English so you can't ask directions. A labyrinth stairways and you get to guess which floor will allow access to the next building. DODGE the mobs of tour groups led by a lady with a colored flag or umbrella. A group will fill an entire corridor or exhibit space. Heaven help you if you try to break through the tour group. They will not let you through. I think that they are terrified of getting separated. Elbows can be lethal weapons when attached to the body of a small Asian lady, especially one with an umbrella. Don't expect to stand long in front of a particular painting or sculpture. You will be mowed over by the waves of contiguous tour groups.  I enjoyed the food bar and the food was pretty good. The museum shop was good too. There was a splendid exhibit on early Hittite life, completely unexpected, and there were no tour groups in this esoteric part of the museum. You cannot do justice to the collection in a day. Two would be closer if you could afford it and if you tolerate the tour groups. The palaces took 36 rounds of artillery during WW II but have been beautifully restored to a jaw-dropping opulence of gilt, mirror, parquet flooring and sumptuous color. I believe there was a lot there; I just could not see it."

There were also tour guides near the foyer who offered (for a fee) to give you a personal tour in your language.From the square in front, you have to go through the large center archway and walk through the courtyard to the back to enter. After paying your entrance fee, you go up a short flight of stairs and then it gets a bit confusing. In that foyer (behind you to your right) you can rent audio guides, go left and take the flight of stairs to go up to the next floor, or turn right and begin your tour on the first floor. You are required to put your coat and backpack in the cloakroom.There are \"old lady guards\" in every room to make sure you don't touch anything. The pieces are nicely arranged. Each piece has plenty of space so that it can be admired properly. There are some exquisite pieces in sculpture, painting and furniture, especially the huge vases and ancient urns. You can see the collection online at www.hermitagemuseum.org. The building itself has been well-maintained and is quite clean, as is the grounds.Tip: To avoid large crowds, especially if you go first thing in the morning, go to the furthest point in the museum you want to visit and work your way to the front."

When I got to the Hermitage I didn't need to stay in the line, just changed my voucher for the tickets and a map. This ticket is priced in US dollars (25.95) and includes permission to take photos without flash, in the exhibitions where photos are allowed. The tip to not be bothered all the time by the museum's staff is keep the ticket in your hand while take the photos. As they charge visitors for taking pictures, we have to show that the ticket we bought give us the right to do that. This works in every museum of St. Petersburg. And other important thing: wear good shoes in late winter to walk in front of Hermitage, because the floor of the Palace Square is slippery with ice.I used a pen to mark the rooms I had visited in the museum map. It was usefull because the stairs are not continuous (you can go from first to second floor, but to go to the third floor you have to take another staircase, something like that) and as the museum is really huge, it is easy to get lost, and I didn\u2019t have time to get lost! I stayed the first day in the main complex, from 10:30 AM to 6 PM. I ate quickly in a cafe inside the museum to have time and strength to finish this part in one day. I did it, but it was winter and the museum wasn\u2019t crowded. I don\u2019t know if it is possible during summer vacations.The next day I went to the Porcelain Museum on Prospekt Obukhovskoy Oborony, to the to the Winter Palace of Peter the Great, and to the Menshikov Palace.

One full day or two visits of half a day are necessary to appreciate what you see because the experience is overwhelming!My personal favourites:On the ground-floor: antiquities from Siberia (unusual exhibits from primitive tribes, including a rock with ancient engravings)On the first floor, the impressive palace interiors (state rooms) and the beautiful Greek-Roman style sculptures.On the second floor, the French art of 19-20th century (incl. Picasso, Matisse, Gauguin, Monet etc.) and the European art of the 19-20th century (especially some paintings by Kandinsky).This museum is often compared to the Louvre in Paris due to its size and quality and even though I adore the Louvre, I preferred the Hermitage in St. Petersburg for several reasons (very good presentation, art work titles/explanations in English in most cases, the museum building itself, and representation of more contemporary art works). Make your choices and enjoy!"

Irritating to hear our guide explain that, unlike Western museums, the collections were not created by imperialist lootings - apparently the euphemistically termed \"nationalisations\" by the communists is still seen as acceptable.For the informed art lover, a treasure trove indeed. For the less-skilled, a must-see tour de force but oddly disappointing as an elevating experience."

We originally were going to book a two day ticket, however after reading some reviews on here went for the simply one day entry ticket and this is for everything exlcuding the gold rooms but it takes so long to get around it you can barely see everything. Defo one of the best in the world, and dont forget to look up, the staircases and ornate roofs are jaw droppingly amazing and I'm 23 I dont get excited about things like this, such a rich treasure trove in one place albeit the exterior is a bit worn.There are clean toilets and gift shops downstairs which are possibly a lot cheaper than the shops outside of it for gifts.Defo go, it has something for everyone."

Not too cold (5-8 degrees) and not so busy. We went to the Hermitage on a Sunday. It opens at 10:30 and we were a little slow that morning, so got there at 10:45. Queued for 10 mins and then in. Make sure you leave you coats at the free cloakroom.Also if like us and most people you are most interested in the French/Spanish 19th/20th century paintings, then my tip would be to go up the stairs to the 2nd floor, and instead of following the crowd straight on, instead turn right and right again and walk down long corridor. If you follow this route and the map you can go straight to the 3rd floor and then through to the last Picasso room. We got there at 11:15 and there was only the Babushka sitting there. We saw Picassos, Degas, Monet, Matisse all in virtually empty rooms. After 45 mins the crowds started coming through from the main route, and by then we had seen our highlights. Took a while to then find the Kandinsky but don't miss these. We then spent the next couple of hours enjoying the building and other rooms, and actually only stayed 3.5 hours. Enough for my wife and I without being too knackered. When we left the crowds were busier and queues for 30 mins plus I'd guess.This is the MUST see thing in St Petersburg"

Everything is very clearly labeled in English and one can avoid the crowds at the most famous paintings with just a bit of patience. The serious art buff will wish to spend most of an entire day, while others will find a full afternoon satisfactory. The guided tours are primarily for those with only a passing interest in art and architecture and limited time. But it is hard to be rushed through rooms laden with treasures while seeing only 10% of them."

The conserved rooms are delightful, ornate and opulent. You can really imagine the wealth that Russian royalty flaunted in those days. The art is dwarfed by the rooms that house them and so I find myself distracted by the intricate detail of the Palace. It is a maze so I highly recommend you get a map prior to going in. You can buy them inside but they aren't very good. Expect long waiting lines to get in. If you go in a group tour, you can go in more quickly as they have a separate entrance.Photography is allowed inside in most rooms but some will have signs that clearly show you cannot. The view outside from within the Museum is very nice too if you can draw your attention away from everything else!"

The entryway alone is worth the price of admission, and walking thorugh this museum gives you a sense of russian history. We had a spectacular engligh speaking guide who made the whole experience so much better for us. She knew the Hermitage like the back of her hand, was very passionate about art, and the works in the museum, and was able to show us around, made sure we saw the key pieces, and had a wealth of insight. We had a great visit here, and I can't imagine anyone visiting St. Petersburg, and not visiting the Hermitage Museum."

The number of paintings is so vast that a guide or very careful homework is needed to gain maximum value and pleasure from this world class attraction. My personal two favourite attractions were the peacock clock and the painting by Rembrandt, 'the prodigal son,' such a symbolic painting. a good guide will have many stories about the royal family as well. I have mobility problems and was warned that Russia was difficult for the disabled but not here. My guide organised the lift without difficult and the improvised ramps wre excellent."

Part of the tour was a visit to a Russian orthodox church, on the day we visited there was an open coffin with the family in attendance, apparently this is a usual occurance but not something we are used to and could be quite disturbing to some visitors."

Although I have been to St. Petersburg many times before on cargo vessels (Which I\u2019m employed) never really found some spare time to visit the place. Finally came my day \u2013 a day with heavy rain pouring in!! Since no cargo operations were possible, finally managed to go ashore and found my way to Baltiyskaya Metro station and got down from Nevsky Prospekt Metro station. It is the closest Metro station which the Hermitage is just a 10 minute walk from there.Arrived at winter place square around 10 am and had to wait about 20 minutes in the ticket queue. Ticket cost was 400 Roubles for the whole complex and borrowed an audio guide which the cost was 350 Roubles along with a map of the complex. From then on it\u2019s just an amazing experience. The halls, paintings, sculptors and artifacts were simply awe inspiring and indescribable. I didn\u2019t rush through the halls so only managed to see the ground floor of the complex and a small section of the upper floor during the whole day! I think you need at least 2 full days if you want to see it properly. Most of the museum staff was helpful although there was a language barrier. You just have to ask Davinci, Raphael or any other famous name or place \u2013they just direct you to the place.Thanks to all reviewers I was able to plan my trip early. Overall it was a great experience. Suggest visiting the place during late summer on a weekday, and if it is raining you should be able to have the museum to yourself!!"

Good thing the rooms are so beautiful because when we were there (on a cruise tour) it was so crowded you could never get close to much of the art work, and couldn't hesitate to look at it. The new system of 'walky talkies' so you only quietly hear your own guide is great. That helps keep the noise level manageable. Try to find a way to go on your own at some time when the tour groups are not there. Surprisingly, you can take video and photos, which is not true at some other places in St. Petersburg."

The huge Hermitage lives up to it's reputation as a vast museum full of many thousands of years of exhibits all housed in the opulent winter palace - itself worth a look.A few tips:- As others have commented, plan your visit and work out what you want to see in advance. You could easily spend a whole day and still not cover it all.- Use the ticket machine outside, the queues to pay at a ticket desk, especially at weekends, can be 30+ minutes. But be warned they don't give change and if you want photo tickets with your admission ticket, you can't combine the purchase.- Some of the galleries are poorly lit, principally those rooms facing the outside, making it difficult to view some exhibits when you're fighting with bright sunshine."

Just a quick review to recommend Alla Tours (www.alla-tour.com) with whom we had a great experience - we were delighted with the quality and value for money they offered, and would recommend them to others with hesitation The pre-tour instructions Alla provided were timely and very accurate There was no need for Visas and the system for greeting us was smooth and swift: from leaving the ship to being on the tour minibus (about 14 people in total) took about 20 minutes of which 15 was queuing at passport control! Our guide Valentina was simply superb \u2013 excellent English, great sense of humour, encyclopaedic knowledge, with an \u2018interesting\u2019 view of Russian History - past and present Day 1 was packed and fantastic and as described on the itinerary. The Hermitage and a trip into the Underground system highlights. We also chose to go to the Marinsky Ballet as an \u2018add on\u2019 on the evening of Day 1- again arranged by Alla tours. We were the only couple to do this. Again the arrangements were faultless and smooth. In the evening a Taxi was waiting for us just beyond passport control, it took us to the Ballet where we picked up tickets and were guided to our seats and then the taxi was there immediately after the performance to take us back to the ship. The Ballet itself was simply superb \u2013 a real highlight of many highlights of St Petersburg. We would recommend it very highly as an essential \u2018add on\u2019 \u2013 so much better we understand than the ballet \u2018events\u2019 offered by cruise liners. Day 2 started with paying for the 2 day visit and the Ballet (payable by credit card or cash) and then a full itinerary as described in the brochure. Peterhof is breathtaking. Another brilliant day All in all we cannot recommend this Alla Tour programme too highly \u2013 it delivers exactly what it promises and it is excellent value for money. We hope you enjoy it as much as we did  Kate & Arthur, Notts, England"

Unlike in some of the smaller palaces, we didn't feel we were being hurried through and had masses of time to enjoy the magnificent rooms and exhibits. We were also allowed to take photos in all parts of the palace. Having seen the main Classical exhibits - both paintings and sculptures - we had time to nip upstairs to glory in the fantastic collection of Impressionist paintings and to photograph them and go right up to them, unheard of in many other similar places. The shops are well stocked and not too outrageously expensive and the toilet facilities clean and modern. All in all, a marvellous experience."

She also got us directly in, bypassing the queue which went well down the street. This tour company provided more flexible options than did Denrus, and we were very happy with them. As someone else commented, I was surprised to see artwork by the masters with little or no protection around it. I liked it actually, that I could get right near a Rembrandt and examine it with nothing in between us. Hermitage is the top-rated St Petersburg site for a reason. It is that good. But all of the top 4 are excellent, and all are \"must not miss\" sites. If you are not into artwork, the other 3 would come higher on your list."

Things have changed and it was very nice this time that one can take more time to visit this museum and do it at your own pace. On this visit we got to the museum when the doors opened in the morning and had the place to our selves for a couple of hours before to got crowed.

What we were not aware is that the combination ticket will allow you to visit the Hermitage Museum only in Day-1 and in Day-2 it is for the Peter the Great's Winter Palace (next to Hermitage) very small and nothing interesting to see except his dinning room + Menshsinkov Palace (long walk) but there are few interesting things to see (also a small area) and a porcelain factory (which is far away) that we did not bother to visit. Lucky during our vacation the State Hermitage is open to public for free every first Thursday of a month. So we went back and completed all the remaining galleries that we missed in Day-1. At least it was a consolation for what we paid for day-2 that we think is not worth-it."

Our guide was excellent and this is really an essential thing to have to avoid as many queues as possible, although when you are talking about seeing the big names, Rembrandt, Da Vinci, Rubens and so on, queues are a little inevitable. They say to do about 2 hours in one go here and that's a good idea, anymore and you stop really looking. Please bear in mind it's going to get really warm in here, theres no AC and a lot of people, and it's a good idea to buy a guidebook, if for nothing else than they have decent pictures of some of the main paintings as you cannot photograph these.

I saw them in 1995ish shortly after they were discovered or at least taken out of crates and put on view. The colors the Impressionists used were exquisite. To see them fresh as they were painted was one of the great treats of all my travels. I realize that we are now 15 years out and I seriously doubt that they are being taken care of as well as they deserve, but if you are in St. Petersburg and don't visit, your soul has lost a chance to soar. They are breathtaking.Search for a small restaurant behind the circular parade grounds behind the Hermitage and Palace. Ask around for the restaurant the Alexander Pushkin had his last supper/lunch? in before he went to his death in a senseless duel.Third note: It's worth the effort to try to make your trip during the Silver or White Nights--around the Summer Solstice in July. It's a big thing for the citizens and they stroll along the Neva and wait for the bridges to all be opened. It's been going on a long time and they are quite proud of their traditions and their city. Many of those who suffered during the seige of Leningrad are gone, but you'll see some who remember it well as children. I hope you meet some."

It contains enough art work that it would take you ten years to see everything, if you looked at each piece of art for one minute. The lines are long, the museum is crowded beyond belief, the art, for the most part, is poorly displayed. That said, it is the most beautiful museum in the world, with one of the best collections.Buying tickets at the museum is a bad idea. For a little bit extra, you can buy tickets on line at the museum\u2019s web site. More on that later. To buy tickets on site, you have two choices, queuing up for a manned ticket window or buying the tickets from the machine just as you enter. The latter is the best choice here. You need to have 400 rubles in 100 ruble bills to use the machine. The line here is much shorter.If you buy tickets on line there are a few things you should know. You can buy one or two day tickets. Two day tickets must be used on consecutive days. If you are buying tickets for someone other than yourself\u2014you must place a separate order as you must show ID that matches your voucher. You take the voucher to a special ticket window. You queue up in a very short line to the right of the long line. You present your voucher and then you get your ticket(s). You can use a copy of your passport as an ID. It sounds easy but in Russia, nothing is easy.Firstly, if you buy more than one two day ticket, it can confuse them. I purchased two, two day tickets. When I arrived at the counter, the ticket seller was flummoxed. She couldn\u2019t understand that I wanted two, two day tickets. I also made the mistake of asking for my wife\u2019s one, two day ticket package. This whole Abbott and Costello routine took almost thirty minutes to sort out. I was told that I could only get one pair of tickets. She took my voucher and gave me two tickets. However, the voucher listed two, two day tickets. If I hadn\u2019t printed out a spare voucher, I would have been out of luck. By the time I got upstairs, in the Renaissance rooms, it was packed. More on that later.I went two days in a row, took off a day to see Peterhof, and returned with wife in tow for my second two day sojourn through the museum. After showing my voucher, to the very same ticket seller, I was told that I had already picked up all the tickets. Through my broken Russian I explained that she herself told me that I could not pick up all the tickets. I watched her play with her computer for about twenty minutes and she led me to a ticket counter where they printed out all my tickets, including the ones I had already used. Since we headed to the third floor that day, the museum was not overly crowded. Keep in mind that if you use a two day voucher it may take some time to get in on the first day, but on the second day, you have your ticket in hand and can run up the Jordan Staircase at 10:30 AM when the museum opens. This is what I did on the second day. More on that later. I had planned four, four hour trips to the Hermitage. To try to see this museum in one day is ill advised for a true art aficionado. If you just want to see the State Rooms, The Davinicis, and a few other highlights, one day is fine. This just wouldn\u2019t work for me and I didn\u2019t want to spend eight hours in the museum as I had done in The Louvre, two summers before. I ended up only going for three days, about four hours each day. Luckily my hotel, The Pushka Inn, was two minutes from the Hermitage. It\u2019s a hotel that is perfectly located, has a great restaurant, and the most helpful staff I have ever encountered. Naturally, I had to see the Davincis and the Michelangelo as soon as I got in. You make a left at the top of the Jordan Staircase and hang a left. Then you will have to ask as the rooms are poorly marked, if at all. Simply ask one of the friendly guards: G\u2019dere Davinci or Raphael Loggia. Try to learn the words for left and right. Knowing a few Russian phrases will save you much time in Russia. Once in the Renaissance rooms I saw a sea of people queuing up to see the Davincis. They just brushed past the Della Robias, The Fra Angelicos, and Botticelli\u2019s, to snap a picture of the Davincis. Every painting in The Hermitage is covered in glass. Most of the lighting is through the window. Not only are you fighting the glare, your eyes are fighting the reflections of passers bye. If you are looking at a painting of note, you will see a constant barrage of flashes, infra-red focusing lights, etc. I shot a video of one of the Davincis and it looked like a fireworks display. It looked pretty but it wasn\u2019t the pretty that I had in mind. I then visited the Michelangelo and the Raphael Loggia and continued through the ages: The Renaissance, The Baroque, Dutch art (especially Rembrandt), Spanish art, and French art, up until the English art. This is the majority of the second floor, which, is the majority of the museum. You can get from the 200\u2019s to room 300. To do more than this in one visit will test the bounds of your patience and your feet. Taking this route will give you the opportunity to see all the State Rooms. Don\u2019t plan for them as you can\u2019t miss them. On the second day, I had my ticket in hand. I was let in at about 10:20, and darted up the stairs to my first destination. Bliss. I had the Davincis, the Michelangelo, and the Raphael Loggia to myself. I shot a little video and then the crowds came. I bid adieu to the second floor and spent the rest of the day touring the ancient art galleries on the first floor. It was deserted and undeservingly so. This has one of the finest collections of Egyptian, Greek and Roman art in the world. There is also a fair amount of ancient Russian art, called Scythian art. This is a solid three hour tour, with a little time left over for the treasures upstairs.On the third day, we were slowed down by the ticket lady so we went straight to the third floor. Here you will see French art of the 18th and 19th century, the Impressionists and modern art. This floor, coupled with the \u201crecovered\u201d art taken from the Nazi\u2019s in World War II must have more Renoirs than any museum outside the Barnes Collection. It has a vast array of Impressionist art and a slew of Picassos and Matisses. The latter is especially well represented. After two hours we descended to the second floor where we re-visited the Renaissance galleries, the Rembrandts, and the aforementioned \u201cRecovered\u201d art. There was also a special exhibition of Annie Liebovitz and a special exhibition of Giorgione\u2019s \u201cThe Tempest.\u201d Also, his \u201cJudith\u201d is not to be missed\u2014nor should any Giorgione.To sum up, you can probably see this museum in two four hour visits, but be warned, you may not get to see everything you want to see. I missed some things I wanted to see but had little regret spending three, four hour days at The Hermitage. Don\u2019t miss the Russian Museum for half of the world\u2019s Russian art. The other half is at The Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. Also in Moscow is The Pushkin State Museum, which is an encyclopedic museum like the Hermitage, just nowhere near as large. Its Impressionist annex is especially captivating. I wouldn\u2019t miss it.One last thing. Finding a bathroom on the second floor is impossible. There is a restroom at the bottom of The Jordan Staircase and one on the third floor."

After going to this city, I can say I have never seen such a display of wealth in stark contrast to poor. I even think Russian wealth surpased Versailles, France. This is all part of that era, and it is amazing. They also found hundreds of impressionist paintings by the masters in the basement, which had been hidden away for 33 years to avoid being destroyed in the war, all beautifully maintained. I would venture to say there is more here than the world realizes yet. It really isn't a good idea to go by yourself, so join a tour. Be prepared, though: We went on a Holland America 2 day St. Petersburg tour and paid a large amount...BOTH days 3.5 hours of our trip were spent being driven to a souviner shop and a mall for fast food at a food court. with KFC and McDonalds..very upsetting....we came clear across the world to do that? I think not..but it is a new country in terms of tourism, so perhaps they didnt' realize we wanted authentic food and not have our time driving to an out of the way souviner shop when they were everywhere, including right outside our ship. The tour was very rushed, and we were hustled through the rooms, not being able to really see and appreciate the Monets, the Picassos...and all the other masterpieces, so be ready for that if you attach this tour to another. The traffic in this city was the worst in the world we have seen so far..more tour buses than I have seen anywhere in the world. It's bursting with people wanting to see it. The museum is a must see..skip the subway tours and such and spend the time seeing this and the other palaces."

The master paintings, the sculptures, the thrones, the ceramics, the marble all are one of a kind and exquisite. But I was most impressed with the decorations of the rooms themselves. Everywhere you see gold, precious stones, mirrors and furniture that is simply amazing. I have seen the Louvre and Versailles and the palaces of Vienna and Wurtzburg, Germany, but the Hermitage is the most eloquent in my opinion. Check it out for yourself. It is huge. You just cannot see it all. Takes AT LEAST three hours. TIP: Ask for a map in English of the museum when you enter."

In order to avoid the crowds, it is worthwile to carefully plan your visit. - It is not possible to avoid the crowds by going early, the tour groups will be earlier, since they are allowed in earlier and will head straight to the masterpieces. It is better to visit those around closing time, if you're lucky, you will be able to be alone, surrounded by Rembrandts. - There is much and much more to see than just the highlights, the Hermitage has a stunning archeological collection which is hardly visited by anyone. It is all the more interesting since it features many excavations from the caucasus, and these are not easily to be seen in other archeological museums. I would focus on what is unique for the Hermitage, in my opinion, all the Egyptian and Greek artifacts can be seen in many other museums, but the Siberian art is quite unique. It is pretty amazing to have all these big rooms just for yourself, hardly anyone visits these. - Use the toilets near the group entrance, they are quite clean compared to the toilets in the main entrance. Or even better, use the toilets between rooms 68 & 61, since they are in the area of the archeological artifacts described above and not nearly as much used as the other toilets. - If you take pictures, it is helpful to take a picture of the accompanying text. This way, you will remember who actually painted that particular work of art. - For those from the Netherlands: Become a friend of the Dutch Hermitage, earning you free entrance to St. Petersburg Hermitage. You are able to enter through the group entrance, even before official opening time. This way, you will be able to leave the Hermitage and come back later during the day, not possible on a normal ticket."

The place is huge and full of astonishing masterpieces and you need at least 4-5 hours to visit at least the basic works of art. As in most monuments in town, no Russians pay much higher tickets than Russians (at Hermitage you will pay 4 times more than a Russian to get in). I found, here and almost everywhere else in St. Peterburg, extremely rude and hostile guardians and receptionists. Most Russians, despite their job as front desk and ticket offices, refuse to speak any other language but Russian, including English. Also beware as most tours and signs are in Russian only. In brief, it is definitely worth a visit and I would suggest to swallow hard on service and concentrate on the masterpieces."

What I liked best was the Egyptian and photography exhibit. I have always had an interest in Ancient Egypt, and I was gladly surprised to see their huge exhibit on ancient artifacts. Also, when I went, they had a special exhibit on Annie Lebowitz, the famous photographer. I had never really enjoyed photography exhibits, but this was definitely worth going to. The only thing that I didn't like about the Hermitage was how long it took to get in. The first time, I stood in line for over half an hour (on a Tuesday!). However, the next time I went, I found that when you enter the courtyard, the line on the left always moves faster. I completely bypassed the line! But believe me, it's totally worth it.Definitely bring your walking shoes. Also, if you plan on going in the summer, bring a fan (you can buy one from most of the street vendors before you enter)! It can get very hot, and there's no air conditioning. Only bring a camera if you really want to. You must buy a special pass to be able to take pictures. I did not, but I think that just looking at the beauty was enough for me. Going to the Hermitage is definitely a long visit event. My friends and I would go for three hours at a time. Personally, I visited twice, but a few of my friends went upwards of five times. I wish I would have gone more, but I saw the most important things that I wanted.Oh, and definitely find one of the information desks and ask for a map! It will help to plan out where you want to go in the museum. Whether you like Renaissance artwork, French Impressionism, or modern art, the Hermitage literally has all you could wish for!"

Then grandness and richness of elite noble living is so evident everywhere.Then they have a good collection of paintings from Leonardo, Michelangelo, Renoir, Picasso, Van Gogh and many other famous painters. The beauty is that on such off-days, we had all the time to study up close and personal such exquisite arts and appreciate every moment of it. The last time we went to the Louvre, we could not approach in the crowd even within 10 feet to see Leonardo's Mona Lisa and even at that has a fleeting 10 seconds view of it before force to move along in the crowd. The Hermitage is Grand and has a wide selection of paintings by these famous painters.Then walking along many corridors, the ceilings and walls are filled with beautiful paintings and murals similar to that you see in the Vatican.

First the plus side: everything is very beautiful. The buildings of the Winter Palace, the old and new Hermitage, are very impressive. The rooms are still decorated as they were in older times, and it really adds something to the visit. The collection is also excellent, offering art pieces from all times and places in the world. I had a great time there!The down side is that this museum is extremely crowded. Way too crowded. So crowded that at some point, you just want to leave (and that's what I did on the 2nd day, when room after room I encountered hordes of guided tour groups, up to 30 people in each group! That's just too much!).Do buy your ticket online before your visit. Print the voucher, and just walk through the gate on Palace Square. Ignore the line if there is one. Cross the interior court of the Winter Palace all the way to the end. Don't be scared by the huge lines of people waiting, they are waiting to buy a ticket. At some point you will finally see a line indicated for people with tickets. Enter the hall. Do not wait at one of the booths for tickets. Just walk around the main hall to the information desk, and that's where they will exchange your printed voucher for the actual tickets. Nothing is indicated properly there, and one might think he has to wait in the line with all other people, just don't. Walk straight to the information point which is located behind the ticket booths. That should avoid you loosing more than 1/2 hr as I did (luckily I did see that I didn't have to wait in the line outside, but I didn't know I didn't need to wait inside to exchange the voucher).Right next to the information point, you'll see stairs leading you down to the free cloakroom, which is apreciable.Another down point are people using flash to take photos. I'm sure that Da Vinci's paintings, which are more than 500 years old, appreciate that very much. The worse is that there are signs everywhere showing \"no flash\", but nobody seems to care.And finally, i hope that they will start cleaning the toilets more often. I rarely suffered from such a horrible smell in any museum toilets."

The collections of older times are vast in number, pick the collections or milestone paintings you aim to see, and see those, as you may not have time to see all in half day (also even walking in the corridors takes time!)Very many visitors, something expected, the officers in each room are very helpful even if they don't speak English :) In summary, a MUST SEE in St. Petersburg but PLAN AHEAD your tickets (not online if it's a Thursday or Friday) and things to see inside (the website is helpful on that)."

Depending on where you are traveling from to visit here, ( Me being the United States) you may have already noticed the culture difference. It is different than getting greeted in a warmly manner, and showing you aroung the museum. They will come across as rude and unconcerned about your visit there.Therefore aside from the culture and the way customer service is represented, it was an impressive structure as well as museum. Well worth visiting at the very least to say I was in this well known magnificent structure."

But I feel that five hours is enough for casual visitors like me. The initial euphoria while climbing the Jordan stair case of the Hermitage lasts for one hour and then the repetitive and monotony sets in. Even for a connoisseur, apart from his interest in a particular area, the others too would be monotonous.Most of the tourists, stay on an average for three days, so it would not be worth to put in more than five hours, when there are other places of interest and equally beautiful. I would advise to buy one day ticket online as it would save considerable time, while standing in the queue for tickets."

For me, the deep and high-quality collection of French impressionist paintings were the highlight. There would be an entire room of works by a brand-name artist, and then, whoa! Another whole room of nothing but that artist\u2019s work. Of the many other cool items there, the peacock clock stood out the most.Notes if you go: you have to check your bags, and they charge extra (200 rubles, over $7) for the right to take photographs. One sour note: many of the paintings were visibly damaged (such as significant cracks in the paint), perhaps from being hidden from the Nazis and perhaps from mismanagement. The Hermitage doesn\u2019t seem that careful about managing climate control in the rooms."

There are several 'must go' museums in the world - like the British Museum in London, Louvre in Paris, Cairo Museum in Egypt..then in Russia, it is the Hermitage. I have seen all the rest of the museums mentioned but none is as splendid and glamorous as the Hermitage. There is always something to entertain you or to attract your attention even if you do not know anything about art or the artist. Each chamber has its own distinctive character and style of architecture and it is never boring. You have to look at not only the paintings or sculptures but also the ceilings, walls and the floors that revealed the stories of the history (look at my photos). There are so many chambers and corridors that you will easily get lost if you did not prepare your trip well in advance or have no guides with you. If affordable, spend a little time at the souvenir shop on the G/F before you enter or after you left the exhibition chambers. There are some good quality canvas paintings (copies) of the famous art works with different sizes. As a layman, I took a look at those paintings before I entered so that I would know what to appreciate when I got inside and see the 'real thing'. I spent 500 rubles and brought home a piece of great memory. I am not a museum fan but this one is really fanscinating. I would definitely like to return when I have a chance."

It was like a hit upside the head when I got back to our ship. I missed taking pictures of the best part. The unsmiling people of Russia. Our guide told us many were Russian widows who live on very small pensions. Yet they grabbed the brass ring, and were willing to watch and guard the treasures of Russia. Many looked like real Babushkas, and others were classy dames, with great hair and make up...some looked like really nice little ladies, wearing their best clothes, hair and make-up.

There isn't any one piece that is so much better than the others, but the collection as a whole is almost overwhelming. The museum is so huge (spanning four different buildings now, and seemingly expanding all the time) that without a good plan (or a good guide who knows what you are interested in) it can be a daunting task to even go inside. And, of course, the buildings themselves are of great interest. The state rooms of the Winter Palace are lovely even without the art, and the history of the palaces, their restoration, their inclusion into the museum is fascinating. I've heard that it would take 9 years to see everything in the Hermitage, and it certainly feels as if it is true, after a long day walking through the various rooms. It is definitely worth having a clear plan of what you want to see and the best route to see it, as even in June the museum was crowded with large tour groups with headsets and waving tour guides, making it hard to just wander and look at the art. Or, bypass the major stops on every tour (impressionists, Rembrandt, etc) and opt for the lesser known or less important periods and artists for a more sedate and art-museum-ish sort of experience. I love Dutch realists, for example, and the two rooms of paintings were nearly deserted, giving me time to really appreciate the various artists and pieces in the collection. You cannot go to St Petersburg and miss the Hermitage, but you should also make sure you know what you want to see and how to get there -- or you'll be frustrated by the crowds and the labrynthine corridors. Do some research up front on the collection."

Yes, there's a lot of beautiful art here, cause that's what Catherine The Great (reason for the construction of this museum) wanted, but now its also very large collection of sculptures, artifacts, relics, riches and etc. from ancient civilizations/cultures all over the world. Upon entering, we walked into the Egyptian room and the first thing I saw were 2-large granite sarcophagus's on the floor and from there it just kept on getting more and more amazing. If the art, artifacts or sculptures weren't impressive enough, the architecture and ornately detailed rooms became mind-boggling in themself. You gotta remember, this building was orignally intended for royality and distinguished guests, so because of this nearly each room is a story in itself. I'm a huge history buff and no where else in the world, do I know of, can you see such a vast collection of the world's history in one place. Do get there early (no later then 10 AM) to avoid the long lines and hopefully some of the large tour groups. Also, if possible avoid taking any coats or bags with you cause this all needs to be check-in and its just another chaotic line. You really need a full day to truly appreciate and see everything there is in this very large museum, but in my opinion it more then worth it and maybe you'll leave as blown away as I was."

If you are someone not that familiar with art but want to say you've been there, the usual three-hour guided tour will satisfy you. However, if you want to make sure you see certain pictures, figure out how to see the museum on your own and plan to spend most of the day there.Under no circumstances take anything that has to be checked, i.e., coats or similar items.

Each room (ceiling, floor, walls) is a masterpiece itself and on top of it there is a lot of really well preserved exponats.An important tip - buy your ticket online through http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/ and avoid a long long line to the ticket office. There is a separate ticket office (number 5) that deals with internet tickets only - this got us inside the building in about 3 minutes compared to some people who had to wait for over an hour in a line!Also, I wouldn't hire a guide but rather use an audioguide - each exposition has a number and if you are interested in a particular exhibit, you can just punch it into the device and hear all about it through the headphones. This way you can do Hermitage in your own pace and see what you really like and skip what you are less interested in.Hermitage is a must do while in St. Petersburg, even if you are not a huge fan of museums - this is far more than yet another boring museum."

Then you need to skip queue and go to cashier no. 5 (don't worry, I couldn't find it as well, it's really well hidden - ask staff for help). When you enter museum be sure that you will not leave even for toilet (use these inside) because this is only 1 entry on your ticket per day (even if they tell you that you can come back in 5 minutes...). You can take photos almost everywhere, but flash is often forbidden. It is not cheap museum to visit, but definitely worth it. Absolutely great. Unfortuantely I forgot about Monday closure and I haven't seen treasury (extra fee). That must be amazing. Anyway, have a look and definitely reserve some time for the Great Hermitage.

The fee was nominal, certainly for all there is to see. I liked the requirement to have your coat checked, was much easier to get around without the bulky winter coat (was snowing a lot outside). Outside the museum there were a set of Catherine and Peter impersonators, which seemed ubiqutous the more I got around town, as well as some guys trying to sell black market cavier (black, Beluga).I wandered the museum, which was probably not the best way to view things as I was not focused and spent a lot of time backtracking.

After all my numerous visits to the Hermitage I would recommend to come in November-April - excluding school vacations (November 1-7, January 1-10, March 24-31), preferably - on weekdays. No lines for tickets - only checkrooms might be an obstacle (mainly on weekends). Remember, that first Thursday of each month is a day for entrance with free tickets obtained from the box office.During the season it is better to use the Internet ticket sale - $18 one day, $26 two consecutive days per person. Otherwise - it is better to come an hour before the official opening (by 9.30) to the entrence from Palace square to get to the courtyard from where you enter the vestibule. Those with vouchers purchased in advance - go ahead of line showing the papers to the guards.If you want to get to the Treasury (2 departments available - Golden and Diamond rooms) - it is better to find a way to do in advance. These areas are non-available for regular visitors and can be visited with special groups with the obligatory attendance of Hermitage guides. During the season, in Summer they organise tours in English - one group of 15 persons a day to each room with tickets sold only on the day of the tour, no advance purchase. Advance arrangement can be done via an agent in Russia only. This particular visit might be a highlight (like for the majority) or a failure. Please think if a big collection of jewellery produced between 4th millenium BC and early 20 century AD is of interest for youand do not believe immediately to somebody telling it is all junk."

The Hermitage is by far the most frequently visited museum in St Petersburg so if you come to visit it during the high season, make sure you book your entrance tickets in advance via their website or ask the hotel where you are staying to book the tickets for you (some hotels provide this service for a fee even if you do not book a guided tour) or, if you are determined to buy the tickets on the spot, come at least half an hour before the opening time, which is 10:30, or expect to spend up to an hour and a half lining up to the booking office.The entrance for individual visitors is from the side of Palace Square (there is another entrance from the riverside, but it is only used by organized tours). The booking offices only accept Russian rubles \u2013 no credit cards! You can either buy a regular ticket that is valid for a day and lets you see the main collection located in the Winter Palace and the three adjoining buildings, or, if you want to visit the Treasury (the gold and jewelry collection) also known as the Gold Room or the Diamond Room, there is a tickets that includes a visit to the Treasury. Important: the Treasury is a guided tour with a Hermitage tour guide, so you have to be at the meeting point at exactly the time indicated on your ticket (or, better still, 5 minutes before). There are normally just one or two English-speaking tours of the Treasury a day (and a group can be no more than 15 people), so if you do not manage to get on one of these, you will have to join a Russian-speaking tour \u2013 better than nothing if you mostly want to see things (and there are some captions with general information in English). Make sure you sign up for the right kind of Treasury, however: there are actually two of them \u2013 one (which is more popular), known as the Diamond Room, is a display of gold, silver and precious stones dating from 1000 B.C. to the early 20th century, and the other, known as \u201cTreasury No.2\u201d, is a display of ancient Greek and Oriental gold and jewelry. Overcoats and bigger-sized bags are not allowed inside \u2013 check them in the cloakroom downstairs (the cloakroom is free). The ticket checkpoint is equipped with turnstiles \u2013 press the bar code on your entrance ticket to the barcode reader on the turnstile, and when the green arrow shows up, push the turnstile and walk through. Remember that you can only use your ticket once, - it will not work again if you decide to walk out of the museum and then re-enter it, even on the same day.Some people are confused about the Winter Palace and the Hermitage, thinking that these are two separate sights. In fact, the Winter Palace is part of the Hermitage, and when you enter the Hermitage, you actually enter the Winter Palace. Besides the palace, there are four more buildings of the Hermitage, all joined together by roofed passages \u2013 three house the collections, and the fourth one, the Hermitage Theater, is used for performances. To find your way in the Hermitage is not as easy as you might imagine \u2013 the place is like a maze, so get a plan for free at the Information Desk next to the booking office (make sure it is in English not in Russian) or hire an audio guide in the lobby (after you have passed through the ticket checkpoint). If you do lose your way, ask the museum attendants (there is one in every room \u2013 they are mostly elderly ladies but they will speak some basic English and will send you in the right direction).If you want to use your camera inside, buy a camera permit at the same booking office where you buy your entrance ticket (no pictures are allowed in the Treasuries, though) but remember you cannot use flash for paintings. There are lots of kiosks and small museum stores that sell books of the Hermitage all over the place, but the main gift shops with the biggest choice are downstairs on the main level of the Winter Palace. The gift shops also have a big selection of souvenirs specially made for the Hermitage. The guys that walk around the Hermitage offering you books mainly sell outdated editions, so it is safer to buy the books at the official museum stores.There are a few toilets around the place (one in each Hermitage building and one at the cloakroom in the basement), but they are all downstairs on the main level. There are only two elevators (both are not very easy to find), so most people walk upstairs. The main staircase has very shallow steps and is fairly easy to climb.Generally, the Hermitage is a huge place with about three million exhibits, so if you are an art lover, leave a whole day for your visit. You can lunch at one of the two cafeterias downstairs on the main level of the Winter Palace \u2013 none of them accepts credit cards, but one (the internet caf\u00e9) will normally take dollars and euros. There are some ATM machines inside the museum at the entrance that you can use before you go through the ticket checkpoint.The Hermitage works until 6 o\u2019clock p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays, and until 5 o\u2019clock p.m. on Sundays.

The Russians have done a wonderful job in restoring the Winter Palace to its former glory. I saw the museum as part of of tour and barely made a \"dent\". To anyone wanting to see the splendours of this museum I highly recommend that they take their time and visit the museum on their own. If time is limited another suggestion would be to concentrate on any section of particular interest only. The Hermitage is certainly an attraction not to be missed when in St. Petersburg."

This tour was prepaid and so no hassels with finding our way around. Being September, the weather was cool and comfortable. BE AWARE that NO coats or jackets are allowed and have to be checked into the cloak room.Our tour ended at lunchtime leaving us wanting more as we really have had only a small taste of what The Hermitage has to offer."

This workaround has two catches, though: first, the tickets voucher is e-mailed to you not immadiately, but after 2 or 3 days, so don't wait till the last moment. Second, it's fun to fetch the tickets while you are there: you go in through the exit, waving the voucher to the security person, go to informations desk, they call some clerk in some office, you go there, they take you t yet another desk, there they take your voucher, go to the ticket office and return with your tickets. It's not very streamlined but it gets the ticket in only about 10 minutes.Inside... Well, there's lots to see, as it can be expected. Most people seem to be visiting the painting galleries (Leonardo, Rembrandt...), but there are some corners with really exotic stuff like the caucasian archaeology section. One day may not be enough to see all what's in here, so it may be sensible to buy a two-day ticket and spend both days in the Winter Palace.And if you're looking for more Russian artwork, don't miss the State Russian Museum which is not that far away."

Today (11th August 2010) I went to the Hermitage musem, and I must say that it is the most disorganized museum I've ever been to.First of all, at least in theory, the entrance from Palace square should be reserved to individuals, but I saw groups entering from there too, so, if one hour before the opening of the museum there is already in place a very long queue, after the opening of the museum, differently from what you would expect, the situation becomes worse and worse.It is made even worse by the fact that there are only four ticket windows, incredibly few for such a busy museum, also considering this is high season, so the result is an even longer queue.Moreover, the disposition of the ticket windows itself is completely nonsense: the initial queue is split in two and each sent to a different couple of ticket windows, but then they all get mixed up, causing a big big big mess!It would be much better to have one queue for all windows and when one of the employees is free the next one in the queue could be served. This way, if one of the employees is new or one of the terminals has some problems, there wouldn't be one queue much more slower than the others.Some of the employees can't speak English, nor they can understand the kind and number of tickets you are asking for: considering that the Hermitage is not Wal Mart and that they sell a limited number of \"items\" this issue should not exist at all!Besides of that, the queue is shared with Russian people, which, in order to obtain their discounts, have to show their ID, making the queue unreasonably slower.It is true that maybe most or all of these problems can be avoided by buying tickets online from their web site, but the procedure itself is not easy at all it if must be done when you are already on vacation (a receipt it sent after three days, it must be printed and taken to the \"manager\" or whoever it is, ...).Opening time are just ridiculous: with only seven hours and half per day, and the ticket allowing the entrance for just one day, which is the point of having 24 Km of exposition if visitors can't humanly see them? If I had chosen to stop visiting in order to eat something/going to the toilet, I would have had even less time! If one (OR MORE) room(S) is (ARE) under maintenance, they should move the most interesting masterpieces in another open room, it is completely unacceptable to lose the chance to see them! A defined clear route though the musuem does not exist: in order to see everything you must turn back over and over, because the way the maps depict the museum is quite different from the reality (close doors, stuff only access... etc).Reaching other floors is an obstacle course: expecially the third floor, because of massive restoration works currently underway, so massive that they have almost completely made invisible the main stairway (see the attached picture).There is a fee in order to be allowed to take pictures, but the majority of the most architectonally spectacular rooms are used for temporary exhibitions, so pictures are not allowed at all, and in some cases pictures are not allowed even for the permanent exhibition.The value of the collections is not at issue, but I would have expected something more, at least comparable to the other museums I have visited so far, from the organizational point of view, by one of the most famous museum in the world."

I loved it, not only the exhibits, but the beauty of the building. It is a definite must do for anyone.Tips 1.Get in line one hour before it opens in the hope that you won't have to wait over two hours like we did in the hot summer sun. There are multitudes of people and it can be noisy in some parts of The Hermitage due to the number of people there.2. Find a good Russian guide who will take you in a very small group to discover the best of the place. There are large groups everywhere and the leader usually has a flag leading everyone about, not ideal imo. (We did it on our own, but it is interesting to have a guide.)3.Entry cost 400 roubles plus 200 roubles to take photographs (a must do).4. You cannot go to the toilet after you are in The Hermitage, neither can you take your own food and eat it there, you leave your large bags in the cloakroom on arrival.5. Go to the cafe for a quick meal.6. If you get stuck in a line for a long time like us then look out for two food stalls inside the courtyard where you can buy a beer, coffee, drink and snack but you will need someone to mind your place in the line if you do this.And yes the Russian Museum only a short walk away is terrific but nothing surpasses The Hermitage.Give yourself a maximum of three days in St Petersburg, get a 4 or 5 star hotel near The Hermitage and organise a guide ahead of time to see The Hermitage, The Church of the Spilled Blood, Russian Museum, Peterhoff Palace and Catherine Palace.Enjoy."

I have always thought that opulence that was something reserved for Indian palaces, but the 'Hermitage' is in another league for museums. As practical as 'Te Papa' in Wellington or the 'Natural History Museum' in London, but with the added interest that the building itself is a work of art. By world standards it's reasonably priced for entry.The art collections alone occupy over a hundred rooms in this vast complex, with works by almost every artist imaginable, the treasury and Faberge collections are out of this world, and then there's room after room of the more usual museum 'stuff'; mummies, bronze age axes, flint arrow heads, Bazantine pottery it just goes on and on. Unfortunately, like all large museums it's impossible to see it all, or even a large part of it, in one visit. \"Museum Fatigue\" eventually sets in, not tired of wandering around but the brain gets over-loaded! Certainly a reason to return to St.Petersburg. But I have no idea when the best time to visit is, early May was busy, guides said that it was actually fairly quiet - I suspect it's all a matter of luck, extra tickets for the treasury etc need to be booked well in advance."

My daughter and two grand-kids signed up for a St Petersburg city tour through a tour operator located in the US who then made our advance reservation for the Gold Room (required 60 days in advance) of our trip. It would honestly take five years just to see all that the Hermitage offers and I understand that only 5% of their collection is on display. The Hermitage has over a 1000 rooms and has at least 24 rembrandts, 40 Rubenes! TheHermitage was the Winter Palace of almost every tzar and tzarina to rule Russia since Catherine the Great.We were very pleased with the second floor which has a fine collection of Italian Renaissance if you wish to see lovely Leonardo da Vinci works and sculputure. There are also Picasso and Matisse pieces on the 1st floor. The patterned parquet flooring and inlaid marquetry through out the Hermitage is breathtaking! Our tour of the Gold Room was scheduled for 2pm and there were only the four of us with our Gold Room guide. As this was a private tour we were able to ask questions and received detailed answers and learned more than the guide books.Living in Florida myself, and my daughter living on Long Island we were hesitant to book our St Petersburg & Novgorod city tours directly through Russia for we did run into problems when we booked other tours directly in the Czech Republic and Hungary. We found Red October USA online and phoned to see exactly what and how they operated. We were pleased that the owner is a Russian and operates a USA based business which made it so convenient for setting up exactly what we wished to see. We have now toured in Russia several times but on this trip we arrived on a cruise ship and wanted the best city tour we could book. Being past European, Med. and Carribean cruisers we know enough NOT to book the tours offered by the cruise lines unless that is you want to be treated like cattle and herded around! We always book PRIVATE tours so we don't need to see what we don't want to see - we are alway specific as to what and where we want to go. We asked Red October to give us several hours in the Hermitage so we could see not only the main museum but also the riding stable and other apart;ments. It takes many trips to St Petersburg to see WELL all of the wonderful sites, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to St. Petersburg - take a private tour and spend MORE time in the Hermitage and Winter Palace."

We signed up for both the gold and diamond tours when we bought our entrance tickets. Unfortunately once you enter the Hermitage you can't exit and re-enter. However the gold tour is outside of the Hermitage! We had to beg and plead with the guards to get back into the Hermitage without buying another ticket. The diamond tour which is inside the Hermitage had many of the same exhibits as the gold tour so my advice would be to just buy the diamond tour. Otherwise we enjoyed wondering the museum which is so huge that you never knew what room would be next - an elaborate palace room, Renaissance art or Greek statues. We eventually saw all of the art that we really wanted to see and ran into many other interesting exhibits. You do have to pace yourself so be sure to drop into the cafe for coffee and pastry sometimes."

St. Petersburg was one of our favorite cities on the cruise. It is important to note that if you do not get a Russian visa prior to going, you will not be able to get off the ship unless you book the tour excursions through the cruise line. We obtained our Visa from Visa Express in Houston, TX and it cost about $200 per person. Which was actually well worth it since the cruise line excursions were expensive. Celebrity Constellation was docked about a 10 minute cab ride from the main sites. It cost about $12 each way. However, if you walk about half a mile you can take the local #7 bus to the main attractions for about $1. Once you are by the Hermitage, you can easily walk to all the other sites. I would recommend getting rubles in advance if you are doing independent touring.I HIGHLY recommend buying your Hermitage tickets in advance from their website. The lines are VERY long and by buying them in advance, you go straight in, no wait. This saved us atleast 2 hours in line.We took a canal cruise, great photo opportunity. We read on one of these posts that Anglo Tours did English speaking tours. They were good and covered a lot of history. Their English was great. They were located off Nevsky Prospect and their first cruise was at 11am (so don't rush down there at 8am like we did).In terms of safety, we were careful. We stayed in the main areas and around people. To be honest, we felt pretty comfortable overall. People were helpful but I do have to warn you that very few people spoke English and there were no signs in English so get a good guide book with good maps. It was very easy city to get around once you are in the main area (by the Hermitage). Peter and Paul fortess was nice, reminded us a little of Tower of London. The political history museum was interesting but we preferred the ones in Budapest and Prague more. Russia's had a lot of great displays but reading the captions for all the photos and items was just a little too much. You would need a lot of time to really cover it. The Hermitage was wonderful (I am not a huge fan of art museums but this one is amazing and the building itself is worth the visit). The Church on Spilled Blood was interesting but a little expensive, if you have seen a lot of other churches, you might save your money. If you like tile mosiacs, you would appreciate the church."

We had purposely not walked in that direction since our arrival so as to maintain an element of anticipation! It was only a short walk from our hotel (but long enough for our daughter\u2019s hair to freeze \u2013 she had not finished drying it before leaving!) and our first view was a classic image of the building across a snowy park. As you would expect from a world famous museum, all the facilities \u2013 ticket office, cloackroom, toilets, caf\u00e9, etc are very accessible and user-friendly. In February there are no queues, no crowds \u2013 we often found we had entire state rooms to ourselves. The floor plan/map provided by the museum (in English) is good, although it is still easy to get completely lost. Note that they refer to the ground floor as \u2018the first floor\u2019, the first floor as \u2018the second floor\u2019, and so on. We spent 4 or 5 hours in the museum and concentrated on the STATE ROOMS of the WINTER PALACE (marked as \u2018Palace Interiors\u2019on the plan) and 19th & 20th Century European Art. The State Rooms are all on the \u2018second floor\u2019 and while you are on this floor it is also worth seeking out two other exhibitions : tucked away in Rooms 143-146 is a collection of TROPHY ART appropriated from the Nazis at the end of WWII. It includes works by Renoir, Van Gogh, Gaugin, Degas, Manet, Monet & C\u00e9zanne. This is clearly still a very sensitive issue \u2013 the collection is not referred to on the museum plan and, unlike elsewhere in the museum, photography is not allowed. Also on this floor, in Rooms 175-187, is an EXHIBITION OF RUSSIAN INTERIORS\u2013 it consists of a series of rooms (smoking room, library, study, nursery, etc) re-creating the style of each decade from the early 1800s to the Revolution. Originally opened as a temporary exhibition in the 1980s, it proved so popular that is has remained ever since.On the \u2018third floor\u2019, in Rooms 314-350, you will find the collection of MODERN EUROPEAN ART from the 19th & 20th Centuries. It is a breathtaking collection, with a stunning range of works by Picasso, Matisse, Gauguin, the Impressionists and many others.A tip: If you can, watch RUSSIAN ARK, a film by Alexander Sokurov before your trip. Watching this film before a visit to the Hermitage really gives an added dimension and depth to your visit. Made in 2002, this film was shot on location in the Hermitage in a single, unedited take. It takes the viewer on a journey through 300 years of Russian art & history. It received rave reviews, among them, the Guardian, \u201cBreathtaking \u2026 a cinematic love letter to the Hermitage\u201d. Our teenage daughter particularly appreciated having seen the film \u2013 it really did enhance her visit to state rooms in the Winter Palace."

            "review": "Almost overwhelming!. An incredible collection! Buy your ticket on-line at the Hermitage Museum website and avoid the lines. On line tickets also allow you to take photographs (which you can turn into the best screen saver ever!) Review the floorplans at the website to make the most of your time there. Wear comfy shoes and check coats and bags downstairs. Rent the audio tour (bring an unimportant piece of ID along, you'll need to leave something as security- I used my frequent flier miles card.) Make sure you pick up a map and take advantge of the little computerized \"You are here, where do you want to go\" kiosks scattered throughout the Museum. (We didn't notice them until well into our third hour and they came in quite handy for finding specific works of art) Pace yourself as best you can and have a cup of tea before you head upstairs to the Impressionists on the top floor, where I guarantee you will be amazed at the scope of the collection!"

            "review": "book early. This museum is an absolute must see however it gets so busy with tour groups. The museum hasn't quite figured out how to get the queues down and I was watching one tour guide who had to get twenty tickets individually for her group as she couldn't get the tickets all at once. People must have been stood for over two hours in the queue. We booked on line which allowed us to skip the queue however we still had to fight at the ticket office as there are no orderly lines! Go to the museum however ensure that you book on line will save you so much time!"

            "review": "No.1 reason to visit Russia!. What more can be said for this magnificent museum and its unbelievable art treasures? Simply one of the best experiences anyone can have. Here are some practical tips:- Book your tickets online! This will save you A LOT of waiting. Two-day tickets are best, as they allow you entrance to other branches of the museum as well.- Don't visit on weekends. Although we booked our tickets online, we had to wait 45 mins to exchange our voucher with the actual tickets, as the crowds were incredible ( I really wonder why they don't open more counters, people often have to wait in line for more than two hours...)- Don't visit as part of a group. You'll only see a very small percentage of the exhibits, you'll be rushed through rooms and you'll miss most of what your guide tells you.- Go prepared. It's impossible to see everything. Get a good guidebook beforehand and organize your visit before you travel according to your personal taste.Hermitage is one of the things that anyone should see in his/her lifetime."

            "review": "Amazing museum!. We weren't aware of the buying tickets beforehand scheme other reviewers have mentioned, so we queued. We arrived just before opening time (which is 10.30am) and the queue was already quite long. It was 45 minutes before we actually had bought our tickets and got into the museum to start looking around, but later on in the day the queue does get longer! We were lucky as the time of day meant we could queue in the shade rather than the direct heat of the sun (it must have been at least 27C there). Once inside the museum is amazing. We went more for the architecture than the art works. We weren't disappointed either. The rooms are just amazing! A lot of them have various works of art on display, and up on the 3rd floor are rooms that feel more like art gallery rooms - plain rooms with art on the walls. There were Picassos, Monets and others in those. We were there for over 2 hours and managed to get museum fatigue as well as getting hungry. The museum cafe is very good (great cakes!).We got round the museum quite quickly really. We didn't see everything, even a whole day wouldn't do the place justice, but we were only in St. Petersburg 2 days so we wanted to see as much of other attractions as we could as well."

            "review": "Scythian Gold - Don't Miss It!. First, as another reviewer has already said, buy your tickets online at the Hermitage Shop. Buy two day tickets, because it takes a day to get oriented and establish your priorities. The long line is to buy tickets. So if you already have your voucher you do not have to wait in line - at all. Move past all those people directly to a ticket counter and exchange your voucher for a ticket.When you exchange your voucher for a ticket, also buy a ticket to the gold treasure. Even though you will be rushed through much too fast and cannot take any photos, this is incredibly lovely stuff and includes the stag in mid-leap that is the logo of the museum. And on the way to the gold treasure room, be sure to see the ancient Russian exhibits on the first floor."

            "review": "The highlight of our visit to St Petersburg. We were able to spend a full day at The Hermitage which we needed to see the wonderful state rooms, The Raphael Loggia and the fabulous paintings, tapestries and sculptures. We went with Russian Gateway and our guide Maria got us into the Hermitage without having to queque and took us straight to the french Impressionist gallery which we wanted to see first. We had arranged to stay after Maria had given us a 3 hour guided tour and it was good to have the flexibility to stay as long as we wanted after this. We had two breaks for food and drink at the cafe there which wasn't crowded and the tales of dreadful toilets there proved to be unfounded."

            "review": "Every room is a work of art. We went on a tour of the Hermitage with Royal Caribbean which included the Gold Room. Our tour of the museum itself was very rushed, it was also very crowded. The only time we were able take our time and see everything at our own pace was in the Gold Room in which we spent about a half an hour. It is filled with treasures, including a ring once owned by \"Francis Drake, a pirate\". Don't know if it was worth about $33 pp more than the regular tour, however, it was nice not to be rushed through one exhibit hall anyway. I don't know how you could go to St. Petersburg and not see the Hermitage, but with the crowds it is tough to see even a fraction of the art there. If you can plan your visit around the crowds, you would experience a lot more of the museum than the rushed four hour shore excursion I went on."

            "review": "Worth a visit but be warned. While a visit to St. Petersburg is not complete without a visit to the Hermitage and Winter Palace, be warned you will find more than just an impressive art collection. For my wife and I, the bad attitude and poor treatment by the employees unfortunately overshadowed our visit. In all our worldwide travels, we have never seen such dismal, rude people. They were rude, pushy, and surly. Our tour group and ourselves were yelled at and pushed several times by the museum staff. We were either standing in the wrong place or not moving fast enough for them. Our Russian tour guide got into several yelling arguments with the staff. Not what we expected in a world famous art museum.While we still encourage you to go see one of the treasures of the world, just be prepared for the people you will find there."

            "review": "dont stand in a queue. We went to St Petersburg to see the sights but mainly to go to The Hermitage.If you dont want to stand in line for 2 or 3 or more hours, go online to The Hermitage Shop before you leave and buy a 1 or 2 day pass (would reccommend 2 day)costs US$24 each, just print out your copy and bypass the queue.Walk past the queue (go about 10-11am and you will avoid most of the coach groups).Show your paperwork to the guard on the door, but dont go to the first counter you see, carry on a few more steps and take a rh turn.Since this counter is hidden away you get issued with your tickets in minutes.If you want to see THE TREASURES Room, book you spot as soon as possible.We didn't know and missed out.Fortunately we had seen the Moscow Faberge exhibit .It might cost you extra but when you have gone all that distance!!.Don't take anything bigger than a handbag, you will have to go through the traumas of finding the left luggage room.If you decide to do the audio tour you have to leave ID, try and find something with you name on that is not your licence, passport or credit card. We used our airline membership cards.Also there is a massive internet area near the cafe."

            "review": "One of the greatest museums in the world. Anyone who has even the slightest appreciation for art will treasure this museum. I've been to the Hermitage a half dozen times, but it never ceases to impress me. The building itself is as much an artistic treasure as the masterpieces hanging on its walls. The main staircase is the most impressive entrance. It leads up to the royal chambers, many of which are still decked out in royal finery. If you've seen \"Russian Ark,\" you'll recognize many of these spaces. Intertwined with the royal rooms are collections of great Russian and European art. You of course have to catch a glimpse of the Hermitage's most famous works in these rooms, like Michelangelo's Madonna or Catherine the Great's enormous gold mechanical clock. Usually the crowds start the thin out by the time you get to Italian sculpture or modern European art. It's easy to get tired out by such a large museum, which is a shame, 'cause there's still a tremendous amount left to see! I especially enjoyed the armor room, the ancient Roman sculpture, the Ancient Egyptian art, and the dark twisty hallways packed with artifacts from ancient Siberia and central Asia.A few tips: Although the entrance fee is rather expensive, admission is free with a student ID, and once a month there is a free admission day (although that day is also much more crowded than usual!). The museum has a nice ATM machine as well a post office that never has a queue (that's a rarity in Russia!). Don't eat at the museum cafe unless you're starving--it's overpriced and the food is terrible."

            "review": "Wow. Beautiful beyond belief.. I read somewhere that the Hermitage is one of the two great art galleries in the world, and you can pick the other one yourself. I support this sentiment 100%.No trip to St Petersburg would be complete without a visit to this institution. The art collection rivals any in the world and to my mind beats the rest hands down. What amazed me is the range of works covered. One minute you can be walking through gallery after gallery of ancient sculpture, and then you find yourself face to face with 28 Picassos, then a dozen Monets, a room full of Rembrandts, a Gainsborough Lady, more Cezanne's than you could shake a stick at, a Michelangelo, a handful of Da Vincis, a wall of Raphaels, a room of Van Goghs that I never knew existed. The list goes on. It would be impossible to see everything in a day, or even two, but whatever you see you are guaranteed a delight. That the collection has this impact with no \"signature\" pieces (ie. there is no Mona Lisa or Birth of Venus) is testament to the quality of what is there.Of course, the greatest piece of art is the Winter Palace itself. As a gallery it is unmatched. The rooms are amazing and walking from room to room can literally take your breath away. It's also amazing to think that you are wandering around the palace that was home to the Russian Tzars for over 200 years. We were there in March and so the heat was not a problem. However, I would suggest you go early. We arrived at 11am and there was no queue, but we looked out of a window at about 2pm and people were queuing around the block."
