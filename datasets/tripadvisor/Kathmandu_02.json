I wanted to organise my trek through an Kathmandu company and after reading previous reviews on Nepal Hiking team i decided to email them . I was pleasantly surprised at the prompt and detailed response to all my emails . All my queries were answered and i felt at no time that i was not in control . On my arrival in Kathmandu i was met by Ganga , He made me feel like i was the most important person that day .i was taken to my hotel and ther Ganga booked me in and explained all about the days Ahead .During the trek Napal hiking team had provided me with a Guide and porter .My guide was a young man named Pavan ,what a respectful young man ,a credit to the Nepal hiking team . He looked after me from start to finish . without his aid i do not think i would have managed the Chola pass. Nepal hiking team had arranged the best flights to Lukla . Thank you Nepal hiking team ."

            "review": "Great trip around Manaslu Circuit. We booked this trip a few months ago because it seemed quieter than the EBC and Annapurna trips but with the same great scenery. We weren't disappointed. Our guide, Bal, was great and very ably dealt with one of the party having to turn back after a few days (too hot). The experience was very well organised, from collection at the airport when we arrived, dropped at the hotel, collected for the trek, returned to Kathmandu, and then dropped at the airport again. Highly recommended for dealing with your every need and being fast and responsive to queries. Capable and personable porters too."

The booking side was very easy and Ganga sorted everything out perfectly via email.Having been in Kathmandu a few days prior to the trip we didn't bother with the city tour offered. We were lucky and due to a cancellation it was only my wife and I, our great guide Suraj and our porter Lukebada - so a very personal tour!Flew into Lukla on 24th Sep which is a great and thrilling flight. Reached EBC on 1st Oct and flew back from Lukla to Kathmandu on 5th October. Through out the trip Suraj was an excellent guide, supportive, informative and made sure we were careful to look after ourselves so we could reach basecamp. Would highly recommend. We spent another week in Pokhara after the trip but Ganga and the team took us back to the airport when we returned and flew out of Kathmandu which was a nice touch!"

My review is on what I think makes the trip .... the company, the guide and the porter.My 61-year old friend and I had a unforgettable 10-day trek carefully planned by Nepal Hiking Team Pvt Ltd. From the time his staff picked us up to the time we said goodbye at the airport, the entire trip was perfect. This included water rafting and paragliding. Its Managing Director Ganga Raj Thapa was fast and efficient in his email response before and after the trip. I found the charges reasonable. He answered to all my questions and would accede to my requests if reasonable. In person, he's a warm and friendly man that you will feel comfortable with.The guide that he assigned, Narayan, was also very responsible. Very knowledgeable, informs us what to expect, very patient to wait for us 2 slow men. He took very good care of us, see to any of our needs... charge batteries, got us blankets, refill our bottles with water, be our camera man, he even holds my walking sticks or spectacles whenever I am taking pictures. He's very fit and could climb Everest, problem is that he doesn't have the money to do it.The porter, Lal, was just as amazing in his role. He could carry our stuff of 30kg for the entire 10 days, where we could easily trekked over 160km, ascended and descended over 15,000 stone steps, not forgetting the last stretch from MBC to ABC where oxygen level dropped to 50%. Despite all these, he is grateful that he has a job.Together they served us extremely well .. at meal times, they doubled up as waiters. At lunch, they ate their meals after us.. at dinner, they ate their meals .. after ALL the trekkers in the guest house had theirs .. and those trekkers are NOT even their customers.They did not sleep after we slept .. they slept only after ALL the trekkers in the guest house had slept .. and those trekkers are NOT even their customers .. because due to the lack of proper rooms, they can only sleep in the dining room.Our tips for them increased as each day passed. Hence dear trekkers, give generously when you are there, .. they deserved more.We may return to Nepal and although we can choose to do a different trek like the Everest Base Camp trek, we will definitely NOT choose a different company. Can change treks and cannot change company."

Also, I am a slow walker and not very strong.Mr. Gangga is awesome. He arranged a very lax 20 days itinerary. He picked me up at the airport and I was surprised with the hotel he arranged for me. Such a comfy one!My guide, PS is a very patient guy. He made sure that everything is alright and on track. When I got the dreaded AMS in Lobuche we decided to descend and rest in Periche and try again the next morning. He will do anything in his power to make my dream came true - stepping my feet in EBC. My porter, Jivan is a very funny guy too. He makes me laugh whenever I am out of breath with his funny manners.This team is great. I never feel worried of travelling alone. Highly recommended."

There were 5 of us doing the trek and we all agreed they did a fantastic job! Ganga was very efficient in organizing everything for us and from the minute we landed in Kathmandu until we left 6 days later, we were very well taken care of.We could only do a short trek (4 days to Poon Hill with a fantastic view of the Annapurna range) but it was totally worth it and I'm excited to go back and do a longer trek with NHT. Our guide Basu was professional and friendly and the whole crew (Basu, Prem, and 3 porters) were great company for the trek. When we celebrated the last night of our trek with a few beers and a party at our guest house, they really got the party started with some great Nepalese music and dancing.Thanks Ganga & team!"

The 14 day Annapurna Circuit package exceeded all expectations as far as scenery and diversity of terrain (rain forest, snow capped mountain peaks, and desert) are concerned. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a scenic trek. But what separated our trip from great to priceless was the Nepal Hiking Team. Our guide Baal submerged us in local flare and information. He told jokes and was always making us laugh. Our porters Prakash and Prim met us with warm smiles and high fives whenever we made it to our days destination. The details are what matter to me and everything was taken care of. I always felt safe and well informed. Even before we set foot in Nepal, Ganga answered all my emails immediately with fluent English responses which put me at ease. We were met at the airport and from the minute we were picked up our every need was catered to. It was a life changing experience and I honestly think that was 100% due to the Nepal Hiking Team. Im officially addicted to Nepal and will be coming back as soon as possible to do another trek with the Nepal Hiking Team."

Thanks to the great competency and efficiency of Ganga our trip was redesigned within an hour and we went finally to do the Annapurna Circuit.We had a great time there enjoying the beautiful mountains and the friendly company of our guide - Ram and porter - Robin. Apart the default itinerary we had been given a lot of flexibility and could explore some additional places like Ice Lake and whereabouts of Dhampus Pass.Despite we had given them a tough time almost running up the mountains they still were able to familiarize us with their culture, cuisine and habits. It was challenging yet unforgettable experience."

As such I decided to do the helicopter tour instead. I was well taken care of and my interests were protected throughout the trip. Weather was bit challenging and most of time it was cloudy in the high mountains. As such it was all about managing the trip. To make the money worth we initially took off for lukla. Then spend a night there. Next day tried to make it to Everest base camp but it was too cloudy so we spend more time at Everest hill hotel in the middle of the mountain range. Then when we had a good window we made it to base camp and had a clear view on the mountain. True , it's highly weather depended but we got lucky and the team did anything to increase the chances of the latter. Really enjoyed it: will try to come back and do the trek . Will choose them again."

As soon as we grabbed our bags from the airport in Kathmandu and headed out the door, we saw our guide ready to greet us. He took our bags and shuttled us to our hotel. That night we met Ganga to take care of the details of the trip. The following morning we had our tour of Kathmandu. My wife was feeling a little sick and halfway through the tour they took her back to the hotel with no questions asked.The trek was indescribable! Our guide, Basu, was amazing. He has the perfect balance of being professional while feeling like you are hiking with your best friend. Basu and our porters always made us feel like we were at home. Sometimes I wanted them to relax after a long day of hiking but as soon as we would reach a destination they would ask us what we wanted and take our lunch and dinner requests. They even brought our food out to us. There were never any issues if we wanted to to stop to take pictures or change in/out of a jacket. It was our trip and they made sure we knew it. I felt as though I made two new friends with our guide Basu and porter Santos. We taught each other how to play new card games and we learned a little Nepali language as well. Of course the mountains and the views were amazing, but this review is for the exceptional job that Nepal Hiking Team did. If you are looking for an EBC trip, look no further!!"

Our guide, Basu, was more like a friend than a guide while being professional and knowledgable of the Himalayan region. Both Basu and our porter Santosh, went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable, well fed and having a good time. During the day they made sure we trekked at a safe pace and took as many breaks as needed. Every breakfast, lunch and dinner started with Basu and Santosh, taking our food order, serving us and getting us anything else we needed before they sat down to eat themselves. Most nights concluded with playing cards together and laughing around the dinner table. Throughout the trek we stayed at the nicest accommodations available, had hot showers when available and ate homemade food at all our hotel restaurants. The overall organization of our trek with NHP was also impressive. From the beginning the coordinator, Ganga was extremely helpful answering any questions or concerns we had. They also organized our airport pick-up and drop-off, plane ticket to Lukla, all our permits and a city tour with a local guide. If you are considering trekking in the Himalayans, Nepal Hiking Team is the best of the best! Thank you for everything!!!!"

NHT was wonderful supplying transportation to and from the airport, hotel, taking care of permits we needed and gave a tour of sites in Kathmandu. The climbing experience was amazing thanks to our professional and knowledgeable guide, Basu. He made the trip fun and we appreciated all he did for us. We felt like family from start to finish. During the decent I twisted my foot and Basu walked slowly with me making sure I was okay. We enjoyed the experience so much we're thinking of coming back in a year and climbing a different mountain. I would recommend NHT to anyone looking to trek in the Himalayas!"

I've had the pleasure of arranging an Annapurna trek route with Nepal Hiking Team first week of September and it was an absolute blast right from when I stepped foot in Nepal. I was warmly received by Ganga and my trek guide Suraj, the accommodation arranged were above my expectations and I was well taken care of by the team. Suraj is one of the most patient and meticulous guide I've met - he accommodated with all my requests and is very wary of my wellbeing throughout my trek. The Annapurna trek itself was amazing (and would have been even more awesome if the weather had been better) with a wide range of scenery from the villages to the waterfalls with the mountain range as the backdrop. All it all the organization was impeccable and I would definitely recommend anyone to take up a trekking package with Nepal Hiking Team, and if you do, remember to hit up Suraj."

            "review": "Nepal Hiking Team Deliver Excellence Again. I and a group of friends hiked in Nepal to Everest Base Camp and Cho La (pass) with The Nepal Hiking Team in May of 2016, and my son and I continued with the Nepal Hiking Team to trek to Everest Advances Base Camp via Tibet in June 2016.Both adventures were excellent, and the organisation and performance of the Nepal Hiking Team in arranging and carrying out the trek was of the highest order. I have trekked with them before on a number of occasions and I find that their performance just gets better and better.Their advice in planning and preparing for these treks was spot on - any question I asked was answered promptly and fully, and this was very useful for advising others in the group and helping us prepare ourselves for the treks. Gunga was our main in country contact and he met us at the airport and took care of us with transfers and briefings for the trek. He arranged everything - accommodation in Kathmandu (a good hotel in Thamel the main trekking quarter), guides and porters and transport to Lukla, the start of the trek. Our guide was Bhim, a tough and experienced man who was brilliant at assessing our physical and mental condition on the trek, and adjusting to ensure we all achieved our goals with enjoyment and satisfaction. One member of the group suffered altitude sickness. Bhim was very caring and shepherded the person as far as they were able to go, with medication and adjusting the schedule without detriment to others in the group. Bhim and Gunga organised the persons evacuation by helicopter when it became clear his condition was not improving. Again, their performance in this emergency was fantastic, and very reassuring for all concerned.It was a wonderful trek and we were able to leave everything to Nepal Hiking Team with confidence in them delivering.The trek to Advanced Base Camp via Tibet was likewise a very well organised and operated event. Personally I was pretty cautious about the trek, mainly the unknown emergency support facilities and the quality of the Tibetan guides (you have to employ one, that's the rules). The Nepal Hiking Team sourced all our requirements in Tibet, accommodation, guide, trekking permits etc, including arranging visas and flights to Lhasas - the whole lot. Also, Gunga sent Bhim as an extra (Nepalese) guide and this was really great because we knew him, and he is very skilled. This is the sort of care and consideration the Nepal Hiking Team puts into their arrangements, and I for one appreciated it very much. Again, with Bhim's help and guidance we were able to be flexible but still achieve our goals - a yak carrying our sleeping bags and tent fell through the ice on a glacier, and although rescued in good shape, it caused a delay and potentially threatened our schedule. Bhim consulted with us and suggested a changed schedule that was able to get us to Advanced Base Camp and back within our original time frame. Still a tough trek, but we got to see Mt Everest (as we call it) up close - a dream come true!So I have no hesitation in recommending The Nepal Hiking Team to any one contemplating a trek or other adventure in Nepal or Tibet. I have travelled with them on four occasions now, and they are great."

We were greeted by Ganga at the airport with a warm welcome. Ganga is a lovely genuine guy and wants you to feel comfortable. We were taken to our hotel and ran through the intinerary. The hotel was perfect and in a fab location, just at the top of the Thamel and everything from restaurants, shops, bars, German bakeries, cafes etc right on your doorstep. Our hotel jn Pohkara is was an excellent location aswell! The trek was the perfect amount of time for us! Our guide, Paban, looked after us from start to finish. He was very patient with us, a lovely guy and he had a real passion for trekking which was lovely to see. Couldn't have asked for a nicer guide! Our porter Lalman was also lovely and helped us along the way aswell! We felt very comfortable with them and we had an awesome time! We stayed in lovely guest/tea houses along the way which are standard but authentic and added to the whole trekking experience. All the guest houses are the same standard, some better than others. So if you're looking for luxury accommodation then maybe trekking isn't for you. Nepal Hiking Team choose the best ones and ones they have been using time and time again. We took the Poonhill Trek in August. I would recommend Nepal Hiking Team to everyone, amazing company and well run by lovely people! You'd be silly not to choose them! "

Nepal Hiking Team's seamless planning of lovely accommodations and in-country travel took all the anxiety out of navigating in Nepal. The staff and guides worked with us to adjust the itinerary as we requested and always provided plenty of choices so we could customize our experience. Nepal Hiking Team's Balaram, Ganga, and our guide, Bhim, treated us like family, and we felt well taken care of all along. They embody the local knowledge one hopes to find when traveling abroad and do so with professionalism and great communication. The Himalayas are stunning, the villages of Nepal are beautiful, and trekking with Nepal Hiking Team added even more joy to the trip and greatly enhanced our experience. We would certainly come to this organization for future expeditions.

This spring in March I have decided that by the end of April I want to go to Nepal and Bhutan for a one month travel. Usually such a trip needs to be planned in advance but for Nepal Hiking Team it was no problem to set all the necessities within a few days and off I went!My itinerary included: 3 days in Kathmandu, 20 day Mustang trekking with the Tiji festival and 5 day trip to Bhutan.And from the very beginning and warm welcome at the airport to the last goodbye I was pampered! Everything was well organized and I didn\u2018t have to take care of anything! I was just enjoying my time and if I had some suggestions or wishes the team was very flexible and change the programm according to me.The Mustang trek was amaizing and as it was my first trek ever I was very happy that it was not so dificult \u2013 average time of walking was arround 6 hours per day. My guide Santa was a professional taking a good care of me, always aware of my limits and capabilities and as also I found out with a huge experience in all kinds of situations. He is familiar with the whole area and he\u2019s also well known by the locals. Together with the porter Yamu they made a excelent couple to travel with and always with a big smile on thein face. After we\u2019ve reached the city of Lo-Manthang we stayed by the locals at their house which was an unforgetable experience and made me feel that I know Lo-Manthang since ever. The festival itself was also magical and I\u2019ve also enjoyed a lot the one day trip on a horse back to the Jhong cave.After this wonderful trek we\u2019ve return back to Kathmandu and the very next day I had my flight to Bhutan where another guide Dorji and his driver accompanied me during my whole stay. I was amazed by their knowledge of the history and culture of Bhutan and also they were very flexible if I wanted to make changes in my program. It was sad at the end to say goodbye to Balaram and Ganga but I\u2019m sure it was not the last time I was traveling with them and I can highly recommend to travel with Nepal Hiking Team!"

TREK TO UPPER MUSTANG REGION OF NEPAL WITH NEPAL HIKING TEAM \u2013 APRIL 2016With a friend we recently completed a most amazing trek to the restricted Upper Mustang Region of Nepal. We did the trek with the Nepal Hiking Team, a Nepalese trekking company based in Kathmandu. This was my second trek to the Upper Mustang region with Nepal Hiking Team. Both times that I have used them I found that my trips were well organized and everything was done very efficiently. On my first trek to the region I did the standard up and back trek to Lo Mathang, the ancient capital city of the region. The trek was a wonderful adventure that made me well aware of a very different region of Nepal, instead of mountains and forest, it is an area of high desert, ancient Tibetan culture and villages.On returning home I read the book, Mustang, A Lost Tibetan Kingdom, written by Michel Peissel. A book which he wrote in the 1960s about the people and his travels throughout of the region. At this time I became more and more interested in returning for another trek to the Upper Mustang region to one of the less travelled and a different area.I decided that I wanted to return to Upper Mustang. I contacted Nepal Hiking Team and Ganga by email with regards to a trek to the Upper Mustang region. I wanted a trek that was different than my previous trek. This time I proposed a trek to the area on the east side of the Kali Gandaki River. The first part of the trek up to Lo Manthang, would be up the west side of the Kali Gandaki River and then back down the east side. which would be a much harder and more difficult route. I also wanted to visit Ramchang Cave Monastery as well as Drakmar and the 8th century Ghar Gekarn our way to Lo Manthang. On the return to Jomson overnight at Yara and day trek to Luri Gompa and the Tashi Kambum. From Yara trek and overnights in Tangge and Tetang. From Tetang we would trek to Jharkot via Muktinath. From Jharkot to Johmson we would go via the old Bonn village of Lupra.I emailed Nepal Hiking Team with my proposal, Ganga responded to our proposal and questions. All the emails that I sent were always responded too within a few minutes. He accepted our proposed program which met our requests and all our requirements. I made air bookings and made the booking for the trek. We had to make some changes to our program because of air flight changes, the program and hotel booking changes were made with no problems.Despite that our flight arrival in Kathmandu had been delayed by 6 hours we met on by our porter, Santa, he was standing outside the arrival area with a large visible sign, he assisted us through the crowd and took us to the waiting car. He was also very helpful at the hotel. We met with Ganga the next morning who gave us a comprehensive brief and answered questions about our trek. Ganga with our guide came to the hotel the next day to deliver, Nepal Hiking Team duffle bags and a sleeping bag and jacket for my companion, we were able to keep the duffle bags. Both the sleeping bag and jacket were in good condition and suitable for cold weather.On our departure from Kathmandu our guide took us by car to the bus for our trip to Pokhara, on arrival in Pokhara he got us a taxi and to the hotel. The next day we had an early morning flight to Jomson.On arrival in Jomson we met Vishnu, our porter. He would be carrying our two duffle bags. After a late breakfast we set out.Without going into all the details of the trek. The region on the west side of the Kali Gandaki River is very isolated high desert with very few people, other than in the small villages. We only saw two other trekkers between Lo Manthang and Muktinath and an occasional goat herder. The trails had many long steep uphills and downhills, at times were narrow and sometimes sand covered, often the downhills were covered in loose rock scree. We did see the occasional coloured trail marker and sign. We found that Santa was a very excellent guide, he was familiar with the areas that we trekked, he looked after us very well, always assuring about or safety and wellbeing. Our porter, Vishnu, was outstanding and strong. Both the porter and the guide were wonderful people and were great to be with. They had fresh fruit for us at our evening meal every night which they carried throughout the trek.I hope that someday that I will be able to return to Nepal to trek again and certainly I would book and go with Nepal Hiking Team. I would highly recommend that anyone considering travels to Nepal for a trek or just a visit to contact them.Thanks again Nepal Hiking TeamGarfield Saunders (Age 77)Victoria BC, Canada"

I must say, the arrangements and support provided by the Nepal Hiking Team (NHT) run by Ganga & Balaram Thapa and their team had a massive contribution to our success. The entire team is very courteous and prompt on responding to emails ever since I first contacted Ganga in Dec 2013. They patiently answered all my questions and even gave me references of their clients to get first hand feedback. Since the time we came out of the Kathmandu airport to the time we departed back to our homes, Ganga and his team were there to help us all through the way. Their choice of hotel in Kathmandu (we stayed at Gaju Suites in Thamel area in Kathmandu) as well as the Tea houses through out the trek was spot on. NHT also has a very experienced team of guide. Our guide was Lal Gurung who did a fantastic job through out the trek. He knew the trails very well and had a amazing ability to motivate us with the least amount of words and know when to push us. I would thoroughly recommend Nepal Hiking Team as the right agency to plan your Nepal trek. I am sure I would use their services again when I return back to Nepal"

First time I was traveling with my friend in December 2014 - we had a perfect 20 days\u2019 holiday in Nepal. We were packed with activities: trekking through ABC, visiting Pokhara, Lumbini, Chitwan National Park and rafting in Trisuli River. We also toured all three Durbar Squares and other world heritage locations in Kathmandu Valley. I returned to Nepal this year during March-April as a solo traveller, trekking Jiri-EBC-Lukla route for 3 weeks. NHT organised everything for the two trips. As directors of the company both Ganga and Balaram were very professional and efficient from beginning to the end. Their swift email responses were very impressive. NHT's competitive pricing and flexibility to modify itineraries also made them standing out. The personal welcome and farewell at airport by either Ganga or Balaram made us feeling their sincerity. All trekking guides, porters, local tour guides, rafting guide and drivers provided for us by NHT were very friendly, knowledgeable and provided excellent service. We were very happy with all hotels provided for us as well. I strongly recommended NHT if you like to have a worry free trip in Nepal."

I have just returned from my 3rd trip to Nepal and my 3rd trek with Nepal Hiking Team and their attention to detail right throughout cannot be faulted. They cater for all and their guides and porters do a fantastic job.I first used Nepal Hiking Team in 2011 when I went on my own with a guide on the Gokyo, Cho La, EBC trek. From the time I touched down in Kathmandu, crossing Cho La and up to EBC and back It couldn't have gone better which inspired me to return in 2012 with my 12 year old son to embark on the Everest High Passes trek. Again NHT where absolutely fantastic ensuring everything went well and leaving no stone unturned. Our guide, DC Raj made all the right decisions when it mattered most which meant we had great success crossing Cho La again, Rengo La, reaching EBC and the top of Kalar Patar and Gokyo Ri. I new my son (who still talks about it as if it was yesterday) and I where in the best hands and the results speak for themselves. Jacki and I have now just returned from successfully completing the Annapurna Circuit including crossing the Thorong La at 5416m. We are both in our 50's now and it was DC Raj again who guided us throughout the trek with no problems at all. Ganga and Balaram do an outstanding job managing your holiday from the time you make your first enquiry and to the time you depart thinking about when you'll be back again. We will certainly be heading back to the beautiful country of Nepal and without question we'll be using Nepal Hiking Team for any type of adventure we choose. They are the best.Tom & JackiNewcastleAustralia"

Although the itinerary they provided us said that 3 guest houses during the trek should have hot showers.When my husband had altitude sickness at Gorek Shep the guide Ganga took care of him very well.

Finding Nepal Hiking Team on the Internet helped allay the fears immediately. Initially I had another trekking company in mind. Ganga soon won me over with his prompt email responses and Skype calls. He was very willing to work with me as an individual with a few concerns I had. His service is exceptional. He will bend over backward to ensure the client has a flawless experience. I had exactly 33 days in Nepal. I wanted to do the Everest Base Camp and the Annapurna Circuit. He arranged everything. The package is comprehensive including meet and greet at the airport complete with lei greeting, flights into and out of Lukla, transportation to and from the Annapurna region, day tour of Kathmandu, lodging, most meals, and the wonderful support services of my guide, Ram. I simply could not have been more pleased. My guide, Ram, was way way more than just a guide. He was also a personal assistant and friend. He took the time to point out points of interest along the way. He was willing to engage in discussions on Nepalese culture. Lastly, when I succumbed to a nasty respiratory infection a few days before the end of my Annapurna trek, I found Ganga and Ram very sympathetic. They were willing to rearrange the last few days of my trek allowing me to return to Kahmandu to recover before returning home. I am very very pleased with the all the personal service provided to me. I recommend them highly and look forward to booking with them again."

It is my pleasure to recognize the outstanding service the owners and staff of \u201cNepal Hiking Team\u201d provided me during my trip to Nepal in April \u2013 May, 2016. The co-owner Ganga is a very professional and sincere business man. He put my interests and concerns first. He has good relationships with other business professionals (i.e. hotel managers) which helped facilitate great tours and hotel accommodations. I want to also share my gratitude for Ganga and my guides (Anuj and Nararyan) for their immense support in helping me find my luggage which was lost for 3.5 days. I was so happy that we were able to get to the airport in time to claim my luggage on the last flight that came in before I left for the Everest Base Camp trek. I want to express my great appreciation for my Everest Base Camp guide, Nararyan. I successfully reached Everest Base Camp and could have never done it without Nararyan\u2019s assistance. I have a weak left ankle and poor balance. I found Nararyan to be a very patient, compassionate, positive, and considerate gentleman and a joy to be around. He went above and beyond to prevent me from getting injured. Nararyan kept a close eye on me at all times and every time the trek was challenging he was right there to offer extra assistance without me asking. My climb to Everest Base Camp was one of the most fascinating experiences in my life and it will live with me forever! A big applause goes to \u201cNepal Hiking Team\u201d and my guide, Nararyan.

I think i would have asked tons and tons of questions but no matter what, he always got back to me with such patience. My trip was organized very well and i was very happy as everything was done efficiently. A very special thanks to the best guide in the world, Deepak. I don't think i can find a better one. I traveled solo and you were always there from advising me on things to buy and also taking care of me and all my queries during my trek. When i had blisters and walked with so much pain, you always made jokes to make me feel better. Every time i come to Nepal, i'm definitely only going to request for you to be my guide! Definitely the best. Nepal hiking team is amazing and everyone showed more care than interest in money which i found very amazing and different from other trekking companies. They always prioritized my safety, food and made sure i was always contented with everything. They definitely give a very good service and their prices are also of the best. I had met a few people on the trek as well and Nepal hiking team had the best price and package to offer. Ganga and Balaram personally sent and fetch me from the airport and they always had lovely greetings and farewells. My trip went very well because i made the decision to go with Nepal Hiking team. Its really important to find the right trekking company and i especially recommend them as they were more interested in my well being and to enjoy my stay in Nepal more than anything else. I would definitely come bk to Nepal for more treks and will choose a package with Nepal hiking team. I did ABC and EBC back to back with much ease because of my fantastic guide Deepak as well as the other arrangements done by Ganga and i am very happy with everything. There was full transparency from the start to the end. No hidden agendas or anything. Nepal Hiking is a trustable, honourable company and i would recommend to all."

Neither I or my family have ever been on an organised adventure holiday but going trekking in the Himalayas with two daughters aged 5 and 10 we felt needed some back up. Not so much the difficulty but the potential remoteness on one of these treks led us to this decision. Mr Ganga and his team were truly professional on all counts, very responsive in dealing with our requests and providing exceptional attention to detail from start to finish. We were even provided an additional guide should we have problems with the children but we only nearly needed this once when our youngest was sick for a day. Accomodation on route was never disapointing and the food was as good as you could except on a trek with the team always there to support and provide assistance where necessary. We got to Annapurna Base camp and back as a team and we will always remember this and a big thank you to the Nepal Hiking Team. A lot of respect for the Nepalese after a big earthquake and severe petrol shortages to keep smiling and making it happen. Thank you guys."

Every question was answered, i found Ganga very quick to respond to emails and i had confidence in him before i even arrived! Our trek was well organised, our guide Bim was helpful, informative and reliable. Our porters Chandra and Orkeil were friendly and all were easy to get along with. Nothing was too much trouble. I would have no qualms booking another trip with NHT and in fact hope to book one with them to Annapurna in the not too distant future.

The manager Ganga and guide Arjun met us at our hotel the day before to deliver bags, down jackets and sleeping bags that we would use, and introduce themselves. Arjun flew with us from Kathmandu to Lukla and was amazing at sorting out all the paperwork and baggage so we could just relax and avoid the hectic crowds fighting to get checked in. The guide Arjun and the porter Gobinda were really friendly and spoke great English (as well as other languages) and were great company on the trek. They made us feel very safe and were fun to hang out with in the evenings too. When we felt tired and sick from altitude on 2 occasions they adjusted the itinerary to allow us to rest and even managed to make up for the lost days later on in the trek so we still got to go to EBC! Arjun and Gobinda were clearly very experienced on the mountain - everyone knew them! Overall the trip was amazing, Nepal Hiking Team were extremely professional and I would highly recommend them to anyone thinking of trekking anywhere in Nepal."

I was met at Kathmandu airport and taken to my hotel, the Gaju Suite Hotel in Thamel.Next morning a car collected me and my guide/porter and took us to Besisahar from where we took a jeep to the trek start at Syange.From there me and my guide trekked for the next 9 days from Syange to Jomson via the Thorong La Pass. From Jomson we flew to Pokhara, had a night there, then took the tourist bus back to Kathmandu where I spent another couple of nights in the Gaja Suite Hotel before being transported back to the airport for my flight home.

Chose NHT due to the tremendously positive reviews on them, the professionalism of their website, and the quick response I got from Ganga when I sent an initial inquiry via their website -- he phoned me within a few hours, apparently as soon as morning had come round to Nepal (given the time difference between North America and Nepal). He was extremely helpful and responsive from the start, all the way through completion of our trek and last couple of days back in Kathmandu.

As a number of people have inquired about the Annapurna/Dhaulagiri Panorama trek, here\u2019s a brief outline of the route:You follow the exact same route to Ghorepani/Poon Hill but then you deviate from there.As you head downhill from Ghorepani the next morning, after 30-45 min. you take a trail to your right that leads down into the valley instead of following the normal trail out toward the main Annapurna Circuit trail.This trail descends down into the valley bottom through villages and rice fields from where you catch another trail that takes you zig-zagging up the ridge to Khopra Dande (3600m) on the opposite side of the valley.At Khopra Dande, you\u2019ll spend the night and have the option of doing a full-day hike the next day to a lake (Khayer Lake) at the foot of Annapurna South. If the weather is good and you have the time, I would take at least one full day at Khopra to enjoy the views and hike around farther up the ridge.Leaving Khopra, there is a trail that follows the ridge line down (a different trail than the one you came up), passing through other villages and finally arriving at Tatopani, which is along the main Annapurna Circuit route.From Tatopani, it\u2019s easy to catch a bus back to Pokhara (although you\u2019ll have to switch buses at some point and possibly share a microvan). Tatopani also has outdoor developed hot springs, but don\u2019t get too excited."

First off I'm so glad we chose Nepal Hiking Team as I had a lot of concern about who to travel with in Nepal. Ganga, Balaram, and our guide Arun were very professional and caring throughout. A very large amount of snow had fallen while visiting, and our guide Arun did an amazing job of keeping us safe while still allowing for great exploration.We started early and made our way out of Namche. The initial climb is quite steep, but Arun helped pace us so we didn't exhaust ourselves. The view as you make your way towards the Everest View Hotel is just breathtaking, so we made plenty of stops for pictures. Throughout the hike we learned a huge amount from Arun about the local customs and Buddhist traditions. We stopped for tea at Everest View, took pictures, and enjoyed the scenery. Everest, Lhotse, and Ama Dablam made for the perfect panorama.Around 11:00 we headed down the hill to Khumjung for lunch. We stopped at a local tea house for what I consider the absolute best pizza we had while in the Khumbu. Not an easy feat considering the altitude, but regardless of wherever we went the food was always tasty. After lunch we got to see the school that Edmund Hillary established before making our way back towards Namche. It was a phenomenal day trip, and I was so glad we got experience the best of the Himalayas with Arun's help. Mark F."

The logistics in the planning of the Everest Base Camp trek along with our 1-day tour in Kathmandu with the Nepal Hiking Team was well executed and coordinated. Ganga was polite, warm and responsive when we emailed for an itinerary on the Kathmandu Valley tours of the Durbar Squares and temples. When we arrived in Kathmandu, Ganga was very welcoming. Ganga and his team invited us to the Samsara Resort hotel and explained in detail the plan for the next few days. After a great day of temples, cultural sites and markets, we headed off next for our trek to the Everest Base Camp and Island Peak. Price is very competitive and our guide Arjun and porter Yamu were great. If you are planning any sort of adventure in Nepal, I'd recommend giving the Nepal Hiking team a call for some advice. They also sorted us out with bus tickets to Pokhara and transfers to the airport. They can coordinate any trip in Nepal and make it happen! We'll definitely be returning to Nepal soon."

I am so glad that I chose Nepal Hiking Team as my tour company to see all the city sights again. The day tour in Kathmandu was well-organised from the outset. I was transported in comfort by private car to each of the sights, and then given plenty of time at each place to soak up the culture with my friendly and informative tour guide only too happy to answer all my questions and provide me with clear details of the history, etc. Congratulations to Ganga and his team on running a fantastic tour company."

Among all companies I sent emails for information, Ganga was the first to respond, like an old friend. I was surprised that they allowed the payment on the spot as usually the guests need to pay a deposit. Thanks for his information to make my first backpack trekking trip well prepared. It's also my first time traveling alone. In Nepal, everything was arranged smoothly and transparent. I was totally trouble free and can simply enjoy the trip. Ganga and his team made me feel like home. I think I wouldn't mind to do it again as a solo traveler. Particularly I want to express my gratitude to my local guide, Ram. He is such a generous and kind person, taking care of me on the road and being patient with my changing plans. He was also ready to reach out to help the others with his expertise on trekking and mountain climbing. He made the trip so enjoyable and memorable! Thanks! I was really touched when he even prepared fruits after the dinner. How sweet! On the way back, Ganga visited me twice to ensure everything was fine and saw off me at the airport. I don't feel like dealing with a professional company, but friends. Sure I'll go back for EBC next year with them!"

We selected them because they were in the top 3 prices (but not the cheapest) and Ganga was so extremely responsive and thorough in his English email replies. He also gave us real people that we could email and ask them questions about their experiences. We had Prakash Rai as our guide and he was such a pleasurable person to be around.

At first, we were naturally apprehensive about wiring money to a complete stranger half-way around the world based on a promise typed up on e-mails so we relied on testimonials from others. However, we trusted the testimonials, went with our guts and were very pleased with the outcome. Excluding the hotel arrangement, which we made separately, Ganga made all the tour arrangements. He personally greeted us at the airport upon arrival. Khumar the tour guide was amazingly patient and knowledgeable about the sites around Kathmandu, its history, palace and temple designs and architecture, culture, etc. The driver was very cool during the traffic jams and craziest Nepali driving style. And at the end of our visit, Ganga joined us for the cultural dinner and accompanied us to the airport the following day. He also arranged the Everest flyby in a way that the entire day was maximized for other activities. By the way, NHT price was also very competitive. Without any hesitation, I would highly recommend Ganga and NHT. Credit Ganga for his arrangements and attention to detail, we had an excellent but limited time in Kathmandu to the extent that we will contact him again should we return to Nepal."

It could get quite hot and humid if you went off season. By the second day we didn't want to do the trips in the valley, we told our guide Pranav (pronounced as Pranob) - let's do something else where it's cooler. So he took us to Nagharkhot and it was just amazing! Pranav is really good at what he does. He is very knowledgable (I meant literally- he has a Master degree in Tourism), friendly and has the right attitude for his job. We were lucky we got the best tour guide, for the trip! He took us to all the right places, he was very understanding when we changed our trip at the last minute. At the end of the trip he became a buddy to us. I would recommend this tour company just for Pranav if not for anything else! You might find it a little pricey if you book last minute but if you air your concerns to Mr.Simkhada, he would be willing to reduce the price.

We had a very magical and culturally enriching experience in Nepal thanks to Google Treks."

            "review": "Organised Nepal. Prakash at Google Treks organised a very efficient 5 day tour through Nepal that was exactly tailored to what I wanted. On arrival make sure you have US $25 for the visa, fill a new immigration form (not the one they give you on the flight), and make sure you have a passport sized photo.Prakash made sure everything happened as it should and his drivers are all courteous and safe. He selected a very nice hotel for me, which was also exactly what I wanted.I did a one day tour of Kathmandu and the city suffers from bad traffic so allow for a considerable time to be sat in a dusty vehicle on noisy roads wherever you go. The 1 day tour in Kathmandu was great-ask for Pranav Thapa, who is an entertaining and informative guide. Prakash organised a transfer to Green Park at Chitin by air. The domestic airport is a little old fashioned (there is wifi) and listen out for the flight announcements, they won't let you miss your flight however. A 45l back pack is OK for cabin baggage even though you will have to sit with it between your knees.Green Park at Chitwin is a new lodge with rooms for around 50-60 people with pool and bar. The apartments are very nice with wifi and a/c, the food is good (if you are ok with Nepalese/Indian food - there is some western as well) The tours were all good, the best was the canoe ride - don't miss it. The elephant ride in the jungle is a must, however be aware you will be very lucky to see a tiger (the elephants have a habit of snorting on themselves, and the passengers, trying to stay cool - what can you do, just have a shower when you get back to the lodge). I also had a bird watching walk with Binod Chaudhary, who was the lodge guide for all the tours and was entertaining, courteous and knew his stuff.For International departures there is very little after security and the seating is basic."

I was for the most part a solo traveller but Google treks guide bigger groups as well. Every question you have is answered ahead of your arrival and Prakash will help you with any visa, currency exchange, or accommodation question on the ground. I also was able to borrow a sleeping bag from Google Treks which was useful as I didn't own one that was warm enough for the frigid mountain nights up there.My guide was Dipendra, who was incredibly dedicated to get me to Base Camp safe and sound, often encouraging, and full of information about the Himalayas. Whenever I felt unwell from Altitude, I was knew I was in good hands with Dipen's professionalism, reassurance and experience. Definitely request Dipen as your guide!Our porter Asish Rai was also a wonder, always carting our bags up the mountain with a smile! Polite and friendly at all times! Overall a highly organised and pleasurable experience. I got to Basecamp and had an experience of a lifetime! Highly recommended!"

After days of waiting for the weather at Lukla to let a plane through and no end in sight, some of our group could not spare extra days to wait, so Prakash arranged to have us to the equally awesome Annapurna trek, arranging things in such a quick order we didn't even have to leave the airport to get to Pokhara! Prakash helped us to arrange to bring things from the hotel to the airport so we could get one or two things for our different itinerary. We had an amazing trek to Annapurna Base Camp and then down to the jungle in Chitwan. A bit of advice on Chitwan, first, March/April is the peak time to visit because the grass is short so that animals are easier to see. Secondly, please ask Prakash to omit the elephant ride- we didn't realize how bad it was until we did it, but they jam 5 people on an elephant back that is not as strong as you think it is, and the mahout constantly whacks the elephant on the head (the elephant often cries out) to keep obeying his command. Really, it's not worth a spot on your bucket list, just don't do it, please don't support his industry, I really regret doing it. Anyways, other than the elephant ride, the whole trip was awesome. The country was (and as of this writing still is) reeling from a severe fuel shortage but Prakash managed to get us where we needed to be despite it, and did everything in his power to make it a great experience for us. Other people have mentioned this, but Prakash makes you feel like you are his only clients in the world and your happiness is very important to him."

I would of liked it to be a bit slower so I could enjoy the scenery a bit more. I did not have trekking pole which you definitely must have with you! You don't necessarily need them on the way up, but on the way down is a killer. I ended up hurting my knee on the way down due to the decline. The guide as well as the porters were so amazing with me. They even made me bamboo sticks to use while I hobbled down the mountain. We went in September/October time and it was hott! The only time I needed cold gear was the last day on the top of Annapurna because I packed too much cold gear for this time of year and would of liked to bring more short sleeve shirts and socks! I would recommend this trek for anyone! Beautiful country and I did not feel unsafe to travel here at all even after the earthquake! I hope to return to Nepal for climb Mt Everest!!"

Special mention and thanks for the skilled guides, who helped to learn about Nepalese culture and its great nature. I really enjoyed the order of my trip: first more active parts rafting and 5days hiking in Annapurna, then Pokhara for 2 nights including a city tour, Jungle Safari for 2 nights and Kathmandu for 2 nights including a city tour and a farewell dinner. Although, I traveled alone to Nepal, it was nice to join other customers for the tours and activities."

Once we arrived in Nepal, Google Treks looked after us amazingly well. Even loaning us Nepalese Rupee not once but twice with out any concern. Why twice you may ask??Jet air lost our bags in transit!! This is where Google Treks and Prakash really made our trip, Not only did he loan us thousands of rupees until the next day but he was in contact with the airport and the airline constantly, trying to track down our bags just so we could enjoy our trip to Nepal.The guides were amazing as well - Shout out to Prabak! We repeat - you may find cheaper, but you won't find better!We strongly recommend Prakash and his team for Nepal - 5 stars!PS - Nepal is completely safe to travel even after the earthquakes."

Last December my partner and I decided we needed a change of scenery and purchased an online deal, packed our bags and traveled to Nepal to do the Everest Basecamp Trek. We weren't sure what to expect when we arrived, having done next to no research on Google Trek or the actual base camp trek.Thankfully, Prakash and his team turned out to be the perfect choice for us. Prakash picked us up from the airport (which itself is an experience!) and took us safely to our hotel. He walked us through our travel plans for the next 2 weeks and helped us purchase all the trekking gear we would need while in Thamel, Kathmandu.I always felt very safe with Google trek in charge. I even felt comfortable enough to hand over to them $400AUD to change over. The trek itself was amazing and I cant wait to go back. I think we had the most popular tour guide and porter on the mountain. Everywhere we went people would call out to them and ask them for advice on different matters.After the trek, we decided to extend our stay (to recover and rest our legs!) and Google Trek was able to arrange travel and accommodation for us at Pokarah.Overall I had the experience of my lifetime and have no problem recommending Google Trek to anyone. NOTE - It's taken me a few months to get around to writing this review. I was prompted by the recent earthquakes in Nepal. My partner and I saw the work that Prakash and his team have been doing to support the Nepalese people in recover efforts and decided to make a donation directly to them.Trust is must when you are traveling through unfamiliar territory and Google Trek are honest and reliable."

            "review": "Fun Langtang Trekking. We booked an 11 day Langtang trekking trip with Google Treks Nepal for March 2015.We had never been to Nepal before so having the basics like airport pickup, pre-arranged accommodation and the arrival-evening orientation were key benefits for us as first timers. These logistics were managed by Mr. Prakash - the friendly general manager of the outfit - and generally executed by his local Kathmandu staff.During the trek we were shepherded by our capable, friendly, and appropriately chillaxed guide, Asok. With no mobile network along the route, there is no way for him check in with management so he completely ran the show for the 7 days that we were under way. He managed to keep the 7 people in our group together en route despite different paces of some of the Trekkers. What was especially nice for a trip like this is that he handled all of the dealings with accommodation along the way, doing most of the thinking for us, making it possible for us to really just focus on the experience, the beautiful nature, the occasional tricky foothold and just relaxing in the evenings. Real back-to-basics stuff. The best test of any company's customer service is how they respond when things go sideways and how they accommodate special requests. Due to the fallout from a crash landing at the airport a day prior to arrival which closed the airport for 4 days (no serious injuries though), Prakash was forced to deal with incoming Trekkers from different parts of the world and uncertain arrival dates at the last minute. He setup a Facebook group which helped everyone stay abreast of developments and changing plans in a situation otherwise devoid of good information from the airlines and officials. He ultimately delayed the start of the trek and shuffled around some of the planned itinerary to accommodate all of us. We understand he also allowed one of the would-be members of our group to reschedule their trek for 6 months later. The Facebook thing was so useful that I'd encourage Mr. Prakash to set one up for all his trekking groups in the future.Despite the difficult circumstance around our arrival, the trip came off well and we'd easily recommend working with Google Treks Nepal.NOTES:- although mentioned in our tour description, sherpas are optional and cost quite a bit extra and we opted against - if you find you overpack (don't plan to carry more than 7-10 kilos) it is possible to leave items at the various tea houses along the way- sleeping bags are cheap to rent - around 1 euro per day per person. They were nice and clean. Mr Prakash handled pick up and drop off so it was very easy for us- yoga and meditation were mentioned and implied as part of the itinerary but in fact these are 'self-led', meaning if you are already into yoga or meditation, you're free to do that on your own in your free time, but there's not like a yogi or anything- we visited the cheese factory and bought super tasty yak cheese, but the factory is only in operation in May to maybe September when the grass is green so no operations to see for us- both monasteries along the way were closed when we got there, (blame us for being slow), so we didn't meet any monks but the exterior and grounds were still beautiful in a minimalist way and made for some great photos"

Car, drivers, sherpas, porters, hotels, food..... Not only we completed the 12 days Everest Base Camp safely, living in warm hotels (while I hear others complaining about cold hotels), we were also well introduced into Kathmandu - taken to the world heritage sites in Kathmandu, the birth place of Buddha in Lumbini, and elephant safari in Chitwan National Park. My daughter enjoys her trekking so much that she wants to go back again this year! Thank you Prakash, Pasang and the wonderful team!"

If you plan to do any kind of activity in Nepal you can trustfully rely on Prakash as a coordinator. I bought a ticket for trekking in the Langtang Valley via Groupon Germany and from my arrival in Kathmandu up to my departure about 3 weeks later everything went smoothly. Hotels, sightseeing and transportation in Kathmandu were well organised by Prakash who was always available via phone and was taking good care of us. Two day after my arrival we drove to Syraphrubesi (the starting point of our trekking tour) together with Raj our guide. Raj is a very likable and polite guy and it was definitely fun to trek with him. We were pretty lucky with the weather and we rarely met other tourists on our way. Despite the trekking tour we had booked via the Groupon deal we asked Prakash to organise wild water rafting and and a trip to Chitwan National park for the time after our return from Langtang to Kathmandu. Both of these activities were great fun and again extremely well prepared by Prakash. Prakash took good care of us until our departure, even joining us when we had to drive to Kathmandu airport at 6.15 a.m.I will definitely be booking any of my activities in Nepal via Prakash again whenever i return to this wonderful country."

We experienced some challenging weather and Pasang did a great job in ensuring we made it to Base Camp (and back down again). There were often times where there was no path to follow due to the snow, Pasang knew the area so well he would create his own (that other tour groups would follow).Throughout the trek, Prakash was on the phone regularly checking to make sure everything was going well. He also made himself available on a daily basis at Kathmandu to ensure we had everything we require. Additionally, due to the closure of Kathmandu airport, Prakash did everything possible to ensure we were able to get the first available flight when the airport reopened.I would have no issues in recommending Google Treks Nepal to anyone considering trekking in Nepal.

We immediately had a good feeling with him, because he gave us all the questions competently answered and gave us very helpful advice on the way. A large Parti of our trip we organized ourselves, such as the Annapurna Trek. Prakash organized for us the transport to the startpoint, a guided tour in the Mustang in between our selfguided Annapurna Trek. This required a good organization because the guide for the Mustangtrek has to appear at a agreed-upon date at agreed-upon location, all formalities must be completed and the tour must be exactly organized with fixed dates. In Nepal, things do not go strictly according to plan, and you can not rely on everyone and everything. With Prakash... it works! Reassuring it, if you can call someone in Nepal and get a competent service at a fair price. After the Annapurna- and Mustang Trek we traveled further into the South and after that we started an other extended hike in the Langtang Helambu area. Even with these trips we were given valuable advises and well organized transport for the journey to the starting- and endpoints of the treks and good hoteladvises and -bookings .

We were two couples planning the trek individually but due to the \"Festival of Lights\" (new year) all offices for getting the permits and TIMS were closed. So we went to Google Treks Nepal agency and got everything we need immediately by taking a porter (Jeep to Jiri, permits, TIMS, flight tickets for return from Lukla, accommodation, porter). The guys were very friendly and helpful. We got a very good porter (Harry) and had a wonderful time on our trek. Every ordered detail was perfectly organized and worked very well (Jeep, permits, flights, porter). The most important point was, we were still independent on our trek. So we decided on our own about the daily trek target and the lodge to stay. Nevertheless our porter Harry was a good advisor for the best lodge in town. During the trek his experiences helped to find the right decision about available options. His communication skills helped us to ease our whole trip. So we were very happy to have him along with us.The prices were reasonable but you should know that the first mentioned price is net. So they added 13% tax on it at the end. Concerning accommodation we would not include it next time because we were fixed to \"common rooms\" which means just the bed. In higher areas you have to pay for the shower separately. So it is better to decide on-site whether you save money taking the \"common room\" or to spend some more money to get a detached shower and toilet. The \"common room\" is much cheaper on-site anyway."

We had 5 members on our team, including a 70-year old man, and we had a 100% success rate of reaching Base Camp because of how amazing the Mountain Monarch guides were. From the warm welcome at the airport in Kathmandu to the dancing departure dinner in Lukla, and all the priceless memories in between- the guides and admin staff were absolutely wonderful to work with. I was impressed by the standard of organization and overall service provided, and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a positive and memorable once in a lifetime experience. The guides (Finjo & Mingma are the best!) were incredibly knowledgeable about the region, history and culture of Nepal and the Himalaya, and went out of their way to share the beauty of their homeland with us at each stop. Their knowledability made the experience exponentially better than if I had gone only knowing what I read online- they are locals after all! The team from the Mountain Monarchs tour know the best tea houses to stay in, and you can guarantee excellent food choices and sleeping amenities. Our tea houses were always very comfortable and friendly...a welcome sight after long days of walking :) Our wonderful (and STRONG) porters had our bags conveniently waiting for us at each tea house so that we could quickly change out of our boots at the end of the day. (P.s.I personally could not have completed this journey without our porters and I am very grateful!)The trip allowed for flexibility in the schedule (we wanted an extra day in Kathmandu and the team was very helpful in organizing this) and extremely well equipped for saftey. I had never been at altitude before so I was really nervous about experiencing AMS, but we had our blood oxygen and pressure checked regularly to ensure our bodies were coping with altitude. There was even an oxygen tank available if we felt that we needed it- at one point our guide even helped a trekker from another group so we knew we were in the best hands in the mountains. This trip to Mt Everest Base Camp was unbelievable and I thank Mountain Monarch for helping me achieve a lifetime goal. Again, I would HIGHLY recommend this tour group to anyone looking for an organized, fun, knowledgeable and high quality tour to the Himalayan region. I can't wait until my next trip :) Any questions please feel free to ask! "

Without Santos' 'encouragement', I wouldn\u2019t have got to see Everest.Everyone does well when things are going well \u2013 character is how you respond when things aren\u2019t going well - Dipen and Santos showed an awful lot of character. These two gentlemen did an amazing job. Dipen's knowledge of the area, religions, and customs was enlightening. Santos' sense of humor, smile and laugh lit up many rooms along the way. They made a good experience great!I commend Mountain Monarch on the 1 trekker 1 porter policy - this addresses a real problem in the area. At first I was amazed at the physical feats of strength and agility the porters displayed - when a couple of random porters removed their shirts one warm day I was horrified at the bruising on their backs - the 1 trekker 1 porter policy at Mountain Monarchs is well worth supporting, the other porters are carrying too much - to a point of being unhealthy/dangerous."

We did a fair bit of research before deciding on the trek and booking with Mountain Monarch and we are very happy with our choice! At the outset, their website was very helpful and provided good information on various treks. Subsequently, Mr. Pradip was quick to respond to our queries on email and phone, and these discussions helped us plan well for the trip, sitting far away from Nepal!Once in Nepal, we met our guide Arjun and our porters, and pretty much relied on them for the next few weeks during our hike. What we liked the most about Arjun and other Mountain Monarch guides we met en route was the professionalism, knowledge (of local conditions + medical), and friendliness. Arjun was well equipped with a good medical kit and knowledge of what conditions to look for in customers. Arjun was also extremely thorough in his daily briefings and flexible to adapt to our constraints and interests.We could also see Arjun and other guides constantly communicate on trail conditions, and update each other. We felt safe with that kind of meticulous planning. We were also impressed with the policy of \u201cOne porter for one customer\u201d, and we could see our porters were taken better care of by their management than that of porters from other companies.As we did a teahouse trek, we were reliant on Mountain Monarch for having a good local network to get us the better teahouse for stay or lunches, at the villages where it got crowded, and they did indeed met or exceed our expectations.As a result, we had very less to worry in terms of logistics, trail difficulty etc. and could just free our mind to enjoy a beautiful trekking experience, and the spectacular views. Staring from 800 m to crossing the Thorong La pass at 5,400 m, and climbing down to Muktinath at 3,800 m, while enjoying great views of Annapurna ranges, and diverse landscape each day, was an experience we will never forget in our life time. If we go back to Nepal for another adventure I the future, it would be with Mountain Monarch!"

This is a trek that combines the lodges of the Annapurna Circuit with some off-the-beat trekking and camping in remote areas. This is a great combination! We were with guide Vivek and four porters. Everything was very well organized, we only had to walk, eat and sleep. The gear was all in order, including very nice tents, sleeping bags and mats. The guidance was very good. For me, it was the first time I was in Nepal, and the first time at high altitude. I felt very safe and secure, the build-up was very gradual, and my health issues were dealt with expertly. Vivek was excellent company, he understood very well when it was necessary to guide actively, and when it was possible to relax and give us confidence and space. He also knew a lot about nature and culture. They were also flexible in the programme, although in general one has to say that their planning is probably best, since they know what they're doing! They're absolutely worth it!"

I really appreciated being in a small group of two as it meant that our plans were easily adapted to suit more of what we wanted along the way. CP was a wonderful guide, who really looked after us especially when my fellow trekker fell ill, as well as being hugely entertaining, friendly, caring and passionate about the trek, Nepal and life itself! Just when I thought nothing could top our day at Annapurna Base Camp (ABC), our last day during the Dashain festival was so beautiful that it caused a lump in my throat of gratitude and emotion especially when we were playing on the festival swing with the children after walking through the beautiful paddy fields with the endless variety of pretty butterflies and dragonflies.Pasun, our porter, was amazing; I just wish I could have spoken Nepalese to him! In comparison with another tour company (compared notes with another group post-trek), ours was much better organised and the service was far better and respectful with private transfers between KTM and Pokara. I definitely recommend MM and would use them again.A bit of advice: If you arrive in KTM one-two days prior to the trek, you could buy extra kit there on top of what MM provide. To remove leeches/keep leech free, get an old pop sock/part of a pair of tights, wrap up a ball of salt in it to make it a poultice to dab the leeches off. Walk in the middle of path wherever possible, staying away from vegetation and walk with a good distance between each other to avoid any leeches pinging off the branches disturbed by the person in front of you. Wear at least two socks and trousers tucked in, preferably with waterproof trousers on top and rub your legs/feet with salt.Definitely recommend hiking poles for the descent if you want to protect your knees."

I was a little anxious because it is monsoon season in July and was hoping the rains wouldn't dampen our whole trip. From our first contact, Pradip answered my many questions quickly and patiently. He customized our trip to include trekking, a jungle visit to Chitwan, a morning flight to see Mount Everest and a quick cultural tour of Kathmandu. It was a jam packed 6 day trip! Our guide for the week was Dipen Rai and we don't have enough good things to say about him! His English is excellent and local knowledge extensive. He met us at the airport and took excellent care of us for the rest of our trip. He handled all of our trip details with ease and we all enjoyed his company along the way, especially our 8-year old son.  The trekking was an easy hike from Kande up to the Australian Camp then down to Dhampus and Phedi. Each day was only a 2 hour (max) walk, very do-able with the kids. Mountain Monarch provided sleeping bags, fleece liner, down jacket and a rain poncho as well as a huge duffle bag to put all of our gear in. We were fortunate that it didn't rain while we were trekking as the stone steps and path would have been very slippery in the rain. For the trek we also had an assistant guide, Amrit and 2 porters Romesh and Dashvil. They were also great guys although they didn't speak a lot of English and we don't speak any Nepalese! My son's favourite part of the trip was playing cards with the guys after the day's trek was done:)After 3 days of trekking we drove to Chitwan. Our driver (also called Dipen) was also excellent along the crazy roads from Pokhara to Chitwan then to Kathmandu. We enjoyed seeing the rhinos in Chitwan however the long drive (5 hours from Pokhara and 7 hours to Katmandu) ate into our sightseeing time. In hindsight I think we would have rather done more trekking. On our last morning in Kathmandu we went on a flight to see Mount Everest. We were once again lucky with the weather as these flights don't run if the visibility isn't good and you don't know the visibility report until that morning. Pradip prepared us for this possibility as the flights the day before were all cancelled. At the the end of our trip we went on a quick visit to the Boudhanath Stupa and then the promised rains finally hit us so we missed seeing Pashupati temple before our flight home. Mountain Monarch's experience gave us a well-organized and enjoyable trip. The hotel in Kathmandu was a bit basic but well-located just off the main street in Thamel, the teahouses along our hike were clean and the hotels in Pokhara and Chitwan were very nice and more modern. We were very lucky with the weather as it rained a few times but not when we had to hike or sight-see. It was nice to go in the off-season as there weren't very many tourists around and hardly anyone else on the trails for our short trek. We had a wonderful experience in Nepal and it was all due to Mountain Monarch's professional care and attention to detail in planning our trip. Pradip's previous experience as a guide shows that he knows what the client wants and also how to support his guides so that they are happy. Thank you to Dipen Rai, Dipen 2 and Pradip for an excellent holiday!"

We saw other trekkers get helicoptered out due to dodgy guides pushing them to hard.One porter per trekker is an a great policy. Especially when you see other porters carrying 3 duffles.Highly recommended!"

My boyfriend and I booked the EBC trek and from the moment we contacted Pradip we knew we\u2019d made the right choice. His quick replies, helpful answers were enough to tell us these were the guys we wanted to go with. Not to mention that it\u2019s a fantastic local business which we wanted to support and their belief in the 1 Porter to 1 Trekker system. Pradip really is doing something right \u2013 even his team share how great he is and speak so highly of him, which just makes you support what Mountain Monarch does. The trek itself was stunning from start to finish. Meeting both Pradip and our Lead Guide Aakash at the hotel put our minds at ease and answered any lingering questions. We felt so assured and safe in their hands. The welcome dinner was a lovely touch, perfect for starting to get to know your fellow trekkers and our leader. A great night! The tour in Kathmandu and visit to the burial ceremony was a fantastic experience. Our guide Ram was an absolute delight, charming, knowledgeable and very funny. We all had a wonderful time and learnt a lot.We could not believe how great the whole experience was\u2026there were luxuries we had not even expected. Plenty of hot drinks throughout the day, a fantastic choice of food in all teahouses, charging facilities everywhere, showers if you wanted, even wifi cards available to those who needed, wonderfully comfortable beds, some rooms with private bathrooms, as temperatures dropped the guys were amazing and offered us bowls of hot water in the mornings to wash our faces with \u2013 truly amazing on a chilly morning! Breakfasts and all meals were delicious and certainly enough to keep us going all day! The bathroom facilities were clean, indoors and perfectly functional, some squat loos, but we were used to them due to travelling in Asia previously so no problem at all \u2013 absolutely no complaints about anything. The teahouses were so comfortable, amazingly so \u2013 their communal areas amazing for socializing, warmed with the stoves and the owners always friendly and helpful! Our lead guide Aakash was the best guide we\u2019ve ever had on an organised trek - wonderfully passionate about what he does, a great sense of humour and hugely patient at all times. Our daily briefings were informative, thorough and detailed. We felt totally safe with him, he was incredibly knowledgeable, professional but also social and we thoroughly enjoyed getting to know him. The other assistant guides were fantastic, so attentive, patient and kind. Mingma and Roshun were with us throughout and were amazing. Other guides we also had the pleasure of spending time with were Mingma and Lakpa and of course we couldn\u2019t have done it without all of the wonderful porters.The equipment we used from Mountain Monarch was amazing \u2013 the down jackets only needed in the evenings, the sleeping bags and liners \u2013 so warm, especially with our hot bottles of water inside! The trekking itself was tough at times but the guides were fantastic at pacing us, taking us very slowly to altitude and really we felt great considering how high we went. We had done some HIIT training sessions and walking up and down stairs to train before which helped with the long days and up and down fashion of the trek. But it was absolutely beautiful - the most beautiful place i have ever been which which over-rules any difficulty on the trek. Overall Mountain Monarch Adventures were totally professional, attentive, ethical and friendly. We loved every moment of our trek and it was worth every penny. We would love to come back and do more trekking with them in future. Trekkers and guides all started as strangers but soon we were a family. Thank you for everything and for helping us get to EBC and Kala Patthar \u2013 it was a truly unforgettable experience!"

The trek was excellent: well organsied with an excellent guide and porters.I was well looked after from being met at the airport right through until my departure. personal attention from the Managing Director, Pradip, was indicative of the personal servcie provided. Nothing was too much trouble, best illustrated by the company chartering a plane to ensure we got from Kathmandu to Lukla without further delays when our original flight was cancelled because of bad weather.The trek itself lasted 21 days in total including time spent in Kathmandu. We stayed in teahouses which were better equipped and more comortable than I had expected. Food was generally good. We were lucky in that we had very good weather so the views were fantastic. The trek itself was not too hard except for the Cho La Pass itself. However this was well worth the efort. Our guide, Dipen, was excellent, very professional anjd attentive to the needs of me and the other person on the trek. he varied the itinerary to accommodate our specific needs.Mountain Monarch are to be recommended for their excellent policy of one porter per trekker. I saw groups from other, perhaps better known companies, where the porters seemd to me to be carrying excessive loads. Our porters were well equipped and properly looked after.I would have no hesitation in recommending Mountain Monarch to anyone considering trekking in Nepal."

We had actually booked the EBC (Everest Base Camp) but due to some health issue (sciatica), we felt safer to do something shorter and less strenuous (even though we are experienced trekkers). We contacted Mountain Monarch the day prior our departure asking what the options were & they recommended this Annapurna Panorama trek & also accepted that we could apply half our deposit to this trek, which we greatly appreciated. Our stay and the trek was seamlessly organized by Pradip and his team and we enjoyed very much the insights of our guide, Arjun, and our interactions with the other staff of Mountain Monarch (Ram and Ram! and Finjo). The trek itself is a good 5 day (4 nights) introductory trek, which included some nice views of Annapurna and Daulaghiri range, pleasant walking through blooming rhododendrons, nice lodges in picturesque villages (e.g. Gundruk) & insight into rural life of the Gurung people of Nepal. To be fair, we were a little disappointed with the views of the high mountain as the atmosphere turned out to be fairly misty which we read is actually fairly common at lower altitude in April-May. So we would probably recommend to do this trek and plan any trip to Pokhara between October and March instead. However, we learned that the trekkers who carried on with the EBC at the same time had very good weather and visibility up there...On the plus side, the rhododendrons were in full bloom near Ghorepani, which made for great colours and pictures, and we had more time to visit all the Unesco World Heritage sites in and around Kathmandu which are still incredible in spite of the damage caused to some of them by the earthquake of April 2015. All in all, we very much enjoyed our 12-day stay in Nepal and are definitely going back to experience the higher altitude!"

I knew after reading the reviews I had likely found our guide company. Mr. Limbu was very quick to respond to our first email inquiry and he made us feel comfortable with our plans from the start. After we confirmed the our itinerary and booked our international flight we wired a deposit to Mountain Monarch. We emailed a few times back and forth with questions which were quickly answered. When we arrived, our MM quide was at the airport to pick us up with a new clean van. He escorted us to our hotel and we settled in for the night. The 2nd day we had a wonderful tour of the local sights, then met with Mr Limbu and our guide that afternoon to get our equipment and discuss the trek. ( We were loaned a down jacket, sleeping bag, liner and rain poncho as well as a large duffel per trekker for our gear). The porters would later carry this on the trek. Our airport transfers, flights, tours, bus rides and trek all went without a hitch. We trekked for 4 days, during that time all of the accommodations and food prep was handled by our wonderful guides. The trek to Poon Hill was hard, but so so worth it in the end. Everyone you meet on the trail was wonderful from the locals to other trekkers. I had read many reviews that said, you come for the views and experience and return for the people. That sentiment is spot on. Its the people and the hospitality that makes Nepal and the treks so great. On a side note, we really expected to see more damage from the earthquake. It was there, but almost had to be pointed out in most cases with the exception of the historic/religious tour spots. In closing, let me reassure you, Nepal is safe. The people are wonderful, the experience is unlike anything else we have seen in the USA. When we return to trek to EBC, we will only be calling Mountain Monarch to handle our guide and travel arrangements. Thank you Pradip Limbu, Mingma Sherpa, Phenuru Sherpa, Ram our Kathmandu tour guide and our porters for making it such a wonderful trip. The entire staff exceeded our expectations."

A dear friend and I wanted to trek to Mount Everest, or more precisely, Kala Pattar, above Everest Base Camp, to get a close-up view of the most famous mountain in the world. After we reached Kathmandu, we allowed ourselves time to go on Trip Advisor and arrange in-person interviews with representatives and guides from the four highest-rated local trekking companies. I'm so glad we did! The other companies were great, but we picked Mountain Monarch because of its focus on safety and ethics. For example, Mountain Monarch was the only company we interviewed that insisted on bringing an oxygen tank and two sherpas for two trekkers. Rescue helicopters will not fly at night or in bad weather, but the other companies never mentioned this. The other companies never mentioned the need for oxygen if no helicopter rescue or rapid downward climb is possible. It was so comforting to always see the oxygen cylinder being carried by our side, especially when the air became so thin that every step upward had me huffing and puffing. Having two sherpas instead of one was very good for us as well as them. I don't like seeing human beings carrying the 30 kg that is standard for other companies. 15 kg is enough for any human! And because we had two happy sherpas instead of one exhausted sherpa, our sherpas would get to the next lodge in record time, and then race back to us and carry our backbacks for the rest of the way, which is often the toughest part.Our Mountain Monarch guide, Dipen Rai, was amazing. We could tell he would be, as soon as we interviewed him. His English is perfect, he's got a great personality and sense of humor, and he clearly loves his job because of his passion for the Nepal trekking experience. He took a genuine interest in us, and he was constantly coming up with ways to make us happier and safer.One thing I wanted to make clear at the start was that we wanted to customize our trek. We did not want to be rushed in any way, or be told that we had to cover any particular distance in one day. Dipen and his company did not resist this at all, and in fact, they helped us tailor the trek as we went along, taking into account that I am 100 pounds overweight and nearly 60 years old. We took it very slow! Most young, fit people take about 8 days to trek from Lukla to Kala Pattar. We took 12 days for that. And then we helicoptered back to Lukla on a flight that was 5 minutes of heaven, getting an aerial view of everywhere we had been. I'm convinced that taking it super-slow on the way up, plus the lack of panic when I knew there was an oxygen tank and mask right there at all times, are what prevented me from getting altitude sickness. Several much younger, fitter people we saw coming down as we went up were not so lucky.It was a very challenging trek, but the rewards were tremendous. The views were even more exciting that we imagined. My friend and I bonded in the best possible way, by sharing an extraordinary adventure. Yes, there were hardships along the way, but their effect was to make me feel so grateful for almost everything in my life back home, which I usually take for granted.Thank you Dipen, Pradip, and Mountain Monarch for making this a perfect trek that we will never forget!"

We booked our Poon Hill trek/ Chitwan safari holiday through Mountain Monarch who organised everything impeccably. Pradip the owner promptly addressed every question or concern I had (which were numerous) by e-mail, during the planning of this holiday. Pradip fulfilled every request I made which enabled my husband to trek with me. This included hiring a horse to support us during our trek; this was necessary for my husband\u2019s knee problem. Pradip\u2019s expertise and attention to detail created a holiday of a life time that was stress free and which surpassed all expectations.Our guide for the trek was Finjo. He was professional and extremely knowledgeable which gave reassurance to us and we benefitted from a wealth of information about the area we trekked and culture of the communities who live in this area of the Himalaya\u2019s. Finjo supported my husband to reach the summit of poon hill for sunrise and we were all rewarded with the most increasable views of the Annapurna range in crystal clear weather conditions. Finjo created a relaxed and stress free atmosphere throughout the trek, with nothing been too much trouble. We thoroughly enjoyed spending the 7 days with Finsu, Ramesh our porter and Raj our horse driver.At every tea house Finju made sure we were able to have a hot shower (bliss!) and arranged our meals for us at the tea houses. I especially loved the Dal Bhat and the thick creamy porridge with honey and masala tea. After completely the trek we spent a couple of days in Pokhara where Finjo introduced us to Sherpa cuisine (delicious) and accompanied us on our journey to Chitwan. Our Chitwan safari was superb, we took an elephant and a jeep safari and a jungle walk. The staff at the hotel Pradip booked were extremely helpful and the hotel had resident rangers who took us on the safari\u2019s. We saw so many animals including a Tiger! This was an incredible sight and one that we never thought we would see. We also saw wild elephants, Rhino\u2019s, sloth Bear, monkeys, deer and many more. Once we returned to Kathmandu Pradip arranged a sightseeing tour. Despite the awful destruction of the recent earthquake there are so many heritage sights intact and so much of Nepal\u2019s rich cultural and historical heritage to see with 7 UNESCO world heritage sites. This has been an incredible holiday experience which has fulfilled my dream of Trekking in the Himalayas and also created more dreams to return with Mountain Monarch."

The CEO, Pradip takes personal care of each and every client, and ensured a seamless experience of whatever was desired. He welcomed us personally, and also on departure - can't say that about many other companies.My wife and I wanted to go onto Poon Hill to see the Anapurna range, visit Chitwan to see the jungle life, and see what Kathmandu had to offer by way of cultural heritage. Pradip made it happen, using his knowledge and links across Nepal - far better than anyone abroad could have done, I think. Accommodation, food and guidance was brilliant. We had a one day arrival in the capital, followed by a 6-day trek, then by 2 nights in Chitwan and 3 back in Kathmandu.My own fitness was not great, and therefore a horse was provided by the company (cost extra, but justifiably so) for the times when the climb became too much for me (3,000 steps anyone?). We had a brilliant one-on-one guide named Finzu (a Sherpa) who had climbed Everest (no less)! This modest young gentleman was attentive and caring, ensuring that we faced the physical challenges but were not overwhelmed by any cultural or communications issues. The tea houses were as expected - but do bring along slippers and a towel. The closest analogy is to think of them as youth hostels,.The company provided sleeping blankets and other items such as jacket, so you don't need to be a pro to go with them. Our porter, Ramees and the horse boy Raz made us a group of five. Apart from our own thermal clothes and a few toiletries we spent 6 days trekking - everything else was met by the company. I took along an electric shaver and found that as it wasn't drying out properly it became less effective over the trek, but did add a certain ruggedness to my appearance which I believe is currently fashionableWe stayed at the Shangri-La in Kathmandu (superb), the Choice Inn in Pokhara (fantastic), and Landmark Forest Lodge in Chitwan (brilliant) all met our high expectations.Transfers were prompt and comfortable and went without a hitch. The individual attention given by various people was amazing. The value for money due to the exchange rate made Nepal a place where $30 per day was more than adequate for food etc., but keep in mind that Mountain Monarch took responsibility for food for 7 out of 14 days for us. Be advised that drinks (apart from water) are an extra, and that it is rare to get any diet versions of soft drinks. Given the Nepali lack of a sweet tooth, obesity is not a problem here, but sweeteners are hard to find, if you want to avoid the calories, but have a sweet tooth.We even saw a tiger in Chitwan. I understand that even local rangers have waited years to see one. Guess we were lucky (only 20m away). But rhinos, sloth bears, and monkeys and deer are plentiful. The elephant safari was fun and novel. The animals seemed to be well treated. 4 People only on each elephant, together with the mahout. We also had a jeep safari, shared with other visitors (10 per open topped \"jeep\") & a jungle walk. Packed a lot in! We wondered about malaria prophylaxis but it appears that it has been decades since a case from Chitwan has been reported.There are 7 World Heritage sites in Kathmandu. Sadly, like all developing world countries, pollution is a problem with haze spreading throughout the day. The earthquake damage is being repaired, but it will take time. The Durbars,particularly the one in Patan is amazing still. I hadn't appreciated the way Nepal had influenced both Hinduism and Buddhism until I visited. The notion that there were numerous warring nations unifying into one was familiar to someone in the UK, but put a new spin on a familiar tune in Nepal. The variety of different ethnicities and the melding of Tibetan and Indian peoples makes Nepal unique with its diverse heritage. Hindi, due to Bollywood, is widely understood. The spoken numbers in both Nepali and Hindi are the same. The greeting \"Nameste\" and thank you, \"Danevaad\" will get you far in the country. Money changers are plentiful in the cities, but not so in the countryside.We changed our itinerary a few times, but Pradip accommodated without any issue - of course, where there was a cancellation fee, we had to cover it but that is only fair.My wife is already planning to go back - she muttered something about Everest base camp. Better start getting fit. I guess you must ask yourself why so many visitors are repeat ones that keep going back?"

We had an amazing experience, neither of us had climbed a mountain before and our guides gave us great advice and training before the climb. Our guide got us to the top, he put on our crampons for us when our hands were freezing, he helped us change over our jumars on the fixed ropes etc. On the way down, a porter came up part way to meet us with hot tea and our comfortable trekking boots (as opposed to more rigid climbing boots). The gear that was issued was top notch western gear (mostly black diamond), I felt safe the whole time. Everyone was friendly, honestly I wouldn't change a thing."

From the moment we landed in Kathmandu, Pradip and his team were fantastic. Our trip leader went through the schedule and gave us our duffle bags and warm feather down jackets. Our group of six friends set off early morning with a packed breakfast, to catch the flight to Lukla. The flight left on time and landed safely in the mountains. Along with our trip leader, there were two assistant trip leaders and six porters, who joined us at Lukla. All of the team were very friendly, helpful and experienced in the mountains. Over the next ten days we climbed slowly upwards with much needed acclimatization days. The teahouses were simple but comfortable and served tasty food. The day hike up to Gorekshep was tough with the altitude and followed by a quick lunch. We then picked up our cameras ready for the walk to Everest Base Camp, which felt like walking on the moon. Our guides kept us safe going past a slight landslide area and over the thin ridge alongside the beautiful glacier. Reaching base camp was an amazing moment wilst feeling very proud and tired! We had bonded well with our excellent team of guides so it was great sharing it with them. A lifetime's memory to cherish.Overall, Mountain Monarch are the company to travel with in Nepal. The guides are very professional and really show their love of this beautiful country. Part of the reason for choosing Mountain Monarch was because they have a one trekker to one porter policy which really helps these men to perform their tough job at high altitudes. The only slight negative was the schedule of three consecutive long walking days, but that was because of the very high altitude. Our trip leader explained that we needed to get back down to lower altitudes, so spreading things out over another day was not advisable. In the end, we were all glad to be back in Nanche Bazzaar for Christmas Day. If you are looking to go trekking in Nepal, Mountain Monarch are the specialists to choose. I'd love to come back and trek again with the same brilliant guides: Dawa, Arjun, Mingma and Kolanda. Thanks for an awe inspiring holiday!"

Pradip and Subesh, the owners, take care of everything and provide personal assistance from the moment you arrive at the airport in Kathmandu till the day you leave. They know the mountains, their trips are very reasonably priced and it's hard to understand why individuals choose large international tour companies that charge 2 to 3 times more to provide the same experience. Pradip customized our trip to accommodate our schedule at no extra charge. My previous trips with MM were The Everest Circuit (my personal favorite) and The Annapurna Circuit.

It was an adventure that ranks amongst the best in the world. The Himalayas of Nepal are spectacular, the trek is arduous & rewarding but the best part of it: our team leader + 2 sherpas took care of us like no other! They woke us up early in the morning with hot tea, encouraged us during the harder moments of ascent, monitored our symptoms (in order to prevent altitude sickness), warmed our spirits with stories, positive attitude, songs & happy moods everyday. Mountain Monarch went above and beyond my high expectations. I will without a doubt join a Mountain Monarch trekking group in the future again! We trekked 5 months after the earthquake of April 2015 and i wish to insist: NEPAL IS SAFE TO TRAVEL! Nepal is recovering well and need tourism money to rebuild its country! Thank you Mountain Monarch for making my dream come true: trekking in the Everest region in Nepal~"

With no hesitation, my next adventure in this area of the world will also be with them. Me and my son spent a fantastic 4 weeks of trekking, climbing and safari, from October 24th to November 19th 2015. We did \u2018Everest High Passes and Peaks\u2019, which brought us to high passes and peaks like Renjo La, Gokyo Ri, Cho La, Everest Base Camp, Kala Patthar as well as the unforgettable Imja Tse (Island Peak) at 6189m. Since we had a bit of time at our return to Kathmandu, we did the 3 day Chitwan Jungle Safari, also organized by Mountain Monarch. It was a good decision also to do the safari with Mountain Monarch and very convenient for us as Pradip took care of the logistic. The hotel, the Landmark Forest Park, number 1 hotel in Chitwan, is very comfortable, clean, nice rooms, food and service are excellent, and perfectly located.Thanks again Pradip for your professionalism in organizing all of this for us. You and your team and also the staff at the hotel Shakti in Kathmandu are really great. Thanks to our guide, Dipen Rai, for your courtesy, support, explanations, respect, smile, patience and care throughout this wonderful trek. It was not just interesting but also fun. We can\u2019t forget Santos, assistant guide, always there and dedicated to look after us with enthusiasm, and of course, the back bone of all this, the porters, ours were Karma and Becass, thanks to you for carrying all our heavy bags! Big thank you to Chittin, you have made the difference for the Island Peak climb, without you, I don\u2019t think I would have made it, at least not in this time. So, thanks to Mountain Monarch, a great trekking company taking a lot of care of us, the tourists, but also taking care of their porters with the One-Trekker / One Porter policy. Yes, I highly recommend them for your next adventure. And by the way, they provide a lot of good quality equipment, so look at it on their good web site, ask Pradip, he will support you and give you good advices.A special thank you also to Ngima Sarki Sherpa, my guide from my 2010 adventure.

Beautiful landscapes, several interesting villages and some remote areas where we were the only guests. We had a good guide called Akas who was like friend, helped out and guided but did not impose. We had also one little tiny porter who carried the luggage for both of us. We can sincerely recommend Mountain Monarch, our guide Akas and the trek.

I come from an extensive history in the travel industry so am familiar with researching tour providers. I narrowed it down to 4 companies out of the seemingly hundreds online but it did not take long before Mountain Monarch impressed me the most with how they responded to my inquiries. Pradip, the owner and front man was incredibly quick responding and very thorough explaining everything in terms that I was able to understand. He is amazingly good at his job!Originally we were going to join one of their small groups but then we decided to see what the cost difference would be for just the three of us. Pradip said there would be no difference so we chose that travel style. We had two guides Amirit and BJ and two porters. Every one of the four was cheerful, considerate, and careful and totally impressed us. On Day 6 we were to hike to Kair Lake but the day before that trail received 3 feet of snow. Our guide discussed this with us and warned us that the day would be extremely difficult under those circumstances and dangerous so was encouraging us to consider alternatives. That made good sense so we agreed and within hours they had a new itinerary for the balance of our trek put together which turned out to be an excellent revision in response to the unexpected snowstorm. I was impressed with the way they handled that event.The porters did an excellent job for us, the lodges we stayed at seemed to be amongst the best choices and all of our trek meals were included with plenty of variety and quality. Mountain Monarch have excellent down jackets available for the occasional cold morning and super warm sleeping bags for the nights. I fully recommend that before you decide on a trekking company talk to Pradip. I am also happy to respond to any questions. In short Nepal is a wonderful destination with so many trekking trails you will be amazed. I did think of two suggestions \u2013 Apart from our ten day trek we had booked three nights in Kathmandu and two nights in Pokhara. We decided to switch that around to 3 nights in Pokhara. Kathmandu is historically interesting but Pokhara is just a really cool city. Also very strongly consider flying at least in one direction between Pokhara and Kathmandu if you are in that area because the drive between the two cities is a little on the scary side and takes a good 7 hours (200 km).Thanks to Pradip and team for keeping us safe, informed and for your friendships."

If anyone is considering a trip to this awesome country, look no further than this professional company. The highest complement that I can pay them is that we intend to return again and will book Mountain Monarch and entrust them with the safety of my precious daughter (and me too!).We ate local food the whole time in hotels and in fabulous lodges and Chandra ensured that we had perfect, hygienically cooked, delicious food.Definitely, my best ever holiday so a big Thank You to Chandra and everyone else who looked after us so well."

Two weeks ago I returned from Nepal after doing the Annapurna Dhaulagiri Trek with Mountain Monarch \u2013 fifteen days in all \u2013 with twelve fellow South Africans.What a carefree, exciting and memorable trip it was! All hats off to Mr Pradip and his team who made sure that all our needs were met and that we came away with such positive and happy memories of our time in Nepal. As owner of Mountain Monarch, Mr Pradip was there to welcome and see off all of his clients from the hotel in Kathmandu. He certainly runs a very principled company, one that I would recommend without any hesitation.Our guide Sunil was able to answer even our most obscure questions and was unfailingly patient, helpful, warm and good humoured. As were his assistant guides: Khuch, Bijaya, Pemba and Santay. Our porters smiled under their loads and got stuck in in the tea house kitchens helping Pemba and his fellow cooks to prepare and present the most delicious, nutritious meals, even under difficult circumstances when stocks were low because of the fuel crisis. We were most impressed that our Mountain Monarch team happily cooked for other trekkers not of our group when at the teahouse on Khopra Ridge, the staff there having left to join their families for their big annual festival. The camaraderie amongst the Mountain Monarch team members was always evident.The pace set on the Nepalese \u201cflats\u201d as well as on the more vertical uphills was good and our trek was incident free. The accommodation in the tea-houses along the way varied in style, as did the setting of the tea-houses \u2013 so all in all we had a wide-ranging experience of what the beautiful country of Nepal \u2013 and its warm-hearted people \u2013 has to offer.A definite 5-star experience! Thank you to all at Mountain Monarch."

Our Anapurna Dhaulagiri trip with Mountain Monarch exceeded our expectations in every way. Mr Pradip answered our emails timeously and efficiently from the day we started planning our trip. We were a little apprehensive after the earthquake hit Nepal but needn\u2019t have been. Mountain Monarch as a company were outstanding. Mr Pradip led by example. Everything was planned and executed to perfection. Sunil was our fabulous, knowledgeable team leader. He was ably assisted by a team of four assistant guides who also helped with the cooking at some of the teahouses and our happy, smiling porters. We felt as if we were being looked after by professionals who went out of their way to make our holiday the most memorable experience. The Anapurna Dhaulagiri trek is absolutely beautiful. We felt as if we had a taste of the best that Nepal could offer. We walked through magnificent rhododendrons and forests that were reminiscent of Tolkien\u2019s \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d. We also crossed many crystal clear streams and waterfalls, before emerging into the grasslands above the tree line. Most mornings we woke at dawn to witness the sun coming up on the magnificent, awe inspiring peaks of Anapurna, Fish Tail, Dhaulagiri and many more. The accommodation was basic, but clean. The food was much better than we expected and we often had a choice of meal. The kit provided by Mountain Monarch, (sleeping bags, jackets, rain poncho, and tog bag) was excellent. Our group of twelve , aged mainly in our fifties, found the walk challenging in parts, but well worth the effort. No-one battled too much and we were always rewarded by the most spectacular scenery. However, it was the people of Nepal, and the Mountain Monarch team, in particular, that really impressed us.. Despite, the earthquake and the recent fuel shortages, they remained cheerful, peaceful, kind and caring and we will always hold them close to our hearts. Even though we were there during the fuel crisis, our plans were never altered and everything worked like clockwork. Mr Pradip even organised a flight around Everest for us which was spectacular. Thank you Mountain Monarch for this amazing trip of a life time which I would definitely recommend."

We were so happy and impressed with the Mountain Monarch team starting with Pradip Limbu, the managing director and our main contact at Mountain Monarch. He responded very quickly to our many inquiries and gave lots of reassurance to our safety concerns, especially after the earthquake when we had to change our trekking plan due to damage in the Manaslu area. Instead we trekked to Gokyo Lakes, Gokyo Ri and Renjo La. It was a fabulous trip and met all of our expectations. Pradip made us feel cared for from our first contact nearly a year before our trip until the end of our trek and time in Nepal. It is not possible to imagine a more responsive business leader. His concern for his clients is matched by his caring for his loyal guides and porters. ONE PORTER PER CLIENT!We were equally impressed with the rest of our team, our guide, Mingma, and his assistant, Nima, and all our porters. We always felt like they were looking out for us and putting our interests and safety first. We had never been at such high altitudes (5350 meters) before, but with their guidance we all did quite well and successfully completed our trek, seeing fabulous views and having lots of fun along the way. We really enjoyed the company of our team, we played cards with all of them at some of the less crowded lodges. Our trek was 17 days since we added in some extra time to acclimate and explore the lakes. That also gave us a cushion for a few cloudy days so we didn't have to hit the high points in less than ideal viewing conditions. The views from Gokyo Ri and Renjo La were all we hoped for!Things to be aware of: the lodges are very basic, the guides will provide advice on food choices to stay healthy, but you will order from the teahouse menus. Distances covered are not great, except for the pass crossing day. What makes this challenging is the altitude more than the distances. Our guides kept us going quite slowly to minimize the risk of altitude problems which worked for all of us. Be sure to use your hot water bottles to warm up your sleeping bag!"

Local outfit with a one porter one guest policy which is currently unheard of in Nepal. Hopefully not for much longer.I was impressed that MM kept the trips going despite a dramatic drop in clients due to April earthquake. For EBC trek there were only 3 clients and for the Island Peak section only 2. There was a lack of communication prior to the trip but emails were answered promptly.Our guides Ram and Prakash looked after us very well throughout the entire trip. We took their advice and stuck to basic vegetarian dishes until after the Island Peak climb. As a result we only had two minor incidences of stomach trouble.Teahouses are basic and most have communal toilets. Some have showers that you pay extra for while others don't even have running water for guests. Our guides always had sanitation gel at hand in the dining rooms. The camp site at Island Peak was very good. Saila, the cook, was a magician when it came to the variety of food we ate.The climbing day at Island Base Camp is quite basic but gives you the skills required for the big day. As I had no climbing experience Tsheten, our climbing sherpa, was with me every step of the way. An advantage of there only being two clients one of which was a competent climber.Equipment supplied by MM was top quality and saves you having to rent or buy it. With climbing gear already at base camp it also means that the 15kg limit on total luggage to Lukla is not as bad as it could have been. As it is the climbing boots and holdall are pretty heavy which doesn't leave much room for too many luxuries!Overall top service and I would recommend Mountain Monarch."

They assessed our abilities and made changes to suit. They provided one porter for our youngest child and always made sure the front and last of the pack were being looked after. Whilst in the towns/cities they always accommodated whatever we asked for, including arranging cultural shows at villages, and paragliding at Pokhara, etc. The food was a mixture of local and western, which suited everyone.

To summarize, this was the most epic, beautiful, thrilling, spiritual trip I've ever taken. Honestly, I embarked on the trip with dread. I pictured climbing a lunar landscape while suffering from altitude sickness in third world chaos. I was so mistaken. We traveled to Europe twice last year, including Switzerland, but I can honestly say trekking in Nepal, particularly with Mountain Monarch, was by far my favorite trip EVER. Despite the misinformation currently on the United States travel advisory website, everything has gone completely smoothly. All of our flights and helicopters were on schedule. And because so many of you are avoiding Nepal (because why? the earthquake six months ago?!) we enjoyed no crowds on the trek. Mountain Monarch is special in that they hope to exemplify responsible trekking. This means they only allocate one client's bag to one porter (other less responsible companies saddle their porters with two bags, a ridiculously burdensome load). We fell in love with our caring, professional knowledgeable, local guides. Dipen and Dahwa took every precaution to help us avoid altitude sickness through proper acclimation and with the help of a little Diamox and Decadron, all five of us summitted 18,500 feet without trouble, including our 13-year-old neighbor Briley (who admittedly is incredibly fit, strong and exceptional). The tea houses were charming and delightful (although the rooms very rustic and basic. If you're a whiner or princess this trip is not for you.) It was so fun to meet other trekkers from all over the world in the tea houses. Some of them were on very special pilgrimages for loved ones. Learning from Dipen Ri, our amazing guide, about Hinduism and Buddhism, attending a ritual by monks at a high mountain monastery, learning about Stupas and prayer flags and prayer wheels was absolutely beautiful. Above all were the majestic mountains. They are indescribable. Actually, so is the whole experience. Find out by booking a trekking trip to base camp on Mt Everest with Mountain Monarch. It's life changing."

We were in Dingboche, about 2 or 3 days from base camp, when the earthquake struck. Our wonderful guide, Dipen Rai, balanced all the difficulties of our safety, his own family concerns, communication and decision-making. With Dipen's support we determined to slowly make our way back out of the high mountains - I feel that this quiet return brought us a stronger appreciation of the Sherpa people and their beautiful region even in the face of the greater tragedy of the earthquake.Dipen is completely professional and at the same time has a spirit of fun that we both loved - he is full of information about the geography, people and culture of the Khumbu. He never denied the potential danger of the return trek but led us confidently and calmly. It was an emotionally moving experience and we had the best possible partner in Mountain Monarch."

We still remember the farewell party!If you're looking for a trekking company that knows Nepal, will provide you with memories that will stay with you for the rest of your life and provide a team that really want to make sure you have the best possible experience, I have no hesitation in recommending Mountain Monarch!"

The food was expertly made and we had meals better than I have eaten in restaurants and some of them were made in the middle of the jungle! They even made us a pizza one evening which was simply superb! The guides were friendly and helpful and became not just guides but friends over the three week trek. They ensured we were all safe and were able to contact our families when the earthquake hit and even helped out other groups who didn't have guides as prepared as the Mountain Monarch crew. They couldn't do enough for us! The equipment they provided was top quality and provided adequate protection from the elements which kept us all warm and dry and happy.The views from the peak were immense! The views all the way were spectacular to be fair! Just got better and better as we went up! So a big thanks to the Mountain Monarch team for organising an awesome trip for us. When I go back in the future will definitely be using Mountain Monarch again!"

We felt well looked after from the airport pick up through to the end of our trip which included the earthquake. MM, particularly Pradip and our lead guide Dawa, went above and beyond to help us at that scary and difficult time, providing food, water and shelter and staying with us to ensure our safe travel back to New Zealand, even though they had their own families to worry about. During the trek we found MM made every effort to make the experience stress-free, from arranging food and accommodation to assisting with the kids and changing our itinerary as needed. We would highly recommend MM to any traveller to Nepal, and encourage travellers return to Nepal to support the recovering economy with more tourism...we cannot recommend Pradip and his wonderful team of guides and porters highly enough."

My daughter and I trekked to Everest Base Camp with Mountain Monarch (MM) and would highly recommend them to anyone planning to trek in Nepal. From my very first email enquiry and prompt reply from Pradip (the owner) I knew we had made the right choice. Every email was responded to within hours, which I could not believe, and always with great information which made the preparation for the trek much easier. We exchanged emails with fellow trekkers in our group before the trip which was a really nice touch. It was a great way to swap ideas on what equipment to bring and how to prepare as well as learn a little about the people we would be spending two weeks with.From the moment we landed in Kathmandu we were looked after in every possibly way. The guides, assistant guides and porters were all brilliant and could not do enough for us from the moment we woke up until we fell into bed each night. We loved the many conversations we had every day to better understand the culture, the people and the amazing environment. They were always there if you needed them. They kept a very close eye on how we were all feeling each day and ensured we were drinking plenty of water and walking at at own pace. Our health and safety was a clear priority and the group had very few problems which was a credit to the MM crew.The trek to Base Camp has been on my \"bucket list\" for many years and MM and our fellow trekkers made the whole experience very special. My daughter had her birthday on the mountain and she was presented with a birthday cake and gifts. So unexpected and such a wonderful memory for us both.Would I trek with MM again? Absolutely! We plan to return to Nepal and trek in the Annapurna region and I will only contact MM when the time comes."

We were both reasonably fit and healthy but had never done anything like this before. We had a lot of questions about gear before arrival which were answered very rapidly over email. Since we were coming from living in Thailand, we didn't have trekking gear and our guide Dawa was great in helping us choose appropriate trekking boots. Our flights to Lukla were cancelled for two days because of the weather, and it was great to have the support of Mountain monarch. They provided us with accommodation in the same hotel for those extra days as well as being very well organised in adapting our trek to a new time frame. On the trek, they always encouraged us to stay at our own pace and it was comforting to have guides at the front, middle and back. Any medication you needed, they provided it for us. We feel very fortunate to have had a wonderfully run company. On return to Kathmandu, we shipped goods home. We had shipped our goods on New Years Eve (in Nepal), however we hadn't received our tracking number because of public holidays. Mountain Monarch personally contacted the shipping company when we were unable to. Our goods have arrived home safe and sound but we were most impressed with the kindness and support from prior to the trek right up until a week after we had left the country. I cannot recommend this company enough."

The guide and porter on the trek Tamang Dhiraj and Tamang Syangbo Ram acted like personal butlers attending to our every need from the moment we woke up until we went to bed.We are pretty slow walkers but this did not phase Dhiraj or Ram they were very patient with us and gave us nothing but unconditional support not only for the 10 days of the trek but the rest of our time in Kathmandu! and their knowledge of Nepal and the Himalayas is unequalled. Pradip was always available for the duration of our stay ( I'm sure he must have a room at the hotel?) and the equipment supplied by the company (capes.sleeping bags,liners,gaters,crampons,fleece jackets) was either brand new or almost brand new and perfect for the trek.With our walking pace we asked if it was possible to do a longer trek in the future and of course they said no problem they could just factor in a couple of extra days. We are now back home and thinking about our next Nepal adventure with MM and proudly wearing our MM tee shirts at every opportunity and telling our trekking friends if you are thinking of Nepal then do not go past Mountain Monarch!"

We chose them because we wanted a local company, to keep the profits in Nepal. In addition, the cost was less than many of the other possibilities. Pradip, the owner, was very prompt and responsive with all our questions before the trip. It was really helpful that they supplied good rain ponchos, parkas, sleeping bags, crampons, duffel bags, and trekking poles so that we didn't have to bring our own gear and deal with it on later segments of a bigger trip. Our leader, Dawa, as well as his assistant guides, Pemba and Robin, and the \"crew\" (porters) were consistently helpful and friendly.We had a delayed arrival when the Kathmandu airport was closed for a few days, and later, one of our party had health problems which led her to have to stay in Chomrong while the rest of us went on to Annapurna Base Camp. Pradip and Dawa helped us deal with the logistics of the setbacks, even arranging a full dinner for us at midnight when we left the Kathmandu airport on our ultimate arrival day.We could see elements of thoughtfulness of Mountain Monarch that felt like we were getting better treatment than some of the other groups we encountered at the teahouses--that we were supplied with boiled water for our water bottles and that the meals were included in the cost of the trip.The base hotel in Kathmandu was conveniently located.The cultural day tour of Kathmandu was also well designed and interesting, with a great guide.We would certainly use Mountain Monarch again were we to return to Nepal."

The idea was that my group would fly up the next day to meet me, but Pradip promised that if the group got delayed for any reason I could begin my hike, since he arranged for my porter and guide to already be in Lukla.Sure enough, weather forced the cancellation of two days of flights, but true to his word, Pradip allowed me to begin my journey. Unfortunately, my group never caught up, but I completed the journey solo. Even though I had paid for double accommodation, Pradip never charged me a penny more for the fact that I had a single room throughout.In a day and age where everything is reduced to the bottom line, I was quite impressed by Pradip keeping his world.I would highly recommend Mountain Monarch, both for the quality of the hike and the honesty of the company."

This is my third trek with MMA, having previously done ABC and Ama Dablam BC with them, and every single one has been a grand adventure.The first leg of our trek was up the Langtang Valley to Kyanjin Gompa and back (Syabrubesi - Lama Hotel - Langtang Village - Kyanjin Gompa - Lama Hotel - Thulo Syabru). The second leg brought us up to Gosainkunda Lakes, over the Laurebina Pass at 4610m and through the Helambu region back to Kathmandu (Thulo Syabru - Shing Gompa - Gosainkunda Lake - Gopte - Kutumsang - Chisopani - Sundarijal). The whole journey took 12 days in all, and brought us through many magical moments: the wide, wind-swept expanse with all-round views of snow-capped peaks in Langtang Valley, the pine forest with flowering rhodendrons around Shing Gompa, spectacular night skies at Gosainkund, snowy fun at Laurebina Pass, the \"winter wonderland\" feel at Thadepati pass, sunrise/sunset views of misty valleys in Kutumsang... we felt like Hobbits on a magical journey, minus the scary bits involving the beardy guy and that angry fellow with the burning eye... and hairy feet, of course.MMA uses only in-house guides, who are sent on courses (eg. leadership, mountain medicine) and apprenticeships as assistant guides before they lead treks. Independent freelancers may be cheaper, but can also be more variable. They also look after their porters, providing cold wear (for some treks) and insurance... basic things, but important.Guides carry first aid and medicine kits, which most others also do, but also oxygen tanks and pressurised tents (for the higher altitude treks), which is most other companies do not. You only have one chance to fail in an emergency situation. I also like the fact that they provide personal equipment (down sleeping bags, down jackets, gaiters, etc.) that would be impractical for infrequent adventurers like myself to buy and own.I am more of a comfort traveller seeking some (but not too much!) adventure, so I appreciate the convenience of having a room at the next teahouse booked (I've always gotten one, but I'm told this is not guaranteed, especially during peak season) in advance and getting to order anything I want to eat from the menu, though drinks are on one's own tab. Papads, prawn crackers, French fries and cheese fritters were readily available to satisfy my gluttony (need to pay for them, but at low prices like USD$1-2 per plate).MMA's itineraries are also slower (though this can be customised to your own needs and schedules), so there is more time to acclimatise and simply to enjoy the experience of trekking at one's own pace amidst such natural beauty, without having to worry about rushing to reach the next destination before sundown. On this trek, we averaged between 6-8 hours trekking per day, which left plenty of time for lunch, tea and impromptu breaks to enjoy the local bakeries or just a picnic next to amazing scenery. The pace was never rushed, and we always got to the next teahouse with time to spare for interacting with other trekkers or exploring the environs.Service was also impeccable, and I appreciate Mr Pradip personally coming down to the hotel to greet us, attend to our needs and send us off.Recommend MMA to friends? Yes, definitely. Even before finishing this trip, I was already thinking and looking forward to the next one!"

We planned to go to Tempboche, but there was a lot of snow, so we cut it short once we had viewed Everest from the Everest View Hotel, above Namche Bazaar. Despite not going as far as we had planned, it was amazing and fantastic. Our guide Ram was super wonderful, picked us up at the airport in Kathmandu, saw us to our hotel, took us on a welcome meal, then a few days later took us to the airport for the trip to Lukla. We were so glad he was there, the airport to Lukla story is a complete zoo yet Ram had us thru and on the plane in no time. Throughout the trek Ram took excellent care of us and saw us happily and safely thru the trip. His village is close to Lukla, and he really knows the route and lots of interesting information along the way. He insisted that we head up to the Everest View Hotel first thing in the morning because he believed the weather would sock in in the afternoon and he was completely right. We had a gorgeous sunny day view of Everest and all the mountains. The smile on my face hasn't gone away yet!! He completely arranged the change of plans so everything was seamless. Once we were back in Kathmandu for some days he saw us to the airport. In addition, Mr Pradip met us several times to make sure everything was OK and arranged a guide for some cultural trips in Kathmandu before and after the trek, which added so much to our trip. Also, the Hotel Tibet that Mr. Pradip arranged was really great, quaint and friendly. I was a bit leary before we left about the hotel in Kathmandu, but I was completely happy with it.Of course, in theory, we could have done this on our own, but it was so wonderful and easy with guide and porter and so much less hassle. We really felt taken care of the whole time. The porter Suriya was great. He is Ram's relative, so they were a team. A porter is really really important.We are an older retired couple, and my only comment is that if you want upscale accommodation on the trek, do let Pradip know before you go and that you are willing to pay extra for that. 95% of the lodges are basic - very basic. Apparently there are a few mid range and one very expensive high end option. So if you want to upgrade (and pay more!!) be very clear about that.Overall, it was truly an astonishing and amazing trek, even just to the Everest View Hotel (staying in Namche Bazaar) was truly wonderful. Mountain Monarch is a good company to go with, they did everything they said they would and treated us well and fairly."

Jaya (who is also called Jay) turned out to be a good improvisational cook as well. And Pradip Limbu, the Managing Director, did a great job organizing our trip. What we really appreciated was the flexibility we were given. For example, the Annapurna Base Camp became temporarily closed due to excessive snow and avalanche danger, so we went to an alternate, very quiet, high elevation location which we loved! This entailed trekking for several extra days which we were able to pay for after the trek.Furthermore, after our trek, we decided to go to the Chitwan Park, and Pradip quickly organized this great additional experience for us. Some other reasons for choosing Mountain Monarch are:1. Mountain Monarch\u2019s guides have taken courses in health issues that can arise during a trek. Indeed, they have studied wilderness first aid, are knowledgeable about altitude sickness, and are equipped with a comprehensive medical kit. 2. Mountain Monarch provides their clients with plenty of boiled water, so their clients have safe drinking water without contributing to the myriads of used bottles! The hot water bottles also do wonders for your sleeping bag at night when the weather is cold and damp at the higher altitudes that we were at!3. All the food during the trek is included in the price, and the client can choose what he wants to eat. One does not have to order from a \u2018set menu\u2019.4. Mountain Monarch supplies warm sleeping bags, down jackets, gaiters, and \u2018yak tracks\u2019 which are crampon like devices for icy conditions. These \u2018yak tracks\u2019 made the trek much safer and easier. Many people were slipping and sliding without them!5. Finally, Mountain Monarch is very competitively priced! As their slogan states, \u201cExplore the Himalayas with local experts\u201d!"

Cultural tour in Kathmandu was very educative and interesting. Accommodation in the cities and on trek was well selected and transport between cities comfortable. Our trekking guide Vivek did amazing job, he went many times out of his way to make sure we will enjoy our holiday to the most. Thanks to Vivek's support during tough climbs I reached all trek's highlights safely.  Our assistant guide Ram was also very good, he always chose appropriate trekking pace and was perfect with taking our food and drink orders. Special appreciation belongs to our two porters, without them this trip would not be possible for me. They were always smiling and seemed full of energy despite carrying heavy bags trough difficult terrain in the rain. I highly recommend Mountain Monarch. Marketa from Czech Republic."

I wanted to go with a company who cares about their own employees too, and I can tell you the porters on our trip were well equipped, happy and were often laughing with us and the guides. In addition Mountain Monarch tries to support community lodges and tea house families who will benefit directly from our visit. We made wonderful memories.

The 11 year old due to medical reasons, could not walk, so the guides organised a horse for the whole trek, and it was magical. Pradip the owner, is professional and attentive to all the details of the trip. From meeting us in Kathmandu to the trek then to Chitwan National Park then driving us to the airport to leave Nepal, Pradip made every effort to make our trip comfortable and exciting. The trekking gear that was provided was of high quality and kept us more than warm in below zero temperatures. It was fantastic and we received duffle bags and shirts to take home, which was a nice bonus. Netra was the lead guide and he and his team, attended to us when we were sick and when we were having fun, with care and friendship and a truly professional attitude. Everyone treated the children with such respect and care, they will never forget it. The trip was incredible, and waking up in Thyangboche monastery blanketed in snow was truly the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, then to walk back to Namche Bazaar in thick snow was incredibly brilliant. Throughout all of this the team made us feel like we were walking with friends, and when we needed them they were there. I highly recommend Mountain Monarch to go trekking with and wish the entire team all the best."

The company were outstanding in every respect. Pradip the owner was attentive to every detail from our first enquiry until the day we left. Nothing was too much trouble and he responded to all our queries and requests quickly. Our guide Dawa was absolutely first rate, ensuring that we had a safe and enjoyable trip all the way. He has many years experience of leading expeditions in the Himalayas and told us some terrific stories en route. He was ably assisted by Pemba, who led from the front all the way at a steady and manageable pace. They also made sure that the porters Jaya and Raju (whose strength and nimble footedness was something to behold) were not only well looked after but were also included in the camaraderie of the trip. The trek itself could not have been better. The views were truly stunning and varied because we crossed from one valley to another. Highlights were: trekking through snow after being caught in a storm near Dobato; the views of the Annapurnas directly above us from Khopra Ridge; the view of the Kali Ghandaki Gorge, the second deepest in the world; the peace and tranquillity of the village of Swanta as people went about their daily tasks; the view of our whole route from Poon Hill; and of course the sites of Kathmandu. The accommodation was in teahouses and although it was very cold indeed at night we enjoyed sitting round the wood-burning stoves, playing cards and talking through the day's experiences. Apart from the storm, the weather was fine although I gather there was a heavy fall of snow soon after we left. That said we had the teahouses all to ourselves after Tadipani, although a loan trekker walked into the Khopra Ridge late one evening, seemingly having come from nowhere. The equipment the company loaned us was of very high quality and even though the temperatures dropped well below freezing each night (the water in the bucket for flushing the toilet froze solid in one lodge!) the down sleeping bags were almost too warm at times.Many thanks to everyone at Mountain Monarch for a truly memorable trip and there you go from strength to strength!"

And once in Kathmandu, I was met by my guide Netra Tamang at the airport and felt very well looked after all the way through to my departure back to Sydney.The trip was very well organised, with the whole crew of guides and porters were incredibly experienced and very skilled in their area of responsibility. Mera peak is a camping trek and we had a guide, assistant (climbing guide), kitchen crew and cook, as well as porters. Each and every one of the crew was warm, friendly and genuine - they went to such efforts to ensure our comfort for the duration of the trek. The meals provided were hearty and delicious - there was always way more food than we could eat (and other travelers often looked at us with jealousy when they saw the amazing meals that we were being served). Big thankyou to the chef Colandar who not only fed us great meals but was also highly entertaining.The gear and equipment were top notch. The boots they supplied us for the trek from high camp to summit were of the most expensive brands and quality. The tents, sleeping bags, down jackets, mattresses and climbing gear were close to brand new and very well looked after. Most importantly I felt very safe the whole time I was on the trek. The very experienced guides Netra and Mingma (climbing guide) ensured each one of us was always safe.The whole crew at Mountain Monarch were so much fun. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the team and will definitely be booking my next Nepal trip with them again - I think it will be Island Peak :)"

Pradip, the trekking company owner, promptly answered all of our emails and picked us up at the airport upon our arrival. We were the only trekkers for the departure date we selected so our small group consisted of the two of us, a guide and two porters. Our guide Aakash was very experienced and shared his extensive knowledge of the people, places, culture and trail during the trek. He provided the leadership we were looking for as this was our first visit to Nepal and first time trekking at higher altitudes. Aakash took very good care of us and was very attentive to our health throughout the trek. We had no significant altitude health issues. It was also great to see the very positive relationship Mountain Monarch, and Aakash in particular, had established with the numerous people we encountered along the way including teahouse owners and staff and other guides. Our hard working porters were also instrumental in making our trek a success, providing us with daily boiled water and ensuring our gear was waiting for us at the end of each day. All of this made our journey enjoyable and worry free. During our time in Kathmandu, Mountain Monarch provided us with an experienced guide who had a wealth of knowledge about the people and places we visited. After our trek Pradip asked to meet with us to get our direct feedback, which is a very positive process for any business and likely one reason why Mountain Monarch is an excellent trekking company. We will certainly choose Mountain Monarch again for any trekking activities in Nepal."

The extra few dollars spent with Mountain Monarch will be 1000x better than with a cheaper outfitter. And the porters the other outfitters utilize will be Overloaded with gear. No kidding. Mountain Monarch group size is from 2-8 trekkers.....no more than that. Their porters are treated with dignity and respect. So you will get to know your Sherpas and porters as friends before the end of your trek. I have see large groups outfitters where some trekkers are struggling physically and because the group is so large, the guides/Sherpas have no time to help them. Mr. Pradip, the owner of Mountain Monarch is thoughtful, trustworthy, and professional in every sense of the word. Your email will be promptly answered however simple it is and have professional advice to all your inquiries. You will be personally met at Kathmandu's airport and at the end of the trek, you will driven to the airport for your departure. Mr. Pradip will personally await your arrival at the hotel to greet you, like one of the family. They will stay with you until you pass through the door of the airport at your departure. Mountain Monarch is THE leader in Nepal trekking. All necessary drugs and precautions are brought along during the trek in case someone gets into trouble.

The organisation of the logistics of the entire trip was perfect and without any problems. The kit provided was entirley appropriate and in good condition. We had full confidence in our Sherpa guides who were kind, helpful, fun, witty and instilled the necessary confidence and drive, and supplied the necessary mountaineering skills, to get 9 out of our party of 11 safely to the summit. The kitchen and portering team was excelltent; if only they had allowed us eat more traditional Nepali food!

It was an enhanced experience walking with the Mountain Monarch Nepalese team and I particularly enjoyed learning Nepalese and playing UNO with them all.

From our initial contact with Pradip to meeting our fabulous guides Sunil and DK (and the wonderful porters Santosh and Purnah) , our trek was a life changing experience from start to finish! What none of us could believe, was the attention to detail MM took with our trek. (Our guides had to assist numerous groups on our way up experiencing problems with altitude - the wonderful Sunil and DK and our MM First aid kit ams to the rescue of many - who's guides were ill-equipped!) We cannot think of a better company to use to guide you through some of the most beautiful treks in the world. Thank you Mountain Monarchs and apologies for taking exactly a year to write this!!!!"

Dawa is incredibly experienced and his first priority is to look after the trekkers in his group. Without their expert knowledge, equipment and the fun of the group, I wouldn't have learned nearly as much about their beautiful country and people as I did. As the oldest and slowest member of the group, Dawa stayed with me and encouraged me. He was very professional and the level of service that the entire team gave us was unparalleled in my travel experience in any country. I highly recommend trekking with Mountain Monarch Adventures. You just can't gain the level of professionalism from a book or a guide that you hire in Durbar Square!The day trip in Kathmandu was very interesting too!Trekking in Nepal was an amazing experience, which really built my self confidence and resilience. I was surprised that I wasn't too old. Dawa told me that he has lead groups with people as old as 75 years! All credit to Mountain Monarch Adventures for ensuring the safety of the group, having the equipment, experience and energy to make my Annapurna adventure a true mountain top experience.P.S. I'm very grateful for the other reviews on Trip Advisor that led me to choose Mountain Monarch!"

Their goal was to ensure a successful and safe experience for all clients.

Pradip was very willing to adjust the trip to meet our travel needs and always had a quick reply to any emails.

MM are a local Nepalese company with a passion for ensuring people get the best possible experience from their \"holiday\". A strenuous trek but the tour leader and his team ensured that everything possible was done to keep us safe, healthy and positive.... What an experience, and it couldn't have been better. The group of 6 soon became a team but individual needs / limitations were still accommodated for and the leaders constantly monitored individuals health, especially with regards to preventing altitude sickness. We could not have been better looked after whilst others were being airlifted back to safety having not achieved their goals.MM also have strong environmental credentials with a passion for protecting the area and the Nepalese culture. The leaders are well trained and very professional, carry an extensive medical kit with altitude chamber and the porters are happy and well looked after. Nothing is overlooked ! And what's more - we all had FUN !I would be more than happy to receive direct communication from anyone wanting to go trekking in the Himalayas (e-mail through MM) but strongly recommend that you look no further and engage with MM for what has been for me \"the trip of a lifetime\". I even got a birthday cake (well digestive biscuits) for my 60th birthday the day before climbing Kala Patthar and visiting Everest Base Camp.If you put your trust in MM you will not regret it - happy trekking!"

Our guide, Nhima, with plenty of guiding experience and knowledge of the area, took excellent care of us, noticing every detail, always at hand but allowing us to keep our pace and privacy. He took us for a meal in a tea-house, with a view over the valley, and we had an unforgettable Tibetan bread and soup. Near the peak it started raining. Our guide immediately took out Mountain Monarch rain ponchos for us and took us under the shelter. We enjoyed the view while the rain and hail were pouring. We were rewarded with the most beautiful rainbow.If you want a good preparation before your trek, or if you want to experience the life around Kathmandu, Mountain Monarch can arrange an excellent day trips for you."

This trip involved my two oldest kids (9 & 11) with some other Dads who brought a son each of similar ages.As with previously, Pradip was excellent to deal with and his communication always gave you peace of mind before the trip. On arrival , we are welcomed and briefed and supplied with good gear to take the trip (duffle bags, sleeping bags and warm jacket) Having kids on the trip is always a concern at any point for an adventure holiday. Pradip gave us additional support staff and an excellent guide Dawa Finjo who understood kids and helped us with them. He gave them orientation lessons in the tea houses and talked about the customs of his people to give them a better understanding of Nepal as a country. Finjo was with us the entire journey and was always available to answer any concerns and issues- with a smile. This guy has climber everest and He was our guide. That is very cool! The trek to Poon Hill was tough for the kids, but they made it well and that was helped immensely by Mountain Monarchs planning.

We were accompanied by two of my friends and three other children so a group of 7 all up. Mountain Monarch was amazing, even better than in 2009 where they organized a trekking peak expedition for 5 of us that went without a hitch. This trip went without a hitch as well and again with everything being organized so we didn't have to worry about any logistics at all. In addition, Mountain Monarch really went the extra mile - provided 2 extra guides - 4 in total (to safeguard the kids a bit more on the trail) and a safety kayaker on the white-water rafting (in case one of the kids fell out) without being asked and at no extra cost. Indeed they lowered the price a bit because some of their permitting costs were reduced for kids. Our lead guide (Finjo) had summited Everest - what a buzz for the kids to be getting compass lessons from an Everest summiteer! Even more impressive Finjo has academic qualifications in child development and had an amazing rappore with them! Finjo stayed with us through all parts of the trip which really helped. Pradip, the managing director was always available and indeed essentially operates out of the hotel in Kathmandu where we stayed. I had asked Pradip a favour, whether some certificates could be made and presented to the kids on their return - Pradip readily ageed and the certificates were very well done (the kids are very proud of them, my boy has his on his wall). Only negative was the white water rafting lead guide wasn't particularly \"child friendly\" - not awful, just not used to kids rafting would be my guess - this part of the trip was sub-contracted but I mentioned this minor issue to Pradip and I am sure he will review his sub-contractor for the next time.I have personally been to Nepal 5 times, I am likely to return in 2015 and will certainly be utilising Mountain Monarch again.Regards,Mike DworkinPerth, Australia"

I had actually looked into a guide before I left but the quotes from another company were so high we decided we just needed to go alone. The advice on the internet forums were that you could go to a travel agency and pay them to take care of your permits for you. We went to the agency that was on the same property as our hotel to have that done the morning after we got there.Once we did everything change. Our agent, Dennis, did not pressure us to use a guide but demonstrated why we should consider it. When I told him that we were students and didn't think we had the money he did some calculating. He also added in a whole different trek because it sounded like more of what we were looking for. The price was just barely below what we brought with us, but we did it.And boy are we glad we did. The extra circuit, the Manaslu, was amazing. That was by far the gem of our trip. We did that for the first half and then Annapurna for the second. Our guide, Ram, was amazing. He was the same age as the other two guys in the trip. We got along very well. He took care of us and adjusted the plan as needed. He was more impressive than any other guide, often helping other groups when we stopped by meals. Many people made note of this and wrote down the company information with the intent of hiring Ram in the future.All in all, spectacular experience. I would note 3 things, none of which would change my review from 5 stars, but that should be said. 1. The infrastructure in Nepal is not so good. It caused delays for us on numerous occasions. You should be prepared for things not work at times.2. The agency has connections all over and you end up staying in hotels that are owned by friends or family. They were all very nice, but the communication between was not always perfect. When we finished our trek in Pokhara there was confusion about breakfast. Our agency and guide said it was included, but that information wasn't relayed to the hotel in a way that they understood and we had to work it out with them. It was fine, but we shouldn't have had to do it.3. Our guide steered us away from hiking Tilicho Lake because the way was too dangerous at the time. We of course were fine with that and altered our schedule. However, when we got up to the area we met lots of people who did it the same time that we were going to and the reports were that the way was both open and that it was not dangerous at all. They also reported that it was one of the highlights of their trip. I'm a little disappointed that we didn't get to go and I personally feel that it was given the ax too quickly."

Out of the best 10 rankings I choose Osho Vision Treks & Expeditions Ltd. because I liked the homepage and the friendly offers. So I wrote an email and the reply was very quick and Dinesh, the manager offered us three different treks to choose. After customizing the itinerary to our special wishes, we booked the holidays with Osho Travel and that was a great deal!From the first day arriving, till the last day before departure we were more than happy with the service. All people working for Osho Vision has been friendly, experienced, helpful and just great, and especially the crew we had on our trek, everybody was perfect. Prakrash, our guide and Bijaya and Ram Hari our porters made the trek unforgettable. Prakrash was every time looking after all of us, always reacted to the situation when somebody needs something, or when we decided to change the plans a bit, he always tried to answer all our questions and very often all three of the team worked together to get us a perfect lunch or dinner, or make our day even better. After asking for a special song, they have taught us the words and so we were able to sing along and had so much fun. Comparison to our last trek in Nepal in 2011 this tour was much better, because of this brilliant team which was guiding us. So all in all we were very happy with our decision to book with Osho Vision Treks & Expeditions and we recommend it to all our friends and those, who are looking for a familiar, friendly, but also experienced company. Thanks a lot dear respected Mr. Dinesh Lamichhane for such a great experience! Namaste, Dhanyabad and Bidaa Hau"

The great thing about having our own trip meant we could flex as we went. I.e. If you want to walk a little further in a day you can. If you want to speed up & finish a day earlier to relax for an extra day in Pokhara this is all possible as your guide (in our case Raj) can help arrange all this for you. Our trip included food (you can select from a menu), accommodation, transport, transfers, a guide & a porter. The only extras you needed to pay for were for drinks and then occasionally for showers, wifi & phone charging. We were also helped with hiring trekking equipment & we had a lovely final trekking day dinner. We want to thank all the team Raj, Ram and Dinesh for such and amazing time. We would definitely recommend for any trek in the region...."

When I arrived in the (quite) hidden office of Osho vision, I've been surprised by the quality of the service (very welcoming staff, good tea and coffee to wait...). I've then been introduced in the office to speak with the manager. First good sign, he didn't give a price directly. He first asked some precise questions about the type of trek I was interested into, showing everytime a map of the areas we were speaking about and detailing the steps of the trek. He also asked which kind of transportation we would prefer. Then he offered directly a fair price for the options I showed a bit of interest to (everything included but drinks 200\u20ac while some other started with 600\u20ac offer... Off season prices). We had a pick-up from our hostel fixed by our excellent guide (Ram) and after a night in Pokhara, started the Mardi Himal trek, in the clouds and the rain, learning Nepali songs to keep the mood up! Ram was very sorry for us about the lack of visibility and was awake as soon as the sun rise to knock at our door (on our request) as soon as it was possible to admire the wonderful mountains surrounding. All in all, priceless memories acquired in a trek during the monsoon! (possible to pay cash in different money, or with visa)."

He made our minds about doing a 13 day trek on the Annapurna circuit, which would be just on time to catch our flight back home. We were a bit concerned about the guide that would be leading us as we would only meet him the next day, 1st day of the trip and would be someone who we had to depend on the next two weeks. Udaya assured us on the guide's experience and next day we met Rajendra \"Raj\" the best guide we could ask for. Raj is a very experienced, friendly, funny and helpful guy. We had a great time with him and felt we were always taken good care of on the journey. Always felt we were staying at the best places available and that there was a constant concern from them about our well-being and happiness. At the end we felt we were lucky to have met Yudaya, Raj and Osho vision, as we didn't had much time to look for agencies and guides and they came through with everything that was contracted. We even spent the two nights at Kathmandu in their hotel, an excellent place to stay.Very positive balance of the experience with the agency and with the trek, the perfect way to be introduced to Nepal, culture and trekking the Himalayan range.Left two final advice's for them to improve: a bit more advice on the gear and weight to carry, and drivers arriving on time and rested."

We did a 5 day trek round the Annapurna mountains with osho after alot of debating about with company to go for as we were very cautious about choosing the right one. After talking to Raj and the gang there we were happy to go with them. So glad we did as some of the other guides we met on the trek were not half as friendly as our man Raj.. Spot on thanks again Dan and Ruth. Love to the family to bud.x"

            "review": "Amazing Trek to Annapurna Base Camp w/ Harry the Wizard-Guide!. I initially planned to the ABC Trek solo but changed my mind after numerous friends advised me against it as it was my very first trek in Nepal. I met up with Udaya from Osho Vision Treks who drafted out a 13-day trek that put more emphasis on picturesque locations. The day before my bus to Pokhara, I was hit with a really bad case of Gastric and was pretty much bed ridden until Udaya helped me out and took me to see a pharmacist which really helped a lot. The next day, I was a lot better and the ride to Pokhara (which a lot of people had warned me about) was actually pleasant.Now onto my guide, Harry Pokhrel, we got along very well from the beginning and he was very helpful in pointing out some points of interest along the trail. He even helped me out by volunteering to carry some of my camera equipment which really helped out since I'm not exactly in the best of shape. What was most interesting was that he actually turned out to be a fairly good photographer! I'd say 30% of my favourite photos were taken by Harry and I'm very happy with guiding me throughout the trek.Photography aside, I was very pleased with the lodging Harry had selected for me as the food was great, the beds and blankets were comfy and most importantly, I had some great night sky views at 3-4 in the morning! We were also blessed with amazing timing as we had great weather during the trek and when we stopped for the day, the weather had usually turned rainy. We were also joined by another group from Osho Vision Treks and I had the pleasure to meet another guide, Bishnu and the porter of the group, Bhijaya, who funny enough, was Udaya's younger brother! Together with the Scottish couple who trekked with us, we had a real fun time trekking and the continuous climbs and descents weren't too rough on morale since we had good company.All in all, I had a blast trekking with Osho Vision Treks and if things work out, I'm planning to do another trek with them next Spring!"

I was so impressed that the manager Dinesh had efficiently organised everything for us in 2 days inc hotel stay, flight, trekking package, guide and porter; and I appreciate very much on his reliable and comprehensive services all the way through.Raj has been assigned as the trekking guide accompanied by Bavin as the porter for our 4 day trekking trip. Raj is a very responsible, knowledgeable and funny guy whilst Bavin is a very caring young man, both taking good care of us in the mountains, esp we went through the muddy and slippery paths under the adversed weather condition. It was great fun to have them among us and by the end of the trip, we became good travelmates. On top of this, staff at Osho Hotel are very supportive and always readily available to provide assistance to us during our stay.Although this is my first visit to Nepal, it brought us very good memory and already tempted to plan for another \"aggressive\" trekking soon.. We have no reservations in recommending Osho team to any visitors."

I would definitely recommend him! AntonSwe"

Having decided to go trekking on a whim, I was lucky to have Hira patiently answering all my questions on the various treks available - locations, accomodation, food, costs and other trekkers' feedback, etc. He also showed me photographs taken by their guests, which helped me make my mind up on an Everest Base Camp Trek package. I just had to pack my bag while all the required paperwork and bookings were taken care of for a reasonable fee.Hira then brought me to a shop with honest salespeople who helped me get all I needed - trekking wear, gear, equipment and accessories. During my stay in Kathmandu at their very comfortable hotel, he gave me good advice on Nepal too. What I appreciate the most is that he treats me warmly as a friend.Ram guided me safely to Everest Base Camp and back. He kept checking to see if I was alright - something very important since almost everyone we met on the way suffered from altitude illness, but not us. At the lodges, he made sure I was comfortable and happy with my meals. Ram even carried 2 kilograms of apples from Kathmandu and shared them with me, along with warm drinking water, which I was too lazy to carry. Also, he was always helping me with my gear and equipment, like my crampons to walk on ice, and giving me a hand when the path is not easy. The day after we reached Everest Base Camp, as it was too cold (minus 15 degree Celsius in some rooms at night), I requested to descend faster and we did our first Everest marathon-plus in the middle of winter - 48 kilometres in 10 hours, up and down slippery, snowy, icy paths and the last hour in semi-darkness. It was not easy but Ram made it possible.During the trek, Mr Dinesh, the managing director, would contact Ram to check if everything was fine. From many aspects, Mr Dinesh shows that he genuinely cares for the safety and comfort of his guests.Thank you very much, Mr Dinesh, Hira, Ram and the Osho Vision family for showing me your beautiful country and true Nepali hospitality."

I highly recommend our guide, Raj, he spoke English very well and was great company. He was very knowledgeable of Nepal and surrounding region. I am not a rich man and found the tour was well worth the price. Osho Vision took care of all of our accommodations. This included food, transportation, a guide, and lodging.

I organised the trek with Mr Udaya, who was very helpful in selecting the right trek for me - I wanted something relatively remote and challenging.The trek itself was absolutely incredible and I can't recommend it highly enough, especially Tsum Valley - if you are looking for something off the beaten track, this is definitely the place to go - very basic accommodation, no new development and very few trekkers during the day although you do meet a few at the guest houses at night.Manaslu circuit, was equally breathtaking but is becoming more touristy, albeit less so than other treks. Accommodation was better than in Tsum Valley.My guide for the trek was Mr Bishnu and my porter was Mr Prakash. They were very good company and we had a great time together!Overall, I was very pleased with the trek and the company. Highly recommended!"

Udaya provided a very transparent view of what the costs would be and how the schedule would look. The organisation of the fairly complex set of permits was completed without any fuss upon arrival. I paid i advance for the permits - this was no problem at all.The trek itself took place less than one week after cuclone Hudhud had taken over 50 lives in the Gorkha amd Manang districts - it wasn't an ideal time to be heading out on a trek. I need not habe worried. On the trek itself, my guide, Harry was very professional, ensuring constant updates from futher up the trail as to conditions on the pass. In addition this, Harry was a great companion speaking very good English with a tify sense of humour.

The best guide, that we met in last 4 years in Nepal was Prakash, very friendly and english speaking guide. Everything during our 14 days tri was organized perfect. Prakash is really the best friend in Nepal. Thanks and we can recommend this company for trekking in Nepal...Lukas and other friends from Czech Republic"

We met our great Guide Udaya and the porters in Katmandu and drove to start our trek in Pokhara. We did an excellent 4 day trek to Poon Hill and enjoyed every bit of it. The trip was made so much better by the professional, informative and friendly experience we got from Udaya and team. They constantly had smiles on their faces and were very friendly. Udaya himself is young, but extremely informative . He has alot of knowledge of Nepal and most the Treks. He spoke very good English, some Russian and some other languages. Udaya is happy to talk and tell you as much as you are willing to know, Although, if you want to walk in silence Udaya and his team walk quietly with you in order to fully immerse yourself in the amazing surroundings. Ask for Udaya and you will be in safe hands, I assure you."

We bumped into Prakash on the way from airport and to our hotel and in between our ride to the hotel, Prakash managed to convince us that he will be able to arrange our sight seeing activities in Kathmandu. Originally, we thought we will just request the hotel to arrange for us but when we compared and found that we get more bang for the buck by chosing Osho VIsion we decided to go with them. A decision we never regret.Since we are only going around the valley, we arranged with him to bring us to all the all the famous tourist traps e.g. Swayambunath Stupa, Pashupatinarh temple, Kathmandu Durbar, Nargarkot, mountain flights arrangement etc. He provided with us a really nice and friendly driver - Kapil to manage our transport need. Everything was well arranged and the trip went according to how expect it to be. It was wonderful and memorable trip and Osho Vision was instrumental to the enjoyment to our trip. The only negative portion that I have is in term of time management. We encountered twice late transport arrival that made us anxious - once, when we are supposed to be on the way to the domestic airport for the mountain flight and the 2nd was on way from hotel to the airport for our return flight back home. I hope they will improve on this aspect. Anxiety is something tourist are not looking for when they are on holiday! But otherwise, I will be chosing them again the next time I come around to Nepal for a holiday. Their price are the cheapest and exemplary service is why I will be chosing them again."

There is few reason I would really like to recommend Osho Vision Treks:1) We got really good prize. Mr. Prakash met us on our arrival in airport and was really helpful and trustworthy. We compare his prize with several other tour operators and he really give us the best one. Here is contact on him (pl.oshovision@gmail.com - +9779851013032)2) Owner of the office Mr. Dinesh is really great guy. He is busy businessman but really helpful. We trusted him with our passports and China visa and he manage to pick it up for us very safely. In the end of our stay he even invited us for a dinner. Really great guy!3) Best of all was our guide Udaye. We chose him based on other great reviews here and we was definitely not disappointed. He is young and smart guide with sense of humor and great knowledge about Nepal and mountain. Take him specially if you are planning to visit Manaslu region. He was born here and knows everything about it."

All details were professionally managed and all questions promptly answered, and any criticism we had was about the standard of accommodation in some of the tea houses, which were often primitive and fundamentally basic but outside the remit of Actual Adventure, of course. We couldn't fault this company and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for your trip in Nepal. We'll use them again for a foray into Evrest base camp trek next year!Regards,zuleima ,pablo"

            "review": "Trip of a lifetime!!. I just finished a two-week trek to Annapurna Base Camp booked through Actual Adventure. I had an amazing time and was completely thrilled by the excellent customer service provided by Kedar and Sujan before, during, and after my trek. The company was recommended to me by a friend, so I contacted Kedar. He responded promptly to all of my emails and was happy to discuss different options for trekking that fit my budget and time constraints. The night before I departed for my trip, Kedar met with me to go over the itinerary, answer any questions I had, and make sure that I had all of the gear I would need. The actual trekking itself was mind-blowingly awesome, full of lush forests and massive snow-covered mountains. I can't even begin to describe how beautiful it was up there. My guide Binod communicated each day's schedule well and made sure all of my needs were met. He was flexible and adjusted the schedule according to how I was doing each day--for example, we decided to put in a long (8-hour!) day coming down from base camp so we could stop at some natural hot springs the next day. (AMAZING.) Kedar was in contact with us throughout the trip to make sure things were going smoothly. When we got back, Sujan came to the airport to pick me up; he also took me around Kathmandu the next day for some last-minute sightseeing before my evening flight. Throughout the entire two weeks, I was consistently impressed by everyone I interacted with at Actual Adventure. I highly recommend this company to anyone who wants to explore Nepal: you will be amazed by the kindness and attentiveness of the staff. Book your trip already!!"

The mountains, culture, and the people who were some of the friendliest I've ever met. I decided to book with Actual Adventure because after a while of searching they had the best tours for the best prices that i came across. After getting in touch with Kedar Neupane I know i made the right decision. He couldn't have been more helpful, kind, and patient with all my questions. While i was in Nepal i partook in two separate treks through the company. Which i would have had really hard time with if it weren't for my awesome guide and new brother Lakpa Sherpa. I honestly think if he wasn't there with me i wouldn't have been able to do it both physically, and mentally. The first trek being the 20 day Jiri to Everest Base Camp and Kala Pathar. The second being the 7 day Nayapul to Poon Hill in the Annapurna Range. For the money that i spent of the trek i really believe i got the most out of it. I had three meals every day, countless cups of tea, and a room to myself every night. Now trekking in a developing country you need to have realistic expectations of the lodges you will be staying in. If you bring a sleeping bag to throw on the bed to sleep in you will be fine, these village lodge owners give it all they have but that is limited. In the cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara they clearly have the ability to have immaculate rooms. I honestly have no complaints with Actual Adventure or the Trekking I did through them. They were all incredibly kind and helpful. I will most definitely visit Nepal again and without a doubt be using Actual Adventure again and again."

He can cater to all budgets and organised a hotel, flights to Lukla and a guide/porter quickly and efficiently while I was still in Australia.Our guide Mingma was amazing and truly made our trek memorable! He was very knowledgeable about the terrain and culture, and we enjoyed leaning about different ethnic groups and towns every day. It was the small things like holding my hand when we were going down very steep sections, or giving us advice on altitude sickness when we felt unwell, that made us feel safe and extremely comfortable in his presence. On the last night he even invited us into his family home and cooked us a delicious meal. It was a sad to say goodbye after a wonderful two weeks in the mountains!Our accommodation in Kathmandu (Hotel Peak Point) was suitable for a few nights before and after the trek. We had a private room on the top floor which caters for travelers on a tighter budget.When we went to thank Kedar and his brother Susan after returning from Lukla, they invited us to play indoor soccer with them (which was boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed!). This shows how friendly they were!I would highly recommend this company to all of my friends. Everything went really smoothly and they were instrumental in ensuring that we had an excellent time in Nepal! Thanks Kedar, we'll be back to conquer Annapurna Base Camp one day!Olivia and Nick"

In starting we are little bit afraid to going up in the dark but our guide was very helpful. It seemed easy at first, just walking slowly on a soft incline but later, once we reached the base of High Mountain we had to climb up many steps. The view was beautiful from the top though it was too cloudy for the sunrise. Still very attractive though. Then we eat bread, bananas and hard boiled eggs in breakfast. The tour also provided snacks like chocolate bars, cookies, bread and bottles of water. The fog and view was just so amazing, I am still missing it. Then we had to slide down some parts of soft black sand which was fun. It was quite relaxing than climbing up. It took us around 6 hours in total. The drivers and tour guide did an amazing job. They are friendly, helpful and willing to share with you everything they know about their home town. We are happy with the service and schedule arranged! Over all it was a very good tour and we are very thankful to Mr Kedar Neupane and their all team for this wonderful job !"

It was magical. Thank you Lynne, Kedar and a special thanks to Keshab."

As a woman traveler alone I received a wonderful personal, polite service catered to my needs during my time in Nepal, and was helped to find my feet within an unknown Country. An itinerary was put together for me at a very reasonable price and covered all the things I wanted to see and do whilst in Nepal, the itinerary was very flexible and could be changed at any time.If you have any questions or queries Actual Adventure is able to help with anything and make good suggestions on making the most of your time in Nepal. I hope to return again very soon and will certainly be using the service again."

However, Kedar took care of me with extreme personal care. He even drove me personally from airport to hotel and vice versa. My trip consisted of one night stay in Kathmandu and then took buss to Pokara. Then a 2 day hike to Sarangkot. Kedar organized the whole trip without any shortcomings. The hotel in Pokara was also really excellent. The Trekking Guide from Pokara- Mr. Kumar Adikari was also superb in helping me to enjoy the climb. Since I am only a novice enjoying the beauty of nature through these hikes (and not a hard core mountaineer), Kumar was really helpful to make the most of the trip. I returned back to Kathmandu by Plane (yeti Air). I went for a half day visit to Bkahtapur which was an amazing location - if one loves the ancient skills of craftsmen. Kedar personally accompanied me in this visit explaining me many things.All in all, I have no complaints with actual and will again go with them. Really appreciate their keeping the trust I placed on them."

An incredible four hour trek inKathmandu Valley from Sankruh to Nagarkot, guided by 29 year oldDepak.. from Actual Adventures, LTD, who grew up in the Everest BaseCamp area. Vistas too incredible, too majestic for words, silence onlysporadically broken by the calls of children, songs of birds, crowingof far-away roosters, bleating of baby goats\u2026 terraced fields ofmustard yellow flowers, or of newly planted corn and wheat ready toharvest, bent women and children packing tons of fire sticks on theirbacks, herding their flocks through stone studded streets. Depak knowsall the little short-cuts, and is able to negotiate different routes-some scenic and very rustic- through the valley, routes not everexplained in any of the travel books. You cannot even help but tomeditate, .. to pray\u2026 to be calm and take in the magic of Kathmanduvalley. I so wish you were here to share in this wonderment- that I amso honored to witness alone.We stop at the edge of Nagarkot\u2026a blue plastered structure that theowner calls \u201cNaldum ghining\u201d (guest house), and order our lunch, onlytwo items on the menu- Nepali Dal-Bat or Thuk Pa. I order the former-rice, chutney, curry sauce of potato, spinach and hot pepper, andlentil soup sauce that you mix all together, and then are careful toavoid the hot pepper!! Downed with a glass of ginger sweet tea, justto breath in the mountain air is intoxicating all its own! The rest ofthe trek is a winding pathway UP HILL through almost a \u201cjungle like\u201dpassage, with step stone steps or just winding dirt walkways, stoppingto admire the bright red rhododendrons, Nepali national flower, thatpop into view along the way.Our Hotel Mountain View is perched on a road top, steep climb to makeit there with my backpack, and I could NOT be more excited!!! My roomis about 6 walking floors up, near the top, and a view of the Mt.Everest just from my window!!! I join Depak and meet some Aussies fora few Everest Beers as we watch the sunset over the Himalayas! LovelyBuffet Dinner as I sit at a Nepali table (about 6 inches tall)\u2026 thatis, legs crossed yogi style, sitting on a mat, looking out over thesunset, a fire ball disappearing into the misty mountains.To bed under mounds of warm, thick blankets, after a hot shower in aclean bathroom, cozy, comfy- and FREE INTERNET! Such a bonus! Will beup at 6 a.m. to view the spectacular sunrise\u2026 RIGHT in front of myroom, and then off for a five hour trek to Dhulikhel through terracedhills and local villages tomorrow\u2026Actual Adventures have really goneout of their way to make this small \"trek\" of mine and amazing journeyand a dream come true!!.So friends, No matter if you are looking for a small or large group,or just a single person needing a guide, no matter what your age orskill level, I believe Kedar delivers a highest quality product at aVERY reasonable rate. I am recommending Actual Adventures to everyoneI know who will be taking an adventure to Nepal or areas nearby."

I researched companies on TripAdvisor and settled on Actual Adventures as Kedar was always prompt with replies and eager to answer my many many questions. Originally planned to go with my son but when his plans changed I decided to take a leap of faith and go alone - I had some reservations about being a woman travelling alone but it turned out I had nothing to worry about. Kedar met me at the airport and transferred to the Yak and Yeti Hotel - a very nice start to such a big adventure. I was introduced to Binod on the morning of our departure and as I'd made the mistake of looking up Lukla landings on Youtube, was quite nervous about that leg. Binod put my mind at rest and I think he would have happily held my hand if that had been necessary. The flight to Lukla was like a Disney ride once you get over the nerves of such a tiny plane. We picked up our porter Dilip upon landing and we were off .... the higher in altitude we traveled the more remote and basic the tea houses and you need to be prepared to rough it .... no hot water, but then it's too cold to shower anyway and the food can sometimes be basic compared to what we westerners are used to ... but it's not about that - it's about the experience of a lifetime - and that, it certainly was ! The scenery is breathtaking in every direction and every day gets better. The sense of accomplishment upon ascending Kala Pattar and the most magnificent, close up views of Mt Everest will remain with me as a highlight - also the hardest part of the trek - at 5500 meters the air's pretty thin !! Binod was extremely helpful, cheerful and a complete professional. He was able to answer any question and I felt able to rely upon him for everything and anything, from advising me to use my water bottle as a hot water bottle inside my sleeping bag at night, to showing me which were the safest rocks to step on when crossing frozen rivers. I can highly recommend Actual Adventures and if you're thinking about doing Everest - stop thinking and just DO IT !!"

All details were professionally managed and all questions promptly answered, and any criticism we had was about the standard of accommodation in some of the tea houses, which were often primitive and fundamentally basic but outside the remit of Actual Adventure, of course. We couldn't fault this company and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for your trip in Nepal. We'll use them again for a foray into Tibet next year!"

After emailing back and forth with these companies we chose Kedar Neupane\u2019s company, Actual Adventure, to book with because of Kedar\u2019s prompt, friendly and honest replies to our questions and also their competitive price. This company was also able to accommodate our specific requests for flexibility and could easily tailor the trip according to our requirements. We are very pleased that we chose Actual Adventure and have received excellent service well above what we expected. Kedar met us personally at the airport, which was a really lovely touch, and he organised a great hotel with a balcony within our price range. Kedar also organised transport for us to Jiri and made sure we had a good car (with plenty of leg room as we are both tall) and that we had a safe driver. One thing I was most impressed with was over a misunderstanding regarding the cost of transport. I had thought the cost was one thing and Kedar told me it was another. I assured him his email had said what I thought and he instantly agreed to honour this price. On checking my email I realised I had made the mistake \u2013 but as I say, I was impressed that he had already agreed to honour the price if it was his mistake (which it wasn\u2019t). I was most embarrassed by this and Kedar ended up reducing the price for us. Other personal touches included Kedar suggesting that we buy a sim card at the airport so that he could contact us during our trip, which he did, and Kedar meeting us when we got back from our trip. He even offered to help my husband find things he wished to purchase in Kathmandu. Anyway, our trip went extremely well and we were very impressed with the team that consisted of a guide, assistant guide and porters. The tents used for the base camps and climbing equipment were of a high standard \u2013 as was the food provided at altitude. My husband and I summited Mera Peak on October 19 and the whole experience was wonderful. Thanks Kedar for ensuring our trip was a great success. We highly recommend him and the company Actual Adventure."

Getting into the airport check-in area was a challenge. Checking in is a nightmare itself, there are too much people with oversized baggages and the domestic airport is so cramped. Luckily Mr Kedar had an insider who helped us check-in and helped us through to the boarding area. He also arrange for a porter for us in Lukla, Shambhu Karki.

Good Karma as always!!!Here's a short video of the trip I recorded...you should experience Nepal with Actual Adventure too!! http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xyp2yj_namaste-nepal_travel"

As with many other tourists we wrote to as many companies in Nepal as we could find and Kedar was the first to answer. We had a leghty correspondence before the trip as we were initiall thinking of doing kathmandu and Chitwan, but when Kedar told us that Tibet could be arranged, we changed our program to include Lhasa instead of Chitwan. Kedar was extremely helpful even in the smallest details of our trip. We had a great time in Kathmandu, saw all the major sites and Lhasa was well worth seeing as well (even though the flight Kathmandu-Lhasa was probably the most expensive one hour flight we've ever taken). We had a great time and we strongly recommend Actual Adventure and our friend Kedar."

Kedar answered all emails and questions in the leadup to travelling and gave good advice that was all proven to be correct during the trip.Kedar met us at the airport from our international flight and when we flew back to Kathmandu from Pokhara. We cancelled one flight so he refunded us in cash before he had got the refund from the airline which was great.I walked Annapurna with my dad who is 72. He struggled at times so the guide carried his load as well as his own. This was beyond what he was paid for and he did with good humour and with no hint of a complaint.If I return to Nepal there will be no question that I will use Kedar for all elements of the trip."

From our first inquiry to the very end of our stay in Kathmandu the crew at Actual Adventure made sure our experience was easy and manageable and that we had everything we needed to do exactly what we wanted to do. My friend and I came from the states to hike Everest Base Camp. We googled trekking companies and found Actual Adventure. Kedar responded quickly with all the information we needed and helped us arrange flights from Kathmandu to Lukla and back. When we arrived in Kathmandu we stopped by the office to get everything sorted and Actual Adventure made sure we had everything we needed. They even sent someone with us in a taxi to get the proper permits and passes. he made sure we had everything we needed for a great two weeks and checked in with us when we got back. We had a couple questions during our hike and always got swift answers. The staff at Actual Adventure are dedicated, knowledgable and fun.Had i more time in Nepal, I would have happily turned over the rest of my trip planning to them."

We had a fantastic time and would recommend Nepal Vision to anyone who wants to do this. Prior to the trip we were impressed with the information and advice we were given by email. When we arrived at Kathmandu we were met by our guide, Eaklal, who throughout our time in Nepal was extremely helpful and ensured that we enjoyed the trip and looked after all our needs. The trek itself was an amazing experience, and although we both suffered to some extent from the effects of altitude, we made it to the Base Camp. We would like to especially thank Eaklal and Keshav for providing such a great experience, and would recommend Nepal Vision to anyone. Our trek was in early January and the weather was generally sunny with a few overcast days and one overnight snowfall. The temperature was pleasant for walking in the daytime, but it was extremely cold when the sun went down. The food was basic and the menus were generally the same in all the accommodations, however we had no complaints and all our food was included in the price of the trip which made it very easy and great value for money."

Tashi Delek - I received a season\u2019s greetings card from the Tibet Guest House, reminding me what an unforgettable journey I had in Nepal. Visiting Nepal was life-changing, as clich\u00e9, as it sounds. The trek I completed in Nepal, from Lukla to Tengboche, was amazing\u2014crossing suspension bridges, eating amazing meals that were made to order (be patient), meeting the gracious people of Nepal, being removed (at times) from electronics (i.e. no computers, no televisions)\u2014it really reminded me how out of touch I've gotten with the world. This journey re-connected me with myself and with basic life, mindfully: eating, sleeping, trekking. I have to advise, it is a good idea to physically train before you embark on a trek, especially, if you normally, don\u2019t hike like myself. I recommend trekking poles\u2014they really helped through some of the steep parts of the trek. I also, recommend wearing a hat, buff, sunglasses, as it can get really dusty, with the dirt trails plus, you\u2019re sharing them with dzos. Also, highly recommended is a small day pack to carry while you hike, for toilet paper, water, and snacks. It was very cold in Tengboche\u2014wearing layers is a must, also, having a warm sleeping bag & headlamp, as the guesthouse room did not have heating or lighting available at night. A good pair of high top hiking shoes is a must & staying hydrated is important, due to the altitude. My analogy on the bathroom situation in the guesthouses is, it is like a slot machine, you do not know, whether if it is going to go down or not, until you hit the flush lever. The outhouses along the trekking trails were actually, more pleasant than the western toilets. What really made the trek though was our trek leader (A. Tamang from Three Jewels Adventure)\u2014our leader really educated our group about Nepali culture and had incredible stories to share, so having a good trek leader does make or break the trek. Be aware when you get your visa for Nepal--how long it is valid for. Reason to note this, is that there may be flight delays, due to poor flying visibility, which may leave you stranded for a few more days longer in Nepal than planned\u2014likely, after your visa has expired so be warned. As far as Kathmandu, it was infused with spirituality, with Hinduism and Buddhism co-existing peacefully. Be prepared to bargain for merchandise and note, that sometimes, old, torn rupees may not be accepted by all merchants. Namaste!"

They took care of everything and were highly dependable, flexible and accommodating. It's a great trekking company that tries to make you feel at home when you feel incredibly away from home - plus all proceeds went to Nepal Orphans Home (the orphanage they help to support).Be sure to bring adequate supplies and gear - most of which are available in Kathmandu: Diomox, iodine tablets, garlic pills, grapefruit seed extract, charcoal pills, anti-biotics, lots of TP, wet-wipes, lots of warm gear, a warm sleeping bag (sub-zero), trekking poles, comfortable shoes, chocolate, and dried fruits. Make sure drink plenty of water to stay healthy.You will have an amazing time!"

Didn't have enough time to do the trek and the flight around the Himalayas seemed lame. We found the option to have a freaking helicopter take us up into the Himalayas and we jumped at the opportunity. Granted it is not cheap, but after traveling for 7 months, that is still my best memory and one that I've told countless times to others. We took off from Kathmandu, came up through the clouds and were speechless at the view of the Himalayas. We then got a fantastic view of the the big one, Mount Everest, with the classic wisp of clouds at its peak. After landing at a Sherpa basecamp to \"de fuel\" so we could get higher, we then got another, closer view of the storied mountain, along with some of the other massive mountains that pail in comparison.

            "review": "Bhutan: Breakfree no value added, read to see what we wish would have known prior. Contrary to the great glowing reviews you see for Breakfree, our experience with them was not so nice when arranging an 8 day, 7 night, culture tour visit to Bhutan. Read below to see what we would have liked to know when we started planning the visit to Bhutan.\u2028\u2028Breakfree\u2028Initially Breakfree was very responsive and helpful to our questions. As soon as we paid the deposit however, communication was extremely slow or non existent. I guess that this was due to the unresponsiveness of the visa office. However the slow and non responsive communication increased our frustration and made us unsure of our trip, and the huge cost associated.For the deposit, we refused to write our credit card details an 3-digit code on a piece of paper and send a scan. They offered to accept by PayPal. \u2028\u2028Visa process unclear\u2028Regarding the visa for Bhutan, they would say they would get back to me on date x but it would take several followups by me to get an answer many weeks later. We finally received the visa two weeks before arrival.\u2028\u2028Arrival process unclear\u2028We still didn't know who we would meet in Bhutan or what the process would be upon arrival a day before we arrived! Breakfree finally answered a whatsapp message less than a day before arrival. \u2028\u2028Poor communication made us cautious and unsure\u2028The poor communication with Breakfree brought us to Bhutan in an overly cautious, careful mindset - it set a bad precedent for our week in the Bhutan.\u2028\u2028Good to know:\u2028After arrival, we learned that \u2028- Breakfree is simply an agent for another travel company based in Bhutan\u2028- travel agencies in Bhutan cannot register on tripadvisor, that's why we didn't see any from Bhutan\u2028- Breakfree should have passed us over to the Bhutan agency to answer our questions and arrange things but didn't\u2028\u2028Payment problems\u2028Breakfree also wrote that we could pay by credit card when we arrived. However the Bhutan travel company said this was not correct and they were expecting cash payment in USD. After some arguments, the local company accepted our credit card payment by taking us to a nearby gift shop and charging us the amount plus a fee of 3% (bartered down from 7%). My receipt is from a gift shop. Even though Breakfree sent the name of the local company, Bhutan Wilderness Travel, at the beginning, we had such little contact with them prior to arrival that it was easily forgotten. Fortunately, the manager at the local Bhutan company was in the end helpful, expressed a willingness to help and worked in a problem-solving manner.\u2028\u2028We had a guide and a driver. The driver didn't say much. The guide was young, 30s. He normally does trekking tours which I could see him good for, but for a cultural tour it was not the right fit. He was not fun, his knowledge of many things we saw was little and too general. We even had trouble believing what he was saying. At the end we were not listening much anymore, looking forward to our departure.\u2028\u2028We did meet several people on other tours that expressed their enjoyment. \u2028\u2028Bad start: itinerary was unrealistic\u2028The first thing the guide said upon arrival is that there are mistakes in our itinerary. It was true, the itinerary was not adjusted to the working week. Saturday and Sunday full days were planned, but Saturday is a half working day and Sunday all is closed, most things planned these days were unrealistic. Two long driving days were planned, one he said the road is in too bad of condition to make it to a valley with the planned stop at a fort during its opening hours. The other was too icy because it is so high. The question I'm thinking: is he being lazy or truthful? My only baseline is this itinerary, which we used to select a tour, and now it turned out to be useless.\u2028\u2028Bhutan: not good for independent backpacker explorers\u2028-> To visit Bhutan you must accept that you will be contained with your driver and guide most of the time. If you are an independent backpackers and you don't enjoy the time with your guide, it can feel especially claustrophobic. \u2028\u2028We would recommend to future visitors of Bhutan:\u2028- Bhutan is expensive, daily low season fee of 200 USD and flights around 700 USD each, and a visa fee of 40 USD per person, then a tourism development fund fee of 10 USD per person, put together we paid more than 300 USD per day overall, this is significant - and in our view far too high a price to pay when you consider the cost of living is similar to India. Moreover, we learned that it is customary to tip, 10-20 USD per day, on the higher end for the driver and the lower end for the driver. However, as we were not satisfied with the tour we left no tip.\u2028\u2028Advice if you must go:\u2028- it seems most tours do the same things, book a company through the gov tourism website. Maybe just pick a few at random- we haven't been able to find a reliable review site \u2028- don't use an agent because they will take a cut, meaning less money for your trip, and in our case no value add.\u2028- read lonely planet Bhutan before booking\u2028- stay only for 3 or 4 days max, if you only want to do the cultural tour. We got very tired of forts and seeing the same type of things each day, and being contained by our guide and driver. Unfortunately I don't know how you will ensure the guide you get will be good or not- prepare to spend a lot of money and set low or no expectations\u2028\u2028We liked:\u2028- Tigers Nest, a tough hike but worthwhile \u2028- seeing Phalluses on the front of houses\u2028- seeing Everest during the flight over Himalayas from Delhi (sit at left side window)\u2028- about half the hotels were nice and comfortable \u2028- speaking with locals away from our guide\u2028- hot stone bath and a dinner with a local family, request both to your travel companyOur suggestion for Breakfree: be more straightforward on the status if there's delays, communicate better the process and the next steps, handover properly to the local agent"

My fiance and I just concluded two tours with Breakfree Adventures starting with (1) a 9 day Cultural Tour of Bhutan with their partnering local tour operator Bhutan Wilderness Travel and (2) an 11 day Annapurna Base Camp Trek in Nepal.I'm so glad I found and booked with Breakfree Adventures due to their excellent TripAdvisor reviews and value for money. But what really stood out for me was the warm service provided by their amazing staff all around.BHUTANBhutan is a beautiful, unique and sparsely populated country and we were so glad we got to go while many of its customs are still preserved. Sometimes while standing in a medieval village surrounded by green hills and pine forests or inside the walls of a medieval dzong (Bhutanese fortress / temple / palace) I felt like I was in an Asian version of Game of Thrones. No dragons of course but they do have mythical-looking takins, an animal that looks like a moose with a guinea pig face.Our guide Kesang Tenzin and our driver Tandin made our trip wonderful. They took care of everything and all we had to do was follow them, eat when told to eat, etc. Kesang is really funny and extremely knowledgeable about Bhutan's culture and fantastical history, we nicknamed him the \"Divine Madguide.\" We were also lucky to have Tandin as our driver (he was subbing in to help his brother), since he has excellent English as well and we got to talk about things like American movies and TV shows and generally get a perspective on how young people in Bhutan view the future. As Kesang says, Bhutanese men's hemlines are getting longer while women's hemlines are getting shorter.We loved every sight and activity but our top favorite experiences were: (1) Visiting the Punakha Dzong during a once in a 400 year event when the Zhabdrung's relics were on display for the first time and hundreds of Bhutanese were on line to see them and hundreds more were inside the dzong courtyard chanting beautifully in unison. (2) White water rafting on Class III+ rapids in Punakha's male river (my fiance fell off the raft while riding over a set of rapids called Buddha's Wrath!) (3) Trying their national sport archery and eating a delicious traditional dinner with locals and other tourists at a 300 year old farmhouse in Paro. We are excited to go to Bhutan again in the future and will probably explore the much less touristed eastern region with Kesang.NEPALKathmandu is an overwhelming place to land in for the first time (esp. coming from tiny, quiet Paro), so it was great that manager Bharat and our awesome guide Ramesh Duwadi picked us up from the airport and from then on helped us with anything and everything we wanted or needed in Nepal. On day 1, Ramesh helped us rent and buy our gear for the trek in Thamel. Giving realistic and good advice on what we need and don't need. We are hopeless New York urbanites and this was our first mountain trek, and of course we chose to spend it in the highest mountain range in the world! Going from ~1000m to 4130m and back in 7 days.The ABC trek itself was difficult, A LOT of up and down stairs for most of the ascent and descent days (days 2, 3, 4 and 5 were the hardest for us) but well worth it. Seeing the snow covered peaks was the highlight but we also had fun at the lower altitudes seeing all the Gurung villages, cute farm animals, relaxing at Jhinu hot springs and picking / eating elderberries. Noticing that my fiance was picking tiny wild strawberries, Ramesh introduced us to elderberries. The bushes are tall and full of thorns though both Ramesh and Dipak had no problem climbing up and picking handfuls of berries for us. They both went out of their way to make sure we were safe and had fun every day. Ramesh warned us about stinging nettle at the start of the trek. Nevertheless, on day 2 I touched it accidentally when retrieving my dropped poles. I freaked out at the intense pain and Ramesh immediately found and picked a local plant, created a paste and rubbed it onto my fingers which neutralized the pain and he did this again later in the day when the pain came back. Later on the trek I got unpleasant stomach troubles which made me weak and in pain for 2-3 days, Ramesh gave me antibiotics from his first aid kit and even helped carry my day pack when i was struggling up a snow covered hill approaching ABC. The grips of my sneakers were worn out and I fell or slipped almost a dozen times on snow, mud or slippery rocks. I don't like asking for help but Ramesh helped hold on to my arm over particularly slippery stretches. And Dipak helped me up a few times even with a wobbly 30 kg on his back. Just for fun, my fiance and I tried on Dipak's pack and walked uphill for a minute. So tough! Incredible how Dipak carries this all day long, walks twice as fast as us and never loses his balance (even without any poles) and is never out of breath. It must be the legendary power of dal bhat! By day 6 we had soreness in our knees from all the descending and Ramesh led us in a nice mini yoga session. Definitely ask for him if you would like a yoga + trekking tour.Every night at the tea houses (lodges), we would collapse from exhaustion. We never had to wait for a room and our guide worked hard to make sure we would get a large room and not have to share with other trekkers for more comfort. Our guide and porter would patiently wait and make sure to serve us dinner before they would eat. Ramesh would cut us fresh fruits every night for dessert. None of the other guests would have this. Also these guys are hilarious, we would play Nepalese card games for hours every night: dhumbal which Dipak would suspiciously beat us at almost every time and donkey which results in a lot of slamming the table and each other's hands (sorry other guests!). Day after day, they were becoming our good friends.We were not the easiest customers because on day 1 we requested to change the itinerary so that we could stay 1 night at Annapurna Base Camp, meaning we had to be at least 2 hours ahead of the trekking schedule in the days before. And very last minute on the evening of day 6 we requested a change again to take the bus from Pokhara to Kathmandu one day early in order to spend 2 nights in Kathmandu instead of 1. Our guide Ramesh executed the plan immediately, he made a lot of calls (while we were still in a mountain lodge) to change hotels, cancel our bus and even arranged a heavily discounted private car to take us to Kathmandu on the afternoon of day 7. We were so glad he helped arrange all of this so that we could have a full day to explore Kathmandu's top sights.Ramesh and Dipak made our experience in Nepal seamless. While the 3-8 hours of hiking up and down every day was difficult (even for a marathon runner like me), everything else was made easy thanks to the wonderful people of Breakfree. In addition to the trek, we also had a fun tour of Pokhara's top 4 sights and a nice farewell dinner on our last night in Kathmandu, both were with Ramesh. We want to come back to Nepal later to do the more challenging Everest Base Camp and will definitely request to have Ramesh and Dipak again, they're the best."

When we plan for the trek, we search for some outfitters online and found Breakfree Adventures out of hundreds company around. First, we send an email to them with other 10 agency but few things make us to choose them. First thing was the price compared with other company, it was very reasonable! The gear they provide us also make us think them, as we are living in desert and don\u2019t have gear for the cold weather, they provided for the free of cost which was very good part. Also we start checking their background online and found very positive review everywhere and we choose them.We had many questions before booking with them and they are never tired to reply all our weird questions.The choices of hotels are perfect and bid our expectations. The guide and porters are very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our trip very much and have decided to come back Nepal again for another trek and 100% we will use Breakfree Adventures. Highly Highly recommended tour company."

They organized the whole thing for us very smoothly from airport pick at the beginning till to the end of our holiday.

Among many good points which other reviews have already mentioned, two things which impressed me were the little things they did. Before the actual trek, Dipak went to buy a bag of fruits. We didn't think much about it until meal times..... we were the only group that had fruits! Logistic and preparation was very well taken care of. We spoke to other trekkers and realised their guide didn't book the tea house in advance which resulted in them sleeping in the dining hall! The founder of breakfree, Barat, whom you will correspond with, was very accommodating with our requests in putting together a customised itinerary for us."

            "review": "Flexible. I decided to go to Nepal in the fall of 2015. I wasn't sure exactly what sort of trip I would want but started with the standard Everest Base Camp Trek. I wrote to several trekking companies, all based in Nepal. Some never wrote back. But Bharat Sapkota got back to me right away. His agency, Breakfree Adventures, is one of the few to also have a US phone making communication prior to my visit easy.I am going to confess right now that I was not an easy client. I changed my itinerary several times before my arrival inNepal, and then changed my trek in Nepal when weather conditions turned sour. Through it all Bharat accommodated me every step of the way. I finally ended up doing an 8 day cultural trek in the Himilayas and a 4 day 3 night trip to Chitwan National Park. In all, I had a great time. Prices were very reasonable and my service was excellent. Every guide I had (trek guide, jungle guide, and Kathmandu City guide were great, fluent in English, and flexible. All made sure I had a great time in Nepal.Recommendations for future travelers. Schedule extra days. Bad weather in the Himalayas can make a trek difficult and getting back on time almost impossible. If, at the end of your trek, you still have time, then Breakfree can easily accommodate you with shorter treks and other tourist options. Regardless, Nepal is a great place to visit and my experience with Breakfree was terrific.Photo is of a large Rhino seen on the jeep tour of Chitwan National Park. I strongly recommend the 4 day 3 night tour of the park as it offers more activities and many more wildlife viewing opportunities than the more common 2 night 3 day trek."

They were value-for-money, and the experience from start to end was fantastic. Not only was the logistics like clockwork, the attention we had to all our needs (accommodation, food, special requests etc) were all attended to promptly by Bharat, our hardworking guide Dipak, and our two lovely porters - Dipak and Sundar. Not once did we feel like we were left alone to handle any difficulties, and the camaraderie among us all was awesome.The trek is extremely fun and worth it, and the views are unmatchable. Thanks very much to the Breakfree team!"

We visited Kathmandu, Pokhara, Chitwan and I must say our entire trip was comfortable and hassle free. We literally dint have to bother about anything. Everything was so perfectly planned and arranged by Bharath.Hotels we stayed were actually great, they all served decent breakfast. All transportation like mountain flight, buses, taxis were taken care by Bharat. Must mention about Ramesh, our guide who spent 5 days with us in Pokhara and Chitwan. At the end of the trip, he was not just a guide but our good friend. Am not giving out much details of the trip because I don\u2019t want to spoil your excitement and thrill.

            "review": "Annapurna Circuit Trekking in late November 2015. In 2014, my wife and I did the Annapurna Base Camp Trekking. We were so enthralled by landscapes, people, colours and light that we had to return to Nepal and to attempt the Annapurna Circuit. We were thrilled but also anxious about trekking over 5,416 m altitude (the target altitude on day 11 of the trek), whilst at home in Germany we live just at 45 masl. We booked a package containing two porters and one guide (all English speaking), accommodation and meals, and transportation with Breakfree Adventures. Breakfree Adventures was recommended by my company's office in Kathmandu. After the sudden and tragic events at the circuit in October 2014, we did not wish to do any compromises with the company organising the trek (the readers may recall that a cyclone over India caused heavy snowfall in the Himalaya and trapped trekkers at and around the Thorong-La Pass; it was a sad tragedy and the news went around the world). Our intention was to go with an absolute professional company and experienced and English speaking guide. We checked various sources of customer reviews, including Trip Advisor and all feedback on Breakfree Adventures read impressively positive. Hence, we decided to test Breakfree Adventures. The correspondence was quick and informative. Rates were competitive, and when eventually planning the programme and trekking schedule, Breakfree Adventures was very flexible and included all our suggestions. And indeed we were not disappointed. Guide and porters were professional, very kind and polite, and extremely attentive throughout the trek. We could not have made a better choice. The accommodation arranged was always top range of the guest houses; the budget for food was generous and we were taken well care of from the first day until the last day. We have no hesitation to recommend Breakfree Adventures as a trekking tour operator and organizer for any such tours in Nepal.As most trekkers, we did the Circuit anti-clockwise. We started on Nov 23 for a 14-day tour inclusive travel from Kathmandu to Besi Sahar (by vehicle) and return travel from Jomsom to Pokhara and the day thereafter from Pokhara to Kathmandu (both by air). The trekking itineraries of the Circuit are all similar but the breath-taking part of the Annapurna Circuit definitely starts in Upper Pisang with beautiful vistas of the mountain range and the valley (Annapurna II is just opposite). Photographers can live out all passion and take beautiful night and early morning shots of the Annapurna range (ideal before sunrise). Note, Upper Pisang is definitely worth staying a 2nd day. There is much to see and to discover. The Himalaya Hotel (just below the monastery in Upper Pisang) is a very commendable choice to stay. The views from their balcony and dining room are spectacular.Another stop to remember was Brakha, which is just about 30 trekking minutes before Manang. No question, Manang is a must town to visit and most trekkers stay in Manang. But our reason for staying in Brakha and not in Manang was the easier access and ascent to the Ice Lake (a climb of 1,200 altitude meters) and on the other side of the valley the reach of the Milerepa Cave and the Glacier Viewpoint. When staying in Brakha, an excellent choice to stay is the Himalayan Lodge, a superb guest house with comfortable rooms (toilet and bathroom attached to the rooms) and an exquisite cuisine with surprising international flair. It out-rated all guest houses we stayed before during the trek. Yak Kharka is another perfect spot for night photographers. It is just one night before Thorung Pedi and Thorong-La Pass next morning. I took a series of good shots of the Milky Way before midnight (a tripot is a must). The lower mountain range in Yak Kharka is a fantastic foreground for astrophotography and the clarity during the night was fantastic (early December).Overall the Annapurna Circuit is doubtless one of the world\u2019s most spectacular treks and we will long remember the days. If you have the time, take a rest day at the Fishtail Lodge in Pokhara, a superb hotel on an island in the Phewa Lake and near the main commerce street in Pokhara. It is a beautiful spot to find the sense of time again after having lost it during the trek."

We chose break free adventure as they were rated very high in trip advisor. However, you are not sure how it will all work until you have a positive experience....I have to tell you that the reviews were accurate. Bharath came to the airport to receive us and dropped us at the hotel, made arrangements for exchange of currency arranged for reliable guides for both the city tour and the hike. Bharath is very professional honest and trustworthy. He is intent on making his customers happy.... Just like I the unted states, customer is very important for bharath.As far as the trek, we had an excellent Sherpa called Dorji and he was amazzzzzing..... Very strong carried about 60 pounds on his back and still hiked much faster then us. The Lat two days he came back after dropping the luggage at the teahouse and came back and carried both my sister and my backpack.... We wer amazed how little gear he had so we gave a lot of our gear to him.We did the hike over 6 nights 7 days. It was an amazing journey. Very safe trails. The people of Nepal are very nice and honest people. The food was excellent at tea houses. Our guide had bought with him some fresh fruits to feed us and that also helped. My sister and I were able to achieve our goal of seeing EBC and kalapathar. Overall I had a great experience with break free adventure and recommend them. Also, Nepal seems like a safe country for single women to travel. Amazing place! Amazing people! Talented piolets and beautiful mountains."

Nothing was too much for him and he answered every little question we had as quickly as he could. As for the price of the trip and what it included, just outstanding really what can I say! We were collected from the airport by private car and taken on a full day tour of Kathmandu the following day. Our guide was fun and informative and after the initial shock of the city, this tour really opened up our eyes to the cultural, hidden beauty of Kathmandu. The following day we headed off on our 6 hour drive to Pokhara which would be the base for the start and end of our Poonhill trek. We met our guide Ramesh and porter Shree Krishna who I wholeheartedly take my hat off to for carrying out bags with a permanent smile on his face!! This trek wasn't too tough as treks go in Nepal but it pushed my comfort boundaries that's for sure and I loved it so much. Seeing the local people go about their tough daily lives with smiles on their faces really made us take a step back and think about life. Ramesh was great, answering my never ending questions, putting up with my moans about the cold and holding my hand all the way down a serious amount of icy steps on the way to Tadapani, such a star :-) On the way back to Kathmandu, we paid a little extra (and I mean a little) to take the 25 minute flight on the smallest plane I've ever been on but thoroughly worth it! Such was the personal touch that Bharat likes to include in his tours, he collected us from the airport himself, took us out for our final dinner in the evening and back to the airport early the following morning. I recommend you book with Breakfree Adventures wholeheartedly for a personal, incredibly good value for money and life changing trip to Nepal,Bharat and his team should be so proud of themselves for the incredible job they're doing."

We had a great time in Chitwan and were very happy with our accommodations and the things we did there. Our tour of Kathmandu hit most of the spots we wanted, except one, due to some miscommunication on our part. Our guide was very knowledgable about the different sites, but was very quiet and had to be prompted to tell us information - not a problem, just a different style. He took us to a Thanka shop at one of the sites that was great and much better (more reasonable prices and much less pressure to buy something) than the one another guide (not through this company) had taken us to. Overall we were very happy using Breakfree Adventures to book our tours in Nepal."

We had full flexibility from the first day and were able to adjust the itinerary and trekking pace to suit our progress acclimatizing to the altitude. We made it to the top of Gokyo Ri at 5,360m - hard to imagine a more spiritual and spectacular place. Toward the end of the trek, we added on side day-hikes to the Khumjung and Thomo villages and monasteries - thus adding a big cultural element to our trek. Highly recommended. Also climbed up the ridge above Machermo during an unscheduled but necessary additional day of acclimatization on the way up. Well worthwhile with views of Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, Cholatse, Taboche, Kantega, Thamserku and Cho Oyo. Breakfree Adventures did a great job. Russell Goodman and Sarah Ellwood."

Maybe we can go from city to city using tourist bus. But after inquiring to chitwan safari tour, I came across Breakfree Adventures who can arrange the whole tour for us. Before we appointed Breakfree Adventures, I raised a lot of questions about Nepal and the trip, and luckily Bharat Sapkota, the owner, was very patient in answering each one of my question.After a few weeks back and forth email communication, we finally agree with the offer and gave down payment. It was the best decision that we could possibly make.The guide assigned to us (Ramesh Duwadi) was really friendly, patient and very helpful. Never get tired of our constant nagging to have food or snack. When we cannot go to one of the site that was in our itinerary because of the landslide, he quickly thought of another place that we can visit as a replacement. It's this type of quick thinking that make us appreciate him even more. Furthermore, Breakfree Adventure also help us even after their service was finished. When the airlines lost my friend's luggage on the first day in Nepal and the luggage finally arrived at Kathmandu after we had left Nepal, they help to arrange for the luggage to be sent to her home.I really enjoy my visit in Nepal thanks to Breakfree Adventure and I recommend this tour if anyone ever want to visit Nepal.

First impression is everything, and out of the numerous companies I had contacted concerning my trip, Bharat wrote back exactly what I wanted to hear. Other companies would just send you random itineraries. Not Bharat! He explained to me everything and even warned me that it might rain and plans might change but he was ready for it! We took a 6-day itinerary and let me tell you we did not have 1 useless minute! Jam packed with everything that we might think of: Bungy jumping, rafting, paragliding, sunrise/sunset-ing, elephant riding, sight seeing, hiking, and even eating! Bharat's choice were perfect, and what made it all better was that we had a personal car, with a driver AND a tour guide! Our driver was exquisite, Nomarash (I hope I spelled it correct!), who was able to drive 5 hours straight sometimes with one break so that we don't waste time, and MAN he's a talented driver!!! Our tour guide Ramesh became family, as we shared numerous hours together and learned so much about this beautiful country! We couldn't have asked for anyone better! I could talk ages about this trip, but I wouldn't want to spoil it for you! My final note would be that we paid a very fair price for all the hard work these gentlemen have done! That's why I'm going again next month, and every month I have the chance to, because Nepal is one of the most beautiful places you can see in life, and Breakfree Adventures will always be there to show me the real beauty this country offers.

Above all, the guide is very well informed with the history of Bhutan, and provides clear and easy explanations whenever you visit historical sites. Unlike other tour packages in other countries (based on my experience), they will not take you to shops where they will induce you to buy pricey handicrafts. The entire schedule is focused on your satisfaction. The guide will also modify the schedule upon your last-minute request. For me, instead of visiting more temples, the guide allowed me to have a tea with a lama, and we exchanged various conversations on life, religion, and everything. An unforgettable experience!I know 250 USD a day may seem expensive, it is definitely worth it.There are many Bhutan-related tourism agencies out there, and there could be better ones. But if you do not want to waste time choosing a travel agency, I can tell you things cannot go wrong if you choose to travel with Breakfree Adventures. Travelling to Bhutan may be complicated, but things get a lot easier when travelling with the agency."

I got through to him less than 2 weeks before we arrived in Nepal but he was able to arrange everything very quickly and our tour went smoothly. We basically had a free hand in what we wanted to do (I already had an itinerary from my research and from talking to other tour operators), but he also suggested additional activities that we liked. I picked Breakfree because they quoted the lowest price and required the least downpayment (among operators I equally did not know), but had a great rating on trip advisor. It was certainly the right choice.Our guide Shankar was very accommodating and knowledgeable about the sites we visited. He also acted as our expert photographer and sometimes haggler. He was always waiting for us ahead of time, and concerned with even where we would take dinner after our tour for the day.Our driver was always smiling and an expert in maneuvering in Nepal's tight spaces and twisting mountain roads.The hotels we stayed in were clean and comfortable. In the one case where I asked for a different hotel than the one recommended, the one Breakfree recommended seemed better. At least it looked much nicer from the outside and was on the lakefront.When our mountain flight to Everest got cancelled, we had no trouble getting our money back as Breakfree was the one who processed the refund on our behalf.I also liked the personal touch of the traditional Nepali dinner on our final night before Bharat personally took us back to the airport.In summary, Breakfree was a delight to deal with even before getting to Nepal, and we were very well taken-cared of from landing until takeoff thanks to Breakfree Adventures."

Not only did he organize an exceptional trek, he was extremely hands-on once our plans unexpectedly changed. When our trek was cut short due to my father's health, Bharat visited the hospital personally many times to check up on my father, and organized additional activities for us within Nepal to make up for time lost. He treated us more like family than clients. Our guide Ramesh Duwadi was nothing short of amazing as well. He was extremely patient and understanding throughout the entire trip - just an exemplary guide who made our comfort and enjoyment his top priority. I would urge anyone to plan their visit to Nepal through Breakfree Adventures. They should be the model for other tour operators to follow."

I was extremely happy with my female guide Tshering Pelden who proved to be an intelligent, motivated and very skilled guide with a warm heart and great sense of humour. My driver, Ugyen Tenzin was also extremely trustful and very nice company. I travelled around for 14 days (Paro, Thimpu, Punakha, Bumthang, Mongar, Trashigang, Trongsa, Gangtey) and every day was great. I have only good memories!"

Pretty last minutes(a week before departure) booking to Nepal via Breakfree through Bharat turned out to be one of the best tour ever! The booking process took less than few hours because Bharat know exactly what itinerary I'm looking for and arranged accordingly, in a very reasonable price(cost breakdown has been attached). I must say his efficiency is very impressing! Despite the itinerary need to be changed after I arrived in Kathmandu due to some cancellations from Last Resort(for Bungy & Rafting), Bharat still manage to rearrange a whole new itinerary(for different dates) which include all the activities I requested before, plus an extra tour to Pokhara. The necessary changed of transportation mean from tourist bus to private car(due to time constraint) to access Pokhara, Chitwan and Last resort just cost me a little extra, definitely a great favor from Bharat. Other extra touch including the motorbike tour to Nagarkot and Bhaktapur, and truly shows the hospitality of Nepali!Accommodations arranged in the tour were all in very good locations and I was really well taking care of (I travel solo). Literally, you just need to book the tour, fly to nepal and simply enjoy the wonderful time!"

Later that night Bharat took us to traditional Nepali restaurant with cultural performance and a great time was had by all, with lots of great food eaten and drinks drunk. It was like having a friend in the city take you out showing you the sights of his home town!

I contacted and expected to use the same trekking company I used previously, but on a random search I discovered BreakFree Adventures- and I'm so glad I did. Our trek on the Manaslu Circuit could not have been better managed, coordinated, guided and portered. I have limited vision and knew that the satisfaction of my trek was going to depend to a large degree on my guide's attention and genuine concern for my well-being, as well as my friend's. After reading a previous review by a deaf person, I decided to work with Breakfree. From the beginning, Bharat provided excellent and timely service, even when we needed to delay our trip just two weeks prior to our scheduled arrival. We were very pleased with how he competently handled logistical changes to accommodate our needs. Our guide Tonka went above and beyond, assisting me on difficult trail sections, and providing all kinds of cultural insights as we walked through the mountains; and he's not afraid to jump into a busy teahouse kitchen and whip up a dynamite meal! He's a gem of a guide. He, and our porters, took their jobs seriously, and we shared a lot of laughs with all of them. I couldn't recommend Breakfree enough, and hope after reading this review, you put your trust in them for your trek/trip...you'll be happy you did!"

Bharat Sapkota and his people were where they said they would be every time.Our Kathmandu guide, Bijay Ramal, patiently fielded our questions and made sure we saw the four big sites: Durbar Square, Swayambhunath, Boudhanath and Pastupinath.But it was in doing what it could to salvage our trek that Breakfree proved its worth. We had a five day window to trek in the Everest area, but an unprecedented return of the monsoon shut down flights to the starting point, Lukla, for the entire time. After our flight was grounded the first morning, Bharat and trekking guide Ramesh Duwadi, anticipating events, got our tickets switched to Pokhara for that afternoon, so we could trek in the Annapurna area.Unfortunately, the weather was bad there, too, so we trekked five days in clouds and rain. But Ramesh was invaluable. He grew up in a small village, so he could explain everything we saw, from architecture to farming practices to hydroelectric projects. He sometimes went ahead to get us a room at a tea house before the crowds showed up. His English was excellent and he made friends with everybody we met along the way.Breakfree even threw in two extra nights at a nice hotel in Pokhara and Ramesh finally managed to get us a view of the Himalayas from Sarangkot the morning before our flight back to Kathmandu. Then, even though we didn't leave Nepal until five days later, Bharat picked us up from our hotel at 6 am and drove us to the airport."

We asked our driver, Nabaraj (who is a very great guy I highly recommend, by the way), to ask Bharat if we could just change our itineraries on the fly like that. He made it work. He just gave us a price quote for the added trip the car was going to take and agreed to wait for us to get back to Kathmandu for the payment.

BHARAT provided the necessary information for our group to make informed decisions, concerning all aspects of the tours including hotel selections, modes of transportation and must see places.We all agreed that the trip could not have been better. We visited Kathmandu, Chitwan, Pokhara, Sarangkot and Dhampus. From the moment we arrived at the Kathmandu airport, we were well escorted. There was not one issue with transportation, the accommodations, tours, and guides. We originally were traveling from Pokhara to Kathmandu by the Tourist bus, but because of a strike, we needed to travel by air instead. This change was handled without a trouble. Tour guides were always prompt and efficient in getting us to the required locations. The choice of hotels offered by Breakfree Adventures allows us to choose a variety of accommodations. In each instance, the hotel personnel were helpful, efficient, and friendly. Rooms were always ready upon our arrival, clean, and above our expectations.Also, during this 7 days tours, there were several misplaced items amongst members of our group - our bag, passports, and even a camera were mistakenly left in hotel rooms. In each case, the items were retrieved by a Breakfree Adventures representative and either brought to us or sent to our next destination.The tour guides were superb, especially Ramesh. We could count on the tour guides to provide us with the local history, culture as well as shopping and restaurant tips, and visits to the local market.We loved every aspect our Nepal tour and appreciate all that everyone at Breakfree Adventures Nepal did to make our journey an excellent.

From the very first email, Bharat was always quick to respond with answers to questions regarding the itinerary, bookings, hotel arrangements, visa and flight information, etc. We were very happy to learn that Bharat would join us on our tour. Our hotels, chosen from the government list which included the Metta Spa and Resort, Meri Puensam, and Peaceful Resort, were charming with clean, large rooms, hot showers, and wonderful food for breakfast and dinner. Our lunches at local restaurants were also excellent. We were pleasantly surprised by the variety, freshness, and delicious preparation of every meal. Our tour guide, Bull, was extremely knowledgeable regarding the history and customs of past and present Bhutan. Our driver, Tenzin, was extremely proficient at maneuvering through the winding, mountainous roads, always making us feel comfortable and safe. We shared meals with Bharat, Bull, and Tenzin which only added more enjoyment to our trip, since we came to know more about the personal lives of the Bhutanese whose incredible country everyone should come to know. We do recommend to everyone that the hike to Tiger's Nest be taken a few days after arriving so the body adjusts to the altitude change. Our 22 year old son made it up to the Nest and back in three hours total time with Bull on the second day of our visit. But then again, he is 22 and his parents are NOT...Overall, Breakfree Adventures is a sure winner when considering a trip to the most glorious of countries, Bhutan.

The guides worked very hard to allow us to have space and at the same time provide any level of explanation which we desired concerning many varied and exotic topics. Where do you start to describe the adventure? My wife and I flew over the Himalayas and got to enter the cockpit where I actually stood when the plane turned towards Mt. Everest. It was spectacular. Unfortunately if you come to Nepal in late May or beyond, the Monsoon is just around the corner and we were denied ground level views of Everest from Nagarkot. Chitwan was great. We saw 10 rare one horned rhinos. One even charged our jeep but was driven off by a very brave tour guide. We saw a sloth bear that was digging into a termite hill and a variety of crocodiles in the streams. There were more bird species than one could count. Our guide in Chitwan, Hari, was the best that anyone could imagine. He arranged a very special tour on elephant back, so we could leave the noisy tourists and get a very intimate look at the jungle. In Pokhara we were again denied a very good view of the Annapurna Range, but things cleared up enough one evening to get a very good impression of just how majestic these mountains are. Amazing! I could go on and on. Please look to the pictures I posted and from others. They are indicative of what you have to look forward to.

The weather conditions was bad however we enjoy the green scenery everywhere, boating in the fewa lake was amazing. The tandem flight over the fewa lake was the highlight of the day. We will definitely recommend these guys who plan to spend a time in Pokhara and around."

Stayed in Chitwan, Pokara, and Kathmandu and they made excellent recommendations....had it not been for them I would not have visited Pokara to see the sunrise, lake, and have an opportunity to paraglide. All of the guide were very helpful, spoke English, and were on time. Overall is was a perfect holiday and would recommend the company to anyone traveling to Nepal. It was nice to have someone else plan and arrange transfers, hotels, tours, and activities."

Our guides (Aleesh in KTM and Ramesh in Pokhara) were helpfull and answered to our questions.If I can say something, it is that maybe one day for KTM sightseeing is not enough and quite speed and it's worth taking your time! ;)We had a very nice trip.Thank you Barhat, we hope to see you again soon!"

It was a private trip and Krystyna who organised it thought it would be a bit of an adventure if in doing the Manaslu Circuit we could also do Tsum Valley. She researched local companies and decided on Breakfree Adventures. After the trek one realises how important it is to do the research before booking.In my view I found Breakfree Adventures to be a highly professional company. Bharat the manager couldn\u2019t have been more helpful in organising the trek to our specifications and being ever vigilant to our needs while we were in Nepal.The guide Ramesh, the Sherpas the kitchen staff and the pony handlers did a marvellous job. Putting up tents, cooking meals (tasty and lots of it), serving us, even on some occasions one of the kitchen staff would meet us on the track with a warm drink. For all our needs I found the staff to be patient conscientious and caring.Ramesh was incredible. He was very dutiful, watchful and when needed went that extra distance. Unfortunately two of our group had to be helicoptered out through no fault of Breakfree. Ramesh on both occasions in organising the helicopters went to great efforts to get our companions out as soon as possible. On one occasion he made a helipad with his bare hands. On another occasion he dashed from one small village down to another so he could make contact. When our companions were flown to Kathmandu Bharat was very attentive, booking them into an appropriate hospital and maintaining almost constant contact while they were in hospital and on their discharge. I can only give full praise to Ramesh the Sherpas and Kitchen staff in taking care of us throughout the trek.I would highly recommend Breakfree Adventures to anyone who wishes to experience the beauty of Nepal or any other places that Breakfree Adventures operates in."

Firstly there was Bharat, who eased the way for us in these unfamiliar surroundings. He personally escorted us to and from the airport and booked us into local tours before and after the trek. He went out of his way to accommodate all the needs of two of us who had to be evacuated by helicopter. I was one of them, stricken by altitude sickness on day 17. He dealt with the hospital and the insurance issues, and organised accommodation and activities for me over the few remaining days before driving me to meet up with my fellow trekkers at the final camp. Then there was Ramesh, our guide, who was unfailingly good-humoured, efficient, conscientious and patient with us at all times, and handled the few emergencies that arose with admirable resourcefulness. And the porters, cooks, and general camp helpers, who carried enormous loads on their backs, strapped onto their foreheads, striding past us as we plodded at a much slower pace along the trail. And finally the line of sixteen gentle, patient donkeys and their minders, who bore our luggage and all the camp paraphernalia. All-in-all it was an unforgettable experience and I have already recommended Breakfree Adventures to friends considering such activities in the future."

The itinery gave us time in Kathmandu , Pokhara and Chitwan , we enjoyed them all. The range of activities that he planned for us were varied and included , city tours , a 5 day trek in Annupurna region , paragliding in Pokhara , elephant safari and canoe trip in Chitwan , then back to Kathmandu for Everest flight , cultural dance evening and souvenir shopping . Bharat and his team looked after us , nothing was too much trouble . Ramesh was our guide for the 5 day trek , with Shondra our porter , Ramesh' guide psychology and encouragement helped me complete the trek - they even gave me a certificate of my achievement . The accomodations were varied , some more \"rustic\" than others , all had hot water for showers and menus to suit even fussy eaters.Everyone we met was so friendly , there was quite a camaraderie amongst the trekkers , comparing aches and pains , blisters etc .The local people we met were all very welcoming with big smiles . Nepal itself is a beautiful country , I intend to go back hopefully later this year. I wont hesitate to get Bharat to plan my next trip."

Namaste!Dear Bharat,It is time that I wrote to thank you for everything you did to ensure the success of my trek, I realise now that a 25 day trek was a huge undertaking but it was one of the best experiences of my life. The choice of guide and porter was vital and Ram, the guide, was outstanding. His English was first-rate and he was excellent at making sure that I was having a good time. He encouraged me when needed and left me alone at other times. He was full of useful information and I soon realised that his judgement was always good. When he suggested that we stop to have lunch, it meant that we needed a rest before tackling something or other! Several other trekkers commented on how efficient and thoughtful he was and I noticed that many people asked him for advice or information, rather than their own guides. Many trekkers were unhappy with their guides so I was delighted that Ram was so helpful, informative and supportive.Nurbu, the porter, was amazing; at times I lost sight of him and wondered where he was - only to discover that he had taken a short-cut and was way ahead of us. He was always helpful and light-of-heart; he managed my rucsac with no problems.Your organisation was excellent, as well. I didn't believe it when you appeared with my permit for Mustang in Muktinath; you had promised to get it to me but I didn't realise, even then, what a long and hard journey it was to reach a place so far from Kathmandu. You seemed to enjoy it, too!Please feel free to use what I have written as a recommendation. As a 60 year old lady, this trek could have been impossible; it was totally due to your organisation and your choice of people that I completed it and enjoyed every day. It was often tough but I never doubted that I would complete the trek.I will try to send you some photos but I am not sure how fast the connection it. I will wend them separately.Yours,Pat SmithUK"

Nepal is chaotic, especially Kathmandu and the airport. We were very pleased that we chose a guide rather than do it on our own as we normally would. Bharat was very helpful in organising the trip including timetable changes. Also very useful in assisting with updates on flights in Nepal as weather conditions made things difficult. Our actual guide was Ramesh. He was just outstanding. Very knowledgeable and patient. He knew when to talk and when to let us enjoy the serenity. They were very flexible in how we spent our time each day. They assisted with shopping and showed a nice restaurant where we ate several times. Nepal is not an advanced country, there are frequent power shortages, the internet is unreliable, the pollution in Kathmandu is very bad so be prepared for that. But it is a wonderful country to visit.I constantly think of the high mountains and the truly magnificent scenery - and I haven't forgotten the climb into Namche Bazaar, talk about hard work. The flight to and from Lukla is not to be missed, especially the take-off from Lukla. A truly wonderful holiday and we will be back. An excellent guide company and I totally recommend."

Overall, my friend and I had a wonderful trip and great experiences both on the \"business\" side with Bharat and with our guide Ramesh. \"Business\" SideBharat was very responsive with emails and helping determine good options for our time frame. Payment was mostly straightforward, but I'd recommend not using PayPal as it looked like it hit Break free with a large fee. We ended up with an extra day in Kathmandu due to reasons detailed below, and Bharat was very helpful in changing reservations and getting us a driver.TrekWow!!! Langtang is beautiful, and highly recommend this area for a more off the beaten path experience. Given it was March and a less popular trekking region, we had trails to ourselves and mostly empty tea houses. Ramesh was everything you could ask for in a guide: professional, fun (we played lots of rummy and \"donkey\" at night), and knowledgeable. Given that a large part of the experience is dependent on your guide, I can't stress enough how lucky we felt to have Ramesh with us. He definitely seemed top tier relative to other guides we met on the trail. He was always making sure we were in-taking enough calories (Orange \"tea\" and cookies became a nice way to finish up the days hike) He also was very cognizant of weather, and had us skip a day of trekking around Lake Gosainkunda due to an unexpected 6 inches of snow. He did a good job of communicating this later on and working with Bharat to plan a day in Kathmandu. With that said, Ramesh also met us at the airport and was our \"in town\" tour guide. Great all around!Misc:My friend and I are both males ~ 30 years of age and in pretty good shape. We carried our own packs and still finished most stretches of the trek in 20-30% less time than Ramesh seemed to normally go. (He of course has no problems with any pace!) Had we known this, we may have tried to do a longer (distance) wise trek ahead of time."

Don't be put off by the fact that Breakfree Adventures offer a slightly lower price - their service is first class. Bharat was quick to respond to any concerns I raised, he personally ensured I was met in Bhutan despite my flight being delayed several hours due to weather. He gave me a substantial refund on his original quote a.s he had been able to get a cheaper flight for me. Once again I would recommend him without reservation"

When I arrived, I had issues getting access to my cash, and no currency exchange at the airport would accept my Indian Rupees to convert to an accepted currency to pay for my Visa. Breakfree met me outside and gave me a huge bailout so that I could get my Visa worry-free and just added it on to my bill at the end. All my transportation was reliable and on-time, the accommodation was cost-sensitive yet great, and the sub-contracted company provided high quality bikes that were well-maintained with a great guide who spoke good English. The whole package including all pickup/drop-off, accommodation, bike, guide, etc. was less than $600. Very reliable and safe...highly recommend."

Bharat, the manager pick me up from the airport on my arrival, give briefing about the trekking and give the answer what I have since it was my first visit to Nepal. Now I can tell everyone that Nepal is safe place to travel even you are young single lady. No problem when you have a reliable trekking crew. My guide was Govinda who had more than 10 years experience on leading treks in the Himalaya. He is very helpful, honest and informative. The porter Tenzin is very strong, he carries my bags + his bag as well and walk much faster than me. I would highly suggest this company to everyone who is planning to visit Nepal for their adventure holiday. Maria TranquillaBarcelona, Spain"

My guide, Govinda, was also very professional, friendly and helpful - it was much like trekking with a good friend, but one who already knew the way! I have never trekked with a private guide before, but would certainly do so again - I had the freedom to dictate the pace and the tea stops as well as the benefit of Govinda's knowledge and experience.I chose Breakfree on a friend's recommendation and would definitely pass this recommendation on to anyone else. I can't wait to go back, and will certainly use Breakfree Adventures for my next trip.Thank you!"

Bharat himself met Glenn and Lynne at the airport and accompanied them to hospital in the ambulance and stayed with them during assessment, and until Glenn was comfortable in a private room. He remained in constant contact and as this incident curtailed our part of the trek Bharat arranged other trips for us, which included a very pleasant evening having dinner with his family.

I knew my guide Ramesh Duwadi from two years ago, as well as Bharat Sapkota who now manages Breakfree Adventure Travel. From planning all the details through online chats and e-mails, I could not have asked for better or more responsive service. I started the trek with my friend Dennis who, unfortunately, had to drop out after 6 days of struggling with sleeplessness caused by altitude sicknes. We took him to the hospital in Lukla. Bharat was able to get him on a flight to Kathmandu and on to the U.S. the same day. For the rest of the trip, Ramesh and our porter Suria continued to do everything possible to make my experience unforgettably beautiful. Suria always had a welcoming smile when we talked, particularly when I struggled up the infamous Chola Pass. When I had to change the itinerary because bronchitis prevented my from going to Gorak Shep, Ramesh helped me by carrying my day pack for the rest of the trip. When we got to Lukla, hoping to fly out, we got stuck for 7 days because of dense fog. Ramesh made sure I lacked no comfort available. I wish Bharat, Ramesh and Suria all the best and am grateful for all the excellent service and support I received. I also wish Bharat a lifetime of happiness with his bride. They will be married at the end of the month.Bruno WalkerOakton, VA - USA"

The friendly Nepalese to help you when you get lost, and you will, the history of it all and the peaceful way so many faiths co-exist is a lesson to the world. But although the guide books tell you to haggle on prices, do you really want to bearing in mind their standard of living compared to yours? A yak wool shawl that takes one person 10 days to make- how much should you pay for it, how much would you want to be paid for 10 days work? Strongly advise going vegetarian and beware lassi a yogurt drink( i may have got Salmonella from it, or other food at a banquet)Use a city guide to explain the customs and get the most out of a day's visit,& they expect a good tip. Fog stops flights frequently though so leave some flexibility in your return flight home !Kantipur Temple House is a great place to stay, beautiful architecture, good food and an atmosphere of peace and tranquility which is great after the noise and explosion of sounds, smells and sights which bombard the senses.

It has been always a great new and exciting experience. We have seen wonderful landscapes in remote regions, from Dhaulagiri to Annapurna and from Everest to Manslu, several ethnic groups with their different cultures, religions and traditions. But we also had often to face problems with some travel agencies, or guides, or porters. So, we have acquired a reasonable experience.This year we had planned a trekking to Makalu Base Camp. We started to evaluate among of 14 of the most known agencies in Kathmandu, comparing the service offered, and how it was proposed, the costs and references. Finally we selected the agency \u201cTrekking Team\u201d. Beyond their very kind and friendly manner, the costs were reasonable, not too cheap and not to high, we had time to discuss about our requests and their program and service were good detailed and the organization seemed to be serious and well experienced.So, indeed, we found the best and most serious travel agency we have ever had in all these years. Everything had been perfectly organized as we had agreed and without any \u201csurprise\u201d. The guide was very experienced for this trekking and, as the porters, was always very kind and helpful and able to manage everything. Alas, though everything was well arranged, this year, though it was already October, the Monsoon had decided to stay longer than it usually does, and after some days of walking among the clouds and under heavy rain, we decided to stop and to change our program. It was a bitter moment for us and great disappointment. Since climatic conditions didn't depend from the agency we had of course to face all the expenses of the trekking without reaching our aim. But by this occasion we had the chance to learn more about the efficiency and organization of our agency. Before coming back to Kathmandu, we informed Mr. Ram Pathak about our problem and asked him to organize for us a journey to Lhasa. In few days, he arranged everything. And all this without charging extra costs. We had just to pay the real expenses of the tour (visa for China, flight ticket, agency and Hotel in Tibet). So, when we reached Kathmandu everything was ready and we could immediately leave for Tibet. It was not the goal we had originally programmed, but also wonderful and not less exciting.Now Makalu has been sitting there for millions of years, so we hope it will wait for us for the next two or three years and, if we\u2019ll try again to reach it, we know we have already our special agency \u201cTrekking Team\u201d which will organize everything for us.Many thanks to Mr. Ram Pathak and Hari Dev Pathak (manger of Trekking Team), Mr. Ram Shing Tamang (guide) and our four porters."

Didn't need guide but only porters, I found Trekking Team from top 10 tripadvisor list, they provide good cost USD 15/day. Except trekking permit, I also bought Lukla flight tickets via Trekking Team. They charged a little commission but it's totally worth it as Ram helped me to get early flight seat to minimize cancellation risk. I changed my fly back dates twice when I was in the mountain, and Ram did great help to deliver the changes. It's very reassuring to know you are in good hand worry free when you are in the mountains.I even asked his help for money exchange, and Ram offered me good rate. Due to my hotel is near airport rather than city center, Ram personally brought the tickets and USD to the hotel I stayed. I couldn't ask for better service than this.As for porters, my friend and I hire 2 porters as we want to have the flexibility to split when needed. And indeed, my body didn't get used to high altitude as quick as my friend, so we split after Luza at about 4300m. Both porters are good and responsible. They know the route well, and they always stay with us no matter how slow we are. At the beginning, I hoped to have some distance. But the higher I got, the more I appreciated porter's close by. I might need to get thick coat from the bag any time when weather change. Sometimes i'd find some beautiful spot to enjoy the view in stead of hurrying ahead, and the porter, his name is Shree, just waited patiently.Without Shree, I could never hike up to Gokyo Ri which is over 5300m. He carried everything I needed, including a thermal pot of hot water that I asked from the lodge.I highly recommend Trekking Team for independent trekkers. You'll find you are in good hand with nothing to worry about except your own physical strength and AMS. Porters English are very limited, so don't expect to get advice from them. You can have freedom of how long you want to walk, which lodge you want to stay. Flexibility is important as I really found that every person has different pace to get used to high altitude. And I met quite a few people giving up as they felt sick. Don't push to stick with a fixed schedule, it might cost you turning back in the end.If anything to improve, I hope to get assurance that porters can eat well along the trek. This became my pressure and sometimes I need to pay for porter's meal with tourist price, because some lodges don't provide decent meal for porter. Especially when I felt sick and lost appetite, I had to skip meal. But it seems if I don't order, then porter has nothing to eat."

I liaised with ram Pathak a lot before our arrival and he answered all my initial questions which was really helpful. Ram's team was seamless and picked us up from the airport waiting a long time for our flight and ram was there to meet us at the hotel and give us all the information. He organised money for us. The hotels in Kathmandu and pokhara were a really good standard and a great way to start the trek. We did the trek to Poon Hill as a couple with our guide Abilas limbu and porter Dhurba. Abilas was fantastic and very knowledgable about the area and letting us know the route. He was amazing in the tea houses catering to our every need. He had the perfect combination of being friendly but also letting us have our own time to relax. Dhurba was also very cheerful and happy to help. Trekking team went over and above to help us and we cannot fault their service. Friendly and very reliable. We would recommend very highly as it made our trip go so smoothly and took all the hassle away for us. Very good!"

Reached out to the Trekking Team (i.e. Ram Pathak) based on these TripAdvisor reviews and was very pleased in my experience - responsiveness via email, virtual & in-person professionalism, knowledge of the area, and price.Was greeted at the hotel by Ram Pathak around 8 AM and we headed to Dhulikhel with a guide & driver, both of whom were very sociable and professional. My guide and I were dropped off, and we trekked from Dhulikhel to Nagarkot. My guide, Ram Singh, and I interacted with multiple folks along the way & stopped at some authentic road-side restaurants and tea houses. We reached a peak in Nagarkot which promises great views of much of the Himalayas (but be warned: a trip during Monsoon season might mean clouds). On our way back, we stopped back at the Trekking Team's office (in Thamel, by tons of shops & restaurants) before being dropped back at my hotel.In short, I recommend this company & would patronize again in the event I return to Nepal. Happy trekking & travels!"

They made sure I was always happy, comfortable, and had everything I needed. They were so respectful, I really felt like we were family. Each morning we discussed the plan for the day, and they always asked for my approval. They were so patient with my many stops to take photographs, adjust clothing for the weather, etc. What impressed me the most about this trip (besides the amazing service) was the variety of beautiful and changing landscape we traveled through.

            "review": "Everest Base Camp - A Fantastic Experience!. After some friends of ours did Everest Base Camp we decided that we had to do it too. We spent months researching the many many trekking companies and decided to use Trekking Team. They're really great at staying in contact with you and answering any questions you have before you even get in the country. When we arrived at the Airport our guide, Ram Kumar Rai, was there to greet us and took us to our hotel. Once we were checked in we met with the trekking team company for a cup of tea and to organise our supplies. Our guide, Kumar, took us around Thamel to buy all the things we needed for trekking and got us the best deals. He has been working in the industry in many different roles for years and the knowledge he was able to share with us made us very confident before we even got on the plane to Lukla.Once we arrived in Lukla to start our trek we met our porter, Deepak, and headed to the first nights accomodation after a quick breakfast. The places we stayed were all a lot better than we had imagined. Some of the reviews of other trekking companies tell horror stories of staying in some terrible tea houses or having to stay in tents. This wasn't the case with Kumar and the trekking team. The accomodation was all very comfortable with decent meals available at all of them. It gets cold at night which is why a good sleeping bag is important but this is the case with even the best accomodation in the mountains.It was just the two of us plus our guide and porter and we took our time trekking up to Gokyo Ri, crossing Cho La Pass, and then continuing up to Everest Base Camp. I don't think we would have had as successful a trip had it not been for Kumar and Deepak. Kumar made sure that we were drinking enough water, eating enough food, and more importantly that we didn't order the wrong food (don't eat the meat..). Kumar also brought from Kathmandu fruit, which he pays for and carries himself, to ensure that you're getting a balanced diet in the mountains. He was also able to answer any and all of our questions, no matter how stupid. He could even tell you the folk stories behind a lot of the mountains and how high they are from memory.We honestly couldn't say enough good things about our guide Kumar. He was amazing. If you are able to request a guide, ask for Ram Kumar Rai, he is one of the best on the mountain. We often had other travellers asking him for advice even when they had a guide of their own.When we arrived back in Kathmandu we were invited to a Nepali wedding by Ram and Hari at Trekking Team. So the next day we were picked up and taken to this gorgeous wedding which is so different to the weddings we have at home. The food was great, the people were all dressed so beautifully, and we couldn't believe that we had been invited to share the day with the family. It was amazing.If we come back to Nepal for more trekking it will certainly be with Kumar and the Trekking Team."

The trek itself was the adventure of a lifetime -- an amazing experience I'll never forget. We saw so many spectacular places and views and met just as many terrific people along the way. Trekking was never something I had done before and now I'm hooked. I'll treasure this time forever.I was also most pleased with our guide service (\"Trekking Team\") throughout the journey. From booking the trip to saying goodbye our trip was handled with true professionalism and friendly faces. Having never done anything like this before I had no idea what to expect but both the company manager (Ram) and our guide (Suraj) made everything simple and fun. Whether it was setting up accommodations, helping us order food and communicate with the locals, guiding us along the right trails, teaching us about Nepali culture and history (and card games), these guys did it all, made it fun, and became our friends along the way. Shout out to Suraj our guide! He was the man...and was genuinely concerned about our health and safety, and making sure we were having as much fun as possible along the way.And to top it off, \"Trekking Team\" gave us a better deal than any other guide service we checked ($$$).We were on the fence about getting a guide service, and while we may have been able to do the trek without one I am so glad we got one in the end. We certainly would have gotten, at least, a little lost a few times, but more than that the guide service just makes everything in your day to day trekking life simpler so all you have to worry about is trekking and having a great time. And you learn a lot about Nepal while doing it. Plus, they're really cool about giving you some space on the trail if you want to hike alone and just have them around to help with logistics.So if you're thinking of taking a trip to Nepal -- do it : ) And if you're thinking of getting a guide service -- get this one."

When we met with him a few days before the trek he took several hours getting to know us and explaining what we would need to take and what to expect. He directed us to the best place to rent good sleeping bags and advised us accurately on what to take. He arranged transportation that was seamless, getting us to Pokhara and to our staring point Nyapool and back to Kathmandu. When we needed a printer to organize our onward journey to India, the brothers thought nothing of letting us use their business computer and served us tea all the while. As women Trekkers, we felt we were well taken care of and that we had genuine friends in town should we need anything at all. This was wonderful. Finally, it was clear that the guides and porters enjoyed their work and respected Ram and Hari and this created a very happy time for all. I would not hesitate to go with Trekking Team as our experience with them from beginning to end was utterly fantastic."

The four of us enjoyed each other's company for the 10 days of the trek--lots of laughs together. Their experience made us comfortable on the trek, which was challenging in places for me.

With our guide known as GM (short for his local name, translated into 'good morning') or 'guidemaster' (as we called him) we set out to a 9 day trek to Poon Hill and Annapurna Base Camp. Everything went smoothly, both in terms of what the trekking company had told us, as well as guidelines from the very experienced guide GM. And having a good guide is undoubtedly important. Our guide was experienced in his knowledge of the area, trekking injuries, altitude sickness, and more. The guide was also giving us much needed flexibility to change the itinerary depending on our progress. For example, we went slow the days we weren't feeling well, and fast the days we were. This allowed the hourly trekking to be from 4 hours a day, to 8, depending on our physical state.Due to our fast pace going down from ABC, we wanted to finish the road down one day shorter than originally planned. Although this needed changes for the plans of the hotel reservation in Pokhara, as well as the bus ticket, this was no problem for the company. The company, as well as our guide, were therefore very helpful in making the most out of our trek depending on our time preferences. We therefore managed an extra day in Kathmandu, which was much appreciated when we had a flight to catch the day after.Food was great. Much a better standard than expected so high in the mountains. And the guide's choices of the teahouses were mostly good, with the exception of one night on Poon Hill where the view could've been a lot better if another teahouse was chosen instead. But that was only the case for one of the eight night we spent in the teahouses, so it really was a none issue. All in all, I highly recommend this company. And if you get to give preferences for the guide you'll have, then ask for GM. He is a funny man, and a guidemaster nonetheless :)"

Bikram and Ujal, our guide and porter for the trekking, were equally brilliant- we even had an impromptu gigging session with them one night at a teahouse in beautiful Pothana- very memorable. Basically, I can't recommend Trekking Team enough- they really did everything they could to make sure we had the best time. By the time we left we really felt like on eof the Pathak family.

We got very lucky with the weather - perfect clear days and very lucky with our organizers - they were just exceptional.I have been on many treks around the world and don't often post a review but felt compelled to compliment the Trekking Team. Our whole trip went perfectly thanks to them.Trekking Team was our organizer - an exceptional company managed by 3 brothers (Hari, Ram and Shyma) - they were very professional in their organization but more importantly they are just nice people. When I first contacted Ram from Canada, he responded within a few hours with all the information and was very accommodating in everything we wanted (we had our itinerary defined and wanted it our way). And while in Kathmandhu, Ram helped us with everything we needed - airport transfers, money exchange, restaurant recommendations, etc. The best was every time we visited his office (at least 5 times) we would ask he order tea for us and we'd sit and chat with the 3 brothers in their offices. Ram, if you're reading this - I'm coming back for some more ginger tea.And our guide, Prakash was exceptional in the service he provided us. He was always there helping us - when we first woke up, he was there, and when we went to bed, he was there to greet us good night. My travel partner, Alison and I wanted separate rooms - Prakash would say I can't promised but managed it every night, I needed a western toilet - he managed it every time (except one). On the Chola Pass, Prakash helped carry our packs and our favorite porter, Chanda, came back from top of the pass to give us a hand. Lastly, at Gokyo Ri, Alison decided not to climb it so I went on my own (highlight of the trip) and after I came back Alison decided to go up. Our guides made 2 trips up and not even a frown on their faces. Be careful: Prakash is a very good Hearts player and was learning Poker pretty fast.Exceptional company, exceptional people. Thanks Trekking Team and thanks Ram and Prakash. If you (my fellow travelers) are planing to visit Nepal please at least consider the Trekking Team to be your organizers and I believe you won't regret it. If you have any specific questions about the trip/trek please feel free to PM and I'd be happy to answer any questions.Amin"

It all started 1 month before the actual trip to Nepal with a very friendly and professional email correspondence with Ram Pathak, the CEO of Trekking Team Ldt.We booked a 2 person private guided tour trough the Annapourna Region, including the crossing of the Mesokanto La pass on almost 5400m.a.s.We had a very warm welcome and pick up at the airport in Kathmandu and were introduced to our guide and porter the next day.We probably had the very best guide one could wish for, Padam Rai, a 30 year old and well experienced guy from the eastern region of Nepal.He was extremly friendly, greatest sense of humor I could think of, excellent background knowledge and was always concerned about our well being :)Our two porters were also very kind and friendly although they didn\u00b4t speak really english. So we tried to learn a bit Nepalesi :) Unfortunately one porter became ill on high altitude and had to leave the group. Thanks to our strong guide he carried most of the left equippment and the group continued its way. At this point I have to mention that my friend and myself were both carrying a havier backpack than it was actually foreseen, >15kg. But we managed it well even on such high altitude.The last two days were very tough though. 2 very long days of hiking at high altidude. Next time I would try to avoid to hikel from 5200m down to 2600m in one long day. However the alternative would have been an extra day of camping.Summarize:- maybe few things could be aranged cheaper like airport pick up/drop of/ inland flight tickets.- we didn\u00b4t actually had the welcome- and farewell dinner as it said on our booking package, but this was OK for us. We got a lot of tea offered and a great help for buying new hiking shoes early in the morning :)- the first porter left us two and a half days earlier due to sickness, the second porter left one day day earlier as we reached our destination one day earlier as well. Still we paid both porter for the whole trip.Pro:+ very nice and professional email conversation from the beginning+ the best guide in the world we could hope for! We always felt safe!+ excellent food on the trek at all day time and also enough of it! We almost got fat :)+ I can strongly recommend Trekking Team Pvt. Ltd to everyone without hesitation!+ I also would trek again with the help of Trekking Team Pvt. LtdThank you very much for this awesome time we spent in the Himalaya mountains with you!!!"

When we arrived in Kathmandu everything was organized as promised and we met our excellent guide and porter.

He knew just how fast to take us and we ended up doing all we set out to do with his guidance. He kept us happy with his stories and jokes and taught us heaps about the Nepalese culture. Acclimatization program was great and so the effects of high altitude was minimal. We managed to climb up Gokyo Ri under a full moon and see the sun rise behind Everest. Magic! Kumar was very calm and showed us how to conserve energy and make the climb as easy as possible. The accommodation that was organized along the way was great and Kumar was able to help us when we felt challenged and in need of rest or energy.Our porter was great and did a brilliant job. It was nice to learn about correct treatment of porters at the Macherma rescue center and good to know that Trekking Team treats their workers well. So it was a brilliant trek and would recommend Trekking Team to organise your trek. the Gokyo valley is particularly beautiful and well worth considering as an alternative to EBC."

Ram checked in by phone while we were trekking, just to see how it was going. Ramesh was informative and easy going, and seemed always to get us the best rooms with the best views in all our guest houses.

I could not have done such a hike without the expertise from Trekking Team. They went above and beyond to ensure this was a successful trip. I highly recommend them to any individual or group looking at undertaking this trek."

Great communication in English with the guide (Prakas) who always took our input into consideration before making important decisions. His expertise and contact with local people was most valuable. He was dedicated to make this experience an unforgettable, successful life event. He was very caring and supportive when we experienced health issues. Ram, his boss, kept in touch on a regular basis to make sure everything was going to our satisfaction. The porter was most friendly. Everyone in the team went above and beyond the call of duty.

It was important for us to choose a local agency as we hoped that our payments would benefit the people of the region as much as possible. Our guide was terrific. He helped us learn about the language, culture and religions we encountered. He was tapped into the wider community of guides and porters always gathering info that would be crucial towards making good decisions regarding safety and the trail ahead. His communications skills were excellent and he would occasionally break into Nepali song when a tune came to mind. Both the guide and the agency in Kathmandu were constantly monitoring our health and happiness. When phone communication was possible we would be called by the head office to see how things were going. The whole Trekking Team was professional, experienced and best of all very caring people! We highly reccommend Trekking Team Pvt. for a great Nepal mountain adventure."

Truly a team, from owners to guide and porter, this company worked together, seamlessly and professionally, to provide an extraordinary, dream-come-true experience for my son and I to, and over, Thorung La Pass. As a veteran of many back country ski touring trips in the Western Canadian mountains, I was impressed by their knowledge and decision making in keeping us safe without removing the adventure part. They custom tailored our time lines, requests and whims into a smooth and appropriate tour. I especially appreciated how well taken care of the guide and porter seemed to be [not to be taken for granted here in Nepal where I saw porters crossing snow fields under heavy loads, in shabby runners and inadequate clothing]. And, last but not least, the thoughtful, personable attitude of the whole team."

As a 25 year old female travelling and trekking on her own, I felt completely at ease trusting Ram and his team. I was provided with an amazing female guide at my request named Papila. Not only was she experienced and diligent throughout the whole trek, but also such a friendly, warm and open person to be travelling with. Throughout my trek, other fellow trekkers I met would often comment on what a great guide she was. My porter Dhurba too was amazing and I had a great time sharing jokes and learning some Nepalese words from him - and felt really comfortable knowing that I was travelling with two highly experienced trekkers. Could not recommend a better company to be trekking with, and certainly looking forward to my next adventure with them."

He paid attention to our itinerary tweaks we wanted in our itinerary. Even though, he was sending out itineraries templates, he addressed and was meticulous in changing to address our concerns. We are a group of 3 girls from Singapore and met our guide Ram Kumarai. He is such a caring, kind, resourceful guide. The weather took a bad turn when we reached jomsom and our itinerary changed entirely. RamK was always thinking of solutions e.g. by jeep, running around in the wet, cold morning (strong winds and melted snow) to source for porters / public buses for us. He is amazing. He always takes care to remind us to get some hot soups, hot coffee and lemon honey to warm our lungs in the cold. He is like a brother, family. There was never a single moment where we felt we were left behind to think of think of solutions for ourselves. Always, RamK will seek our opinions before proceeding with what he had in mind, you should definitely request for his service with the trekking team. Pathak was lovely too, calling us everyday to check if we were okay and always apologizes because of the weather. We took a chance and insisted on mustang (in winter) so really, there was no one to blame.When it was time to leave Nepal, it was really hard because of the friendships we formed just over 6 days. RamK takes team for trekking too, he's our superman from the Everest (his hometown). You can take a look at him in the photo posted. RamK speaks VERY good English, so don't worry,Conditions at Mustang was far from comfortable i.e. the bumpy public bus ride was dangerous (overpacked and top loaded with luggages on extremely bumpy mountain roads with hairpin turns), only cold water, long hours of electrical downtime. so I would request for you to specify for a jeepney or flight to get into jomsom, just let Pathak know. Don't get me wrong, I'm an adventure seeker but I think the balance is tipped here :DThe long journey in revealed a lost kingdom, a place that sets my mind and heart at peace. I am sure when you visit during the optimal months (spring), you will receive more than what you expect. Remember to tip your guide generously if they are really good :DMustang will always have a special place in our heart and I look forward we would go back to meet RamK and his team. :D I actually did not regret missing out Kathmandu and Pokhara. Hurry pack your bags now!"

I visited Nepal and Kathmandu with a friend two years ago and used Trekking Team to organize our tours when another well-known and highly rated tour company in Thamel dropped the ball and messed up our plans. Ram Pathak and his team put together a fantastic itinerary for us and we had a great time.So when I returned to Nepal in October for another visit to Kathmandu and the surrounding countryside, I contacted Ram and he did not disappoint me. He put together exactly the itinerary I wanted in exactly the way that I wanted. I had lots of questions and tweaks to my itinerary, and Ram handled each one with great patience and professionalism. No question I had or request I made was too silly or trivial for Ram to respond to. I always received a very fast reply to each of my inquiries (even considering the 12 hour time zone difference). When I got to Kathmandu, everything went just as I had planned and discussed with Ram, from my initial airport pickup until Ram dropped me off at the airport for my flights back to the U.S., and everything in between. His tour guides were great and not only knew their history and the best places to visit and eat, but they really looked out for my well-being every step of the way.Working with Sam, I was fortunate to be on the receiving end of a very memorable blessing ceremony at one of the monasteries at Boudhanath Stupa, where I was able to take my lay Buddhist vows, and I thank Sam for helping me communicate with the monks to arrange it. It was one of the highlights of my visit.If I do decide to return to Nepal for a third visit, there is no question that I will contact Ram and his team to make all the arrangements. These guys are the best, and they have proven themselves to be heads and shoulders above their competition time and time again!Thank you, Ram, for putting together such a great trip, and for inviting me to your lovely home for a visit. You made my return visit to Kathmandu and Nepal even more enjoyable than the first!"

I found Trekking Team's office in Thamel and Hari was so professional and genuinely lovely! He gave me a really great deal for a trek to Gokyo + EBC with a guide porter to help save costs. Chandra, my guide porter was fantastic! He was super lovely, quickly worked out what I liked doing and what I wanted. Being a solo, female traveller, I felt safe the entire time and was well looked after. When I arrived back in Thamel, Hari invited me over for dinner with his family and I spent a really nice night sharing a traditional Nepali meal with his wonderful family! I felt really welcomed by them and I can't wait to go back and see them all again! I plan to go do I Island and Mera peak with him as soon as I can afford to! Would 100% recommend to anyone looking to organise their own trip. They were in short: affordable, reliable and all round quality!"

Everybody from the group was very friendly, interested in our plans and taking care that everything will be perfect. Everything we have planned was considered, and we could not only see amazing places, but also learn a lot about Nepal, the people living there and their habits, religion, but moreover didn\u2019t had to worry about anything, because everything was planned into the smallest detail, so we could relax enjoying the stunning views that Nepal offers to travelers. Ram's brother, we had the pleasure to meet him as well (I am not good with names) explained us facts about the religion which was a great bonus to the provided service. I can only recommend you Trekking Team Pvt. Ltd for your trip to Nepal, I will definitely use their service again on my next trip to Nepal."

However, we came across Trekking Team and they were very personalized and very accommodating to our request and concerns. We opted to go with them and were very pleased with their service. Throughout our journey from the moment we touched down at the airport until we went back to our homeland, they were with us all the time! During our trekking days, the guides and porters were very friendly and even joked with us. They have become our extended family members. To Mr Ram and his 2 brothers (3 of them manages the company) and our guide Pramila, and porters Suraj, Mila and Krishna, thank you so much once again! We, in fact, are already planning for our next trip and no doubt we will return to Trekking Team to service us. Excellent team by the Trekking Team.

We enquired at few places and finally when we spoke to the trekking team, we felt confident and secured about their concern for us as we were just 2 gals planning for Everest base Camp trek. They planned the entire trek for us and made us feel that we had someone to rely on if any issues would arise at any point during our stay in Nepal. So all in all a very promising service from the trekking team, we are very glad that we found them by coincidence. The next visit to Nepal we know we already have someone in Nepal to plan our stay :)"

They are reliable, efficient, professional, accommodating, attentive to details and customized the trip based on our capabilities. They are result-oriented. When changes were requested, they delivered.We are a group of 4 girls and felt safe the entire trip. We took the short pleasant flight (Simrik Airlines-very smooth landing) from Kathmandu to Pokhara. Ram advised us to take the seats along the right side of the plane (right row, behind the cockpit). It gave us the best view of the mountain range.Our hiking guide in Pokhara, Ghanashyam Tripathi \"GM\" was informative, engaging and constantly checked on our well-being. He was even concerned if the food was to our liking wherever we dined. We experienced Nepali hospitality by being invited to his friend's home during one of our hikes and to his family's home on Nepal's New Year day (April 14, 2014). GM went the extra mile to immerse us into Nepali culture.Ram suggested we drive back from Begnas Lake through scenic mountain terrain to Nagarkot and onto Kathmandu. Mr. Suraj's skillful driving somehow made the trip seemed shorter. We especially appreciated the vehicle was maintained clean. When another chauffeur was assigned to drive us to the airport for our mountain flight to Mt. Everest, Mr. Hari (Ram's brother) personally endorsed one of their staff. Unfortunately the mountain flight was cancelled 10 minutes prior flight due to poor visibility. Mr. Hari had his staff waiting for us, just in case, making sure we didn't have to wait for the ride back.Our adventure concluded with a tasty traditional dinner at Ram's home courtesy of his lovely wife and sister-in-law's culinary expertise, shared with his immediate and extended family. Topping off dinner with a birthday cake for JOvs was a sweet and pleasant surprise! From the warm welcome and beautiful garlands we received from Ram upon our arrival and a farewell send-off from Ram and his son Aswin, gifting us with scarves, we left blessed Nepal not only with fond memories but friends. Trekking Team Pvt. Ltd. provides exceptional, excellent and personalized service. We will definitely go with Ram and his Trekking Team on our future trips and highly recommend to everyone."

My wife and I have been touring the world extensively for over a decade now and usually like to explore new countries, regions and places on our own.

Our trekking guide Prakash was the best. He was an excellent teacher and was always able to make any changes or adjustments we wanted during our journey in real time. His attention to all of the details to make our trekking experience flawless and seamless was extremely impressive. In addition, when I wanted to just go for it and challenge my fast paced hiking, running and climbing skills, Prakash would give me instructions that helped make this so. As a professional athlete, I really appreciated this. The combination of having a guide with a wealth of information and having the flexibility to explore exactly what we wanted to see was perfect for us and a feature very difficult to find. After our extremely successful trekking experience, Ram's brother Sam guided us thru an unforgettable tour of Kathmandu. This is not your basic \"tourist\" experience. We were quickly immersed into the culture and able to see and learn about so much of the details of this amazing city.

However I was making a last minute trip and I ran short on time and enlisted and trusted Ram at Trekking Team to basically plan and arrange everything on very short notice, within 36 hours of arriving in Kathmandu. It was maybe the singe best travel decision I have ever made. They could not have done anything more to enhance my experience; they were so prompt with emails, always early to pick up drop off, always interested in my wants and feedback, so assertive to always think of what would be best for me and what I wanted, so very patient and understanding when I wanted to stop for something or pass something up, could go on and on...They have made me believe in hiring tours and guides even though I usually do not care for them and I don't think I could ever find a group as good as this.About them: They are a local family run (3 brothers) business with genuine guides, they treat each other well and treat their clients exceptionally well. My trekking guide, Ramsing, was always wanting to help me, sincerely, he never stopped checking on me and I really enjoyed his company, he is a great person with much knowledge. The driver didn't speak much English but his smile and demeanor was comforting as well as his conservative and safe driving:) Ram and Sham were my city guides and are wonderful family men who was so helpful to navigate around town and sort out all of the logistics. I was a single woman traveling with just my 19th month old baby so you can image the special needs that occurred...They treated my son and I as family and provided us the most amazing experience. I hope to return next year for a longer trip will defiantly have Trekking Team as my guides. I would advise everyone to just contact them and let their service show how good they are."

With experienced team, our enquiries was arranged and recommended professionally. Our trip to Muktinath from Jomsom was spectacular sightseeing and Lubra pass was amazing. Our female guide was really nice, caring and incredibly talented, including her English, physical fitness and experience that made our trip really great enjoyable. At the middle of the trip, we went from Jomsom to Tatopani by public bus, it was suggested by the company. I thought that it would be great if we walked along this trail, but we didn't have enough time so we missed it. However, it was like a break for us, the beginners, before trekking to Ghorapani and Nayapul. By the way, with wonderful service, nice team and friendly guide, I really enjoy this trip in Nepal."

He and his staff are very friendly and helpful in greeting us their company.We are four gals being arranged to be led by a female guide, who is physically fit and friendly too. Since I had the taste of a very professional guide in my 12-day Everest Base Camp (EBC) few years ago, the guide assigned to us this time did not quite fulfil my high expectation. A bit disappointed is that she appears to be quite inexperienced and young. As far as I could remember, the last time I was led by a professional guide in the EBC trip in 2009 was also arranged by the same trekking company. Apart from the difference of individual guides' quality, I found the service of Ram and his trekking company excellent."

We were lucky to have our own cook provided by Trekking team who was excellent, and hot water for washing was brought to us at most of the locations by Hari and his colleagues. We were unable to do the Kailash Kora as the weather turned bad.

They are always transparency and honest with all the fees and costs for any kind adventure you'd like to do.And what makes Trekking Team even more better is the fact, that they know what they talk about.

Every single trip I made to Nepal (either myself or with a group of clients) I used the services of Trekking Team Pvt. Ltd. and have never been disappointed. Nepal is a bit different World on its own, in some way rushy, in other slow, but definitelly different. But that is why the people travel - to discover and to learn these differences. However, sometimes cultural misunderstanding in combination with language bariers may culminate into a stressful experiences which hide the merits of travelling. At the first place, I talk about problems in hotels, booking confusions, wrong understanding between driver and the group, slow processing of some services etc. These are the experiences you don't need to take with from Nepal. As far as now I have to say that Trekking Team is the very best choice to avoid all these problems and makes your travelling more convenient and smooth. They are helpful, they understand well the needs and wishes of foreigners, have good, safe and careful partners and at any time during providing their services to you they are listening and are very flexible to accommodate to you (e.g. if you want to have a change in your itinerary or change the driver because he/she's too rushy to you)... If you want pleasant and financially optimalized trip in Nepal, the Trekking team may be your right choice."

We like asian countries and the way everything happens in mysterious way there. This time we had an answer to all our questions at once. At the airport we met our friends who were going on a trek organized by ukrainian travel agency with operator in Nepal, Trekking Team. They told us that this agency is the best and we shouldn't waste our time. But still, we wanted to compare and always checked the prices with other agencies. But Hari Dev, the owner, was without a rival, giving good price and a friendly advice. Any kind of request he could arrange: changing money (his rate was the highest), renting a bike, the taxi (nepali price), flight tickets to Pokhara, hotel there, private car to Chitwan, Island Jungle Resort, all the safaries, rafting, any kind of question or advice what to do, where to go, to dine, to make a good massage or even to take a quick shower in Thamel without paying full rate - no problem - anything.But the very important thing he did for us - was his help while we were on a trek. We went on Kalapatar. And when we got on the very top, I was so tired that I couldn't walk anymore. I had an idea of a helicopter but had no idea how to arrange it in the mountains not having a key thing -necessary sum of money. And I called our friend Hari Dev asking him to send a helicopter, to pay for it and we (not nepalies, but strangers) would give him money back on arrival to Kathmandu. And guess what?! He said - \"OK, Marina, Where are you? I will do it!!!!\"I was shocked! I hoped and I couldn't believe. How many of your friends would do that in your native country?!!! I am very grateful to this \"always smiling man\". He did like a very good friend!!! Don't waste your time looking for better or cheaper!!! This is a real shortcut! I wish you a very interesting trip to Nepal and a friend like Hari Dev there. My e-mail, in case you have any questions, mavovk@aol.com.Best wishes,Marina."

We walked the Poon Hill trek with their assigned porter, who helped us a lot, served as guides, and were an importnant part of the successful completion. We respected Ram's insistance on limiting the weights carried by the porters (we have seen many porter who are carrying crazy loads on our way).Throughout our stay, Ram has served as our homebase in Nepal, and was there to recommend hotels, attractions, etc.For those who like to plan ahead while knowing that changes are handled cordially, I highly recommend Ram and his team.Tip of the day I: Lumbini, Budha's birth place, is undergoing reconstruction.

I was a little nervous about parting with my deposit months in advance, not having booked an extensive trip with a 'foreign' tour operator before. I need not have worried. Our trip entailed a week hiking towards Everest base Camp ... this is the bit that should have been longer. As we only had two weeks and we also wanted to spend some time in Chitwan and Kathmandu, we trekked from Lukla to Tengboche and back, listening to the other travellers in the tea houses each night about their trip to EBC. Next time.The only hiccup came in flying out of Lukla, which became fogged in delaying our flight. Ram made sure in our itinerary that we had space for this, which we did, but as it looked like we would be delayed for a further night we decided to hire a helicopter back to Kathmandu so we could get on with our trip to Chitwan. I can only recommend that you do leave enough time getting in and out of Lukla in case of delay. Through this trekking part of the trip our guide Gokarna looked after us really well. One thing that Ram and his team make sure happens well is the transport and dealing with little problems. When we arrived in Kathmandu I had lost my glasses in transit. It was the day before our trek was to start and Gokarna found an optometrist who could make me a new pair ... and I had them 3 hours later. Ram's driver Pradip was excellent, picking us up on time and without problem. Boy he loved that car too! After the trek we went to Chitwan for two nights. The safari was very relaxing after the walk and the chaos of Kathmandu. There are animals there, but maybe more stories of them!On the whole, it was a really special trip with my kids, one we'll never forget. Well done to Ram and his team."

The people who were staffing the business were also very good such as drivers, porters, guides etc. The price was a bit higher than some of the local competitors but you will see the difference in the service. They even helped me find better quality presents for home. My only complaint was the information provided regarding the degree of difficulty in certain parts such as summit attempts. The guide wasn't aware that we didn't know how hard a summit attempt was. We were told 6-8 hours when in reality it was 10-14 hours. Make sure you clarify the length and difficulty of the summits (e.g. how many hours will I be walking with and without crampons)."

I have organised trips to Nepal with family and friends for a number of years and Hari and Ram and the trekking team have provide great personalised service each time.In December 2011 we took a family group to Nepal and trekking team orgainsed all our requirements. We did lots of things including a visit to Lumbini, rafting, trekking and jungle lodge. It was a great trip. The attention to our personal interests (like learning to cook momo's local style) and extra support from the staff if someone was struggling made all the difference.In March 2011 we trekked to Gokyo and Island Peak with Trekking Team, including climbing on Island Peak. The trek was, as usual, well organised with personal service from Hari and Ram. The guide was first class with lots of local knowledge and more than enough climbing experience (4 Everest Summits). Both guide and porters always made the extra effort to look after our safety and comfort. All the details such as flights, permits, accommodation and transfers were smoothly negotiated.In 2009 we completed the Jhomolari Trek in Bhutan and Hari took care of all the arrangements as well as accompanying us personally from Kathmandu to Bhutan. We were a private group of 10 people and Hari and the team made the organisation of the trek easy, paying utmost attention to what we wanted to achieve. Responses were timely and informative and all arrangements including visa approval, Druk Air flights, local guides and staff were taken care of efficiently. Hari was personally involved in all aspects of planning as well as the airport pickup\u2019s and group activities, even to the extent of hosting some of our group in his own home when they were seeking a cooking experience !The service from the team was first class, always friendly and relaxed but well organised and efficient - a really good balance. On the trek, the good service continued. The guide, cook and staff were all again friendly, relaxed but informative and professional. The food was great ! The team helped us all achieve a tough trek.We have also used Ram and Hari\u2019s team previously in 2004 for a private group trek in Nepal ie Langtang, Gosainkund & Helambu. Again the service was personal and of an excellent quality. The trek was successful and great fun, largely due to the team.Trekking Team ( www.trekkingteam.com ) operate from Kathmandu and provide travel and trekking services in Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan and India. Their staff are well looked after and in our experience they take great care to protect the environment we trekked in. The company also contributes to community projects and invests a portion of it\u2019s earnings back to the local community. There are many available options for organising treks in the Himalayas. As independant trekkers who occasionally organise private groups, we have no hesitation in recommending Trekking Team for reliable, personal service at a fair price. We look forward to our next trip with the team."

We had limited time in Nepal and they tailored the trip perfectly for the time that we had. From the first email enquiry i made i cannot fault Hari as he always answered my questions very promptly and patiently and i had many, nothing is too much trouble for Hari.From the moment we arrived in Kathmandu Hari and Ramesh made us feel so welcome and they looked after us like we were family. The whole of our trek was extremely well organised and we did not have to worry about anything. Ramesh was awesome, i highly recommend that you request him as your guide, what a great guy, so happy, patient and caring.....there were many days on the trek when i was challenged with serious blisters, knee problems etc... and Ramesh and Uddhav our porter were so patient with me and also so supportive, they truly represent the open hearted qualities that have made me fall in love with Nepal and her people and i feel that we have made some great friends for life! I would most defenitely book with Trekking Team again, as long as i can have Ramesh & Uddhav as our team.So book your trek of a lifetime with Trekking Team now!!"

The arrangements went completely wrong-through no fault of Trekking Team,because Lukla was closed to flights for a number of days.Trekking Team helped my son get a helicopter up to Lukla,but there was no way my wife was going to be able to get out for a long time.So Prakash and Ram changed everything arround and the three of us trekked back down through the foothills-superb walking.I cannot speak too highly of this company.They even fixed a 4x4 to meet us down at Jiri and took us up to the Tibet border where we had 2 days brilliant white water rafting. This family company bent over backwards to help us through our difficulties,notwithstanding the obvious communication problems.They are lovely people who entertained us to a family dinner when we eventually got back to Kathmandu.They should be the obvious choice for anyone wanting to trek in Nepal"

I asked a lot of questions prior to our trek (even before arriving in KTM) and he was quick to respond. My buddy got into an accident in KTM and had to have his leg stitched up in a hospital a day prior to our trek. I thought we couldn't make it out there, but Raj came up with some suggestions so my friend has enough time to rest while joining us on the circuit few days into it. Bhim, our Nepali guide had 20+ years of experience and being old skool, knows the ins and outs of the circuit at the back of his hand. He took great care of us like a father figure, and always watched out for us! The only drawback was the car ride from Jomsom to Pokhara, which was a tough 10 hour bumpy ride, due to the fact that all flights are booked up. I highly suggest flying from Jomsom to Pokhara if you have motion sickness or can't sit in the car for extended periods of time.

Our guide Bhairas picked us up from the airport, from the beginning he made us feel welcome and comfortable. He was open, honest and treated us like family all through the trek. He went above and beyond booking the best rooms in teahouses ahead of time - i.e. bedrooms with ensuites and catering for western needs. We ate amazing food, never ate a meal we didn't like or felt sick from. His knowledge of mountains, trekking and especially altitude sickness was outstanding. Always checking up on us and keeping an eye out for symptoms. We didn't suffer from altitude and I put this down to Bhairas's knowledge of acclimatization. Thanks also to our porters - Suptha and Bhala you guys are legends. Can't wait to see you all again soon!"

Unfortunately, I had to come down early due to altitude sickness, but Green Valley was with me every step of the way. Raj met me at the hospital and helped smooth over things so that I could get discharged as soon as possible. I had no intention of spending the night in the hospital while on holiday. \ufffd He even picked up my medical records for me later in the week since I had moved on to Pokharra. Highly recommended Green Valley!"

From the start, Arjun was so quick and helpful to help plan our (myself and 3 friends) trekking adventure through the Annapurna region. We met our guide Bhairas at the airport (who waited 4 hours for our delayed flight to arrive) which started one of the funniest and most amazing trekking experiences we could have asked for. One of many examples, Bhairas actually took note of my birthday by looking at my passport before our arrival, then disappeared only to spend 4 hours in the kitchen by himself baking me a cake and buying me a present from the market on my birthday. It was such an amazing experience and the type of attention to detail you can only dream of on holidayThe trek was great, but Bhairas and Green Valley made it absolutely unbelievable. If you're trekking in Nepal, these guys are a must"

Excellent trek company\u2026 Very professional, genuine and charismatic team members...  - Before the Trek:I contacted more than 10 trek companies and I the main reasons to choose Green Valley were (1) Excellent customer service, (2) Very competitive price and (3) Excellent reviews.Since the first contact, Arjun rapidly answered all my questions. The communication was very efficient. After comparing its trek itinerary and price against other companies, I made the right decision to take the trek with these guys. They were well organized and provided good information on what to pack, what type of insurance I should buy and other topics. They trust their clients as we didn\u2019t have to pay anything in advance.As agreed, someone from the Green valley was waiting for us at the airport, they welcomed us with a flowers necklace and took us to the hotel.The hotel was very nice and comfortable, in a very good location and with a great outdoors restaurant. We then went to their main office (5 minutes\u2019 walk from the hotel) where they provided us with travel bags, t-shirts, sleeping bags, maps, etc. We also received some tips and instructions for the trek. Next day, Arjun (one of the company directors) took us to the airport and helped us with the check in. Unfortunately there were flight delays that day (it is usual in flights to Lukla) and Arjun helped us deal with the airline (it is not easy to get answers from airlines if you are not a local Nepalese). He made dozens of calls to the airline and made a lot of efforts to ensure we had a flight to Lukla that day. - During the Trek:Mingmar, our trekking guide is one of best human beings I have met. From day one, I felt like he was part of my family. He was the best part of the trek. He took us to very good tea houses and told us interesting stories about climbers and trekkers. His porters were very friendly and smiling all the time. This company used a different route to return to Namche from Base Camp. This made the trek more exciting as we didn\u2019t go to all the same places on the way down. We stayed at very good tea-houses and the food was excellent. - After the Trek:Someone from Green Valley was waiting for us at the airport and took us to the hotel. Later that evening we met with the team members from Green Valley to celebrate our way back from Base Camp. They were very customer focused and wanted to know how our trek went and how they can improve the customer experience."

Our guide, Raj, was very professional and caring during the trek. Everything was organised nicely and he would brief us every night on the next day's trail and accommodation. Raj and and our porters, Ramesh and Kapil, also never failed to offer their help along the way when we were struggling with trails that were steep or slippery, despite the heavy loads that they were carrying. They are also very entertaining and fun to hang out with; joking, singing and even dancing with us! My friends and I have definitely enjoyed ourselves greatly during the trek with them. Highly recommend Green Valley Nepal Treks if you're looking to have a fun yet professional adventure."

In 9 days we were able to visit Kathmandu, do the Everest Panoramic Flight, visit Pokhara, do the Poon Hill Hiking in the Annapurna and finish visiting Bhaktapur and Patan. For our Poon Hill hiking, Arjun selected Gopal, the best guide/waiter/hostess that we could have. Gopal was very attentions and always concerned about our safety and comfort. Gopal is full of very funny stories, make sure to ask him to tell you those. In our opinion, the tour was very well organized and with a fair price. We were concerned about being overcharged by booking the tours on-line in advance. We did some verification with other companies in Kathmandu after our arrival and the prices were very similar. At the end we were very happy with the services provided for what we paid.We will use Green Valley for our next trip to Nepal and we totally recommend them for a great time! "

My wife and I planned a sudden trip from Dubai to Nepal and got their contact details online and then subsequently wrote them an email & called them. We spoke to the owner who took note of each of our demands and prepared an Itinerary suiting our needs and also the short time we had in Nepal. We visited Nagarkot, Chitwan National Park and Kathmandu. We had planned our visit in a bit of an inappropriate time as it was all rains there. However, we had Eid leave days here in Dubai and therefore we had to travel those days only. Due to the rains all our travel schedule was thrown off balance but the Green Valley owner and staff took note of every minute change and did their best to ensure we have a good time within the limited days we were there.From the time we contacted them for quotations, owner Mr. Arjun took personal care and was upto date on preparing the schedule to following up on calls for every booking to ensure we are in agreement. From the time we landed, we were greeted by a personal Guide (Rajan) and Driver (Yuvraj) who did their jobs perfectly. They made us feel welcome and we were very comfortable in their hands all the days. As mentioned earlier, there were many changes made by us, like we opted out of travelling by car on way back from Chitwan to Kathmandu due to bad roads and asked to book us for flights instead. Even though the flights were unavailable online, Mr. Arjun kept following up with his contacts and ensured 2 tickets for us within a few hours.I am sure, if we had planned this trip on our own and not through Green Valley, considering the rains it would have been a disaster. Their local expertise and contacts helped us to have a great time. I would definitely contact them if I make another visit to Nepal and highly recommend them.There are some people who run their business professionally. Then there are people like Mr. Arjun who run it personally with utmost care of their customers.Rakesh Puthran"

Having good English have made communication with him much easier but how friendly, sociable and understanding he was what made him a great companion.

Raj covers all the bases and makes sure not only that everything is ready to go but that you are comfortable with all aspects of your trek.Raj met me at my hotel the day before trekking to sign permits, etc. and make sure I was prepared and comfortable about the trek. He stored my extra baggage while I trekked, loaned me a sleeping bag (no charge) and made sure I had proper equipment. When the trek was over Raj took me to dinner to chat about the trek. On my last day in town Raj sent a car to take me to the airport.My friendly guide, Lax was so helpful. He was great at making sure I had everything i needed each day to keep things moving smoothly. I mentioned one day I would like to try a walking stick. Literally within 30 seconds he had acquired a great walking stick from a local. I was amazed. Another day I told him my knees were sore and could use some ibuprofen. Like magic he found a dispensary along the trail and got me fixed up. He found a set of trekking poles for me in a high altitude village where I thought it would be impossible. He was always there with water, food, medical needs, extra blankets, whatever I needed. On some of the most difficult stretches he traded my heavier pack to make things easier for me. His knowledge of the mountains trails was great and kept me confident that things would go well. I appreciated the way he looked out for me whether we were on the trail, in a village or traveling to and from the trek.

My girlfriend and I arrived in Kathmandu with no solid plan other than a trek in the Everest region. We had resisted booking a group tour online and I sure am glad we did. We met up with K.P in our hostel and within 30 minutes we were heading to the green valley office to book. The trip was all inclusive- flights, accommodation & meals for 16 days (not something most tours offer), guide, porter, airport transfers and more. Nothing was missed. The next day we were on our way. The great service didn't stop with K.P. Our guide Gopal was incredible. His knowledge of the region was unbeatable and he catered to our every need with a smile. Gopal has been walking the trails for 28 years, first as a porter then a guide. Everyone knows and respects him- he was shaking hands all day. When I trek again I will certainly request Gopal. Our porter Donny (excuse spelling) was also fantastic. At breakfast he would check we hadn't left anything in our rooms then set off with our bag to the next stop. He was always smiling and a really good guy. As for the trek itself it was everything I was hoping for and more. EBC was great but the highlights for me would have to be Kala Patthar and Gokyo Ri. I finished the trek with great memories and two new friends in Gopal and Donny. Thank You Green Valley"

After a short discussion with the owner of the hostel about wanting to trek, he asked KP to come over. KP was amazing in the way that he had so much unbiased information to give me on all the different types, grades and lengths of treks.When we made the decision to sign me up for EBC he organised EVERYTHING for me. This included transport to the airport, flights, a guide, a day to day itinerary, a map and support. In a country where English is scarce, he made me feel very comfortable and safe about all the plans we were making which left me feeling nothing but excited and ready to trek!When I was trekking, my amazing guide, Jami, had his cellphone on him and KP called me a couple of times to see how I was doing. Jami even let me make a phone call from Everest Base Camp to let my loved ones know I was there.KP was 100% professional and went the extra mile to make sure I felt comfortable, safe and happy. I would recommend KP and Green Valley Tours to anybody thinking about trekking in Nepal."

Our guide \"Raj\" was terrific with the two children, often giving us adult some quiet as he chased after them with younger legs. I felt safe the whole time and was happy to trust him to guide them safely over the trail, whether in sight of us or not.We saw some marvelous scenery and experienced cultural side of Nepal. Raj was eager to answer all sorts of questions, personal or not, about his own family and belief systems. He was open and honest, and I truly believe that his participation is guiding us made the trip very worthwhile as a learning opportunity for all of us. He made all of the necessary arrangements for us at lodges and restaurants. He was very helpful, and I think that we made new friends. The management of the company in Katmandu was also terrific, taking care of our every need. Especially important was being sure to assist with airport travel, as our first flight was missed and the return to Katmandu required a change of plans \"on the fly.\" Arjun, the owner/manager took care of everything, including giving us a room to crash for a few hours while in the city waiting for a late flight departure. The porter that they arranged for us was a family friend of theirs - \"Sivo.\" Watching him in action and getting to know him was a personal highlight. He was caring and kind and really seemed to enjoy the company of my children. He was SO helpful with our gear. The trip would not have been the same without him.All told, we are very happy with our experience. I would recommend Arjun, Raj, and Sivo to anyone looking for an outdoors experience in Nepal. The trek itself was tough on the body, but quite refreshing for our spirits. I hope to see these gentlemen again, perhaps if I can return in the future with students to help build a home or school for a families still recovering from earthquake damage."

I was busy in Nepal for 2 month, then I finished my work there and I decided to go to Everest Base Camp, and I had very short time to review the comments from hundreds of thousands of travel agencies on the internet. Yet, I sent my request of EBC trekking itinerary to some companies and Arjun (Green Valley) replied my email fast with his professional experience on organizing the trekking issue, besides, Green Valley offer me a very nice and competitive price of my designate itinerary, those were the main reason why I decide to choose Green Valley. I just mentioned the price was really nice, and the service I got was also good. My guide whose name is Dhankumar, who bought me to the EBC and Gokyo, he guided me the way and explained attractions on the mountains. With his abundant experience on trekking EBC, I didn't worry too much and I felt safe, he took care of everything of the trip and he was helpful, talked with good manner and behave. I have nothing to complain about the trip about my good guide for sure. I am lucky to find a helpful travel agency and a nice guide in a very short time, and most important of all, I spent less than my prediction and got a wonderful experience in the 15 days in Himalayan. When the trekking trip ends, I also told Dhankumar, my guide, if I have another chance to visit the Himalayan in the future, then I will ask Green Valley to organize the tour for me and also send me Dhankumar as my guide again!"

            "review": "Poor service with a misleading trek in the middle. My wife book a tour with Green Valley because of the many positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We had hoped that ours would be another positive experience but there were several negative experiences which let us down.Pros: On our first day we had a decent tour of Kathmandu. Most of the sites had obvious earthquake damage and we were asked to pay for entrance fees to help rebuild these attractions. We had no issue with paying extra and we were happy we went on the tour. We don't have any complaints about organization of the trek itself or the guide and the porter. They were dutiful and patient and adapting itinerary to my illness (which my wife got from the terrible bus ride). We were happy with accommodation during the trek and guides and porters work. Cons:We were not impressed when leaving to Pokhara because we were told to meet our porter at 6:00 AM to take us to the bus and he didn't show up until 6:30. The staff at the hotel was still sleeping and we didn't know if we were going to miss the bus or if something happened to the porter and so on and it made us worried. There was a guy literally sleeping in the lobby so we had no choice but to wait outside as taxi drivers harassed us. We feel like if we are told be ready at 6 am then someone should be waiting for us at 5:59. This lead us to our main complaint, the AC \"Deluxe\" tourist bus. We were told at the start of our tour that the bus journey would take 6-7 hours and we were guaranteed that the buses would have air conditioning. These buses are in no way deluxe, the buses we rode on did not have air conditioning and the trip was over 8 hours. Please note if you are booking a tour with this company do NOT book the bus if you can afford the plane. We wished we had been informed that would have two miserable hot bus rides smelling dusts and fumes from open windows for more than 8 hours. If we were properly informed about the quality of the bus and duration of the ride we would have happily paid more for the short flight to Pokhara and back. The conditions of the first bus gave my wife a cold that badly affected our trekking experience. The trek description was misleading in many ways. On the second day the description said that there would be steep rigorous climbing for 2 hours. However, on the 2nd day we were climbing uphill for about 7 hours! For the rest of the trek we noticed they only gave about 50% of the details about how hard it actually was. This misleading description is completely unacceptable. It is dangerous to put people in this type of situation where they have no choice but to keep trekking after they have been given false information. We were on the Poon Hill circle so it's not like we had the option of turning back when my wife got very sick. Here is a real description of the Poon Hill trek:Day 1. Walk uphill on dirt/stone trail for 4-5 hours. Day 2. Walk steep uphill trail on stone steps for 7-9 hours. Day 3. Wake up at 4:30 AM. Climb 1.5 hours to top of Poon Hill. Climb down to hotel. Eat breakfast. Climb up/down for 8-9 more hours on mostly stone steps and some dirt trails.Day 4. Walk through a large village dodging horses. Spend 4-5 hours climbing down steep stone stairs (Full disclosure my wife was so ill the 4th day we took a jeep out at the earliest connivence).If you don't think you are physically able to do this than don't book this tour. It was very challenging. It is also a circle so if you get sick you have no choice but to finish. Please keep that in mind. Lastly, on our return to Kathmandu the tour company forgot to pick us up from the bus stop. When we pay top dollar for a private tour we expect people to be waiting for us when the bus dropped us off. The owner later apologized saying that because we had been sifted to a worse quality bus it did not stop in the right location. He said that usually he sends the guide/porter back to Kathmandu with us to avoid these issues. We were not impressed that the owner felt he could save some money while leaving us stranded. We ended up taking a taxi to the hotel only because I managed to save the hotel's information card. When I confronted the owner about this he never offered to reimburse me for the taxi fare! Overall this trip had so many issues with service that it took what would have been an amazing experience and ruined it. We wish we had experience that we expected."

I visited Green Valley Nepal only days before I planned to begin my expedition up to Mount Everest base camp, Arjun, Raj and his team were so great in helping me get everything sorted in such a short time frame and in a very professional manner. They provided me with a detailed itinerary that fit within the time frame which I had and all the necessary equipment I didn't (have). I completed my hike over 11 days with an experienced Sherpa (Mingma) and porter. The accomodation we stayed in was great, simple but very clean and accomodating. All of the accomodation had a good communal space with a fire. Meals on the trip were all included and I was hesitant before leaving that I would get hungry during my time. That was certainly never an issue! I had more than enough food and the range of choice was huge. My entire time on and off the mountain was so enjoyable. I always felt safe and if I had any problems or questions they were always answered. I would highly recommend emailing, looking at the website or heading into Green Valley Nepal's office to check out the great options and prices of their adventures both around Kathmandu(Everest) and Pokhara (Annapurna)."

I decided to do the ABC via Poonhill trip 12 days from Kathmandu in February. I was trekking solo but promised the same price for the guided trek even if other people did not sign up, which was nice. They were prompt in email replies and were able to offer (from what I could tell) a competitive price. In the end there were 2 other people in my group. My guide, Gopal, was very accommodating to the different paces of the group and was flexible with our itinerary when we decided we wanted to trek further 4 of our 10 days (this was in February in the offseason, not sure how flexible it would be in high season with tea house reservations). We ended up finishing the trip in 9 days instead of 10 and were able to have a full extra day in pokhara. While in Kathmandu Arjun and Gopal went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of during my 2 days in Kathmandu, especially with my transportation to my accommodation (which was very far outside Thamel). As a solo traveler I really appreciated their help and genuine interest in making my entire trip to Nepal, not just my trek, an incredible experience. The route: The trek was not particularly challenging for me and I wished I would have done my own additional research to realize this because it was my responsibility to do so. Annapurna circuit would have been a better fit but I didn't have the time. I am 22 years old and have done backpacking trips before that were 3-4 nights. I have also summited 12 mountains over 14,000 ft. Looking back If I were to do this same route I would finish in 8 or 9 days, 10 is way too long. Given my previous experience I could have done this trek by only hiring a porter and not a guide at all. However, I did enjoy having a local to trek with and it's nice to be able to relax and have everything planned for you. I also felt a lot safer on the trek knowing I wasn't pushing too fast or slow because of my guide's expertise and that emergencies would be handled professionally if they we to unfortunately occur. Porter or no porter for this route?:I did not do a porter for this trek. If you have not done any backpacking before I highly recommend a porter for this route. There are many stone steps that are rough on your knees. You will be much more comfortable if you hire one. The only complaint I have is the bus ride from Kathmandu to pokhara and back. Told it would take 6-7 hours and both times it took over 8 hours both times. Highly recommend a flight as you waste 2 entire days on a bus otherwise. Overall I highly HIGHLY recommend Green Valley, especially as an independent trekker. Finding a company that will provide you intimate service and competitive prices as a solo Trekker is hard to find! "

From the very beginning this was very well organized, and also my guide Dipak was a super friendly, caring and obviously very experienced guide. Even though the trek was exhausting, it was absolutely worth it as we got rewarded with some stunning views over the whole Annapurna mountain range. Absolutely breathtaking! Next time when I come back to Nepal with some more time I will definitely book with them again. All in one they render an amazing service which is absolutely worth its money."

All information was made very clear and simple when we first visited Green Valley treks in Kathmandu, and it was no problem when we decided to leave the very next day for our trek - trekking permits, paperwork and guide/porter was organised promptly and professionally. Raj was a top quality guide with great people skills and years of experience. He tailored the experience to our own walking speed and ability, taught us a great Nepali card game which we played for hours on end and knew all the best lodges/places to eat. This made the trekking experience much more enjoyable. Prakash was a very hardworking porter and we were really impressed!! Thanks guys."

We were new at this game and a little concerned at being ripped off, but needn't have worried. Raj was very accommodating, extremely considerate, always on time and very polite. We had a great meeting to meet our guide Krishna and get organised. The walk was brilliant (5 days Nayapul to Poon Hill) and there was never a minute when any of us wanted to be somewhere else. Krishna was very knowledgeable, and very patient. He loved to sing which was a nice touch! And he made us feel like we'd known him for years, being very relaxed in our company. He was always happy to oblige if we wanted longer for photos, or a rest or a bit of a sleep-in! And he's stayed in touch since the walk - a friend for when I go back! The thing that most impressed me was the Company's approach to its customers - they are open to feedback, put the customer first and are clearly keen to develop and keep an excellent reputation."

Raj, the coordinator, was very professional in responding to all my questions. He even sent me an excel sheet filled with items I should bring prior to arriving to Nepal. Additionally, he even set up an orientation day for us. I would recommend packing lighter than usual, since the company will give you a sleeping bag, down jacket, and purified water throughout the trip. I went during mid January, and the weather wasn't too cold! Dress in light layers and you should be fine. I would also highly recommend Rajan, our tour guide. He was very informative about what to expect for each day. He even brought oranges and apples just for us! Best of all, he enjoys giving you a cultural taste of Nepal. He will most likely teach you local songs and some Nepali phrases. Also, I liked how Rajan was very patient and accommodating. I tend to take my time trekking, and never found myself rushed during this trip. Our porter, Binod, was always positive and in a good mood. The food at the guest houses were impeccable! I highly recommend trying the dal baat (rice plate) and du chai (milk tea). Overall, I had a very positive experience--and would highly recommend green valley Nepal treks to anyone!"

It was totally wonderful and truly enjoyed it! Everyday was a joy in spite of the cloudy cold weather. The terrain was different from the Annapurna trail, there was forest, greenery, moss and walking along the ridge line to reach high camp. All beautiful and beyond. The route arranged by Dipak and Arjun was spot on! The guesthouses were uncrowded and often we were hiking alone for hours. Which was wonderful different from the norm Annapurna side yet of coz thinking for the trek biz, it was worrying for them. As usual, the nepali people along the trail and trek were friendly, humourous and beyond nice! There were options of staying and being in the village like Sidhing and Lwang, homestay which trekkers nowadays dont get anymore. So, again totally worth it! Green valley once again done their best and provided good services, easy going bunch of people trying to make honest living from what they enjoy - being in the mountains. Kudos to them."

KP and Arjun were happy to accommodate all our needs including additional hotel nights stay in KTM and airline flight to Pokhara rather than the tour bus. I would recommend the flight to Pokhara if you are doing this tour as it gives you a lot more time to explore Pokhara as well as you can enjoy the beautiful views of the mountains from the plane window. In Pokhara you can rent kayaks, paddleboards, or boats to enjoy Fewa Lake. We also did the Parahawking adventure where we paraglided with Egyptian vultures 1800m up in the sky...very cool and definitely a trip highlight! We then spent the next 6 days in the mountains, which was so beautiful. Amazing views particularly at sunrise in Poon Hill and from our hotel room in Ghorepani which had big windows on three sides of the room. The other highlight was the hot springs in Jhinu Danda - a definite place to visit! Overall, we had a great experience with Raz as our guide and Prakash as porter. Both Raz and Prakash were very helpful and attentive throughout the trek. If you have a few more days, I would recommend the ABC trek which is similar to Poon Hill with an additional 2 days up to base camp and back down. Will definitely be returning to Nepal and would recommend this company to anyone planning a visit!"

There are lots of guides and porters employed by Green Valley, but our group was a great mixture, and a very balanced team: Gophal, a guide with over 25 years experience, was hugely informative about Nepal, trekking and learning some basic Nepali. His route finding and pace setting were invaluable over the two weeks or so we were together.Bhim and Sanotos, the porters, were a great double act- not only did they carry large amounts of kit (far faster and more efficiently than we could), they made us laugh, kept us comfortable, played cards and silly games with us, and generally couldn't do enough for us. Altogether, we went from strangers to friends in a short time, and I would have no hesitation in recommending Green Valley for any trek you consider. Next time, I know who I will ask to organise a trek for me."

I chose this company based on the stellar reviews here on Trip Advisor and I feel so blessed I came across this wonderful company. Trekking with green valley gave me one of the most powerful and transformative experiences of my life. I was not expecting to be so blown away by the beauty of Nepal and the Himalayas. i was very well taken care of during the entire duration of this trip, from the minute I started inquiring about the trek till the day I was dropped off at the airport. Arjun helped me coordinate the logistics of the trip. He very patiently and kindly answered all of my questions and helped me tailor my trip according to my needs and wants. I did the Annapurna Base Camp trek. The itinerary was well planned out, giving us ample time to acclimate to the altitude so that I never got sick or needed to take Diamox. I was picked up my Arjun and a driver from the airport, taken to my hotel, and settled in. The next day, Arjun helped me coordinate some tourist activities around Kathmandu. He helped me do the same even when I was in Pokhara, right before the trek began. The trek itself was stunning. Nepal is a gem -- with crazy epic mountain views and lush jungles. My guide Bhairas and my porter Prakas were very attentive, kind, and warm. I felt safe and very well-protected, which was important to me as a woman traveling solo. The trek was beautiful\u2014 starting off with the forest/jungle, with blooming rhododendrons and ending at the INCREDIBLE views of the base of the Himalayas as base camp. I would do another trek with Green Valley in a heartbeat. While I know the situation is shaky right now due to the recent events, when people are starting to feel safe enough (and it does seem like the worst has passed!), I would encourage anyone to trek with this company. You will not be disappointed. Arjun comes with years of experience as both a guide and porter himself, so he has a very good base of information to know how to help you anticipate the trek and how to plan well for it. I cannot say enough amazing things! Arjun, Bhairas and Prakas have become my family, not just people I once knew. We still keep in touch and I know we will be for a long while."

After having spent a few days in Kathmandu, Raj from Green Valley fetched us at our residence and drove us to the office, where we reviewed all requests and details before the trip. The next morning we were picked up at our residence by Raj, our guide Krishna and our two porters in a jeep. We then drove to Dunche where the trek began. The next days we had a fantastic but tough trip up to Gosainkunda and Laurebina pass 4600 meters above sea level, whereafter we descended into the Helambu region. The last day we were picked up by a jeep in Sundarijal and driven back to our residence in Kathmandu. On the whole trip Krishna was a good support, we talked about nature and the mountains, but also about culture and politics in Nepal and personal matters. He spoke encouraging to us when we were tired, he cut steps in the ice when it was difficult to get a foothold and he made sure that we got the best catering in the tea houses. Our conclusion is that the Green Valley and Raj handled the trip very professionally and thought of every detail. Our guide Krishna was a fantastic walking mate, without him we had not been able to complete the trip. Our two carriers Bhim and Binod were helpful and pleasant company. We recommend Green Valley, Raj and Krishna to all who want a safe and eventful trek in Nepal."

Unfortunately our planned trek of 13 days was cut very short due to rock fall and bad weather in Upper Mustang. We only got about three hours into Upper Mustang. This wasn't the best time of year to go, and noone can control the weather, but a warning prior to booking about the likelihood of suitable trekking weather in Upper Mustang from Green Valley might have been good. When we were unable to carry out the main part of our trek into Upper Mustang Green Valley helpfully offered us an alternative trek.Though we were disappointed with not being able to spend much time in Upper Mustang (especially given the non-refundable expensive permits from the Government!), we had a good time in Jomsom, Kagbeni and Muktinath. The scenery was spectacular! Krishna was a great guide and we would book through Green Valley again. Had it gone to plan the trek would have been good value for money.

I was recommended Green Valley for the Everest Base Camp Trek last year, and trying to sort that out at the last minute (a week before flying into Nepal), I was impressed by how easily and quickly they got back to me and confirmed everything. Obviously organising the trek by yourself is A LOT cheaper, but their prices are reasonable compared to other companies and the service they offer is well worth it - I got picked up from the airport upon arrival, hotel within Kathmandu covered, Arjun (one of the owners) even brought me around sightseeing in Kathmandu on my first day, dinner, etc. The itinerary within the trek was also really flexible and they do their best to give you your money's worth - in my case, I booked into the EBC + 3 passes trek, but didn't do the 3rd pass, so my last few days they booked me into nicer rooms with ensuites.After the trek, I spoke to them about what else I wanted to do in Nepal and Arjun quickly came up with an itinerary + costs. It was reasonable and just much more convenient than trying to organise it all myself, so I decided to go for it. This included Chitwan safari, Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek + Pokhara paragliding.I have to say the Chitwan safari, which was done through Jungle Wildlife Camp, was a bit of a let down. For the price you pay, there are dozens of other companies all offering similar packages so I'd say is it definitely worth shopping around and maybe booking it directly yourself. Or better yet, take a bus into Chitwan and find a place upon arrival.I had Dipak as my guide for the Annapurna trek, and it was such a great experience. I would definitely recommend him as a guide - felt more like I was trekking with a friend than a guide. Paragliding in Pokhara is completely standard at USD$85 for a ride so it is worth booking it through them as you will not find a different price anywhere else. The company they used (I can't remember their name) was really great. Definitely recommend it.I also wanted to do a yoga retreat, and even though they don't offer that, Arjun found a popular place and package to suit me, called up the company to enquire and gave me their number so I could arrange that myself when I got to Pokhara. Overall, Green Valley offered very personal service, completely tailored to whatever you want to do. They go out of their way to make sure you are happy and get the right information. And they constantly ask for feedback of your experiences so they can better their service. If you want to do trekking in Nepal I would highly recommend them. And Dipak as your guide if you can. Perhaps for tours that they organise through external companies, it might be worth shopping around for a better deal. And the only downside I would say is that you have to (recommended) tip your guide roughly 10% of the trek price, which is significant if you are on a tight budget. They only tell you the night before you fly off as well, which was a little annoying, and as I learnt from other people, a lot of companies tend to do this as well. In reality though, most people I spoke to didn't tip the full 10% but definitely did tip some or buy presents for their guides. So best to factor this in when planning your budget.Thanks guys for my amazing Nepal experience!"

We met one of the co-owners, KP, at the hostel he owns (Sparkling Turtle Backpackers Hostel - a great place to stay). My group went to Nepal with no itinerary and KP was amazing at taking the time to go over different trekking routes with the various pros and cons of each (KP is a former trekking guide so this was coming from firsthand experience). He was extremely straightforward with what he was offering, which was nice as we were prepared to deal with people trying to take advantage of us. KP even told us to take a couple of days and compare his prices with other trekking companies. A lot of the other companies were very incompetent and hardly knew what they were talking about and Green Valley had the best prices by far. We bought a 25 day package that included 3 meals & tea a day, accommodations, transportation to and from the trek, trekking permits and guide salary. Literally everything we needed was taken care of for us which was a huge weight off of my chest. Our guide was Bhim who was the best guide we could have ever asked for. Overall excellent experience all thanks to Green Valley Nepal Treks."

Raj, one of the co-owners was prompt and professional in handling our concerns and queries. He was able to tailor the trek according to our requirements and quoted us a very reasonable price. Everything was very well organized. We were pleasantly surprised to have Raj himself picked us up at the airport even though we had arrived after midnight! We will certainly use the agency (and Raj) services again as we were impressed with the prompt, reliable, professional and honest services rendered. Many thanks Raj for all the arrangements!Note:The Manaslu circuit trek offers one of the best (if not the best) mountain sceneries in Nepal. One can truly feel the majesty and closeness of the mountains starting from Lho. The sights were really awesome! It was both an inspiring and at the same time humbling experience.GURU & YOKI (SINGAPORE)."

Right from the beginning I was impressed with the level of service provided - although we all arrived to Nepal at different times there was someone waiting to pick us up at the airport. Our trek manager Raj was very helpful with recommending what gear to buy before we started the trek and set us up with our guide Gopal.The actual trek was nothing short of amazing, although challenging at times. I personally underestimated the difficulty of trekking at altitude and found myself short of breath most of the time. Our guide Gopal understood and adjusted our pace to a manageable level. Gopal's English was great and it was quite obvious that he had done the trail many times previously as he knew just about every other guide/local around. During the trek we stayed at the tea houses/lodges and I must say the food was surprisingly decent (Gopal also made sure we had biscuits and fruit every day as an added bonus). However there was no way to escape the cold nights(apart from being tucked away in a sleeping bag).I would also like to highlight Gopal's and the porters efforts to help one of our friends who got sick during the trip with severe mountain sickness ultimately requiring chopper evacuation in Macchermo. While unfortunate, they responded promptly and helped him get to the hospital at a very early hour (lucky for us there was a hospital in Macchermo). Raj immediately sorted out the calls to the rescue service and he was on his way back to Kathmandu that morning.Overall I was happy with the package offered by Raj and especially impressed with the level of service we got from himself as well as the guides and porters. I would highly recommend them to do anything trekking/adventure related in Nepal."

This was a service above and beyond what I expected and I thank them for treating me so well. Therefore I highly recommend Green Valley Treks for your trek of Nepal as I will certainly return and cross-fingers, complete this trek or another in the future using this company.Thanks again to Raj, Gopal (guide), the Porters and everyone involved at Green Valley Treks."

My friends and I live in Canada and we booked Green Valley as a result of their Trip Advisor high ranking and excellent reviews after a thorough analysis of many other companies. It was the best choice considering the price and quality of the services offered. First of all, we were impressed with their flexibility in terms of dates and route. We were able to trek to Everest Base Camp via Gokyo in only 14 days, and all safe and sound without any incidents. We were a relatively small group, 6 clients, but Green Valley provided us 2 experienced guides and 2 very capable porters that not only provided us guidance, but they were very knowledgeable and spoke English fluently and able to offer a lot of information during the trek. Second of all, I have noticed that they booked some of the best Tea Houses for our nightly accommodations and that made our trip even more pleasant. The guides were constantly assessing our state and ensure that we all were in best shape for the next trekking day. I got sick one night (fever and diarrhea) and the guides provided medication and advice that allowed me to recover fast and continue the trip and enjoy the magnificent views offered by Himalayas. I can\u2019t be thankful enough for their support.At the end of the 14 days we all felt like family and to be honest was hard to leave them. We will miss them. Thank you Mingmar and Jangbu Sherpa for making my dream come through."

Booking our trek via Green Valley turned out to be an excellent choice. Raj took care of us from the very first minute when arriving in Nepal. He picked us up at the airport and took us to the pre-booked accommodation for the first night. Meanwhile, Raj had organized all our trekking permits, so we could start the journey to Langtang valley the very next morning. Our guide Krish and his porters took care of us from now on. We met a lot of very friendly people in this beautiful country. Especially, I would like to point out the outstanding quality of our guide. Not only his English was far better than average, he also provided us with a very obliging attitude. For instance we could always order our breakfast the evening before providing us some more calmness in the mornings. He never got tired in explaining Nepalese culture and nature to us. Returning to Kathmandu, we booked a guided city tour (also organized by Raj). That was a very convenient way to discover this amazing city in the limited time we had. I definitely consider returning to Nepal. Probably, I would book Anapurna Circuit next time but for sure I would spend more time than just one week in Nepal. There is so much to discover.I can recommend Green Valley trekking as very trustful, absolutely friendly and professional company. For me it will be my first choice when returning to Nepal."

There had been helicopters in and out for a couple of days because the passe was (unpassable!)The Manaslu circuit was fantastic, even more that what we expected although we did not really know what to expect. As Sonia said \"straight out of National Geographic\" It helped that we had a very knowledgeable guide who advised us of the cultural aspects of every area. Lauren did get to see a Yak after all. The teahouses were all terrific as was the food although I don't think I will be eating Dal Baht for quite some time!I would highly recommend Green Valley and would only ask for Krishna as a guide as I was so impressed (he I am sure probably saved my life a few times as my balance is not brilliant!)Those porters are brilliant, if you think you are fit just take a look at what those lads do!"

When I fell ill with a stomach bug, they tended to me around the clock, rearranged our hiking schedule and kept in touch with the offices in Kathmandu to brief them on my status.

From arranging flights, accommodations, to sight seeing guides and restaurant recommendations, Arjun made us feel totally cared for. He brought us to and from the airport with every flight, provided us with welcome and farewell dinners at each end of our trip, and just provided reassurance with his expertise and smile. Arjun and Green valley are top of the line. I will absolutely recommend them to every friend and family member who visits Nepal. And I will use them on my next visit!!"

The best thing with travel is word of mouth,I got talking to a fellow traveller just back from the Annapurna trek, she recommended this company, and it was the best decision yet. With-in no time we'd meet Raj, sorted a loose plan and then off the next day. It was perfect, relaxed and flexible, we directed the vague plan, they filled in the detail. Our Guide Deepak and Krishana our porter were fantastic. They were chilled and relaxed while being perfectly professional (my kind of guide) just REALLY NICE guys. They looked after us so well, I much preferred using local a company, they have the local knowledge and insight. They even held extra bags for us while trekking, they score 10/10 from me."

Arjun was incredibly helpful from our very first e-mail to him - responding immediately, answering all of our questions, and accommodating any special requests. He took care of all travel logistics in Kathmandu, and helped us plan an impromptu side-trip to Pokhara and Bhaktapur, as we finished our trek several days early (due to great weather and good acclimatization on the mountain). Our Sherpa Guide and Porter were very helpful, knowledgeable, and lots of fun! None of us could imagine the trek being any better - it was incredible. Many thanks to Arjun and the rest of Green Valley staff for an amazing trip!"

I traveled with him in Langtang trek and teh Gosaikund (the frozen lakes) and it was such a wonderful and remarkable experience. Because of the views, and the people, and the hiking and trekking in the mountains, and no less because Rajesh is such a splendid guide. I learned through him the basics of Nepalese, as well as many of the country's history and its people's culture and religion. And needless to say he knows all about the trek, the way, the routes and the best places to stay and to eat in. Thanks to his presence as a guide, I had the unique experience of being invited to a traditional wedding that was happening in one of the villages next to the village where we spent the night during the trek. Truly, during this Trek Rajesh became to me much more than a guide - a sathi, a friend. I can't wait to go back to Nepal and travel with him again!"

Our original plan was to spend a month in India but after discovering we had left it too late to get the correct visa, we decided to have a two week detour through Nepal. This was completely unplanned and turned out to be the best two weeks of our journey! We were recommended a hostel by friends and from there, we had our entire Poon Hill walk AND Chitwan National Park itinerary organised. (Not to mention they also organised our Indian visa's!) We are usually the type of travellers who sort out the details without help but as we had such tight timing, Green Valley Nepal took all the added stress out of our travel. An enormous thank you to our guide Krishna who was not only patient, but informative, motivated and very respectful. We thoroughly enjoyed sharing time and stories with him and he went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. The walk, the tea-house's and the views are incredible!Chitwan National Park was, for us, a little disappointing as there was a lack of organisation and communication when we arrived. This place has huge potential, and however relaxing, it did not live up to our expectations. Green Valley Nepal is a friendly and trustworthy company who we can definately recommend and hold in high regards who go above and beyond expectation."

I arranged a 2 day tour with Green Valley to see Kathmandu Durbar Square, Swayambhunath/Monkey Temple, Pashupatinath, Boudhanath, Patan, and Bhaktapur. I would recommend taking two days to see all the sights, as there is so much to see and one day really isn't enough. Everything was arranged very professionally and I was picked up and dropped off at my hotel each day. My guide was very informative and had a wealth of knowledge to share. I learned so much about the temples, history, and religion, which I really appreciated, since I wanted to learn about the sights and their significance, not just take a picture and leave. If you have more time, I would recommend a few days to really explore all the sights that Kathmandu Valley has to offer. Green Valley was very flexible, and the sense I got was that they are very accommodating about tailor-made trips that fit their guests individual interests. Arjun, the Executive Director of Green Valley, was a pleasure to work with, and was very attentive about making sure the day tours went well. He was very responsive to correspondence over email, and was also always available when I dropped by the office (very conveniently located in Thamel). It was great chatting with both him and my guide about Nepal and gaining some more insight into their incredible country. I hope to return to Nepal one day, and will definitely be reaching out to Green Valley for my arrangements when I do. I will also point out that this was one of the few companies I found when I did research ahead of time that would set up private day tours for solo travelers. Thanks again to Arjun and everyone at Green Valley for a wonderful experience."

From what I saw of some other guides, Krishna was by far and away much more professional and attentive. Poor Krishna ended up being more of a babysitter than a guide with us, I think! From beginning to end, our dealings with Green Valley were wonderful. I am so very glad my instincts told me to go with Green Valley.Thanks Green Valley! J and W"

I found this company while I was finding the hostel, which had the same owner, so I decided to book both trip and accommodations in Kathmandu altogether, and I got quite a good price. I went alone, so, as to save my money, I hired a porter-guide who can speak a bit English that made me sometimes a bit confused about what he wanted to say, but that's not a big problem since I could still understand mostly. My porter guide was helpful and friendly and very strong! And if you want a guide with very good English, you should hire a I booked a full package, all accommodations on the mountain+ 4 nights in Kathmandu + 3 meals a day on the mountain, except tips and mineral water, and after I talked to Canadian friends whom I met in Dingboche, I found that it's quite cheap compared to the same package from other companies. (Around $400-600 different for 15-day trip!!!) Anyway, I'd recommend a not-eat-much girl like me to book a trekking package without accommodations and food, since you can save, more, quite amount of money. ( A room cost around $2-$6 per night in the mountain, and all the lodge strictly want you to have meals at their lodges which you can control how much you want to spend for a meal which is saver than paying all at first with the company. But for those who eat a lot, I don't see much difference of the price and maybe paying all at first will be more comfortable and saver.)All in all, I had a very good experience while I was trekking, although I didn't reach EBC because of the Cyclone from Bay of Bengol. I'd like to recommend anyone to go trekking with Green Valley, and if you need a good and clean hostel in Thamel, Happily ever after hostel can be a good choice for you."

We sat and had tea and discussed life in Kathmandu / Australia for 20 mins before we discussed the trek (Something i found refreshing after all the other \"Hard sellers\") after an hour we had settled on the Annapurna trek.All i can say is that we wanted for nothing. the sights, sounds, guides, Sherpa\u2019s etc. were all perfect. I have to say it\u2019s the best use of money i could possibly hope to use.Money, unlike \"time\" is not the most expensive commodity, we can always make more money, however we cannot make more time, if someone wastes our time it cuts deep, however if someone help you use the time you have for the most amazing adventure, well, there is nothing better than waking up with the feeling that you could die on that day and you would be fulfilled.Thank you Green Valley, thank you RajNamaste's to you and the staff!"

Our guide Gopal and our porters Suren and Auttare were fabulous. Gopal was extremely helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, skilled and professional, with a great sense of humour and many fascinating stories. The accommodation and food along the trek were excellent, and exceeded my expectations.

He has a great indepth knowledge of the places visited which makes it very interesting and means you learn a lot. The accommodation arranged via the company was beautiful, with stunning views, good food, comfortable rooms and such good value for money. All of the food stops included in the package were also good quality. When I return to Nepal I will definitely use this company again as I couldn't have asked for anything more. Krish even accompanied me to the king's palace in Kathmandu as an addition to the trip when I mentioned that I planned to visit there, he went over and above my expectations. I would also thoroughly recommend both Nagarkot and Patak and Bhakarput as destinations for any travellers to Nepal."

Myself and my family (two young adults and two in their fifties) did a short trek in the Annapurna Region. KP, the owner, gave excellent recommendations for how much we should attempt to do each day, what sites not to miss, and what to pack. Our guide, Raj, and two porters, Robin and Ganga, were fabulous! When my parents needed to slow down they were extremely patient and always encouraging. We saw several other groups where the guides were rushing people and pushing them to keep moving without any breaks. I never felt pressured, but Raj made sure we always got to our hotel in time for a great meal and a night's rest. The trek itself was beautiful and I highly recommend it to anyone coming to Nepal, especially if this is your first time trekking!! Doable but definitely rewarding!!"

            "review": "Simply Stunning Start to Nepal. My wife and daughter (23) and I arranged a short trek from Katmandu with Rajendra. We wanted to get out of the city quickly and up and around the mountains that surround the city without having to drive for miles. You could possibly easily do trek on your own and I am sure many experienced trekkers do it very easily if they know the routes. Anyhow we decided that as novice trekkers in Nepal we would hire a guide and were lucky enough to get Krishnu from Green Valley as our guide. He just made it all so much easier and comes highly recommended. The start of the trip was at Sundarual a taxi ride away and then we followed a waterpipe up to a vantage point for lunch where you get an idea of the height you are gaining. Then on to a basic hotel for a night and then a long day trek to Nagarkot. It is actually quite a hard trek if you are just starting off in Nepal, although the locals will laugh at you for saying so. My daughter had severe blisters on her feet by the second day and having a guide to help carry a small amount of kit, and encourgage you on, was actually really important for us and turned what could have been a disaster into a wonderful short trek out of Katmandu. I would highly recommend doing the same if you were starting off in Nepal just as a starter to bigger things. My wife and daughter went on to do some much longer treks elsewhere in Nepal but I had to go back home. My daughter also did an amazing rafting trip. If you want to see my photos of my ten day visit to Nepal, including this short trek, then you can find the photos with some commentary on my facebook album link here https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150638742947924.373068.600977923&type=1&l=d719198742"

When me and my friends were paying the price for the trekking to one of the guys of the agency we decided to go for the all inclusive package (which included accommodation, 3 beverages and 3 dishes per day). The guy confirmed us that we would have saved money with this option, he confirmed that the daily price for these things would have been around 25 dollars, but once on the trek we realized that it was around 10 dollars. So eventually we paid more than the twice of the real price for these expenses. One more thing, when planning the trek at the beginning, the guy from the agency confirmed us that the rest days would be 3... in reality there was only 1. So I can say that the price that these guys charged us was just insane.. the all inclusive package was a rip off and the guy of the agency we dealt with was just a liar.. I wonder how they got the tripadvisor certificate of excellence sticker they proudly show in their office to the clients.."

Our friend of Green Valley arranged al the trips, hotels, restaurants and more. It's good to have one of the locals with you to translate and to arrange everything. He helped us with the price of many tours and things and with our needs at hotels and restaurants. When he had questions about arranging something he called his office and they helped us from there. We have also been to the office of Green Valley to celebrate the birthday of our friend with special birthday-cake! It was a fantastic tour this two weeks with our personal guide.

I\u2019d recommend the Dal Baht to anyone and the Chow Mein or noodles. Dibash, became friend as well as our guide. He was extremely knowledgeable and fun. He made sure we knew exactly what the next day entailed and was always on hand should we need him. We spent most night playing games and cards. I would certainly recommend anyone considering a trip the Himalayas to contact Trekking Planners and speak to them about your requirements.

I always pause and think: \"where do I start? The beautiful forests, the wonderful sounds of yak bells, the things I learnt from my guide...?\" . There was so much awesomeness, it's very difficult to convey what happened in the two and a bit weeks I had with Trekking Planner. A good start is Trekking Planner's organisation and friendliness. From the very first contact I made with Dipak there was a good tailoring of the trek to our needs. All matters were well explained and no stone left unturned in Trekking Planner's organisation. The adjustment of the holiday to our needs was constant throughout, with our guide (Dibash) was able to change our programme throughout the trek to adapt to all our wishes. He and Dipak acted in a caring and friendly manner throughout the trip. At one point I became ill near the Base Camp, Dibash took excellent care of me in a calm manner ensuring I reached my goal safely. I am extremely appreciative of this mature and high-efficacy treatment. The accommodation was excellent the whole way up the mountain, the food and drinks options were good (and very filling - I now have a new found love for Dal Baht and yak meat!) and there was plenty of opportunity to meet other travellers and have interesting convivial conversation. Our guide, Dibash, became both a friend as well as our guide :) He was extremely knowledgeable about the environment, enlightening us on our trek on stupas, mountain eights, tibetan culture, and plants. Truly a Renaissance man of the Himalayas!I heartily recommend anyone considering a trip the Himalayas find these guys to get the most memorable experiences out of your time!"

My wife and I contacted several trek planning agencies by email around a month before our trek; Dipak was fantastic in his correspondence with us, providing prompt replies with detailed and clear responses to our questions. Once we got to Kathmandu, we were greeted by Dipak and taken to the hotel and his office. Dipak gave us a clear outline of what would be happening over the next few days and introduced us to our awesome trek guide, Narayan. We had an enjoyable cultural dinner at night.The next day, we were provided a guided tour of Kathmandu. The historical and cultural context the guide provided definitely enriched our experience of the temples, stupa and the city. They organized a private car for us to travel between Pokhara and Kathmandu; no issues, no delays. Right before setting off on our trek, Narayan introduced us to our porter, Thaman. Over the next few days, my wife and I had a great time learning about the peaks, trekking routes, the forest, the farms, the Nepali lifestyle, and about our guide and porter. The trek was gorgeous and we never felt rushed. Narayan kept surprising us with local delicacies and we enjoyed a few rounds of card games on a couple of nights. When I sprained my ankle, he was attentive and took care of the situation. He also regularly kept track of the weather to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for us. Both our guide and porter were in positive spirits throughout the trek which made for a fun time. After we got back to Pokhara, we walked around the lake and took a pleasant boat ride. We also enjoyed a celebratory dinner at a spot Narayan recommended. Finally, we made it back to Kathmandu and flew out the next day. Narayan came with us to the airport and Dipak met us to check if we were doing well everyday we were in Kathmandu. Overall, a well planned, well executed experience and we thank Trekking Planner and especially the team of Dipak, Narayan and Thaman for a memorable time. I'd highly recommend Trekking Planner to anyone looking to trek in Nepal! We hope to make it back when the clouds are not around!"

Dipak from Nepal Trekking Planner took care of everything. We were met from the airport, taken to hotel for rest then shown around the city by an interesting english speaking guide. We were given an authentic Nepalese meal which was fun too! The touring of Kathmandu was really appreciated and we could not have explored the city without them. Driving in Nepal is insane - but we always felt safe with the drivers they supplied.Then the real fun began! We were introduced in advance to our mountain guide who met us early to drive to the airport to fly to Lukla. As it is a small plane every seat is a window seat. The guide recommended the left side to see the mountains and so we all had incredible views of the Himalayas on the way up. We had a smooth flight with clear skies up to the mountains.In Lukla the guide had already arranged a porter to meet us and carry our bags. While the three in our group all had experience hiking... we were VERY glad we had a porter once we got higher up!! He was amazing - carrying our things ahead of us everyday so that it was in our rooms before we arrived after each days trek. All the Nepalese people were friendly and happy to see visitors. The guide we had was really helpful to pace us and keep us hydrated! He even pulled out snacks for us which was unexpected :)Higher up some of our group got diarrhea and altitude headaches. We were taken care of so well by the guide! Who gave us hydration salts and checked on us regularly when feeling bad. We ended up taking an extra rest day on the way up by his recommendation which was no problem. Nepal Trekking Planner are very flexible with your holiday and make it clear that they can change the plans to suit individual needs etc along the way.Because of the guides great care of us we all made it to Everest Base Camp after 8 days in the mountains. We left early that day and to our surprise we were the first ones to arrive that day! For 30 minutes we had the entire Everest Base Camp to enjoy to ourselves!! It was beautiful being surrounded by such mountains and glaciers. Definitely worth visiting if you can!One member of our group hadn't eaten great on the way up, and actually got worse after we got to Everest Base Camp. The guide was fantastic taking care of him and quickly found out our insurance details and contacted them and a helicopter company along with Dipak back in Kathmandu. We did not need to contact anyone. And a helicopter met us the next morning to take us all the way back to Kathmandu. From there we were taken to the international hospital where we were taken great care of and recovered in hours! Dipak was there and took us back to the hotel once we could leave. He took care of everything and the insurance were happy to pay, with just a small excess. (We used World Nomads).Back in the city early Nepal Trekking Planner ensured we had the hotel booked for all our nights and took care of us while in Kathmandu! They even helped us arrange to go white-water-rafting on our last day :) which we did with our guide which was a fun way to end the trip! We also had another meal with Dipak and the guide as a farewell sendoff.Nepal Trekking Planner were fantastic in arranging our trip to Nepal. We would have been lost without them. We had an amazing time visiting and exploring Kathmandu, the trek from Lukla to Everest Base Camp, and a white water rafting trip a few hours drive from Kathmandu. No matter what happens during your visit Nepal Trekking Planner will take good care of you and ensure you have a great time!I cannot recommend them enough and I will definitely be using them again next time I visit Nepal."

Before i summarise on the title of this short story,let me first say what a great experience, one in which I shall never forget, thanks mainly to Ganache our guide who made the extra effort to ensure we were well looked after during the daily trek,passing on his knowledge of the surrounding areas and ensuring we were well fed and warm at the lodges. Appreciated the nightly Nepalese game of cards before hitting the sack for some well earned sleep.Regretfully I became quiet ill with pneumonia and unable to continue. Ganache contacted Dipak the Manager of Trekking Nepal whom quickly arranged for a helicopter and ambulance to meet me at Kathmandu airport. Dipak was waiting at the hospital to ensure all formalities were taken care of and showed genuine concern as to my health, this impressed me and was indeed a reflection of how well the company had during the trek taken care of its clients. Dipak came to see me daily asking if there was anything I needed and whilst there would contact my family on his mobile so I could talk to them. This again a true reflection of there business ethics. In summary although I got ill, I would have no hesitation to do this trek again knowing that Dipak and Ganache will perform small miracles should they be required.Thanks Guys!!!

            "review": "Amazing Everest/Cho La/Goyko Experience with Trekking Planner. Dipak and his group Trekking Planner arranged everything we wanted and needed down to the last detail. When we first planned our trip I researched multiple trekking companies and Dipak stood out for two glaring reasons. First, he was open and honest with me from the beginning of the pre-planning. I actually sent him some questions that I already knew the answer to but had been warned by experienced Nepal trekkers I needed to find someone who answered them honestly. (For ex. asking if I could make my trek much shorter than is truly safe). He was always the most prompt to respond (always within 24 hours..36 after the earthquake!!!!) and he explained why he felt it might endanger us by going to high too fast. I had others respond \"no problem.\" There were several other examples and in each case he was honest and never made me feel uncomfortable about hiring him sight unseen!Secondly, he was very good about our need for some flexibility in the normal itinerary and worked with us to make sure we could see what we wanted to see during our timeframe and stay where we wanted, choose our own food, etc... as well as the possibility to change our minds during the trek if we so decided. My husband and I were very impressed with his hands on management style. He ensured every need was met and followed through with everything he promised with the upmost professionalism at all times. Our actual trek to Everest Base Camp and then to Gokyo Lakes via the Cho La Pass was absolutely stunning, challenging and life-changing. Our guide, Narayan Dhital, was the perfect fit for us. He was incredibly kind and very funny which was were grateful for during some of the tougher times. He was so fun to be around but also extremely knowledgeable of the entire route and all the views we were seeing. I'm sure he tired of me repeatedly asking him to repeat the line of mountains by name, but he did without any sign of impatience with me! He and my husband hit it off right away and were fast friends, playing dice games every night and celebrating with beers after our trek was complete. Our Sherpa porter, Lhakpa, was truly the sweetest and most amazing young man. I don't know how he carried some of what he carried over some of the most difficult terrain. And he never once complained or showed any signs of stress. In fact, he beat us to every stop, many times hours ahead of us. However, when he did choose to stay and trek with us on certain days he was a welcome addition who we loved having as a traveling companion. We felt very close to both him and Narayan and loved our evenings drinking tea, playing dice and laughing over the days stories. As an example of the kindness of these two men...when we did the cho la pass....very long day with very very early start and very very cold weather...they were the ultimate professionals and kept us safe at times when I could've been really been in trouble without them. In fact, after we made it to the top of the pass the two of them went back to the pass to help two other struggling groups who didn't know the correct direction to go and would not have made it to the pass with their packs without the aid of Narayan and Lhapka. We are back in the States now and miss our Nepal friends..as we truly consider them now. I cannot say enough good things about Trekking planner and their crew. I would HAPPILY use them again and again. And I am happy to answer any private questions anyone has about the group if anyone needs further info!!!!!If you want honest, knowledgeable and fun.... this is the group!!!"

My Dad had to be evacuated from Lobuche due to severe case of attitude sickness and pneumonia and the Trekking Planner team acted quickly and efficiently to ensure his safety. With the prompt thinking of our guide Ganesh and Dipak liasing with our insurance company and the helicopter service, my dad was in an safe environment within a few hours of being diagnoise.Unlike other organisers, Dipak regularly visited my Dad in the hospital to ensure he recovered well and kept me up-to-date.Our guide Ganesh also comes highly recommended. He's a well educated, informed and easily communicative individual who's always by your side. You can trek at your pace unlike other guides I've heard about. Working alongside our Sherpa Milan, one of the best things with our group was the flexibility to turn our 14 day trek to 11 days halfway through. This may not seem like much but this a big advantage when you're trying to make an early flight or when you feel like more of a challenge. Furthermore, other tourists have positively commented on Ganesh friendly and helpful personality as he's socially involved with everyone at the lodges. Overall, my experience to Everest Camp Base is a once in a lifetime opportunity and after a tiring slog for many days to get there you really appreciate having Ganesh and Dipak organise all accomodation, meals, flights (they skip the lines - big advantage!) so you can just concentrate on your trekking, recovering and making friends with likeminded people.Ganesh, Milan, and Dipak come recommended by us (Australian father and son travellers)."

This was a tough trek and his help was invaluable. Also it was a great help to have Raz carry my rucksack!

This time we took a 12 day trek to Gokyo which offers great views of Everest and is a little off the Base Camp beaten track.We were well looked after in Kathmandu and on the trek. We are retired and Narayan, our experienced guide, was always careful to ensure we took it slowly and steadily. We had no altitude problems going up to over 5000m. We took a personalised trip for just the two of us so we could travel at our own pace. Highly recommended as costs little more than joining a group. Much better value offered than traveling with an international company and all the income stays in Nepal!On our trek we also met a Trekker travelling with TP on an Island Peak expedition and he was very happy with his experience too.So if you are planning a trek in Nepal my advice is get in touch with Trekking Planner. They look after you in every way."

The most important thing was that Pasang kept me safe at all times, and as an added bonus, we made it to the summit of Island Peak in the Everest region. Everything else that Dipak arranged went very smoothly - internal flights, trekking and climbing permits, the allocation of a very good and very hard working porter, transport around Kathmandu, and hotel bookings.

On a recommendation from a friend I contacted a Nepali guide, Ganesh and the manager of the Nepal Trekking Planner, Dipak - both via FB messenger and email. Communication was quick, all my questions were answered promptly and they had no hesitation with a solo trekker. My initial itinerary of a 21 day trek was changed to an 11 day trek at my request after the earthquake, as I was hoping to do some volunteer work and partake in the Dashain Festival during my stay. After a 10 month consultation period and regular contact with both Dipak and Ganesh I landed in Kathmandu on 05 Oct 15. Dipak had organised a authentic welcome dinner, a day tour and 3 days of voluntary work in a school - that was sadly cut short due to my illness. He ensured that I arrived safely at Lukla airport and met my porter and Ganesh for the trek. A fantastic home cooked meal was a lovely surprise after the trek and he checked on my welfare and activities regularly during my stay in Thamel. His efforts to provide my transport when needed were truly resourceful during the fuel blockage. A very dedicated and humble manager of a seemingly newer business within the tourism industry in Thamel, he has laid solid foundations to continue to build well into the future. I would highly recommend Ganesh as a guide who is extremely experienced in multiple regions of Nepal, down to earth, fastidious and with a sense of humor. He certainly made my trek a magical experience!!"

Our first family trekking experience in Nepal was amazing and this is all thanks to Trekking Planer. During the trip planning stage, Dipak was great in giving us detailed discussions, professional and flexible in planning. He came to meet us at KTM airport at midnight, carefully checked out the things. Since we insisted in a night drive to Pokhara, he gave us a spacious van so that all of us could have a comfortable ride. He also called our guide every day to update the situations and give advises on the actual matters. We were a bit unlucky with the weather as a happened heavy snowing in Muktinath blocked to road from Jomsom and Kagbeni to there. Luckily, we were aware of that in early communications and could make a great change in the plan by replacing Kagbeni-Muktinath by the high route trek Kagbeni-Piling-Phalyak-Dhakarjhong-Lubra-Jomsom. Our guide Narayan is a brilliant guy. He is positive and optimistic but also professional and realistic in making plans for the trek. He not only helped us in organizing the trek in details, from hiring horse for our small kids and porters when necessary to finding the guest houses in remote areas when plan changed, but also took care of my kids. He became my son's best friend during the trip and my kids till now keep remembering him every day.Back to the trek, we have two resting days in Pokhara before flying off to Jomsom. Highly recommend Begnas lake and Pokhara valley biew points such as Kalistasthan, Thularkot, Siddhipur. We took on the first trekking day the alternative route Jomsom to Marpha through Thini, Dumba lake and it was very beautiful. The hotel Sunrise in Marpha was great with 24h hot shower. Next day we discovered Marpha before taking bus and jeep to Kagbeni. Afternoon, we walked around Kagbeni old town. Marpha was really a jewel of the area and we wish to have more time there. On the third day, we took a day trip to Tiri village lying in the way to Upper Mustang. That was one of highlight days during our trip. Due to the heavy snowing conditions in Muktinath, we could not make it there as well as Jharkot and Jhong as planned. But the alternative route Kagbeni-Pilling-Phalyak-Dhakarjhong-Lubra-Jomsom was superb; the remote villages are very originated with Bon and some Dolpa features; the scene in the high route was the most beautiful among our whole trip. Lastly, we have two beautiful relaxing days in Kathmandu with visits to Patan and Bhartapur as well as Boudhanath temple.To summarize, Trekking Planner was great. Diplak and Narayan were highly professional, flexible and also reasonable and affordable. We highly recommend their services, particularly for the family with young children."

We went and spoken with a bunch of random places in thamel and ultimately decided to go with Trekking Planner because Dipak seemed like the most genuine and honest of all the people we spoke with. He was super helpful answering our questions and addressing our concerns. We booked a guide and 2 porters with him and did an all-inclusive package, One of my biggest concerns was flying into Lukla because I am not a great flyer and Lukla has had some incidents with flights in the past. I mentioned this concern to all the agencies and most said a helicopter would be too expensive or impossible to get. Dipak got it done though and got us on an amazing helicopter ride to Lukla. As mentioned, we did the all-inclusive package and were glad we did. We always had enough food (choice of anything on the menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner, including soup with dinner) and the lodges were all great. There was one we didn't like that much, and our guide helped us find another one that was satisfactory with no issues at all. Dipak was in touch on our trip and always made sure we were happy with everything. Our guide was a great host and was attentive to our needs and health, although at times his limited English was challenging. We were extremely happy with everything about Trekking Planner. We didn't think we would even make it to the top of EBC, having never hiked more than half a day anywhere, but we took it slow and our guide and porters got us there. They never pushed us and didn't complain even when we took hours longer than planned. So glad we went with Dipak and Trekking Planner. Thanks for an unforgettable experience!!"

We researched many companies to book our EBC trek and after exchanged e-mails with Dipak he helped plan our EBC trek, tour in Kathmandu and Jungle Safari in Chitwan in a professional, helpful and organised manor. On arrival in Kathmandu we were greeted at the airport with a friendly, warm welcome from Dipak and he helped settle us in at our hotel and took us out for a traditional Nepalese meal as well as organising a day tour with guide of Kathmandu. Dipak's organisation of our EBC trek was wonderful and the guide he supplied on the trek was informative, friendly and very organised in looking after us, making sure we had enough food, tea and a decent bed for the night after a long day walking. The trek was beautiful and we had an amazing experience. We went back to Kathmandu after the trek was finished and Dipak greeted us and hear about our adventure and keep us informed about our next part of the trip - Jungle Safari in Chitwan. We stayed in Chitwan National Park for 4 nights 3 days and stayed at a lovely lodge by the river just outside the town. We went on Elephant safari, Jungle walks, bird watching, canoeing, traditional evening performance and much needed relaxing after our EBC trek. We had lovely accommodation and by the river and very helpful staff who looked after our every need.It was our first visit to Nepal and Dipak made our trip hassle free, organised and all with a warm welcome which meant we could enjoy our trek to the fullest. I would recommend Dipak and Trekking Planner services and I myself would love to return to complete some Annapurna trekking in the future and will be using Trekking Planner Nepal to do so. Many thanks for such a brilliant holiday of a lifetime! Lauren Connors"

He picked me up as promised at the Katmandu airport and brought me to the hotel. The next day he guided us through the city to obtain the permits required to trek to Everest Base camp and tickets to fly to Lukla. Everything went flawlessly. I felt at ease in Nepal because Dipak was always there to answer any question. He was there to guide you out to eat or find a place shop. After the trek we had a few days and he arranged several exciting tours around Katmandu. I will use him again on my next trip to Nepal."

We were impressed by Dipak\u2019s careful listening to what we wanted and by his ability to adapt the plan to our responses \u2013 no pre-set packages from Trekking Planner!But when we met up we realised that there is far more to Trekking Planner than just planning \u2013 this includes:\u2022 Judging our speed and stamina well\u2022 Excellent choice of places to stay, they know the people personally\u2022 Great knowledge of the terrain and what is in it\u2022 Ability to respond to circumstance, like when the route up to Annapurna Sanctuary was blocked by snow,and the best surprise of all:\u2022 They are great company and great fun.Note - We've entered that we went in Feb 2013 'cos Trip Advisor's tick list only accepts 2013 dates - we went in Feb 2011 when they were just setting up this great service, so we know it from the start and are still in touch.Chris & Norma"

We only knew that we wanted to do some kind of a trek.Through our hotel we got in contact with Prakash at Adventure Himalaya Circuit.Based on our time limit and thoughts, he quickly could determine which treks would be most suitable and we made the decision to do a 14-day trek on the Annapurna Circuit.With everything already booked and planned for us and all of the permits taken care of, we set off the next day. The trek was everything we could hope for, such an amazing experience! Absolutely breathtaking views and beautiful sceneries. Accompanied by our great guide Bigyan, a very nice and knowledgeable man, the trek became even better.If you are going to Nepal and you are looking for a great experience, I would highly recommend the people at Adventure Himalaya Circuit!"

The guide did his best to accommodate our requests, eg, we got two nights with attached shower over the four nights. We took some great photos during the trekking. On our return from Pokhara to Kathmandu, there was petrol shortage in Nepal, and the guide did his best to secure a private van for us. A van of 16 seater carrying only 4 people in total, which was a bit of extraordinary. My only suggestion for improvement is the English skills of the guide, which might make the trip even better.

We payed 35$ for three persons for transportation, but it turned out that the price for the busses was only a maximum of 10 dollars total.

I had a week to look around and talk to other tour guides, and all failed to come close to the level of service and truth that adventure Himalayan circuit gave me.Purushottam and Prakash were the most friendliest and knowledgeable operators, it seem like every one else was just trying to get my business, and didn't care about my experience. Puru and Prakash really worked with me about which trek would be best for me, as I am very peculiar about it. I ended up doing three treks with them! They also made sure I got the right guide (as I was traveling alone and had special request on food and culture). They had me meet the guides to see if we would work well together. I ended up going with a different guide on all three treks since all of them were great! They really treated me like family. They helped me even plan my trip to other parts of nepal and organize my traveling plans to India. Given advice about where to buy certain items, food, and even hotels (I know a lot of the time these business are partners with each other and send their clients to same places, and if that was so, at least these were to best places working together). I never had a complaint they always made sure that everything was good and up to my standard. They were also young and knew how to communicate with all types of travelers.I had amazing adventures and treks with this company, that's why I sent any of my friends and other travelers to them, because I wouldn't want them to get poor quality service from elsewhere, it really ruins the experience. I mean your in the Himalayas, why not get the best for this lifetime opportunity! As far as pricing, they were more than fair. They work with your budget and style of comfort and traveling. I also must say if your loyal (like doing 3 treks with them) you'll really reap some benefits! I will be using them again, and remain to tell any and all people I know to book there treks with them."

With the aid of Prakash and his team I was able to visit the main sights around Kathmandu city, to savour a Nepalese dinner and show, to experience a 'once in a lifetime' plane flight up around Mount Everest, and to drive up into the hills to Nagarkot to witness the last rays of sun glowing off the distant snow-peaked mountains - before heading back to the airport. I left Nepal with only a few coins and a T-shirt which says \"I did not climb Mt Everest ..... but I touched it with my heart\".

I went to Nepal couple of weeks ago, when I first got there i was lucky to meet a person named Saroj, he took me to his travel agent company, i think they gave me a pretty good deal so i took it, i only had 5 days but they gave me trekking package that fit my time staying, it included transportation to Pokhara, lodge for 3 nights and a very helpful guide. I was a bit disappointed about the lodge tho, but maybe i just had high expectations. All in all i had a wonderful time. You can discuss about your budget with them and they will sort it out for you. Thanks to Saroj & Bigyan for the help. Highly recommended."

So we contacted the travel agency of Mr. Puru Rimal before our arrival. When we arrived in Kathmandu we were picked up by Puru with a private car, even though it was early in the morning. He took us directly to our hotel. This was also booked by his travel agency according to our preferences. Directly after check-in we discussed all our possibilities for some smaller trips in Nepal and Kathmandu Valley. Puru gave us very detailed information on everything we asked. His advices proved also very helpful. He could also answer all of our rather unusual questions as e. g. where young Nepalese people hang out in Kathmandu and where to buy traditional tailored clothes. Most of all we appreciated the friendly approach to the customers. We got all the information we wanted without any pressure to book anything. The prices for the services we were offered were very fair, actually much better than we have found in the internet (we had rather small budget). We decided to book a stay in the National park Chitwan with the travel agency. We booked 2 days and 3 nights in a hotel with usual program (elephant safari, jungle walk, bird watching, canoeing etc.). Unfortunately, we had some health problems and couldn\u00b4t manage our arrival as planned. Although we contacted Puru just the day before our scheduled arrival, there was no problem whatsoever to change the arrival date. In Chitwan we stayed in a perfectly nice hotel. From the room we overlooked the river. We had also a straight view on the elephant bathing spot and the jungle. The rooms were clean, spacious and air conditioned. Everything was to our full contempt - for a student-friendly price. After Chitwan we also booked a small hiking trip to the view point Nagarkot, near Kathmandu. We decided just the day before to do the hiking. We got a guide to show us the way and help us with the chaotic bus transportation. The travel agency of Mr. Rimal offered us services on a high level. He proved very flexible, friendly and above all reliable. The travel agency is trustworthy and can offer a wide range of trips and helpful information. He was our contact person throughout the whole stay. We can absolutely recommend him to everyone (not just students)."

We booked a Buddha Air mountain flight through him and he was able to give us lower rates than was advertised on the airline's website, and we also used his driver's services for a day tour around Kathmandu and Thamel. Although the driver spoke little English and mostly kept to himself, he was nevertheless reliable and waited patiently for us while we explored the landmarks to our satisfaction. Puru also provided money exchange services, giving us much better rates than any of the other money changers in Thamel. We also had the chance to sit down with Puru for a chat and drinks, nothing business-driven, just as friends and indeed, we felt like we had made a friend in Nepal."

I understand you can trek for significantly cheaper without a guide and arranging things on your own, but traveling solo, this was well worth the money and the prices were fair. My guide, Surendra, was fantastic. Friendly and a genuine good guy, he was great company, knowledgeable about the trek and Nepal in general, professional, and happy to flex plans to accommodate me joining others I met along the trail (which I've heard can be a problem sometimes). An absolute positive experience, and I am leaving Nepal with a new friend (he came out to join me for dinner and to say goodbye on my last evening in Katmandu - almost a week after the trek ended). Would recommend this company and enthusiastically recommend Surendra in particular.

He gave us his card and gave us the option to come and talk to him and his staff about arranging any travel arrangements that we wanted to make. He was not persistent and said if we didn't like it we could walk away.We decided that we had nothing to lose and went to see what they could offer us. After talking to Puru for an hour we had happily made all our travel arrangements for the next three weeks and it was totally painless and so easy. Nothing was too much trouble and even when we were halfway through our adventure we decided to change the plans a little, this again was not a problem. Just a couple of phone calls and it was done. All the hotels that were recommended to us were fantastic, clean and had very helpful staff. Our trip including full sightseeing in Kathmandu and the valley area including all the Durbar squares, a Bungy Jump, Pokhara, a Hill trek in the Annapurna region, a few more days in Pokhara, river rafting and a few days in Chitwan park with safaris,& all our bus journeys.We made great friends with the Guide (Saroj) and Porter (Shambhu) who could not make us feel anymore welcome on our travels. The other guides were knowledgeable about their countrys history and areas we were visiting. The driver that we had was fantastic making us feel very safe in a country where the roads can be pretty intimidating!Saroj even came to see us off when we left for England which really cheered us all up as we were sad to be leaving. I cannot recommend Adventure Himalaya Circuit enough and Puru's hard work and total reliability made our trip to Nepal a total success. We were totally in their hands and they really did us proud.Thank you to all.Gavin Lacey"

Upon arrival at the airport, I was met by Mr. Basu of Adventure Himalaya Circuit Treks & Tours. He was such a friendly and helpful guy who has arranged all my travel itinerary while Nepal. His assistant, Prakash was a very informative tour guide who explained to me all the history of Nepal and each individual tourist attraction like Boudanath, Pasupatinath, Swayambhunath , Patan Durbar Square and many more. Though the country is poor but it is so rich with cultures and heritage buildings and most sites are certified by Unesco Heritage Sites. Basu also arranged for my trip up to Pokhara where there were also many things to do there. Visited the Peace Temple up on the mountain top, paragliding, strolling along Fewa Lake or a boat ride, watching sunrise at 5.30am up on the mountain and many other interesting attractions.Overall, I had a memorable and marvelous trip in Nepal. I will definitely visit this country again. Next time will be trekking up the famous snowy mountains. I highly recommend Adventure Himalaya Circuit Treks & Tours for organizing any travel service. Thank you very much Basu and Prakash."

But best of all was my guide Ramjee who was so considerate with all of my needs, including my slower pace.(I'm 66) He made sure everything was looked after, and got me back in one piece without any dramas. The Annapurna Base Camp trek is one of the best treks to see 8 mountain peaks from one location without any special equipment or experience. I was so moved to get to the base camp at dawn and be overwhelmed by the majesty of those peaks ranged 360 degrees around me.I'm more than happy to recommend Ramjee and Earthbound Expeditions."

I was a solo traveller who tagged onto a group of 11 other trekkers. The Thamel Eco Resort was fabulous. A cute little boutique hotel only a street back from the main road yet so peaceful and quiet. Very clean and well presented. All the staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough to help with my stay.I used Earthbound Expeditions from a recommendation from a friend and I wasn't disappointed! Right from the get go everyone was so welcoming and I felt I was looked after really well. Especial being a single girl on my first visit to Nepal. Rajan, Arjun and Bibek (our tour leader and guides, respectively) were amazing! So patient with all of us, as at one point or another we all had aches, pains, sickness and suffered from the effects of the altitude, and not once did any of them make me feel like a was slowing the group down. They really looked after us all and cared about my well being, offering me certain foods to help with nausea and Diamox to help with the altitude, which they supplied. All done with a constant smile on their faces! Such a lovely team.As for the trek it's self.... Incredible! Beautiful scenery, stunning views and those peaks! Wow! I couldn't have asked for a more magical trip, caring staff and friendly group. Despite it being overcast and drizzly for most of the trip (just the time of year) we were treated to glimpses of Everest and were surrounded by towering peaks. The most beautiful scenery I have ever seen. Accommodation is clean and dry, very warm in the main lounge and simple, 2 single bed rooms with shared washing facilities. The accommodation gets a little more basic the higher you climb but that's to be expected. Especially when you see that everything is walked up from Lukla! Toilet rolls and bottles of water included! Simply amazing, herculean effort by all the Sherpa people! A truly wonderful trek! Thank you Earthbound Expeditions for an amazing adventure, new friends and memories to last a lifetime! Jessica"

I have never traveled to a country that has made me feel so welcome right from the get-go, and despite all the damage that has been done, the natural beauty of the country and the smiles of the Nepali people shine through.

However, Rajan's professional service reassured me throughout the entire process. This was my second trip to Kathmandu and it was completely safe after the earthquake. Our trip to Tibet was wonderful. We flew both ways to and from Lhasa since the overland route between Tibet and Nepal were still not open after the earthquake. On our return to Kathamandu, Rajan escorted us to a fabulous meal with traditional Nepali music and dance on our last night there. I highly recommend Earthbound Expeditions and also encourage others to consider traveling in Nepal post earthquake to help them recover economically. Many merchants were very grateful for our presence there."

We travelled to Nepal in October 2015 with some trepidation as we did not know what to expect post earthquake (plus there was a fuel blockade from India)We are so glad that we made the decision to go ahead.First of all Kathmandu is out of this world and we were glad we factored in an extra day to savour all of the sights, sounds and sometimes smells!The trek itself was everything and more that we could have imagined.We travelled with two friends and we're joined by two more this made the trip even more interesting as we had lots of stories to tell over the odd beer or two.The scenery is fantastic and the organisation from EE excellent.Our guide was very good (Gopal) and we felt in very safe hands.The tourist numbers were down which is a shame as Nepal relies on tourists but hopefully with time this will chnge.If you are thinking of travelling in Nepal DO IT and do it with Earthbound Expeditions you won't regret it!"

The organisation of the trip was superb from the time we first made our enquiry until the moment we left Kathmandu to fly home. Rajan answered our emails quickly and his responses to our questions before our trip were great and put our minds to rest about problems we thought we might encounter. When we arrived in Kathmandu our driver was waiting with our name clearly shown which was a great relief as Kathmandu airport is a bit overwhelming after a long flight. We were quickly taken to our hotel (Thamel Eco resort) where we were given a warm welcome and quickly taken to our rooms. The flight from Katmandu to Lukla was delayed because of poor visability and eventually cancelled until the next day. Our guide Namar, arranged for our transport back to the hotel and we were given our original rooms back for the night. Next day the flight was again delayed but Namar managed to get some of us on a plane and the rest onto a helicopter to make sure we could start our trek without any further delay. He really deserved his tip just for these efforts alone as after we arrived in Lukla all flights were again cancelled.The rest of the EBC trek was superb as were the porters that we had waiting for our arrival in Lukla. Everyone was very friendly in the tea houses that we stayed in and the food was great considering where we were. Eventually after 8 hard days we made it to EBC, all made possible by the crew that looked after us day and night. Don\u2019t underestimate the effects from the altitude and follow what the guide tells you to do, and drink lots of water.On arrival back in Katmandu we met Rajan again and were taken to a cultural evening. Our guide also joined us on a night which will be remembered for a long time, superb food, drink and entertainment. We were a group of 7 and everyone had the same opinion. If going to Nepal again we would not hesitate to book with Earthbound Expeditions. Contact Rajan for help advice and you will not be disappointed."

The trip was 18 days, with two nights in Kathmandu before and after the trek. This gave us time to take a tour of Kathmandu and to get over our jet lag before starting the trek. We arranged the trip via email with Rajan Simkhada. He was always timely in responding and answering all questions. The trip was great, and we loved our guide Maule Tamang. He was very experienced (he has been to base camp over 100 times and has even summited Everest). He flew with us out of Kathmandu, and back at the end of the trek. He looked after all our needs. The two porters we had did an excellent job, and our belongings were always waiting for us when we arrived at the teahouses. The teahouses were very basic, and we were grateful that we had sleeping bags. The extra time on the trek allowed us to acclimatize to the elevation. We had minimal symptoms of altitude sickness. While trekking we were never rushed by Maule. The extra time after the trek allowed us to not worry about potential flight delays out of Lukla (it wasn't). It also gave us time to relax in Kathmandu (we got a massage) and take a half day tour to Bhaktapur. We highly recommend Earthbound Expeditions, and you will be lucky if you get Maule Tamang as your guide."

However since the earthquake in 2015 the number tourists has dropped dramatically. The tourism business being the main business of the country is greatly affected. So just by hiring a guide and a porter you have already help to boost the industry. My favorite view was from Tolka. Couldn\u2019t be more lucky in terms of rain and hail stone. We managed to arrive at our destination just as the sky poured down. Nepal is a must visit country if you are a lover of mountains, nature and cultural experience.

I chose the Annapurna Circuit trek for the lack of time and did the trek in a total of 11 days, with the firstand last day dedicated for rest and sightseeing. Rajan the owner, was a lovely help. He responded to our emails and enquires with patience and was genuinely interested in assisting us instead of simply sending us a template response which many of the other companies we contacted did. The itinerary provided was comprehensive and easy to understand and covered our meals and when necessary, sleeping bags and down jackets, which will cost you a substantial amount should you choose to purchase. Being the first time I had ever trekked, taking this expedition on served to be a daunting task ahead for me as I did not know what to expect.Should you choose to do the Annapurna circuit, be prepared to climb a lot of steps! DO NOT skimp on purchasing the right shoes, and if you are trekking during the cold season - gloves and socks. These will serve you very well. Also, ensure that you have clothes that you can layer so that you need not carry too many bulky items. As we were trekking near the end of winter (February), which is the off peak season, we experienced a whole host of temperatures from 29 degrees celcsius all the way to -15 degrees celsius at Annapurna Base Camp.I had requested for Maule, upon reading the excellent reviews by our fellow reviewers below. Maule truly impressed. He has plenty of experience under his belt which greatly assured us, given that the trek does come with it's danger and risks with the unpredictable weather and relatively challenging terrain. I had bought gloves that were not effective in staving off the cold during our trek to ABC and the lovely Maule had actually switched gloves with me in order to prevent me from getting frostbite. Our porter Ong Chun was also a lovely help and boy it is a miracle how they can shoulder such weight and leap from one shaky rock to the other! He was a lovely humble and sincere man as well, just like Maule. I will definitely be requesting for them should I consider pursuing the Everest Base Camp in future. Nepal is a truly a beautiful country. It is a pity that this city of wonderful friendly people has had the series of misfortunes befall them, with the earthquake and political situation. When I arrived and went sightseeing on the first day, it was clear the lack of infrastructure and the recent earthquake had greatly shaken up the country, the economy and the tourism industry. If you are considering travelling to Nepal and trekking, you should go ahead and do it. The view, people and the experience is truly one you will remember for the rest of your life. Just ensure you do plenty of research, pack well, and go in with an open, flexible and accepting mindset as plans may change due to unforseen circumstances. Discuss the best possible alternative with your guide should you require any changes and DO NOT give the children chocolate as it encourages a bad cycle of entitlement and destroys their self-esteem in the long run.Do not drink water from the tap, ice drinks or eat salads and fresh fruits. Only eat freshly prepared food to prevent the very prevalent stomach bugs from reaching you and you should be fine and experience the trip of a lifetime!Cheers and wishing all future trekkers the best of luck!"

An exchange of e-mails started in September 2015 with Rajan. He provided detailed information, a list of items to take and also answered my questions promptly.

This was very enjoyable. In the evening, I met my Shyam - my guide for the journey. The day after we flew to Lukla, met my ported Prem and stiff for trekking.It was sunshine with clear skies most of the days.

            "review": "We would use this Tour Group again without hesitation!. This is going to be long - in order to cover some facts as well as give an adequate description of the nature and spirit of the group. I hope it\u2019s helpful.First, let me clarify some things that might be confusing: When we booked our tour it was through Bohemian Tours located in West Bengal, India, and we originally got our information about them via an excellent website of the same name. For airport pickup, however, we were told to look for a sign that said either Bohemian Tours or Earthbound Expeditions. From that point on Earthbound Expeditions was the name used. Also, the listing says Day Tours, which could be misleading. Earthbound Expeditions offers tours of various lengths, from 1 day to 16 or more. I want to add that generally we\u2019re not \"tour\" people (or we didn\u2019t think we were.) We love exploring on our own and an organized tour like this wouldn\u2019t usually be something we\u2019d choose. What happened is that I came across it in a Groupon promotion with a price that was tempting, so I investigated further. Their website was so impressive that I convinced my husband and son to give it a try. Ours was the 8-day Taste of Nepal tour. Our initial communications with Tara, the International Director, were always prompt and clear. The website is extremely well done, providing useful information about flight booking, possible side excursions, vaccinations, money exchange, voltage/electrical requirements, travel insurance, visas, what to bring....and specifics regarding the food, water, weather, accommodations, etc. (with useful links where appropriate.) I highly recommend reading it thoroughly. This same level of care and attention to detail was present in all our dealings with them. Shortly before we were to leave the U.S., Tara sent a letter with additional instructions and offered to answer any last minute questions we had. He provided information about airport pickup and gave us names & numbers for contacts in Nepal in the event we ran into difficulties. One of those individuals, Rajan, was at our hotel to meet us and remained in touch during the tour, though he turned us over to Kumar, who was our guide throughout. It turned out that our group (with the exception of one day, when we were joined by 2 women from Australia) consisted only of my husband, son, 4 year-old granddaughter & me. It was clear to us that this would not be a lucrative venture for the company, yet no corners were cut. Kumar covered everything on the Itinerary and more. He also was attentive to our particular interests. On the way to Chitwan National Park, as we drove along the river, we saw suspension bridges leading to the bank on the other side. These looked intriguing and when we commented, Kumar asked if we\u2019d like to cross one. When we got to a good stopping place he had the driver drop us off so we all could cross, take photos and explore a bit. Obviously this was an advantage of being a small group. In a larger group it might not have been possible, though I\u2019d venture to say that in any size group Kumar would do his best to be accommodating. He\u2019s extremely knowledgeable and provided an abundance of information about the history and culture at each site we visited. Many times this was more than we could absorb at once and he was infinitely patient with our questions \u2013 even when he had to repeat things he'd already told us. He was always helpful and professional, yet over the days we spent with him we also came to view him as our friend. He went above and beyond anything we ever could have expected - even helping to carry our tired little one at times when the rest of us were worn out. In addition to Kumar, Deepak, the driver, was with us throughout the trip. Although he didn\u2019t speak much English, he communicated with a ready smile. He was always prompt, pleasant and helpful, handling precarious traffic and roads with skill and apparent ease. From our arrival in Kathmandu until we left, our days were filled with an amazing array of activities. It was a perfect mix of scheduled and \"free\" or individual time to explore (or rest!) as we chose. Seeing the ancient temples, stupas and shrines was fascinating. The beauty and history \u2013 there was so much to take in. The streets of Kathmandu were bustling, with rich colors and eye-catching architectural elements everywhere, even on the simplest structures. We loved seeing the medieval city of Bhaktapur, a World Heritage Site. There\u2019s still much to marvel at, despite the fact that particular area suffered a tremendous amount of damage in the April 2015 earthquake. Chitwan Park was almost tropical in spots \u2013 serene and beautiful. Among many other things, we were thrilled to see a mother white rhinoceros nestled under a shrub with her calf. We booked our trip prior to the earthquake. Apparently quite a few people were put off by the quake & rumors of widespread damage and cancelled previously made plans to visit. We did give it consideration, primarily because of safety concerns but after some research we determined it was safe to proceed. Moreover, we understood that one of the things crucial to the country's recovery is the return of tourist dollars. As far as earthquake-related damage, we definitely saw some, as well as many repairs and restoration - both completed and underway. During our time there, however, we were much more aware of the economic and social impact of the new constitution Nepal ratified in September. A significant effect of this - and there are various takes on exactly why - is that the borders between Nepal and its neighbor, India, have been blocked. Nepal is dependent on India for the majority of its trade and this has caused a restriction on the transport of goods including petroleum, cooking fuel, medicines, and many other supplies and daily necessities. Almost every aspect of life in the country has been affected - many restaurants were forced to shut down or convert to restricted menus because of food & fuel shortages. Petro lines snake through the streets, with people waiting 2 to 3 days to put gas in their cars and work vehicles. These factors didn\u2019t have a huge impact on our trip, though there was the difficulty of riding in a comfortable, spacious van, looking out at others stuffed into busses and even riding on bus roofs in order to make best use of precious petroleum. The restricted menus were a bit of a disappointment but paled with the recognition of how difficult it was for the restaurant owners simply to remain open. As foodies, we\u2019d looked forward to some exotic meals and especially the Indian spices. The meals that were included with the tour were always ample, good and hearty. They were not highly spiced and we learned that\u2019s probably typical of Nepalese food. Our free-time meal experiences were somewhat hit-and-miss. Because of the shortages, places that had previously received high recommendations might not be open or \u2013 if open \u2013 might only be offering salads (and not always too exciting.) We did come across one sure bet for both food and atmosphere and that was the New Orleans Caf\u00e9 in Thamel, Kathmandu. Unlike it sounds, this restaurant has a large menu and offers an amazing variety of food - everything from hummus to Tandoori chicken to Thai curries - and everything we tried was good. In addition, it had a charming ambience. Once we discovered It, we ate there 2 or 3 times. Another excellent place we didn\u2019t find until one of our last days in the city was the Roadhouse Caf\u00e9, also in Kathmandu. They had wood-fired pizza, so were unaffected by the lack of fuel and the pizza was outstanding! Amendments to the constitution apparently are being considered even as I'm writing this and it's hoped that the situation will be resolved in the near future. For us, we were glad we didn't cancel. Both Kumar and the tour group as a whole let us know they were glad too. They did everything possible to make our trip memorable. They showed great willingness to be flexible, helping us negotiate an unexpected schedule glitch (on our part) and also arranging airport transportation for us at the end of some additional personal days we spent in the country. In summary, Earthbound Expeditions/Bohemian Tours is a first rate organization. We thank them for their kindness and proficiency and for helping to make our visit to Nepal such a great success. We\u2019re considering a trip to India at some point in the future and will most definitely seek them out again."

The river rafting was totally fun! The tent camp and grounds were just beautiful! The 5 day trek with the highlight being trekking up in the dark of early morning to watch the sunrise and see the peaks of the Himalayas come out of the morning fog was something I will always remember! I am 67 and was concerned about ding the trek, but just prepare and you will do well. I loved every moment...the people, the food and the warm hospitality! Earthbound offers a service you can trust! I stayed with Rajan and his family for a homestay before and after the tour. I would highly recommend this as well as the wonderful cooking class given by his wife. She is an excellent cook and the food was so delicious! A real treat to stay with a family, play with the kids and learn more about day to day nepali life."

We booked our trek from Pokhara to the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) with Earthbound Expeditions (run by Rajan), and would highly, highly recommend you do the same. This was one of the best things we did in Nepal and we had an absolutely terrific time. Email Rajan before you go to Nepal to start setting things up, rather than getting approached on the streets of Kathmandu by someone who wants to sell you their (probably less amazing) tour. Rajan laid out all the pieces of the trip by email and was very responsive to any changes or questions we had. Once we arrived in Kathmandu he met us in person at our hotel (booked for you by Earthbound) before our trek began. He arranged for a private guided tour of Kathmandu, which was a good way to see the big sites across the city and to adjust to the time difference before setting off. The one small hiccup was that after getting transferred to the Kathmandu airport for our flight to Pokhara (again, arranged by Earthbound), the airline didn\u2019t have a proper record of our flight. It\u2019s unclear whose mistake this was, but all it meant was that we missed our 8:30am flight and we called Rajan who sorted it all out for us by phone with the airline, and we just took the next flight at 9:30 \u2013 no big deal.The trek itself is an unbelievable and rewarding experience, especially if you can make it up to ABC. Certain sections are definitely strenuous (e.g. getting to Ghandruk/Chommrong via thousands of stairs), but there are also flat sections and we took plenty of breaks. The guide we were provided by Earthbound (Maule) met us at the airport in Pokhara and if you go with Earthbound, definitely request him. He\u2019s an incredibly experienced mountaineer, having grown up near Everest and having summited many of the major peaks in the Himalayas. He\u2019s funny, speaks very good English, and we felt totally safe and comfortable with him. Through observation in the early stages of our trek he learned our pace, adjusted his pace as necessary, and recognized when we needed a break for water or a tea. He pointed out all kinds of things you\u2019d never know/notice on your own, and really made the entire thing run incredibly smoothly. You can do the trek to ABC on your own, there\u2019s really only 1 route and you can ask any of the other trekkers along the way, but having a guide is great, and if you are debating who to use, use Earthbound (and ask for Maule)!"

I'm not one for writing reviews good or bad, but after having such a fabulous trip to Nepal last October I felt the need to leave some positive feed back about this beautiful country. Through a recommendation I booked my holiday with Earthbound Expeditions about five weeks prior to my trip and they were fantastic. They accommodated me as a solo traveler despite not having any treks scheduled for the period of time I was traveling in Nepal. Nothing was too much trouble for them, from the hotel staff in Katmandu & Pokhara to the President of earthbound , Rajan who made every effort to make sure my trip was tailored for what I wanted to do. I ended up doing the Poon hill trek, which was fabulous and relatively easy, along with some white water rafting. My guide, Ray was very knowledgable and enthusiastic, which made the trip even more enjoyable, if that's possible!Nepal is a fantastic, extremely friendly and very safe country to visit despite all It's problems after the earthquake and the ongoing fuel shortage. I would encourage anyone who likes a little bit of adventure to visit Nepal, it was everything I expected and more, and you won't go far wrong if you let Earthbound Expeditions organise your trip for you.

To walk out of the tent at night and stand beneath the amazingly clear skies, the Milky Way above my head with Everest at the end of the valley is one memory I will never forget. Tibet is an amazing country, full of interesting and surprising people and sights.

The food was amazing and the teahouses along the trek were great. The scenery along the ABC trek is second to none- pictures don't do it justice, so you'll have to see it for yourself. The tours and excursions in Kathmandu were also quite impressive. Throughout our planning for this trip, Rajan (EE's president) was unbelievably responsive and helpful. When we met Rajan in Kathmandu, we were impressed by his commitment to his company and his beautiful country. The mantra we kept hearing about Nepal tourism is \"Once is not enough.\" I totally agree. I'm certain we will be back, and we will definitely go through Earthbound Expeditions again.

Nothing like knowing how far you've trekked that day and that you've finally arrived in your destination for the day. Nothing like seeing rolling hills 2000metres below, or the sunset over the mighty peaks across the way. Our guide was amazing, Thakur Sapkota. He took care if us like a brother or father, and I never doubted him. Of all the groups (there were three in our 'trip') I was glad he was our guide. Nepal felt safe, fun, wonderful people, cheap and good value, most beautiful scenery. I was definitely shocked at the poverty when arriving, but quickly realised it was safe and you get accustomed to it. I'm so shocked and horrified by the recent earthquakes - life is just not fair for this poor gem of a country. Nepal was rising as a traveller destination - continue one and all I say. I would love to go back and plan to - I never got to chitwan national park! I wish to see her (Nepal) rise up again."

Rajan, the director of Earthbound Expeditions, fully organized everything like guides, porters, transport, accommodation, etc.We spend the first couple of days in and around Kathmandu. We had a guided tour around all the landmarks of Kathmandu and we went to Nagarkot and Bakthapur. We eventually flied to Pokhara.

The hikes were not particularly hard however, there were enough brakes at teahouses or viewpoints so that our youngest one (11 years old) could also keep up. Even when it got more difficult due to snow and ice, the enthusiastic guide Ramchandra Sapkota and the very friendly porters Padam, Kedar and \u2026 were very helpful and made sure nothing would happen to us. Ramchandra could tell us a lot about Nepal\u2019s history, culture and nature. We spend the nights in lodges which provided us with all out basic needs like a warm welcome, a fireplace, good food, clean rooms, often even WIFI access and sometimes a hot shower. After the trek we traveled by bus to Chitwan National Park. Again the accommodation was perfectly organized. We spend 3 days with a guide in the jungle, either on foot, on an elephant, with a jeep or in a canoe. After this we flied back to Kathmandu to fly home from there."

Every trip I have done has been outstanding with Earthbound, and have the highest praise for this company. Rajan, the owner who I have dealt with for all the trips has been fantastic and has taken care of all the details of all the trips. Rajan is so experienced in the industry, and on top of that he was so friendly and helpful in all of my dealings.

It was our first visit to Nepal, and EE were fantastic.I was a little nervous booking online, especially as sending a deposit in dollars was a MASSIVE faff, but as soon as we met Rajan at the hotel our worries were put to bed. Rajan was very professional, and the hotel (Eco Resort) was clean and well-staffed. Whilst in Kathmandu we had a day tour to various temples and sights, which was a great way to get a feel for the (hideously dirty but very interesting) city and find our way around.We chose to do the Gokyo Lakes, Cho La Pass and Everest Base Camp trek, which was very reasonably priced. Our tour guide, Ram, was very friendly and informative, and did everything within his power to get us on a plane to Lukla when the first day's flights were cancelled due to bad weather. Throughout the trek Ram was fantastic - he organised things to suit us, including pausing the trek for 24 hours when I got the mother of all colds, carrying packs when I twisted my ankle, and offering advice, medicine and good company. We were delighted to make it to the lakes, the pass and EBC, and Ram and our porter Nima were fantastic the whole way. The trek itself was breathtaking, so many beautiful views, and although a real physical challenge, was definitely doable for anyone with a decent base fitness level. Still can't get over quite how cold it was at night when we were at altitude, but many of the tea houses provided extra blankets if you asked.An element which really highlights the fantastic customer service was when we returned to Kathmandu. Back in the hotel, I sadly suffered from a bout of food poisoning, and Rajan helped my husband to get the right antibiotics, and re-booked a party due to arrive in our room that day so that I would not also have to move rooms whilst suffering. (I'm making this sound like so many things went wrong... seriously, it was an amazing experience, and EE fixed every minor issue.)I've recommended EE, Rajan, Ram and Nima to anyone who has mentioned trekking in Nepal, and will continue to do so as their service was so fantastic."

There were some struggles along the way (all weather related), but in the end, this company was really very good. The owner was really easy to work with and everything was organized very well. But what really made the trip for me, and the rest of the group, was our guide, Namaraj Sapkota. He went above and beyond any expectation I could have had. Hew as extremely caring, has strong moral character, and never gave up on us. He had a strong bond with all of the porters and is an excellent leader. I cant say enough about Nama (we called him that for short). I made a good friend over the two weeks we spent with him. If you do end up booking through Earthbound, ask for Nama to be assigned to your group. I guarantee you will have the best trip with him. He taught me to say \"Ma ph\u0113ri n\u0113p\u0101la \u0101'una.\" Which means \"I come to Napal again\" and I hope that I do."

Mahendra had guided me to Kanchenjunga in the past and was a wonderful guide so I fully trusted him to book through the company again.Absolutely everything was arranged for us, including a free pick up from the airport to our hotel.There was no hard sell for extra activities even tho they can arrange pretty much anything you require. As I had been to Nepal several times before, we were happy to do our own sightseeing, although we also used Mahendra as a mountain bike guide around the Kathmandu valley for something different. It was fantastic, safe, and he is so knowledgeable.Our trek to Manaslu was arranged and planned with perfection, and we had a wonderful 2.5 weeks trekking with Mahendra, and Prakash our porter. Both were attentive, helpful, friendly, fun, knowledgeable and went beyond the call of duty to make our trek a very memorable experience.Due to bad weather we couldnt make it over the Larkya La pass, which was disappointing but we fully trusted the advice of Mahendra, and pleased we took the safe option of turning around. In fact, it turned into a positive experience, as M knew a different way to trek out and so we returned via the amazing villages of Laprak, Barpak and the town of Gorkha. Hardly any trekkers around and a truly nepalese experience.We will always remember this special trip and the kindness of everyone at Earthbound.Thank you Rajan, Mahendra, Prakash, and all behind the scenes. You are doing a fantastic job and we fully recommend you to anybody coming your way! Leanne and Tom x"

We saw many people along the path doing it themselves, and while I am sure it is quite possible, it was nice to have someone to set the right pace, guiding the way and having everything planned ahead (nothing worse then getting to a village tired and having an argument with your partner about where is the best place to sleep and eat). It also felt safer in case something went wrong. We compared prices from several operators and EB was the cheapest. We thought a porter was a non-negotiable but in the end we had only a small bag that he carried and we just carried the water\u2026so you can maybe negotiate about a porter (though he bought such personality to the trip it was well worth the cost!). While this trek is listed as an easy one, I would caution people who don't like lots of stairs up and down! If you are going in Winter take some crampons with for the few snowy/icy patches. Accommodation is basic but pleasant. Food prices on the menus along the way were as high as Thamel, as stuff often needs to be brought in by donkey for the tourists. Our hotel back in Pokhara booked by EB (Pokhara Eco Resort) was fancier than any place we had stayed in so far!"

I enjoyed my trip to Nepal from stem to stern and the Himalayas are definitely worth the walk. The mountain sherpa culture so amazing and beautiful to experience. As a solo female traveler, I felt that joining a group trek with a guide would be the safest choice. When I was in Katmandu, I was fully prepared to purchase some Dimox (altitude sickness medication) in case I got sick which is a very common occurrence amongst trekkers to this region but my guide told me he had some and that I would not have to buy any.Four days into the hike, I became ill, with severe nausea and severe headache. I asked for the pills and the guide would not give them to me and said I wasn't \"sick enough\" for the pills. The next day the symptoms intensified and he still wouldn't give me any pills. Had he forgotten them and felt to embarrassed, I am sure he could have gotten some from another guide since they are cheap and plentiful in the area.....but he felt no sense of responsibility. On the third day of suffering from the altitude sickness I was unable to sleep because of shallow breathing and consequentially began to slow down considerably when hiking. The guide and sherpas proceeded to complain about my slowed walking speed right to my face which was totally rude seeing as how if they had have held up there end of the deal, I wouldn't have gotten sick in the first place. Point being - there is no point to going with this company. You pay all that extra money and there is no accountability. You may as well organize your own Sherpa which is very easy, get your own trekking permit - simple again, make a trip to the pharmacy and pick up some pills in case of emergency. Go it alone and spare yourself the aggravation."

We had a great guide in Lekh and a great porter in Naram. Both of them were extremely kind, and they were also very smart with logistics - to the point where we usually got to the best lodges, ate great food and did not waste any time looking for lodging and/or transportation during the peak season. We had to reroute our trip due to the big October snowstorm, and we were glad to have Lekh and Naram with us to descend safely and with minimal disruptions. During the storm aftermath, Rajan also took good care of us remotely by rerouting our itinerary (including some domestic flights) and letting our family know we were fine.Rajan also arranged for us a few days in Bhutan, where we were under care of a partner company that also treated us extremely well.All in all, these were probably the best vacations we ever had and we thank Rajan and his team at Earthbound Expeditions for a wonderful work.

Being invited to share in such a occasion was very special.We can not speak highly enough of our guide Lekh, who was excellent. He was highly knowledgable and did everything possible to ensure our trek was a wonderful experience. His customer service was first class. When problems did occur, such as one of our group experiencing altitude sickness, he found solutions to enable us to continue our trek. Similarly, when we unable to fly out of Jomson due to high winds stopping flights, Lekh arranged a jeep to take us to Pokhara so we could stay on schedule for the trip (I would not recommend the jeep, unless you have to meet an international flight as we did, as the road is so rough it can be hardly called a road and the 139km journey by road took 9 hours). Lekh's excellent guiding, calm problem solving and quiet reassurance was very much appreciated by all of us. The food was excellent and the tea houses and hotels were basic and cold at night as you would expect, but very welcoming. As we wanted a walk while we were at Jomson, Lekh even found a \u2018side trip\u2019 for us the afternoon, to a neighbouring village.The porters, Shiva and Balpu, worked equally hard on our behalf going to of their way to help us, and when they reached the hotel before us in the afternoon, came back and offered to help with our small packs.

The room for first night was near the noisy bar/eating area, but this was more than offset by the great suite we received on the last night after the trek.We were there for the Poon Hill trek and we were not disappointed. The company means it when it says that trail speed is not important \u2013 it\u2019s about going slowly enough to absorb the experience (that\u2019s why we saw the monkeys). Even so, we always reached the day\u2019s goal in sufficient time to unwind, shower and have dinner.If you can, ask for Maule to be your guide. He\u2019s extremely knowledgeable and will talk to you about any topic from things you see on the trail to life in Nepal. You\u2019ll make a friend by the end of the trip. He will set an appropriate pace and won\u2019t whip you along the trail like some other guides we heard about. On the trail, he organized all meals and overnight stays.

            "review": "Amazing tour in Nepal!. Earthbound Expeditions was an excellent choice for our trip to Nepal this past October. We had done a lot of research regarding which tour company to use and wanted to make sure it was Nepalese owned and operated to support the local community. After reading impressive reviews of this company, we booked online with them for our tour which was 12 days. We were very happy with our choice! Rajan, the president, answered our many questions over the period of weeks leading up to the trip. He met us at our hotel in Kathmandu the first day of our trip and also the last day to ensure we enjoyed our time there. Our tour consisted of the following:- arrival day- one day in Kathmandu to see the many temples the city has to offer- a travel day to Pokhara- a 4 day trek of the Annapurna Circuit, including Poon Hill- a day in Pokhara to see the sights- 2 1/2 day safari in Bardiya National Park- one last day in KathmanduThe trekking part of the trip was absolutely amazing! The trail is tough as there endless stairs to climb up from Nayapul to get to Poon Hill/Ghorepani area and then it is back down the endless stairs. All those stairs were worth the trip though. The guides and porters made sure we were well taken care of, both on the trail and once we got to the guesthouses.We chose Bardiya over Chitwan as we had read that the chances of seeing a tiger were much greater and there too many tourists in Chitwan. We were glad we chose Bardiya. The guides were incredible and the lodge that Earthbound Expeditions uses was great! The wildlife viewing was spectacular as we were lucky enough to see a wild tiger not once, but twice! We saw many birds, monkeys, and 3 rhinos. We didn't see any wild elephants in the area but they were definitely there as a guy on a domestic elephant was chased by one while we were out on our safari. Overall, Earthbound ensured we had an excellent trip and we wouldn't hesitate to use them again in the future. A few suggested improvements for the company include:- ensuring guides can speak very good English. Some guides were better than others as was expected but we ended up talking to another Earthbound guide for the majority of the trekking- ensuring the guides are well aware of the itinerary of the individual groups. Because we were going into Bardiya, not Chitwan, we had one less day in the Annapurna region which he did not realize until we brought it to his attention. It did cause a bit of a hiccup in our plans but we managed to work around it.Thanks Earthbound for a wonderful experience!"

However, our guides and porters made it possible. We were a very diverse group of 10 and by the end of the trek we were all friends. On the first day one of our porters Ramjee Bhatta stayed behind to bring up some luggage that had been lost in route to Kathmandu. He covered in a couple of hours what had taken us all day. With a smile on his face. The accommodations on trek, while spartan, were totally adequate and quite comfortable. The food was much better than I expected. I have done a fair amount of travel and this was one of my best experiences. It is difficult for me to put into words how life changing this trip was. Imagine 5 days without seeing a vehicle with wheels? All transport being on foot. And yet we had internet service at night. Meeting people from all over the world and still being in contact with them 7 months later. Not only did we experience incredible landscape beauty and physical challenges, we made friends. Ramjee was among those making this happen. Not only did he carry our bags he was more of an assistant guide, told us about his culture and was a great cheerleader. I would highly recommend making this trek."

The guides and porters did a first class job of making sure that we had the best possible experience and that we were able to make the most of our time in Nepal. Nothing was to much for them and they made us feel welcomed into every location in which we stayed. The accommodation on the trail is basic but this was more than made up for in the quality and variety of the food on offer even in the remotest of spots . Plenty of fresh food cooked to order. Our guide made sure that we were well acclimatised for the high level trekking and also made sure that we made the most of our time with visits to monasteries and other off the trail features such as the Green lake of Upper Pisang . A really good experience that I can thoroughly recommend."

Rajan at Earthbound Expeditions managed every aspect of my trip perfectly -- from the day tours to the hotels, jeep transports, internal flights, and an excellent local guide from the Tsum Valley. He was flexible when I wanted to make changes to my itinerary in the middle of the trip, and he met with me personally several times during the Kathmandu portion of my trip. I could not have asked for a better experience. I chose Earthbound Expeditions because a co-worker has used the company three times previously for her trips/treks in Nepal, Bhutan and India. The people I trekked with in Tsum have also used Earthbound twice before, and this was their third time. That says it all. Thank you, Rajan!"

We had only 6 days, and for a great price they flew the two of us from Kathmandu where we stayed in Lhasa for 3 days and drove overland back to Kathmandu. Our excellent guide took us to the key monasteries, palaces, and temples of Lhasa. His knowledge was encyclopedic. He drove us over 9 mountain passes to the Friendship Bridge, and we took a 9 hour detour to see Mount Everest base camp. It was the trip of a lifetime.

I had initially contacted several agencies to make enquiries and got the best most prompt and thorough response from Rajan at Earthbound so decided to go with them. Definitely a good decision - we were impressed with the organisation and professionalism he provided from start to finish. He offered an initial itinerary which we adapted to suit our needs and was a private trip for just our family. Whatever we wanted to do was no problem to arrange. The hotels were all a good standard and very well located. We did a four day trek from Pokhara which was a perfect introduction for the kids . Our guide Namaraj was great, informative and entertaining. He even ran back an hour to our lodge to retrieve the kids' Kindles that were left behind! Thanks also to our porters Harry and Bhadri who held our kids' hands over the difficult bits whilst carrying our stuff. Even when we chose a different rafting company than Earthbound use, Rajan and Namaraj still arranged private transfers for us at no extra charge. It very much felt like the personal touch made all the difference. The last night included a special Nepali dinner which Rajan personally escorted us to. I would not hesitate to recommend Earthbound Expeditions and will definitely use them again next time, as there will definitely be a next time!"

I followed the training recommendations and was rewarded with a fantastic trip. I won't repeat the other reviews which are so positive that one would expect they might be fake. Trust me this organisation babies you the whole way leaving you to enjoy the hike, the food, the scenery and the wonderful people. Here are some tips. Go in October which is sunny and warm.Take the rafting option. Use hand santizer often. Bring power bars. Bring aqua tabs and flavored electrolyte tablets. Bring flip flops and micro fibre towels. Use zip lock bagsto separate your items. Bring a emergency poncho as well as a thin water proof jacket. I would allow two days n Katmandu prior to the tour and take a day tour of the city but leave the day the tour ends. The tiger hunt part of this tour was especially interesting as we stayed in a nice resort in Chitwan park and actually herded a nasty rino on while riding the elephants. If you like adventure -- take this tour. We paid $900.00 us each"

We never had to wait for a car and the drivers were extremely friendly.We were greeted at the Kathmandu airport where a car was waiting to take us to Nagarkot. The next morning another car was avialble to take us to Pokhara. Because of the rules of sightseeing within Pokhara, you are only allowed to use the local transport people. So they have worked out a deal with Pokhara tour agents to arrange day tours for their customers. We did not have to pay separately or tip separately for anything. Everything was arranged and taken care of. We took all the little detours to Mankamana temple and Begnas lake on our way back to Pokhara and our driver never complained. And even when our mountain flight was cancelled, twice, he dutifully took us tot he airport and back and was very cheerful the whole time. It made the whole experience memorable.Highly recommended."

I didn't take long to decide on Earthbound Expeditions. Email responses from Rajan were quick. Our itinerary consisted of trekking, rafting, jungle safari and sightseeing, suited my children age 17, 15, 7. Charges were reasonable, no hidden costs. We had the best guide, Arjun Adhicari who is confident trekking guide with excellent track record and speaks excellent English. We met as strangers but end up as friends. My eldest son fell ill since arriving Nepal. Arjun and the porters were well-equipped with first aid box. I am thankful for that because the medicines I brought were finished. And thanks for their care to my 7-year-old son and my eldest son who had fever at the beginning of trip. When we were in Pokhara, we wanted to do paragliding, an optional activity but we had no time. Arjun did not want to disappoint us - he took an extra mile and arranged us to stay one more night in Pokhara and arranged us for the activity. The itinerary was so perfectly modified that we did not miss any programme later on and there was no additional costs we had to pay. Despite monsoon season and my sons' age, the amateurs were able to complete several days of trekking in the villages safely. Our trekking was in the third week of June and we expected rainfall. Contrary to what we know from travel guides, the monsoon was not as bad as what we thought. Rain did not hinder our travel plan. Throughout the entire trekking, there were only two occasions of a 10-15 minutes showers. At most times weather was cloudy and occasional sunshine. Things were cheaper in low season and accommodation, restaurants had few guests, hence, the advantages to travel during low season outweighs the advantage during peak season. Change in schedule, according to our guide Arjun, was easier to manage. This is our best holiday. Naturally Nepal - once is not enough...we will come back to explore another part of Nepal in the near future. A returning customer next round and hopefully we can meet Arjun, our trekking mentor, again. I recommend Earthbound Expeditions to anyone and family who looks for professional, personalized fun-filled tour package."

That flight was the highlight of our trip and I would highly recommend this flight to everyone visiting KTM.Another tip that Mr. Rajan gave us was to go for the Aarti at Pashupatinath at 7pm which was a magical experience. Almost like being on the Ganga ghats at Benaras. If it hadn't been for Mr. Rajan's suggestion we would have just gone to Pashupatinath during the day. I'd really like to thank you Mr. Rajan for this tip. I recommend Earthbound Expeditions to anyone looking for a highly professional yet personalised tour packages."

He was alway open to our suggestions and change the planning on our needs. (He was also the best photographer!). All in all, we were very lucky with the weather so it worth every ruppee we paid!

Went on 5 day Poon Hill trek in Annapurna region as part of 12 day trek/Chitwan package with Earthbound Expeditions in April and had a wonderful time. The scenery was beautiful with spectacular views throughout and low difficulty level of hiking. The best organized and most enjoyable trekking experience among any of my guided trekking experiences abroad so far. Our group of 12 was quite varied in age, but everyone bonded and had a wonderful time trekking, eating together and lodging at the guesthouses along the trail. Our guide Pravin was very organized, gave informative daily briefings, answered all of our questions, and made sure everyone was taken care of and accounted for on the trail even with our different ability levels as well as ensuring we were well taken care of at meals and for our overnight accommodations. Pravin and our 4 porters were very helpful, cheerful, friendly and encouraging the entire trek and made the group feel like a big family. We started as a group of strangers but ended feeling like a group of friends who I hope to see again. This was truly the trip of a lifetime!! I would not hesitate to return and trek with Pravin again in the future in Nepal"

Being here for work, we didn't have time for a full trek, and this was out way of trying to get out and see more of Nepal. Our guide was Shree Ram, and he was very informed, very helpful, and very accommodating. Knowing that we had a particular interest in agriculture in Nepal, he went out of his way to answer questions and share extra information on this topic. We had an amazing sunrise over the Himalayas, a great stop for tea and Nepalese donuts, and an introduction to Nepalese lifestyle and culture unlike what we could have gotten anywhere else. Both Shree Ram and the driver were prompt, courteous, and professional.We couldn't be happier and hope we have the opportunity to go out with Earthbound Expeditions and Shree Ram again."

I did my research from home first, then visited a few agencies in Thamel before I walked past Earthbound (who were on my list from internet research), walked in and chose them straight away. Rajan was very friendly and helpful. I only booked the day before I left and this was no problem. I also value the fact that they are an environmentally and socially conscious company.I did the 8 day Langtang Valley trek and absolutely loved it! It was important to me to feel comfortable with my guide as I was a solo female traveller. Rajan paired me up with Mitra as my guide/porter for this trip and it was no problem when I requested I meet him first, which I did the day before we left.Mitra means 'friend' and that he was. He was so professional for such a young age. Mitra took such good care of me, always making sure I was comfortable and ok. He stuck with me at my pace, made sure I was well catered for at every meal and always had a big friendly smile on his face. I was so very lucky to have Mitra as my guide. Langtang was amazing and Mitra made it even better for me.I hope to go back to Nepal one day and do some more trekking. I will go straight back to Earthbound Expeditions. No need to look elsewhere. Thanks Rajan and Mitra!! :)"

            "review": "rajan of earthbound expeditions is the best. If you are thinking of doing something out of the ordinary, THIS IS IT!!!Just like you, I found Earthbound Expeditions (EE) through the internet and chose them based on all the positive reviews. I haven't written any review in my whole life but I'm doing this because the world out there deserve the best of what Nepal has to offer through the warmth and expertise of the people from Earthbound Expeditions.Even if you are not sure of what you want or where exactly you want to go, the first thing you have to do is go to their website and get in touch (email is the fastest) with Mr. Rajan Simkhada right away. He is the president of Earthbound Expeditions and he will help by giving you an idea of what's best for you based on your time and budget.My friend, Jennifer, and I just finished trekking to Everest Base Camp (EBC). Our guide, Resham, and our porter, Bal, were extraordinary. They provided us with the kind of service that's way beyond our expectation. (Check out Jennifer's review on April 24, 2014).For me, March is the perfect time to go because there were other trekkers but not enough to make it like a circus. I treasured the solemnity that the trails had to offer.Also, the weather was just right. Warm enough so as not to feel like we were freezing (down jacket is important + gloves and head cover will help) but cold enough so that the yak dung on the trail didn't stink.When you are ready to go, the most important thing you have to bring with you is your diamox (to prevent altitude sickness) and your used hiking boots. The rest (I mean, everything else that you will need for the trek, I'm serious!) you can buy at Thamel, good quality for an incredible price. Spending money in Nepal is also a good way to give back to the people who go out of their way to to make your stay a pleasant one.Pack lightly. When I was reading the reviews before my trip, I won't believe what they said about wearing the same clothes for days and not taking a shower. It's true. My socks smelled fresh like they were taken out of the dryer. It was crazy!!! I brought a lot of baby wipes and felt fresh everyday.Next is water. I got Steripen from Costco before my trip and it served us (including our guide and porter) well until the end of our trek. I gave my Steripen to my guide after the trek. (Actually, I left a lot of my stuff with our guide and porter, including water bottles, sleeping bag liner, trekking poles, shirts, a lot of food, etc.) There is bottled water available if budget is not an issue. But you have to remember that everything, yes, everything up there was carried on the backs of either the porters or the animals.Which reminds me to tell you not to bring too much food. We did, which just resulted in excess baggage. All you need to bring are snack items because breakfast, lunch and dinner are provided during the trek. I became a vegetarian during the trek to avoid digestive problems. (We didn't have any.)Bring your camera, it's a photographer's paradise. There is internet almost all the way to EBC. You can also charge your phone, camera, etc for a small price. Buying my power bank was useless.And last but the most important of all, get travel insurance. Despite all the preparations, I caught the flu 3 days before flying to Kathmandu. But still, I made it to Kala Patthar (KP) and the original EBC. I was coughing and my lungs were not strong enough and succumbed to High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) two days after summitting KP. When you are in a very bad situation, you want to have Rajan Simkhada in your corner. One text message to him and the helicopter was on its way to pick us up in Lobuche.Despite 2 days in the hospital in Kathmandu, I believe that this trip will remain on top of all trips. Anyway, for me, the best part of traveling are those that are not part of the itinerary. Six weeks after coming back from Nepal, every now and then, my mind still drifts back to those magical mountains in the Himalayas and the bustling streets of Kathmandu.May you have a safe and fun trip."

I can't say enough about how helpful Rajan was in organizing the trip for us. We were on a three week trip and decided to detour at the last minute to the Himlayan region. I had been corresponding with Rajan about two weeks before we left and we ended up finalizing and booking about four days before going. To make things even more complicated, we were in Russia at the time, where we had a very limited internet connection. Rajan pulled it all off effortlessly and cheerfully. Our 13 hour time difference wasn't even an issue; he always responded promptly. Even though he's a busy man, we felt like we were his only customers. He even treated us to momos on our return to Kathmandu!We both loved this trip and are so appreciative of Rajan for making it happen."

Very quick to respond to e-mails, very helpful and informative.

We booked a 10 day tour of Nepal, starting with sight seeing in Kathmandu, followed by a 3-day trek around the Annapurna mountain range, and another 3 days spent doing jungle activities in Chitwan National Park, ending back in Kathmandu.Our guide Ratna was excellent as well. Had read other reviews and heard good things about Ratna beforehand on here and he did not disappoint! Our porter Kiran was also fun to have around. New to the field and rather young, he was able to carry our light (to him) load. At dinner we would try to help him with his English. After our trek, I had gotten a stomach flu while in Chitwan, and Ratna stayed by my side, bringing me tea and company while my friends were out exploring. My friends did not enjoy the tour bus ride back to Kathmandu from Chitwan but I on the other hand found it quite the local experience! There were some doomed vehicles that had gone over the cliff at a couple spots on the route and that seemed to worry other travelers that we could be next, but we made it back safe and sound with stories to tell.If I ever find myself back in Nepal, will definitely book with Rajan and Earthbound again. Won't bother looking elsewhere. :)"

There gear in Thamel (the section of Kathmandu you stay in)and Pokhara was everywhere--and super cheep, e.g. down sleeping bags for 12-20 US dollars, UV light to sterilize water are 20 USD there 200 dollars at home, very nice \"Northfake\" jacket for 20 USD...Bring your own hiking shoes and a good day pack--but buy the rest there--you will save loads.Things I did right:Brought duct tape, O2 canisters and my own meds and plenty hand sanitizer of Toilet PaperHints-donate your boots and other gear at the end of the Trek to Gopal with \"Shoes for Sherpas.\" Your porters will be working hard for the cash you tip them--tip them well and remember that some of them are in need of good foot wear.Biggest Hint--use this company they are fantastic!!!"

A very special thank you to our fantastic guide, Resham, who made our trek so thoroughly enjoyable with his friendly demeanor, wise judgment and exceptional knowledge of the area. Every aspect of our trip was handled so personally and professionally from start to finish which ensured a wonderful experience for my friend Judy Ann and me. I am absolutely effusive about the quality of our trip which was superb in every way. The Thamel Eco Resort in Kathmandu was a delightful place to stay with a friendly, professional staff, excellent food and gorgeous garden. Our city guide, Kumar, was excellent and provided a comprehensive tour of the major sights with in-depth knowledge and fascinating facts. On our trek in the Everest region, Resham took care of us like we were members of his family! The teahouses we stayed in were carefully selected to ensure the highest quality accommodations and sanitary conditions. Resham was always on top of everything and catered to our every need with kindness, compassion and always a smile. Resham went \u201cabove and beyond\u201d to guarantee our comfort, safety and happiness every step of the way. Thank you, Resham!!! The cooperative weather allowed us to spend time in Chitwan National Park which Judy Ann and I really enjoyed. The Jungle Safari Lodge was a beautiful and peaceful place to relax and continue to enjoy nature. Riding an elephant through the jungle and canoeing past crocodiles in the river was awesome! Thank you for suggesting this additional trip and for making the arrangements, expertly, as usual. Rajan and Resham, I will be forever grateful to you for your unsurpassed expertise in handling this memorable lifetime experience. I miss the beauty and culture of Nepal and I will definitely return someday. In the meantime, I have been recommending Earthbound Expeditions to everyone I know!

The whole trip and the people we met made it amazing and the views and friendships we made was what made this trip great. The earthbound expeditions is also with Bomehian Tours out of groupon so it is the same partnership but the porters the guides and our group made this trip of a lifetime. I for one will be back to go again to Everest base camp next year. If anyone is interested in this trip don't think twice it is heaven and you will love it. I lucky to have such a great group to trek and even celebrated my birthday there and thanks to new friends the best one yet. Low expectations and you will love it."

Right from the start when we met the owner Rajan we felt that we were in the hands of pros. Our guide Ram had 16 years of experience in trekking, had run the Mt. Everest marathon was certified in first aid and was also a certified chef. He was warm, cheerful and extremely knowledgeable about the terrain and the culture and made our trekking experience a memorable one. In addition, when we met and talked to other Trekkers we also realized that the price that was offered to us was the best anyone else had received. I highly highly recommend this trekking company and wish them luck for the future and hope to see hem soon again!!"

A destination I have come to love and build many great memories and friendships. My travels have always been stress free due to the expert service I get from the team at Earthbound Expeditions. Namaraj Sapkota has been my guide and companion throughout my visits and always goes the extra mile to see to my comfort and wellbeing. From shopping partner, tour guide, translator and friend, Nama made sure my time was safe and memorable.Anything I needed or problem I came across was solved with a phone call, and I always felt like I was cared about as a valued guest.My plans were pretty loose and I wanted a great deal of flexibility, once this was explained I was given the freedom to choose what to do and when to do it. Even though Rajan was on business out of Nepal the very capable Kadhar saw to my needs. Nepal has plenty to offer the traveller from wild safari, majestic scenery, bustle of life in city or village or peaceful retreat. Earthbound Expeditions have experience, networks and resources to meet any desire. You will not go wrong by engaging in their services."

I was part of a diverse 15-person group and from various countries and of varying ages and fitness levels. Nepal is a gorgeous, amazing country. I'd probably give a 4.8 rating if it were possible because I did have some minor critique's - beware if you travel during rainy times & read up on how to deal with pesky little leeches and know that this culture isn't precise in the timing or scheduling of things ( you might hear: \"may be yes, may be no\"). It's funny if you can just go with the flow and being open-minded, patient and having a sense of adventure. The Nepali people are extremely kind, personable and modest. I found it very easy to converse with all sorts of people there. Our guide, Gopal Neupane, was wonderfully kind, patient, knowledgeable, fun and supportive. He took great care of all of us, especially with those who lagged behind due to altitude sickness, etc. and he was infinitely encouraging, patient and had a good sense of humor. In fact, all the staff, porters (Deepak, Mahesh, etc.)and other guides (Arjun, Rajan) for other groups, were also very kind and encouraging. These young men all work incredibly hard and have the best, positive attitudes in taking care of all our needs from ordering and serving our meals, getting our rooms, and keeping track of us along the trails. They did so much to make sure we were all enjoying ourselves, happy, and safe at all times from before we woke up until after we went to sleep! While the accommodations were \"almost like summer camp\" and adequate, I recommend bringing quick dry clothes and ear plugs and to take all the recommendations the tour gives for what to bring seriously to ensure one is as comfortable and prepared as possible (as there are, of course, no Western style convenience stores up in the mountains!).The natural beauty of the geography, flora, and fauna (elephants, crocs) were almost unbelievable, pictures can only capture a limited portion/shadow of what is really there so I strongly anyone with the least inclination to try it. The group is large enough and has enough porters to help that one can basically go as fast as desired or as slow as needed with many breaks in between for respite, photos and even to buy snacks as needed, so its suitable for all able-bodied people at all fitness levels.Moreover, many of us got to know each other well and I feel I made some genuine life-long friends. Nepal with their ancient, vibrant capital city and those magnificent mountains are a must see and also benefits the Nepali people by bringing in revenue. I can hardly wait until I can go again to see the legendary rhododendrons forests in bloom next time."

The service was great -- everyone who works from the company, from its president to the guides and porters, really want to make your time in Nepal special. I felt really taken care of, a big comfort as I was traveling solo in Nepal. Definitely manage your expectations about accommodations along Nepal's treks. Lodges at higher elevations are super simple, will get chilly at night and may not have hot water for showering. Consider it all part of the adventure! One tip: As I did want a more comfortable place to stay in Namche (you need to stay there three nights along the Everest region route), I did request an upgrade to a Yeti Mountain Lodge, which is super luxe for the Nepal trek circuit."

The accommodation throughout the trek is simple and rustic - no hot water showers, we washed up with room temperature water at best but this is a luxury.

We had different understandings on some activities in Chitwan, and Rajan called his local business partner in Chitwan in advance to make sure we would not run into any issues once there. Earthbound Expeditions\u2019 staff were fantastic as well. Our guide Shreeram Adhikari has extensive trekking and mountain climbing experience, and was very knowledgeable, funny and friendly. Shree is also a great photographer, and I am using a photo he took of me as my facebook profile photo:). Our driver was amazing too \u2013 roads in Nepal are pretty bumpy and narrow, so a good driver is instrumental.I also wanted to mention the community projects that Rajan and Earthbound Expeditions as an organization have been doing. I had the pleasure to learn about their work to help Nepalese local communities, especially initiatives involving children and education. It was very inspiring.I would definitely recommend Earthbound Expeditions toanyone who plans to travel in Nepal. Namaste!"

It's become somewhat of a yearly tradition for me to help such children - it is my gift to myself, but not knowing anyone in Nepal I did a bit of research and eventually found Earthbound Expeditions headed up by the extremely intelligent, warm, and dynamic Rajan Simkhada. I was extremely impressed by how quickly he responded to my messages at all times of day and even more so when I found out how busy he was with civic and community projects aimed at improving life for the Nepali people and giving back. Their Ganesh Himal Charity trip was a wonderful idea but like so many people today with very little time I did not have the amount of time necessary to do take this tour. I explained to Rajan my situation and what I wanted to do and he custom made an itinerary to accommodate my wishes. I was sincerely impressed with his staff such as Shreeram Adhikari who outside of trekking up to the earth's highest point was assisting in the civic and community projects to aid Nepalese people. Rajan and Shree along with the rest of their staff did everything possible to make my trip to Nepal my favorite one to date. I accomplished all I set out to do and more. In a country with more spirit and kindness than money or infrastructure this is a HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT! I would HIGHLY Recommend Earthbound Expeditions to ANYONE seeking to visit the beautiful country of Nepal, India, Bhutan, or any other area they service. Best Regards, Alex Kruz"

My sister and I just got back from our first visit to Nepal in early November, and were absolutely impressed by the service we received from everybody in the Earthbound team, beginning with Mr Rajan Simkhada, We wanted to visit both Nepal and India, and he set out to work with us to customized our trip, putting together an itinerary for us, and then modifying it a few times until we were happy to have all the places in our wish list included to our satisfaction. Nepal is such an amazing country, from incredible natural beauty to the beauty and kindness of it\u2019s people, I brought back with me such wonderful memories!. We did the Annapurna Circuit trek adventure, truly a spectacular trek to be remembered for a lifetime, unforgettable scenery, what an incredible experience, the outstanding and incomparable beauty of the landscape, only made a better experience by the Earthbound team of our guide Lekh Tamang, and Arzun our porter, and the great care they took of us. These guys went above and beyond, making sure we were safe and comfortable, during and after those grueling hours of trekking. I did not physically prepare well for this, and I was unlucky enough to come down with a cold on our second day of trekking, the concern and attention they paid to my wellbeing, touched my soul. Their attitude, kindness and compassion is the kind of stuff you just can\u2019t put a price on, a person either has it or not, and these guys have it aplenty, pair this with Lekh\u2019s extensive knowledge of the area, and you have an excellent team. The India part of our trip was just as successful, Mr Rajan Simkhada was true to his word and delivered for us a flawless and most enjoyable and unforgettable vacation. I would definitely go back to Nepal with Earthbound, because I agree with the tourism slogan, for Nepal, once is not enough!,"

My friend and I joined the Earthbound Expeditions yoga and trekking tour on 23 November 2013, and could not have had a better time. The itinerary was fantastic, challenging enough for a novice like me - my legs definitely felt it! - but managing to take in many different facets of Nepali life. We saw the sun come up over the Himalayas from Poon Hill, witnessed many Nepalis going about their daily life and really getting an insight into how hard that really is, and seeing forests, rivers and waterfalls, as well as wild monkeys. I loved every minute of it.All the Earthbound Expeditions staff we encountered were fabulous. Our guide, Apar, was particularly good..... helpful, informative, quick witted and entertaining.... The porters were excellent.... Always cheerful and smiling, often singing, and happy to help with anything. Our group included a couple in their 70s - truly inspirational in itself - but when they did struggle on some parts, Apar and the porters were always right on hand, making sure they were ok. We were treated to dancing from the porters some evenings, which really was a highlight - the joy they exude is infectious and soon we were all on our feet. The yoga sessions we had as part of the trip were just what was needed in preparing us for the trek, and sorting out our aching muscles after. I would happily have done more - and the opportunity to do some on the trek itself would have been welcome, although I realise this would have been a logistical challenge to organise. If I were to pick a lowlight (not an easy task), it would have to be the cultural show they provide on the last evening. After several days experiencing real Nepali life on the trek, this was less than interesting, with average food, and little to commend it. As an aside to the organisers, this may have some merit on the first night of the trip, before we've had the opportunity to sample so much fabulous food, and warm hospitality on the trek. After the trek, it felt entirely manufactured. Our group still had a great evening as we took in some of the Kathmandu nightlife after the show. My advice would be if you are considering taking this awesome trip..... skip the show, and head straight for the nightlife!All in all, an exceptional holiday that will be remembered for a long, long time. Thanks Earthbound Expeditions...... hopefully we will trek together again one day!"

Trek itself was tough, but to be expected. It would be wise to train before hand. We had one person in the group that didn't finish for the sole fact that they were not physically prepared. You need to have a good amount of money in rupees for the trek as there are not many ATMs or money exchange places and commonly the ATMs were out of money. You can also pretty much expect to get sick in some sort of way, whether its a cold/chest infection, altitude or from food. Be prepared with medication for all of the above. Also beware of what you eat. Things such as baked beans are opened and used again only when ordered which means you have no idea how old they are. Milk, tomato soup etc is all powdered and again sometimes risky. I learned alot of this after the fact. When you get travel insurance make sure you get additional insurance for helicopter rescue. One person in our group needed helicopter rescue due to altitude sickness and ended up with a $4000 bill that was not covered by insurance. Chitwan was a good experience for me although some people did not feel it was worth it. The bus ride is 6 hours long and very bumpy. You are not guaranteed to see rhinos and other wild life. I was lucky to see 5 rhinos on elephant back and another one at sunset crossing the river although I know someone that went and didn't see even one. Tigers are very very rare. Me and a few others paid extra for a longer and deeper jeep safari and it didn't turn out to be worth it as we saw alot more in the morning during our elephant ride, but I guess thats the risk you take. All in all, a trip of a lifetime!!! Very recommended!"

On a personal note, if I were to redo our trip, we would skip the Chitwan Safari(which isn't run by Earthbound anyway) and instead add more trekking days. A great experience!"

Looked after us the whole day and organised our lunches in excellent fashion with different variety.Tea lodges were over my expectations. Basic but what else do you need in the mountains.Only down side was after the trek had finished and we were dropped back to Pokhara. There was no communication to our group on free excursions planned next day. However, this small thing was very minor.Keep up the good work and we will come back to do the Everest base camp"

It is possible it was because I was travelling alone and slightly neglected even though I was charged a premium for the single supplement. Also spent alot of time waiting for other people. They were very quick with responding emails which was great but I think at some point he got me mixed up with someone else and I had to reconfirm my itinerary last minute. Let me just put out there I've roughed it plenty so I'm not too picky on where I sleep. I could tell I got a substandard room in Thamel on the first night because I could compare it to my last night when I got a much better room. On the first night the bathroom was separated from the toilet in the next via a wooden plank so I could hear everything going on (yes. all kinds of business). The guides I was provided with were EXCELLENT. I have no complaints there, at one point my mountain biking guide might have even saved my life from a head on truck. We did a short pleasant hike to Nargakot, accommodation there was pretty good the sunrise could be seen on the roof and even my room. The next day was \"downhill\" biking to Dhulikhel. It was NOT as advertised- easy downhill through a national park. The majority of it was on highways which I was not comfortable with at all, it was very dusty and people had a general lack of concern for cyclists. I felt like I spent those two days mostly trying to stay alive and avoid everything else and it was not enjoyable coming back into kathmandu city on a push bike. I wish this point was made more clear for people taking the option to mountain bike. Accommodation in Dhulikhel yet again was disappointing simply because I could compare it to all the other better available spots across the street for a lot less than what I paid for (guides/fees accounted). My room had a huge hole in the wall which was apparently used for trash disposal. No back up gen power out all night-thus no warm shower. Sleeping in my clothes covered in dirt from mountain biking was a better option to getting under the grubby looking sheets (covered in someone else's hair). If I was up in the mountains where accommodation was limited I would have no complaints but in a big city like Dhulikhel I feel like the company skimped out."

About 7 years ago I learned that one could actually hike to the Everest Base Camp, and in June of this year I finally booked the EBC trek with Earthbound Expeditions. Originally I chose them because this particular tour was being offered at a discount with Travelzoo, but the real reason I booked with them was the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. Organization leading up to the trip was via email with Tarek, who answered all of my questions promptly. Just don't expect to get too much more than brief answers out of him - I got the impression he was very busy and also found out later he is based in India, not Nepal. In short:*Unlike some other members of our group (12 of us in total) I had no issues with my airport pick up or hotel drop off. This went quite smoothly for me in spite of the fact that I didn't exit the airport until almost 1.5 hours after we landed*Accommodations were just fine thru out the tour. I paid for the single supplement (a slight rip off when you realize that rooms are only about $2 on the trekking portion) and it was worth it for me to have my own room everywhere we went. *Our guide, Prem Tamang, was wonderful. I was sad to say goodbye to him and wouldn't hesitate to hire and/or request him as my guide on my next trip to the mountains. He was friendly and polite but also took his job of keeping us alive and well very seriously. Plus he gave these awesome group speeches every night, and quite often he had everyone in the teahouse listening along with us lol We appreciated the information he gave, and the timing in which he gave it. (not too far ahead as altitude kind of makes you a bit stupid and he knew we wouldn't remember anything if he told us too early!) His assistant (Dambar)and our porters were also a great group of guysUnfortunately the beautiful weather we had for the first week of the hike suddenly turned on us at Dingboche, and we were unable to continue on to EBC. This was EXTREMELY disappointing to all of us, but it was fairly obvious that we would not be able to safely or logically continue due to the snow. Such a bummer.My only suggestion would be for Mr. Rajan to offer more guidelines in terms of appropriate and fair tipping for the guides and porters. His offhand \"base amount\" suggestion at our original group meeting was taken very literally by some members of our group, while some of us felt the amount suggested was unfairly low. This caused quite a bit of discussion and tension amongst some of us and was the only sour point of the trip for me. (other than having to turn around of course!)Can't say enough positive things about this experience....it was so much more than I imagined and I can't wait to go back for Round 2!"

For example, sticking to ginger tea before you move on to taking any kinds of medicine. Both of them had all kinds of good tricks to make our lives eascer on the trail. Those solo travelers dont know what they are missing. Nama even spotted some rare monkeys once that all the solo hikers missed. They also knew the best places to stay in each town.

Nothing is going to run exactly to plan, so be prepared to go with the flow. Rein in your expectations (when it comes to accommodation standards in the mountains, timing of flights etc) And you will be vastly rewarded.The scenery was epic and spectacular, but above 4000 metres, it gets hard.. VERY hard.We've decided we'll probably stick to lower altitude treks in the future, but thank you, Earthbound, for an unforgettable adventure, and for looking after us every step of the way."

Both times, Earthbound looked after us from start to finish.On our first trek, I will always remember the moment we reached the top of the Kathmandu Valley rim (at around 2,100m), and the view of the Himalayan mountains opened up in front of us. It was simply breathtaking! At that point, I knew I wanted to be closer to those giants.We were fortunate to find the time to go back to Nepal for our second trek in the Khumbu region. Although Tengboche was our farthest point on the trek, we were still surrounded by 6,000m, 7,000m and 8,000m mountains! And thanks to Resham our Earthbound guide, and Bhim our porter, we were well looked after all the way.We were impressed by Earthbound's owner Rajan Simkhada and his dedication to his work. We communicated by email before we arrived in Nepal, and he was there to greet us when we arrived. He is very professional and well informed, and he is passionate about Nepal and giving back to the community. One thing also to note - Earthbound seems to be highly regarded by the teahouses, which would make a difference in securing accommodation during peak periods.We'll definitely visit Nepal again, most likely with Earthbound, as there is so much more there that we haven't seen and experienced."

Owner Rajan was usually personally available to attend to needs and questions. At dinner one night we spoke to him in the hotel to upgrade our trek to a custom private Annapurna Base Camp, and by breakfast the next day he had it all set up complete with an AWESOME guide + porter. We will never forget our wonderful guide, Barat, and our porter Sandisk. We ended up spending two weeks trekking the Himalayas with these two men and they were personable, friendly, and knowledgeable, and never too chatty, imposing, or pushy. (We'd noted some other groups along the trek with guides/porters that were boorish, incompetent, or unprofessional). Our guys handled our supplies, lodging, food, communicated well, even bringing an impressive array of emergency articles...EVERYTHING 100% pro and totally inspired confidence. We didn't have to think about logistics at all, and utterly enjoyed every moment. There are some things in Nepal that I didn't like seeing so much, such as certain groups of tourists unfairly haggling poor merchants, the oppressive pollution and traffic in Kathmandu, and those darn rolling power outages. But due to Earthbound's ways, none that stuff negated any of a wonderful experience overall. Thank you Rajan, Barat, everyone on the Earthbound staff, and all the associated vendors. You guys are the best!"

For the majority of the trip, it was the two of us and our guide, Nama. Rajan met us at the airport in Kathmandu, made sure we got to the domestic terminal with no issues and continued to check in with us during our trip to make sure everything was going as planned. Our guide, Nama, was tremendous. It was like traveling with a very knowledgable, old friend. He proactively took care of everything behind the scenes that I am sure would have otherwise led to great frustration. It appeared seamless, yet I know took a great deal of coordination and time to set up. We were just able to enjoy an incredible two day trek from Pokhara to Ghandruk and back, paragliding in Pokhara, trips to the World Peace Pagoda, the lake in Pokhara, and the best place to watch sunrise over the mountains. He was a wealth of knowledge about trekking, Nepal, local culture and customs, and really any other question we had. Once back in Kathmandu, Nama continued to guide us through the top sites in the city - Boudhanath stupa, Bhaktapur, Durbar Square, and the Pashputinath Temple. I hope to be able to return to Nepal some day and will most definitely plan that trip with Earthbound Expeditions."

We thoroughly enjoyed your hospitality and the tour arrangements that you had made for us. From the time we landed at Kathmandu you took care of everything. This probably differentiates you from other Tour operators who leave you to your own devices once the booking is made. When we started our tour, you kept in touch with us on an almost regular basis by phone and answered all of our queries. Nothing was too big or too small for you and you dealt with our every request promptly. For this we would like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts."

Warm hospitality by Rajan Simkhada and his crew makes travelling with EE a delightful experience. His highly trained staff kept us very comfortable throughout our trek and instilled reassurance when the going got tough. This, along with the superior level of local knowledge and enthusiasm by all crew members allowed us to soak up and thoroughly appreciate every ounce of the culture and customs that we encountered en route making the whole trip thoroughly enjoyable. We felt Rajan and his team had a unique way of identifying personal needs from an early stage and made a conscientious effort to cater for these throughout the trek- this really gave the experience a personal touch and is great in making you feel at home when in reality you couldnt be further! Without EE we wouldn't have reached Everest Base Camp 2012 and fulfilled a life-long dream- For this reason I will definately be booking a 3rd trip with this organisation and highly recommend it to all those reading this since EE really are second to none in aiding you to transform your dreams into reality!!"

All my personal guides were expert, courteous and willing to go way out of their way to make sure I had fun, was safe and would be happy with my trip. Chitwan park is a must see. It will be a life experience for you. Everything that Mr. Rajan set up for me was absolutely first rate. I cannot recommend Earthbound enough. I can honestly say I trusted them with my life and they made sure I was safe all the way. My drivers were courteous and when told I was afraid of heights, drove in such a way as to minimize my discomfort. That is about as custom tailored as it gets. You will not be disappointed.

My trekking partner, Kathy Warren and myself planned our trip to EBC about a year ago to celebrate our 50th birthdays. We were recommended to Earthbound by a friend of Kathy's. From the moment we signed up for the trip until the minute we were droped at the airport for our return trip home, earthbound took great care of us. The cost was extremly reasonable especially given the service we recieved. It was a once in a lifetime trip and I believe alot has to do with how we were taken care of. From the pick-up at the airport, our tour of Katmandu, our guide, Bharat whom we made a life-long friend with, everyday on the trail was a special experience. The owner of the company, Rajan, was there to answer all our questions, he even skyped with us before the trip. He is a special individual who is giving back his country through funding of schools and employing many local, talented individuals in his company. I would pick earthbound for any of our trips to Nepal. If you have any questions , I would be happy to share more of my experience.

Our primary goal was to reach Everest Base Camp and Maule our guide was exceptional and extremely warm and friendly. His experience and knowledge showed as he was able to take us up and down safely with adequate acclimitazation to prevent altitude sickness. His local knowledge was also excellent and this added to the enjoyment of the trek. A word about our porter Dhukpa, should also be said - like Maule he was exceptionally friendly, helpful and incredibly fit!The teahouses chosen were all comfortable and had excellent food (albeit mainly dhal baat, hehehe), and plenty of hot tea.When bad wheather struck, Maule tailored our trek accordingly (after discussing it with us of course) to ensure we remained safe.Our additions to the trip where also excellent. Rajan (the owner of Earthbound) was very friendly as well and ensured we were comfortable and well taken care of. The hotel (Thamel Eco-Lodge) in Kathmandu was very comfortable and clean. The Kathmandu city tour was very interesting and well organised with a private shuttle bus to get us around. Our trip to Pokhara and to Chitwan were also fantastic. (We got terrible food poising in Chitwan through no fault of the company but although we were sick it was great to see that everyone was concerned and offered as much assistance as possible until we were well again.)Earthbound expeditions is an exceptional company and made our dream of visiting Base Camp a reality in a well organised, comfortable, friendly and safe way.I would recommend them very highly and in fact are already thinking about planning our next trip to Nepal with them."

They are pretty similar when you receive the e-mails although the prices are quite different. Earthbound came with a good price and I like the communication with Rajan. The e-mails were nicely detailed and he was open to discuss new ideas.The first day I arrive in Kathmandu there was someone waiting me at the airport, the person took me to the Hotel, which I chose before, and in the next morning there was a really nice guide who take me to a tour around Kathmandu. I went then to the Agency and after a long talk to Rajan I changed my plan and instead of going to Langtang region I went to Pokhara heading to Mustang area. I paid for a Guide and a Porter and one day before he told me I would have a porter guide which I did not like. I'd rather believe it was a mistake since as soon I told him I paid for both separately he said there was no problem.One of the things I believe differ from one Agency to another is the choice of the \"hotels\" you will stay during you trekking. I believe some agencies safe money at this point. I have no complains about the hotels I stayed during my trekking except one that was quite dirty. Anyway you should not expect to do a trail with fancy hotels. Most of them have no hot water and are basic but good.The guide and the porter were nice people and really helpful. The guide told me to not eat meat during the trip. Later on I found out they say sometimes to not eat meat to safe money as they receive a fix amount from the Agency and whatever they save stay with them. Anyway I agreed with the idea of not having meat as I might not be used to it. I told my guide to suggest something every day.When I came back from Mustang there was no flight available due to bad weather. We came back by bus, truck and the guide made the difference. We had a big group and if my guide was not there I believe we would not have arrived back in Pokhara on the same day. All the guides were following my guide.The price was reasonably good however a friend of mine asked the price recently to Earthbound and unfortunately it was not not cheap. Overall I would recommend Earthbound."

The people working with Earthbound were so professional and very much took care of each and everyones individual needs. If you have the chance to request a guide please ask for Shreeram Adhikari. A young and energetic local who pretty much customized our experience. His English was fantastic and he seemed to know everyone who was anyone in the Sherpa/tea house community. We felt like all access back stage pass holders throughout our quest. One member of our group had to turn back and she she was immediately put at ease. A viable alternative was put into action and she patiently awaited our return at a wonderful yoga retreat at a discounted price. We all became fast friends - even the lovely cousins Bibec and Acus (our porters). Do not hesitate to take the leap and secure your very own life changing moment. Buenos suerte!

I didn't know Earthbound Expeditions was so highly rated on Trip Advisor, until after I had chosen to engage them.I could quickly see why so many people are pleased with the services Rajan's company has to offer. I chose to trek with Earthbound Expeditions because they were the most responsive to my emails and many little queries, patiently. I was very impressed with the prompt and efficient responses. I felt that I would be in good hands in Nepal, and indeed, that was so.We did the Poon Hill trek, and included white water rafting and mountain biking. Earthbound designed the itinerary according to the activities we wanted to do, and there were no slip ups. We were also really pleased with the guide Namaraj and porter Hari, for they were such great company! We had many pleasant conversations along the trek with them, and other trekkers, and were quite sad that we did such a short trek! As hard as it was for us, the encouragement of our guide and porters and patience was very nice to see. We wished we did a longer trek for we truly had much fun!Rajan gives his clients really good personal attention, and met us for dinner - the Nepali cultural show. Its really nice to meet with such a motivated and ambitious person who is truly making a difference in the industry. I believe he has one of the most comprehensive programmes and there are loads of activities you can choose to do with Earth bound - there is even a charity trek.Truly enjoyed it, and I could not had asked for more. I intend to go back, and will certainly engage Earthbound again because I do trust that they can do a good job, and they give the assurance that you need in a foreign country.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

The reason for the decision was due to the recommendation in The Lonely Planet guide book as well as all of the positive reviews on tripadvisor. It was definitely the right decision. Rajan answered all of our emails/questions prior to our departure very promtly. We arrived in Kathmandu quite late at night and were a bit nervous regarding the pickup from the airport. However, there was no reason to be nervous as a representative from Earthbound was standing right at the door with a sign to pick us up and bring us to the hotel. We stayed at the Eco Lodge in Kathmandu which is also owned by Rajan. It is a very nice hotel with a good breakfast. I recommend to try and get a room in one of the higher floors as they are much nicer. The staff was very friendly and we felt comfortable and safe the entire time. Everything about our trek was organized perfectly and went off without a hitch. Our guide Hari was fantastic! The Tea Houses were quite comfortable and the food was good. Neither my husband or I felt sick from the food at any point during our trek. We did our trek during high season and it was quite busy. However we never had to worry about getting a room as Hari always made sure to book the rooms in advance and to send our porter ahead of us as a double check. This was not the case in other agencies as we witnessed some people arriving at the tea houses only to find out that even though they had a \"reservation\" the room had been given to someone else. Rajan's attention to detail and passion for his job are very apparent and we are so glad we went with Earthbound. We really did have the time of our lives and we highly recommend Earthbound Expeditions... you will not be disappointed!!"

We took the everest base camp trek. It is a tough trek, only for those in very good shape. There will be unforseen problems which our guide dealt with very efficiently and cheerfully. Our main one was the backup that occurred in Lukla due to bad weather when we tried to get back to Kathmandu. Well publicized in international news. Our guide seemed to have connections that got us out while others were stuck for days. We were very well taken care of, both on the trek and in Kathmandu with sightseeing , airport pickups, etc always right on time. Pay a little extra for private \"baths\" on the trek itself. Do your homework re medical problems of high altitude trekking."

The Helambu Trail was the perfect trek for us as we didn\u2019t waste time at airports and because it was fairly unspoilt and close to Kathmandu. We will use Earthbound again. Apart from the trek, the tour of KTM and the cultural meal at the end were fantastic and wonderful opening and closure to our trip. Buy a steripen-not all those plastic water bottles!"

I've always wanted to trek on \"top of the world.\" So after a couple month's search on various websites, reviews, several questions and quick responses especially from Earthbound Expeditions, we settled on Earthbound Expeditions, a local company in the Thamel district of Kathmandu. Choosing Earthbound Expeditions was one of the best decisions we made about our trip for several reasons. It is a local company run by its president Rajan Simkhada, who wants people to see Nepal as he does. Compared to large trekking groups, we had exceptional value. We were led by Apar Datta Pant, Guide and Gopal Neupane, Porter were two of the most exceptional, experienced and English speaking Nepalis we met on the Annapurna trek. Also, Apar was always in the teahouse kitchen watching food preparation so neither of us were sick with the \"tourista.\" Huge plus! Since there were only two of us on the trek our guide was able to make a few modifications which really enhanced the trek. One of the best changes were to trekked out via a another route. A real plus during the busy trekking season. Least favorite part of the trek for me was the body-to-body head lamp hike before sunrise. But suffice to say as the tourism slogan goes \"Naturally Nepal once is not enough\" and I'd do it again and again with Earthbound Expeditions."

We organised the trip from the UK and all emails were responded to really timely and efficiently. Nepal has got everything, we saw mountains in Pokhara, jungle in Chitwan and as if it's not just enough to see Budhist culture and temples you also get to see lots of Hindu culture and temples too. Kathmandu was just amazing. The tour was really well organised and the drivers and guides always really knowledgable and nice friendly guys. We were hugely impressed with the hotels we stayed in and I would really recommend if you go to Chitwan to spend a little bit more to actually go to one of the lodges deep in the jungle because this was just such an incredible adventure. Earthbound offered us some great places to stay and were really flexible on what we could do on our tour so it was really tailor made, we couldn't believe the value for money. The pick-ups to go on tours were always on time and we always felt really looked after. At the end of the trip Rajan came to meet us for dinner and to see how the tour had gone which was a really lovely personal touch. I will definately go back to Nepal and would recommend Earthbound to anyone. We have done a fair bit of travelling and touring with other tour companies but Earthbound really really impressed us and made our trip something that we will always treasure."

The devotion, commitment to Budda is eye opening and perfectly awesome.If you have any desires to go to Tibet I will make that trip sooner rather than later. The Chinese are making a huge impact. Some of it positive (good infrasture as far as roads etc.) but much of it very sad and the Chinese are changing the face of Tibet.The people in both Nepal and Tibet are just lovely, generous and very special.

From the first day I booked my trip many months ago, I felt like Earthbound Expeditions was family. Emails were returned immediately, and I have never received such personalized care. If you have any doubt about seeing this part of the world, forget your concerns! Contact Rajan, owner. Better yet, we 3 ladies were able to customize our trip. We felt like royalty. Never have we experienced a trip jammed packed with memory-making experiences. Kathmandu is one of the most amazing cities in the world, so alive and gifted with the kindest people ever. But discover the magnificent waterfalls and majestic mountains, too. Special? We savored a 4-hour jungle safari atop an elephant (and then bathed the elephants!), tracked and found a wild rhino, loved several boat rides, walked the steps of the Dalai Lama's Palaces, and had immense fun bargaining at every market imaginable. I could write a book. The scenery was drop-dead gorgeous, and flying over Mount Everest was unforgettable. Our guide, Hari, in Nepal and our driver Deepok were frosting to the best cake I have ever eaten. We wanted to bring them back to the States with us. Please visit Tibet NOW. The culture is fast changing, so see it while the alleyways still remind you of the old country. I waited until my 60's to see these magnificent countries, and it was worth the wait, understatement. Fantastic Earthbound Expeditions, for touring and trekking, gave us exceptional service with a smile and prices that were terrific. Earthbound is A+ all the way around."

Traveling to Nepal for the first time and making it back safe (and a better person) \u2013 I will have to say that I definitely made the right choice to travel with Earthbound Expeditions as my guide and agent.For the first time travelers: the best way to start your adventure is to hire someone who can navigate the labyrinth of options for you. From finding and booking hotels to arranging (and changing) airline and bus tickets. Traveling in Nepal is not like any place else (that I have experienced). You will have to be patient and flexible. Having someone to take care of the formalities for you makes things much easier and can save you a lot of stress and time. If you are worried about being on a \u201ctour\u201d and being stuck with a schedule \u2013 don\u2019t be. I have changed my mind about bus travel after my first trip from Kathmandu to Pokhara. Rajan got me on a flight \u2013 no problem. Last minute. I didn\u2019t particularly like the hotel in Pokhara so I found a better one \u2013 I then called Rajan \u2013 he changed the hotel for me. No problem.As I got more comfortable in Nepal and still had time to spear I decided to add trekking to my repertoire. As usual \u2013 no problem. He even provided the guide I felt comfortable trekking with and some small things that I needed for the trek (since I was completely unprepared). I canceled (last minute) my trip to Tibet due to problem with my permit (I had to travel to Shanghai after Tibet and I didn\u2019t have time to get a new Chinese visa) \u2013 no problem.It is not an easy task to manage people\u2019s expectations while using very limited resources. Earthbound Expeditions and Rajan did absolutely amazing job. You will have to change your realities and standards \u2013 things are not the same in the mountains. But after a month I have to say that I had an incredible journey and memories to last me a life time.I will definitely return to Nepal soon. And even now though being able to manage the trip by myself - I would definitely chose to work with Earthbound Expeditions."

This gave us great confidence in his company and we decided to select Earthbound Expeditions with my friend. We did right, as our trek in the Annapurna Sanctuary was just magnificent, well organized, and so amazing. The staff went out of their way to make this trek one of the most memorable journey of our life. We were pampered and always felt safe during all our stay even when crossing some difficult paths on our way to the Annapurna Base camp. We had a lot of fun, laughter and discovered amazing sceneries with both our outstanding guide Nabin (who speaks French and English) and our outstanding porter Krishna, an incredible human being. Thanks to the support of our two great friends and the Earthbound company, this was more than a trek. It was also a lesson in selflessness, inner peace, and compassion in the midst of landscape of extraordinary beauty.We have done many trips around the world but we will rate our journey in Nepal without hesitation an outstanding experience.On the practical side we loved our hotel: the Kantipur Temple house: a three star hotel exquisitely decorated in Nepalese style and with a friendly staff. Good food, calm and very well situated near Thamel where you can do incredible shopping. Ask for the deluxe room good value for your money. Free wifi in the lobby.In Pokara the Bahari hotel situated near the lake and restaurants is nice with great views on the snowy mountain. Ask for Deluxe room with balcony upper floor. Good value for money.The tea house picked up for us by our guide Nabin along the trek were all very clean with great views on the mountain. Be ware that at high altitude you need an adequate down comforter (0 to minus 20 degrees Celsius), the company graciously will provide you with an adequate one. The tea house have no heating in the rooms. I strongly recommend the national vegetarian dish the Dhal which is excellent in protein, you can also ask for pizzas. Bring with you a camel bag for your water. In the last stretches toward the Annapurna base camp mineral water is not provided bring pills to purify the water. We had no problem with food poisoning during our entire journey.We recommend spring as the rhododendrons are in full bloom. Also do not hesitate to take a few days to visit Katmandu with the help of Earthbound Expeditions you will not regret it."

I only decided to book my trip with Earthbound Expeditions two weeks before going, having found excellent recommendations about the company on trip advisor which mirrored my experience. I got an excellent a professional and personal service from Rajan. As I was travelling on my own, Rajan suggested I join a couple who had already booked (after asking them if they were happy that I joined them). We were a small group which I thought was great Shree was an excellent guide who was very professional, friendly, helpful, very knowledgeable about Nepalese culture and the mountains. He was helped by his two very able 'assistants' Lama and Bibek Rai - whose welfare he was concerned for (as well as ours) - they were a great team. If you get the chance to request them you will be in for a fantastic holiday. I will definately be going back to Nepal and I would without hesitation use Earthbound Expeditions for any trips I might take."

If there was anyone that we wanted to plan our return trip to Tibet, Bhutan and Nepal, it'll be Rajan and his capable team.From the get-go, emails are responded to very quickly - whether it was a query or advice we required. All trip itineraries, instructions and costs are very clear and upfront - no hidden surprises. After we made our initial booking and deposit for our trip, unrest broke out in Tibet on the day we were scheduled to commence the trip. Rajan kept us updated on the travel situation constantly and reassured us that they will do whatever is necessary to keep our cancellation costs low. Even though we did not make it for that trip - Rajan made good on his promise to hold on to our deposit to use for our trip the following year - very commendable for his honesty.During our trip, we made a last minute decision to go to Bhutan since we had additional time at hand. In spite of the very short notice, the visa and all trip arrangements were made very promptly for us. It is very apparent that Rajan is very highly experienced as a ex-guide and trip planner, so everything went smoothly for us in spite of a complicated and intense itinerary involving Tibet-EBC-Bhutan-Nepal. The guides we had were professional and took care of us. We enjoyed our trip immensely and would highly recommend Rajan and Earthbound Expeditions to anyone!"

My husband and I spent 1 month in Nepal. Prior to our trip, Rajan (the owner of Earthbound) personally answered every question we had and helped us customize a trip to exactly what we wanted to experience. We chose Earthbound Expeditions based on the wonderful reviews, but we were still amazed at how personalized the service was. Rajan was completely flexible in tailoring a trip for us. We're seasoned travelers and had never used a tour company before so we were a bit afraid it would limit us (the serendipity of travel is often the best part). On the contrary, Rajan deftly reacted to every change we made along the trip. We don't even know how he would do it, but magically there would be taxis/bus tickets/plane tickets waiting for us or people to help us every step of the way. Place your trust in Rajan and you can't go wrong. He is also incredibly loyal to his country, knowledgeable, kind, and helps build schools in local villages.We started our trip by trekking the Annapurna Circuit. Much to our surprise (and happiness) were weren't placed in a group of 10+, it was just my husband and myself. Our guide Sudip and our porter Gokel went above and beyond to make the experience outstanding. Sudip spoke excellent English and would willingly answer the thousands of questions we asked about Nepali culture. He was knowledgeable and helpful, but more important he was friendly, kind and so easy to be around. There is a risk in choosing to spend most of your vacation alongside perfect strangers, but we couldn't have asked for a better experience than with Sudip and Gokel. Gokel also spoke English and was helpful far beyond his porter duties...including being the best of us at spotting monkeys on the hillside and even cooking us a delicious lunch himself when the tea house was crowded. Sudip and Gokel always made sure we were taken care, both on the trail and at the tea houses. I had some issues w/ altitude sickness going over the pass; Sudip was completely reassuring and when I was at my worst and scared, he somehow released the pressure in my head through massage to help me make it over. Gokel also went the extra mile as well by even taking my Day Pack. It was on that day that I couldn't have imagined not having them alongside. I've backpacked all of my life, but being at that high of an elevation is unlike anything I've ever experienced...having an experienced guide and porter to pace us, monitor, and reassure us when we were sick made all of the difference in our confidence. Even for little things like colds and food poisoning, they always had either medication or traditional remedies (like garlic soup) to help us.We planned to end our trek in Jonsom, but when our flight was canceled due to weather we decided to change plans and finish trekking the circuit on our own. Within minutes, Sudip stopped a local bus passing by, plopped us in a seat and asked a guide he knew on the bus to help us if needed. Sudip even dropped our extra bag in Pokhara (our destination) and arranged for a taxi to be waiting for us 5 days later to take us there. Mid-trip, we even called him to confirm and mostly because by then we missed our friends Sudip and Gokel!All of the lodging selected by Earthbound Expeditions was great. On the trail, they always procurred the rooms with the BEST views for us. Whether we were coming off of the trail or on our way to Chitwan, they were always a step ahead of us arranging transportation and lodging.The value of hiring Earthbound Expeditions for our Nepal trip far outweighed the actual costs involved. The charges are very, very reasonable and the service absolutely exceeded our expectations!"

This message is for those who are interested to join Kailash - Lhasa tour, Traveling with Earthbound Expeditions in (western) Tibet is traveling with a feeling of safety. Especially in that part of the world where they do not have all those safety services we western people are so common with. Earthbound Expedition is very keen on prevention for the food, drinking water, cars and also for the altitude sickness. Yes, it hit me and it hit everyone who is not used to travel on such altitude. But slowly I, and the others are used to it. They never forced a situation for the sake of their own. Speaking for my own. I could make it without taking drugs like Diamox. That brought me the feeling having a very relaxed time in this remote part of the world. Traveling western Tibet and climbing Mount Kailash ( Dolma - La) was a kind of adventure that makes me feel good because they saw it as their duty to guard us without overreacting. And although we were with a group of fourteen, which meant so many different people with all their different wishes, nevertheless everyone off us was satisfied about the quality of life. One thing you should know ! They know very interesting places even the well-known travel guides do not describe. That's another reason for you to consider traveling with Earthbound Expeditions!September 13, 2004 Teus Vertooren, Project-manager, Mental hospital Rotterdam / Holland"

Without hesitation, Ajay went down the hill to retrieve it, without a complaint! Our porters and us continued on and Ajay caught up with us within 20 minutes, with perspiration and a smile on his face.At Birenthanti, our last stop before heading back to Pokhara, Ajay noticed that we did not enjoy our dinner of Mashed Potatoes.

This is my second time in Nepal and my second time using Rajan and Earthbound. Nepal is an amazing place to go so Rajan's product is quite easy to sell, however it's so easy to become stuck with a bad company and a bad guide - there are 1500 or more companies in Kathmandu, not to mention all the overpriced companies organising trips from Europe and the US, not knowing anything about the guide you will be assigned. Rajan thankfully gets it all right. And at the right price (if the price seems low it's because that's how much things cost in Nepal, the service is still 5*). He's professional, friendly and always responds to your queries no matter how many times you ask the same thing. The guide he sent with us knew everything about the entire region - believe me some guides can't even point out Everest - and was very professional. We also had the best porter on the entire base camp trail. As we were in Nepal during Diwali Rajan invited us to his house for the final day of the festival - Tihar - to experience and celebrate this with his family. Additionally, my boyfriend and i volunteered in an orphanage in Kathmandu, also arranged through Rajan, which in many ways was the best part of our entire Nepal experience. I will definitely be returning to Nepal a third time and will definitely be using Earthbound again."

My father and I (68 and 38 respectively) just returned from a TRIP OF A LIFETIME trekking the Annapurna Circuit trek in Nepal, with Earthbound Expeditions. Back in April, we read an article in the NYT regarding this trek and the reporter mentioned two trekking companies. My dad sent emails to both organizations and was amazed to receive a thorough response with customized itinerary and pricing within the next day. That was our first excellent experience with Earthbound that continued on up to, during and at the end of our trip.Having trekked throughout the world, I must say that Earthbound Expeditions, the owner Rajan, our AMAZING guide Hari and porter Chhirring, are some of the most service-oriented, professional, caring and wonderful people we've ever worked with. Rajan answered my numerous emails in a timely manner and met with us personally at the beginning and end of our trek, for a wonderful NEpali dinner and culture show.In Nepal, anything can go and there are many unexpected events that can change your trip such as outrageous traffic jams, illnesses, altitude sickness, homesickness etc. Rajan and his guide were UNBELIEVABLE in their ability to go with the flow and change our itineary and WORK MAGIC on the trip. I could not believe it! We would never receive this kind of customer service and individualized attention in the US! Our guide, Hari was unbelievable. He and our porter bent over backwards to ensure we were happy, had lots of laughs, comfortable and even helped me make my daily calls home to my family!

I would highly recommend EARTHBOUND to anyone interested trekking in Nepal, especially ones who want a unique experience and not to be with the herds (those huge, annoying trekkiing companies with 15-20 people per group...no thanks). I felt like being with the people from earthbound was almost more important even than the trek....I learned so much about the culture and life of Nepal and its people. It was an amazing experience and one I hope to someday do again. THANKS EARTHBOUND for your wonderful trip!!!!!"

            "review": "Earthbound Expeditions - Beyond Expectations. What a magical experience! This August my family and I enjoyed the trip of a lifetime in Nepal and Tibet. We are in our 40's and 50's and have two boys ages 5 and 12. Since we had just under two weeks for our trip we had a lot of things we wanted to do in a short time. We used Earthbound Expeditions of Katmandu for every detail of our trip. We flew into Katmandu, spent a night in Nagarkot and the Club Himalaya, drove to Pokara for a few days - stayed at the Fishtail Lodge, drove to Chitwan - stayed at the Rhino Residency, drove back to Katmandu - stayed at Darwicka's, flew to Lhasa - stayed at the Four Points Sheraton, worked our way overland back to Katmandu via Everest Base Camp, and then Darwicka's in Katmandu again before flying out. All along the way we had private guides, a Landcruiser, and driver.I really can't even begin to describe how utterly amazing this trip was. We were in the car for a very long time but I wouldn't have traded it for the world. The road trip let us see so much beauty and get such a feeling from being immersed in the both countries. Every corner we rounded brought another amazing sight into our view. Wow. It was simply breathtaking. Additionally having our own car allowed us to stop and check out whatever caught our interest. Like in Nepal the kids wanted to go out onto one of the wire suspension bridges that span the rushing rivers that crash through mountain canyons...so we did. HIghlights of Nepal include seeing all sorts of wildlife including several rhinos, up close and personal. Rhino Residency and in particular Mr. Chok our Chitwan naturalist were spectaular. If you go to Chitwan and you are interested in the people and wildlife of the area, you must go out into the jungle with Mr. Chok. He is like the \"Steve Irwin of Chitwan\". Highlights of Tibet were the breathtaking scenery and the off road trip from Everest Base Camp to Tingri and stopping to have tea with an ancient looking monk who invited us into his tent on a lonely mountain pass. The Tibetan driver and guide had friends all along the way.In regards to taking young children on this trip, I would say it is not for everyone but for our kids it was wonderful. They had so much fun and everywhere we went they found other kids to play with and got lots of attention for the local people who were not used to seeing young American kids. I believe that this trip and our other travels have made them very accepting to all of the diversity in our world and very comfortable with it. Whether they were receiving a blessing from a Hindu holy man, lighting a yak butter candle in a Buddist temple, or playing with the local Taru children in Chitwan .....they took it all in stride. I found myself yelling after the little one in Chitwan \"Hey slow down and stay away from the water buffalo's\". That is something I never would have said back in Ohio ;) The altitude in Tibet has to be respected especially with kids. The most important thing is to know the signs of altitude sickness and go lower if you have problems. Since we were traveling a little faster than I would have liked we took diamox which I think helped a great deal. My little one started to feel sick after a couple hours at Everest Base Camp so we headed back down instead of staying overnight in the tents like we had planned. As soon as we descended to a lower altitude he was fine. I made everyone drink only bottled water, no ice, or boiled drinks and nobody got sick even a little bit. The food was great in both countires. By the way, all of the reviews speak negatively about the tents at EBC but I found the one we were going to stay in to be very cozy and we had some yummy noodles and coffee there.I really can't say enough about Earthbound and the owner Rajan. I think we exchanged about 100 emails trying to sort out the details of our trip. He patiently worked with me and made change after change to our itinerary until we finally settled on the perfect package for our family. He was honest. Completely trustworthy. And best of all treated us like respected friends during the entire process. I have to admit that as a suburban American Mom I was a little cautious about heading out into exotic Nepal and Tibet with my kids. Working with Rajan was like having an old friend or a family member there for us. He met us at the airport, dropped us back off at the airport, was available via cell phone at all times during the trip. I am amazed at how he handled every detail. He took care of us at every step. For example, I was particularly concerned about the border crossing between Tibet and Katmandu because our guide from Tibet couldn't go with us across the border. However there were two guides waiting for us and introduced themselves as soon as we stepped out of our Landcruiser. They walked us through customs, over the border, through Nepal's immigration, and to our waiting Landcruiser on the Nepal side. It was seamless. Our guides and drivers were fabulous and wonderful company on our vacation. I can imagine that they are treated very well by Rajan and that promotes their great attitudes and service levels.So if you are thinking about visiting Nepal and Tibet I would say go and enjoy. It is a once in a lifetime magical experience."

Not only were we now days ahead on the trek of our stranded fellow trekkers, Rajan also ensured that we had a full chopper both directions to minimize our extra cost! Also nice Earthbound touches include the use of excellent down sleeping bags and jackets for the trek minimizing our airline luggage check-ins; a wonderful celebration Nepali dinner with Rajan in Kathmandu; a great city tour; and, yes, even cool T-shirts! Earthbound is eco-friendly and supports numerous charities in Nepal. It is simply an exceptional organization and , of course, we plan on using Rajan and his team for future treks in Nepal, Tibet, and Bhutan."

All written here on TA is absolutely correct! Rajan took care of us in every possible way. We sat with him and with our porter/guide (see below) a day before starting the trek and we got all the guidance, information and tips we needed. Rajan was very vey patient with us, even that I sent him about 20 emails before arriving to Kathmandu. Rajan also reimburse us, immediately, no question asked, when we did'nt use 2 flight tickets he alreay purches for us. Rajan assign to us the most great porter/guide we could ask, his name is *Hary Nepal* (who works at Rajan's Earthbound Expeditions) , remember that name because I would like also like to take this opportunity to highly recommend Mr Hary Nepal. Hary go on the EBC more than 20 times and the Annapurna circuit more than 40 times - he his a pro! very kind and the most modest person, you will not here a ward about money. Hary took care of us on the trek make sure that we will be happy he is an amazing guy, let me just say it like this: if you go to Nepal - go with Earthbound Expeditions, and do yourself a favor, ask rajan to assign you Hary nepal as porter/guide! It was Hary, just as the view and scenery, that made it a once in a lifetime journey for us."

We left the Himalayas one day early (as we were super fast walkers), Rajan and our Guide adapted to this with no worries. Allowing us to change hotels easily & stay an extra night in Kathmandu - not every company would do this.

I have never been disappointed.What I like about Rajan is his ability to organize everything in an excellent way. He seems to have an incredible large network of people in the tourism sector to tailor you the package you\u2019re looking for and to take care of you without worrying. Rajan is very good in hearing what you want - even if you don\u2019t know it exactly yourself yet- and can present you different customized options. He is straightforward in explaining both the highlights and potential downsides one might expect during a trek or trip; as well as what is possible and what\u2019s not. He takes customer care to the core of his business, never being bothered to call you during and/or after a trek to check if everything goes well.Besides his good humor and his dynamism, you can bet Rajan is very reliable. I never had any problem and will surely turn to him for next treks and trips.In addition, I also like his personal dedication to the development of Nepal. He is currently developing a trek that will pass his home village, far remote in the mountains, and where he personally is setting up a school. The income that he generates from this trek is set aside for the school. A great initiative!"

It was exactly what I was looking for, a low-key, very 'real' sort of feeling traveling by local bus and jeep, heading deep into the mountains and far far away from developed civilization. I was introduced to many friends and family and couldn't even believe that a place like this exists, where you can still find people living in such a pure and natural way. This first visit actually occurred last summer, and I have spent the last year fundraising and working to create an NGO. Now this summer, I returned to with a pocket full of donated money to help build the people living in this village a new primary school for their younger children. Over the span of four months I made 7 or so trips to and from the village and never tired of the experience. This is offered to everyone though its sort of like a secret item on the menu, just ask for the homestyle village trek. I highly reccomend it, it was life-changing for me. It is perfect for those looking to get off of the overcrowded tourist treks like EBC and Annapurna and get some insight into how Nepal might have existed before tourism became such an industry. The people living in these areas are so wonderful, all I can say is try it out if you have the opportunity. Rajan and his guides are the most helpful, respectful, and charming people in the business. Without his connections and professionalism nothing that I had hoped to accomplish in Nepal would have came close to fruition. Anything you need he is there for you, a true friend and wonderful person."

Rajan from Earthbound Expeditions arranged our trekking to Everest Base Camp and our Tibet jeep-tour wonderfully. EBC: We booked a trip with just the two of us, a private guide and a porter. Our guide Ram was really great. It's just this guy that you need during such a high altitude trek. We were quite unexperienced with high altitudes, but we felt really safe with him. Ram talks english very well, and just knew what to do when we suffered from the high altitudes; brought the right medication, and let us eat garlic and drink heaps of water. Furthermore, he knew the mountains very well. He is also volunteering often in medical camps and thus he's not only caring about his clients, but he cares about all the people in the mountains. Unfortunately we found out that not every guide in the EBC region cares about his clients. Ram had to take care of a girl that had problems with the altitude. Her guide was drinking beers somewhere else...Tibet jeep tour:We flew in on Lhasa, stayed there for two days, and drove back with jeeps to Kathmandu over the Friendship Highway. The whole Tibet-trip took us one week. Our Tibetan guide talked english very well, although he could not answer all our questions. But that was because of the difficult political situation in Tibet at the moment... Views during this jeep-trip were great, but you don't really need jeeps. The highway is just renewed and a normal bus would do the job as well. Hotels were fine, only in Tingri the rooms were very dirty. Luckily Rajan already told us, so we knew what we could expect.Everything was included in the trip, also all entrance fees. We heard from other travelers, who booked their jeep-trip somewhere else, they had to pay all entrance fees themselves. Rajan is always very explicit and he tells you exactly what is included and excluded in the trip, and what further expenses you can expect.Rajan responds on emails and requests very quick. He is very flexible and tries to make your holidays as convenient as possible. When you book a trip with him, you just know that everything is arranged well."

Before we even arrived in Nepal our entire trip was not only completely planned and organized but very economical for the vast amount of traveling we did within the country. We were greeted as soon as we arrived in Kathmandu and enjoyed a week long, completely prepared tourist trip of the best placed Nepal had to offer. Each of the places we stayed in were five star standards and quite exotic. The animal life and geographic wonders we saw were unprecedented and we truly had a incredible time. When we finished sightseeing, my companions and I had a lovely places secured for us, as a home-stay, to work at an orphanage only five minutes walking distance away. The experience is unbeatable, but the amount of organization and efficiency this organization has is unbeatable. No surprises and 100% customer satisfaction."

E-mails and info were sent in a timely manner and very precise. I had specific needs, like chartering a Helicopter to go to Mount Everest base camp and river rafting, and Rajan arranged it perfect. The trip by Helicopter to Everest is a MUST DO! Along the flight, there are incredible sceneries where you can land for a picnic, or just take in awe the mountains. We stopped at Tengboche Monastery, only reachable by foot or by Helicopter, it was a incredible serene experience.Plan to go back for a hiking trip through the Himalayas. Definitely think is Nepal is for hiking, enjoying nature."

After reading the many good reviews of Rajan and his company on this website, my wife and I chose to book a tour with Earthbound Expeditions for our trip to Nepal in June. We were very glad we did. Rajan's emails were responsive and timely as he helped us design a ten-day tour, including a seven-day Himilaya trek and a few nights in Pokhara. Rajan arranged flights for us to Pokhara and Jomsom, as well as a private car and driver for the return to Kathmandu. We were accompanied on our trek by an excellent Earthbound Expeditions guide/porter who helped us arrange food and lodging during the hike. When it came time for us to leave Kathmandu, Rajan also booked us a flight to Bangkok at the last minute which was cheaper than anything we found ourselves on the Internet. Rajan and his staff were a joy to work with and made sure we had an excellent vacation in Nepal. We will definitely use Earthbound Expeditions on our next visit to Nepal."

From the first e-mail sent to the final meal in Kathmandu I have nothing but praise for both the company and Rajan. Everything was arranged professionally and I encountered no problems. Rajan arranged for airport pick ups, a first class hotel (Samsara Resort), a perfect city guide for our visits in Kathmandu (thank you Salik Ram Thapa!) and a wonderful trek guide Ramchandra.The trek itself was not easy but with the support of Ram and our porters Dawa and Shyam we made it base camp and I managed to take in the peak of Kala Pattar too!I have no hesitation in recommending Earthbound Expeditions for all your trips to Nepal. Just enjoy your time there as much as I did and you will have the trip of a lifetime.Anna Vowles a.vowles@liverpool.ac.uk"

We had a great experiance on this trek, its quite tough but also rewarding to see the big peaks on the way to and in the sanctuary itself, nothing quite compares to what you see when you get into the sanctuary, you really will not have seen anything like it before.Rajan from Earthbound did everything possible to ensure our trip was smooth, well organised and easy for us Brits who found ourselves in a strange land and initially the madness of Kathmandu. All his organisation and very warm welcome takes away some of the culture shock and makes you feel safe and in good hands right from the airport arrival pick up to the drop off (sadly) on the last day when you just won't want to leave Nepal.We were due to start our trek on Mon 6th April from Nayapul by taking a taxi 2hrs ride from Pokhara, unfortunately as it was nearly a year since the government took over the country decided to take an unofficial holiday so there was no transport. Rajan was on the case immediately and called our guide to discuss options with us, by 8am we had a new plan and we were off! it involved a bit if extra trekking but it got us onto the trail and started so we could remain on schedule. The change in plan meant we now how to do our trek backwards but our fantastic guide Gamboo was very careful to plan in a good aclimitization strategy which paid dividends as none of us suffered any altitude sickness symptoms at all so on our 'summit' day to ABC we all felt great. That day will stay with me for the rest of my life, we left in the dark just before 5am and walked up in the snow into the dawn as the sun began to flash its rays upon the sanctuary, an unforgetable moment.Our guide and porters were first class, they looked after us the whole way, at meal times, getting us good rooms etc. a total service. Our guide was very experianced and every time we asked 'how long to ..... ' he was spot on every time so we knew we could rely on everything he said. He also know's all the mountains, will point them out and tell you a bit about them. They also appreicate some mustang coffee (not sure i recommend it but give it a try!) over a few card games in the evening.As, when, if (I really hope so) I return to Nepal I would go straight to Rajan's company to make all my arrangements as I know from this experiance that he's totally reliable, does everything he can to ensure you have a great time in Nepal, is passonate about tourisum, and his price is very competitive - you get excellent value for money.If mountains, the outdoors and trekking is your thing (or even if its not) I recommend Nepal for a great experiance and you won't go wrong with Rajan and Earthbound."

Nameste!To our fellow travellers to Nepal, we write to make good references for Rajan and his Earthbound Expeditions team. Indeed, we were referred to Rajan by our friends who had good experiences with them. The decision to use Rajan and his team was such a blessing to us and we were so glad we did. To be specific, Rajan first impressed us with his prompt responses to our emails enquiries before the trip.There were many changes in our planning as it was our first trip to Nepal but Rajan was so patient to guide us through the planning and eventually we decided to take a 6 days leisure tour around Kathmandu and Pokhara.However, upon our arrival to Kathmandu, we were so thrilled by the mountains ranges seen from the plane, that we decided at the last minute to change (again) our itinery to do a trekking holiday instead.Rajan was so kind and so accommodating to us, making sure that we get to have the best experiences in Nepal, that he helped us to change and plan our trekking expedition. That means he has to book the air tickets and land transports and make accommodation arrangements on the mountains at the eleventh hour for us.We truly appreciate this gracious gesture from Rajan as he keeps his clients' interest at heart and go an extra mile for them to make sure that their clients get the best experiences in Nepal. We were just 2 ladies and we trekked the Ghorepani/Poonhill trek. We had a fantastic guide, his name is Shree, who speaks good english and a very experienced and knowledgeable trekking guide. During our trek, he showed us the Nepalese culture, the people and the way the Nepalese live their lives more than a guide book can offer you. He is very warm and attentive to us. We strongly recommend you to use him as your guide in your forthcoming trip. The porter we used, his name is Sunil, who is also very good and very thoughtful. We would also recommend you to use Sunil as your porter too. From the land transports, the hotels on earth and lodges on the mountains to the hospitality extended to us by the Nepalese during our trip, were simply first class quality services we could not ask for more. There were no hiccups, no hidden cost, Rajan's team was all honest, sincere and reliable. Most importantly, we felt that we were so well taken care of by them that we have decided to use them as our guide in our future trips to Tibet and Bhutan or even to trek the Mount Everest basecamp. Naturally Nepal, once is not good enough, we have to thank Rajan and his team who were the ambassadors of Nepal that contributed to our wonderful experiences. We will definitely return for more and pass our good words around to recommend and appreciate them. We hope you find the above helpful. Our humble experience assures you that your decision to use Rajan and his team will not disappoint you.Be blessed by Earthbound Expeditions so that you can be a blessing to our lovely Nepalese friends.

Rajan was always very prompt and detailed with his email communication, which immediately made him stand out from other tour agencies who I was considering. He accommodated my last minute variations and tailored the trip exactly to my time constraints and interests.My biggest concern was that I would turn up to find I had been scammed. But everything lived up to, or exceeded my expectations. The hotel he had arranged for me in Kathmandu was fantastic. Almost too good - I felt like I wasn't experiencing the true Kathmandu, by staying at something so nice! But it was a comfortable way to get introduced to the environment before the challenges of treking to Everest, so was perfect for me.When I finished the Everest trek ahead of schedule and returned to Kathmandu 2 days early, Rajan immediately came to meet me and altered the itinerary accordingly, fitting in extra activities. While I expect you can shop around and find some things cheeper, my main priority was for everything to run smoothly and for plans to be flexible. Earthbound Expeditions (ie. Rajan) was fantastic for me - no surprises at all. Considering everything, I am happy with the value for money I received.The guides organised through Rajan had good enough English to provide a good service. ie. they had strong accents but they understood everything you asked. While treking, I encountered some guides who had better English, but I saw some that were much worse. Most importantly, they were as friendly and flexible as Rajan, which was very helpful."

We hope to join you when you return back to Nepal... :)My family and I took the Everest-Taj Mahal Tour with Earthbound Expeditions - December 2008.. In Nepal, what we enjoyed most were: the mountain flight over Everest / Himalayas and our visit to mountain towns of Nagarkot and Dhulikhel, not to mention the Nepalis themselves. From Nagarkot, we had about a 15 km hike to Baneppa and from there rode public buses to the mountain resort of Dhulikhel. The hike was memorable because we had the opportunity to interact with the villagers and children. We saw scenic views: waterfalls, rice terraces, farms, hills, and mountains - so different from the chaos of Thamel/Kathmandu. By riding the public buses, we were able to be up close and personal with the local people. We had tea with a family while waiting for the rain to stop and for the bus. In Dhulikhel, we had a good view of the Himalayas right from our breakfast table while being served freshly cooked omelettes.We hope to return to Nepal and go to Pokhara and Annapurnas. Again, with Earthbound Expeditions who gave us a very professional and personalized service. Rajan (president) did a good job of planning and coordinating our trip. He customized a tour for the three of us. He responded promptly to my every email or inquiry. Throughout our stay, he monitored or coordinated our daily activities. Rajan also deployed the best staff to take care of us: G.P., our skilled, careful, and caring driver; Salik, our tour guide for the Kathmandu sites, who gave an in-depth and insightful lecture on the temples and on Hinduism/Buddhism; and Shree, our guide in Nagarkot and Dhulikhel, who was resourceful, reliable, and went beyond the call of duty. He even found the best-tasting radish and soy beans for us to eat while we hiked. Thank you, guys! You are great and we miss you.I think the best asset of Nepal is its people. As a people, the Nepalis are gentle, warm, and friendly. In India, we did the Golden Triangle of Jaipur, Agra, and Delhi. The Taj Mahal lived up to our expectations \u2013 despite the day starting out foggy which can affect your view of the Taj. We were very comfortable in the Holiday Inn in Agra and Jaipur. They offered complimentary bottled water in the rooms \u2013 nice touch. Clark International Hotel in Delhi was interesting because it was located right in the middle of the action, close to everything. We had a good driver in Jaspal and a competent tour guide in Gaurav.By the way, there were power outages in Nepal when we were there. So, while the hotels could run on back-up power generators, it was not enough power to run the heaters, if any. So, be ready to layer and bundle up if you come during the winter. In Dhulikhel, we were given hot water bottles to keep warm in bed \u2013 that worked! All part of the cultural experience. Tip to travelers \u2013 never expect your destination to be like home. If you do, then better stay home. Open mind, open heart! B,C, & G Gonzales, San Diego, US."

Having made the decision to spend my holiday in Nepal this year i set about looking for the perfect company to go with - and i certainly found that in the form of Rajan and Earthbound Expeditions. I explained to Rajan that i wanted a bit of everything - Himalaya, Elephants and 'city culture' and thats exactly what i got. The trek was fantastic and my porter and guide were great. They encouraged me when i thought i couldn't walk anymore, ensured that i went uphill 'slowly' so as not to burn out and watched out for me the whole time. The nature, views and people are incredible and i will definitely be coming back for more trekking with EE. Chitwan was also fantastic and this part of the tour was again organised by EE. I swam with elephants which was a truly awesome experience. The accommodation in Kathmandu was also very nice and Rajan can organise for you to stay in whichever area of the city you like. As i was there during Diwali it was a bit manic and part of my trip had to be rearranged but they did this without any hassle. I was also invited to spend the brother/sister ceremony with Rajan's family which was a truly memorable experience and i felt honoured to be invited. All in all it was the most amazing time and Nepal is definitely somewhere everyone should visit. I will certainly be going back and hope that Rajan and everyone else at Earthbound Expeditions will help me with the details....!!"

The facilities used by Earthbound were exceptional.The huts were nice,the food was absolutely scrumptious (all 3 meals) and the staff went beyong their call of duty. Lumbini ,birthplace of Buddha was very peaceful and serene compared to Boddgaya where He achieved Enlightment.Bhutan was indeed the last shrangri la on earth.The scenery was spectacular,the people very kind and gentle.The restaurants and hotels used by Eathbound were much better than we saw on the internet.This trip is the 2nd one we took with Earthbound in 2 years.

It was an amazing experience, and I hope you will consider it too if you are reading this. The villages and views along this route are like stepping back in time. The views of the three peaks of Annapurna were so magnificent, but equally amazing was walking along acient stone steps used by villagers who have lived here in this high mountains for centuries. We saw people plowing with water buffaloo, local brew being made, old women in colorful skirts and hand-embrodiered tops wearing beautiful beaded necklaces carrying heavy loads in baskets on top of their hears, and barefoot! We sat in the morning watching the sun turn the tops of Annapurna pink, and drank hot tea and ate momo's in a Tibetan teahouse at night. You can't help but feel special to be given this opportunity to visit this remote corner of the world, and Earthbound did a superb job in supplying us with a great guide, Narendra Timalsina, and a good route for us to take. I look forwrd to doing it again-I hope soon-and this time maybe go farther. I will aslo add that the rigors of the uphill climbing is quite a test of physical endurance if you are not used to backpacking-I'd advise you get in shape and you'll enjoy the trekking so much more!! Best of luck to all going to the mysterious and ancient Kathmandu--you will have a Friend in Rajan and Earthbound Exped.! when my luggage didn't show up right away, he was so helpful in assisting me with trying to locate my bags. It's good to have a friend in this part of the world, you can't go wrong with Rajan!"

I went to Buddha's birthplace, the Chitwan National Park, and a number of other out of the way places, many of which found me to be the only white guy around. Dug that. They are willing to work with you on everything: accommodations, meals, transportation, and anything you can imagine. Would highly recommend this company, and these two guys!!"

Thanks to Adventure Connexion I saw more than I hoped. Everything was very well organised. I booked my trip by email with Mr Baral. It was easy and smooth. I also met Mr RB. These 2 persons made my stay in Nepal very pleasant and flawless. The hotels that I stayed, chosen by the agency, were amazing. The guide provided by this agency, Mukesh, is very knowledgable and gave a lot of interesting information about the places we visited. The car driver, Shree, is a good professional. I felt always safe in a car. I saw the Everest thanks to this agency having arranged for a mountain flight for me. Adventure Connexion really takes care of their customers. I felt it all the time. Mr Baral called me to check whether all was OK, we had lunch in a nice local restaurant in Thamel, for me to taste the real local food. Mr RB treated me to a nice coffee when I mentioned that Nescafe coffee was not what I liked. When I was leaving I received gifts from them, a tea shirt, orange scarves, it was touching. The earthquake of April 2015 caused lots of damage, but in any case Nepal is such a beautiful country with friendly and hospitable people. I definitely recommend services of Adventure Connexion in Nepal. Thank you dear Kulendra and RB!"

Adventure Connexion had all of our permits, paperwork, travel logistics etc sorted out before we arrived which saved us DAYS of waiting in lines and planning. Whenever there were modifications necessary to our original plans (impassable roads, landslides, delays due to religious holidays, last minute decision to go to Chitwan etc), RB and his team made the necessary adjustments smoothly and seamlessly, so that every part of our trip was a pleasant experience . Small attention to details also mattered a lot: arriving at our teahouse at the end of every day to a steaming cup of tea, our bags already in our rooms, snacks before supper... Such a treat! Nepal is even more beautiful than I imagined: the scenery is breathtaking and the people will steal your heart with their kindness and generosity of spirit. They are always smiling, laughing, ever eager to please. The quality and variety of food along the circuit was also a pleasant surprise. The Adventure Connexion team went over and above when it came to accommodating a gluten allergy in our group. We were so pleased with our adventure and feel lucky to have been referred to RB and his guide team to walk us through our first trip to Nepal.

This is the third time a visit Nepal, and third time I am using the excellent service of Fanindra Dhamala , the owner and manager of Funny Nepal Treks. The service and help I get from him is outstanding. He organized and took care of everything. from the moment we landed in Nepal to the moment we got on the plane back, including transportation, hotels, internal flight, meals and accommodation during trek, and of course the excellent guide Ratna Wosti and porter Deep Simkhada, which were friendly and helpful. Fanindra really cares about his customers, he has personal responsibility to take care of his customers, keep them well and happy. He also takes responsibility over his own men who work with him. He is one of the reasons I keep coming back to Nepal.The ABC trek itself is a great trek, although not getting to high altitudes it is physically demanding (for me), and offers great views of the mountains , and gives a glimpse of the life in Nepali villages. Food was excellent and guest houses very nice. It was very enjoyable to meet people from all over the world and have a chat with them. I also would like to mention Kathmandu and Pokhara.Kathmandu is a populated city, busy markets shops and streets. Lots of traffic - pedestrians, bicycles, motor bikes, cars and rickshas on the streets. At Kathmandu we stayed at Samsara resort hotel. Very nice and quiet hotel in the middle of the Thamel.Pokhara on the other hand is a place to rest and relax, sit or walk on the lake side,with many shops, restaurants and hotels. We stayed there at Splendid view hotel, a very nice hotel.I guess I will be back for trekking. Thanks"

He has good knowledge of trails and mountains in our path. It was perfect timing for us to see the Himalayas as the weather was perfect for the hike. I was fortunate enough to get a very good hotel to stay even being a countryside the hotel was called buddha lodge. After a tiring hike of around 6 hours(with breaks and lunch), I had a peaceful night and got ready in perfect shape. Next day I got ready with good filling breakfast (fruit muesli and yogurt and pancakes). Then watching beautiful mountains along the hills was the spectacular view. With beautiful scenery and lots of spectacular mountains alongside the trails, it made me feel like I was in heaven. With all the queries, Ram served me well and had lots of chats about the tours, travels, and life, he is a fantastic guy with more than 15 years experience in mountaineering. I was taken to hotel country villa. The best hotel to for the scene and sunrise. I then went to climb the tower recommended by Ram. This place was so windy and I was taken to a small dinner house, there we had Nepalese traditional rum, made me feel very warm. We had lots of meat and then other foods. I was already full but again I went to the hotel and I was offered dinner. Lots of eating and fun talks with the most spectacular views sums up my trip to Chisapani-Nagarkot."

Right from the point when we were organising flights to Nepal, Fanindra was incredibly organised and speedy with his replies and advice and organised the perfect experience for us. We wanted a good mix of seeing Kathmandu itself, to some trekking in in the Annapurna region as well as a tour of Bhutan which Fanindra organised immaculately. On arrival we were made to feel so welcome, and part of the family and at every part of the trip helped with huge knowledge by our guide Uttam. It was great to spend a week in the company of someone (along with the excellent porter) who was so confident and friendly when showing us either Kathmandu or helping us trek through the Annapurna region.Our trip to Bhutan was also completely taken care of and easy to access with an excellent sister company used to provide the tour. We thoroughly recommend using this company to plan your trekking trip to Nepal and further, and will be using it ourselves again and will recommend it to our friends and family. Thank you Funny Treks!"

Finding one that is both affordable and a quality service can be tough and I feel incredibly fortunate that I found Funny Nepal. When I arrived in Kathmandu, I expected to be leaving for a trek about 4 days later -- plans changed however, and I found myself needing to organize a trek for the following day. With less than 24 hours to organize a 21 day trek to Everest Base Camp, I wasn't optimistic that I would find a trekking agency that could make it happen. The proprietors at Funny Nepal told me this would be no problem and handled the entire situation very professionally. Within an hour of sitting down to chat at Funny Nepal, I had a plane ticket booked for Lukla the following day and a guide arranged for the trip.My guide's name was Bishnu Lamicchane and if you book with Funny Nepal, I couldn't recommend a better guide for you to request. It's not easy spending 21 straight days with anyone, but after 21 days on the trail with Bishnu I found myself so sad that we would be parting ways. Bishnu is young (in his mid-20s), something which I greatly appreciated as a young traveler myself. Yet his age is deceptive -- Bishnu has nearly a decade of experience on all the major Himalayan trails and his expertise shows. Bishnu goes out of his way to explain everything on the hike that may be of interest, and if you have any questions about something he hadn't mentioned, he will always have an answer. After a few days, I made it a game to see if I could come up with a question about the trek/Himalayas/Nepal that he couldn't answer, and after 21 days I had yet to stump him. I found that Bishnu would always put the client first -- when we arrived at a teahouse, he always did everything in his power to assure that I was comfortable. My favorite part of traveling with him however, was the conversation. Bishnu is a great conversationalist with an impeccable grasp of English, and when you are spending several hours a day relaxing in a teahouse, having someone like Bishnu to speak with is just great. I only encountered minor medical issues on my trek, but Bishnu was capable of taking care of them all. I always felt that I was in safe and knowledgeable hands. Moreover, Bishnu was incredibly flexible as a guide -- I wanted to change the itinerary a bit during our trek and he accommodated without any problems. I've hiked with trekking companies all around the world and still I was blown away with my experience at Funny Nepal. I hope you have the opportunity to trek with them, and if you do, are lucky enough to get Bishnu for a guide!"

It was our (my girlfriend, Rachel and I) 1st time to Nepal and 1st time trekking overseas, and we must say Fanindra (owner of Funny Nepal) and his team were very responsive to our queries and requests. Prior the trip, Fanindra was prompt in replying to our emails and in arranging for a simple 3-day trek tour package (Chisapani/Nagarkot) and a 1-day Kathmandu city tour for us a week before we flew there. We were greeted by Ram, our trekking guide and Subash our driver at the airport who didn\u2019t complain about having to wait for us for over 2 hours due to our flight/baggage delay. On the 2nd day of the trek, we encountered hail just before we reached Nagarkot but Ram got us safely to cover. He didn\u2019t bring an umbrella, so it was lucky that my girlfriend and I have an umbrella each to shield all of us from the hail.Back in Kathmandu after the trek on the 4th day, we had Deepak (Fanindra\u2019s distant cousin) as our city guide who was not only amusing, but also really knowledgeable about the city\u2019s history.Finally, on the 5th and last day, just before we leave for the airport in the evening, we realised we left an umbrella and a pair of sunglasses at two separate shops. Without complaining, Ram and Subash brought us back to the two shops to get back our items before we rush to catch our flight back to Singapore.All in the all, the trip was good but could have been better if the sky wasn\u2019t so cloudy that it prevented us from seeing the supposedly superb mountainous view at Chisapani. While our guides may not have understood certain parts of our conversations, they made it up for being super polite and responsive to our requests. The only issue we have of Funny Nepal was of our arranged stay at Dorje Lakpa Hotel & Lodge at the end of the 1st day of our trek at Chisapani. There wasn\u2019t enough flow of water for shower even though we were told that there will be warm shower. We have not expected tip-top environment at the countryside but having an insect-prone room with no water and intermittent electricity had resulted in a pretty restless night for us at the Chisapani lodging. The food were also pretty overpriced for a countryside \u201chotel\u201d.The trip was a wonderful experience for us and we would still go for private tours from Funny Nepal Treks and Expedition should we ever return in future for trekking."

I arrived in Kathmandu with virtually no supplies and nothing arranged except for my flight and hotels in Pokhara and Kathmandu, which is where I met Fani. We hit it off right away and within an hour or two I\u2019d met my guide, Uttam, and paid for the trek. He even accepted the AU dollars I\u2019d brought and transferred the rest into NR for a very good rate which saved me a lot of hassle.The next day I flew to Pokhara and bought supplies while my guide, Uttam came by bus, and we set off the following morning. Pretty great timing considering it was last minute.The trek itself was utterly amazing and very highly recommended. We did it in 8 days, but I suggest allowing an extra day if you\u2019re not super fit as it is quite challenging for first time trekkers like myself.Uttam was very polite, patient and great company. He helped out in the kitchen at every place we went to and always served my tea and meals before himself. He can be a little shy and quiet spoken, but he made up for it with his attentiveness, positivity and encouragement.If anyone is worried about the impact of the earthquake or fuel crisis I can tell you first hand there\u2019s nothing to worry about. I saw almost no evidence there\u2019d ever been an earthquake in the areas I went to, and although the fuel crisis is ongoing it won\u2019t affect you except taxi fares will be a little higher... but once you see the queue\u2019s for fuel that stretch for blocks and blocks, you don\u2019t mind paying the extra.Nepali people are so warm and welcoming they treat you like an old friend they haven\u2019t seen in years. I was genuinely sad to leave and would go back tomorrow if I could.If you\u2019re thinking of visiting Nepal all I can say is GO, you won\u2019t be disappointed. Nepal desperately needs us to visit them as tourism is a big part of people\u2019s livelihood, and by staying away you\u2019re not only robbing yourself of an unforgettable experience, but also making things harder for a people who already have it pretty hard. And if you need to book a tour, I highly recommend Fani and his company."

This is a teahouse trek which can be done in sneakers if they have a sturdy sole (without heavy boots). No specialized gear other than a rain jacket is needed.It seems as most groups heading up to Namche Bazaar from Lukla use roughly the same time table, so there is peak \"traffic\" during a few hours every day. But if you are not on a tight time table it is possible to time the walk outside peak traffic. Doing that makes for a wonderful walk!For those of you who are 60+ like me, with old legs, some care must be taken. The final few hours leading up the Namche Bazaar is an ascent of more than 600 meters vertically speaking. It is easy to run out of 'fuel' here. But then again, a supportive guide like my guide Ratna can help with the pace."

A knowledgeable guide with good patience and friendly demeanour is an essential asset in what is ultimately a potentially dangerous and hostile environment.We were going with the intention of a self guided tour and I could not be happier that we changed our minds. From small comfortable matters such as phoning ahead to assure we had good rooms for the evening, stopping at good places to eat to the more important matters of doing the correct acclimatisation days and small hikes on those days to ready you for the altitude, bishnu had all bases covered.Our trip was cut short as despite the Ycorrect acclimatisation days, my wife and I both required emergency evacuation via helicopter because of altitude sickness. He recognised the symptoms in my wife very early and said he would not be happy with her going onwards or back down and I can tell you now as I have never feared for her well being so much in my life that I have never been so grateful as to ignore such things has the potential for a fatality. It is an incredible hike with phenomenal views but I can't emphasize enough that a good guide is an essential asset and I couldn't recommend bishnu any more. I will definately be returning to Nepal and he's the only person I would use for further guided hikes in what I class as one of the finest, most beautiful countries on the planet. "

Not knowing what Nepal would be like, we decided to go with a trekking agency to alleviate any stress around it and given the time we had, we opted for the Poon Hill Circuit with an added day to visit a hot spring. Uttam was assigned as our personal guide and he couldn't have done a better job at making our experience a great one. Trekking in Nepal was unlike any other backpacking we'd done before in that the teahouses provided great food, beds, hot showers and sometimes even internet! We would hike all day with Uttam showing us the way, stopping to point things out, sharing info about the Nepal way of life and chatting with us at pretty viewpoints in between. We learned so much from him. At mealtimes and in the evening, he would be pitching in in the teahouse kitchen since he loved to cook too and out would come one great meal after another. We did this for 5 nights and made lots of great memories. Every detail was taken care of and we just enjoyed ourselves. A rare backpacking experience for us! Thank you again Funny Nepal Treks!"

The Hotel Panda was great for our first day to settle in. The following morning we set out with our amazing guide Ram. He took us on a trek up to the mountain village of chisapani in the Kathmandu valley. After a comfortable nights stay we headed to Nargakot. The scenery in the Kathmandu valley is beautiful. Your not guaranteed a view of the Himalayas because that really is weather dependent but the 2 day trek will leave you wanting more. It has certainly captured me and I will be returning to take on the Everest Base camp trek.Ram our guide looked after our party of 4 extremely well. Always staying with our weakest walker and keeping a good eye on the lead. His local knowledge and English is excellent. On returning to Kathmandu we were taken on a day tour of the points of interest in the city. Again our tour guide was wonderful. Great English and a mountain of knowledge.Our experience of Funny Nepal Treks was absolutely fantastic. I did notice so many agents operating in Kathmandu. Some cheaper some more expensive. I can only comment on our experience. I feel we paid a very good price for all transfers, 4 nights good accommodation, 4 breakfasts, 2 lunches, 2 dinners, 2 amazing days trekking, a day tour of Kathmandu and 2 amazing guides.

After getting a couple competing price quotes and reading reviews online we decided to go with Funny. From start to finish our guide Uttam was great! He was extremely attentive to our needs and was very sensitive to how we felt when we were tired or energized. He knew when to encourage us and when we needed to slow down. Uttam always went above and beyond as Guide. A constant companion, he helped us find trekking gear, played cards with us, helped carried my wife's bag for a few hours, took us out for dinner, drinks, the list goes on. We will remember the time we spent in the Himalayas for the rest of our lives. Glad we were able to see this amazing landscape with a very professional guide. I hope to come back to Nepal soon, and book another hike with our new friend Uttam!"

            "review": "Best trekking company in Nepal!. My husband and I celebrated our one-year anniversary (and a belated honeymoon!) the first few weeks of November this year in Nepal. We had received a recommendation from a friend about Funny Nepal Treks. We are extremely happy we took that recommendation - we could not have had a better time! Our original plan was to go to Nepal in April, 2015, but we had to change the plan due to health issues. Fanindra, the owner of Funny Nepal Treks, was extremely understanding and had no problem with us having to change the dates. Soon after that, Nepal experienced the terrible earthquake that devastated many areas and killed thousands. Unfortunately, this deterred many people from going to Nepal at all. Canceling a trip for this reason would be a big mistake. The country is MORE than ready to receive trekkers and tourists, and needs tourism for its livelihood. In addition, the country has been hit recently with a devastating fuel crisis due to political conflicts with India. These setbacks have dealt a severe blow to the tourism industry. But from firsthand experience, we can say that there is absolutely NO REASON to skip Nepal right now, especially if you are in the capable hands of Funny Nepal Treks. At no point did we ever feel that the country was unsafe or unequipped to handle tourism. In fact, Nepalis (especially the employees at Funny Nepal Treks) go above and beyond to take care of visitors and will do anything to make them feel comfortable and happy. Nepal is 100% safe and ready to accept tourists, and I can say with confidence that I would go back tomorrow if I could.My husband and I did the Annapurna Base Camp trek, which took 9 days. We also went to Chitwan National Park for 2.5 days. The rest of the time was spent in Kathmandu and/or Pokhara. Our guide for the trip was Uttam, and our porter was Kiran. The two of them were simply the best. They were kind, patient, helpful, generous and so much fun to be around! Not only were they excellent guides, they became our true friends. Having done this trek many, many times, Uttam and Kiran knew exactly which places to go - when and where to stop for lunch each day, how fast or slow we could/should go in order to reach our destinations on time, etc. They knew which guest houses had the best food and most comfortable accommodations, and which places to avoid (one guest house we walked by was specifically passed over as one of our guides had some bad food there once and didn't want to take his clients there again!) We couldn't have done the trip without Uttam and Kiran, and we wouldn't have wanted to do it without them!The only complaint I had about the trip was the condition of many of the elephants in Chitwan. Most of them are held in captivity and owned by the local hotels, who keep them chained to posts for the majority of the day. This was very upsetting to see. Oftentimes, tourists don't care about this and they choose to ride the elephants on the elephant safaris that the hotels lead. We, however, chose to take a Jeep safari. We did not want to participate in the cruel act of piling six people on top of an elephant and making him or her traipse into the jungle for our pleasure. In fact, I would discourage anyone from doing this as it only contributes to the cruel treatment of these animals, who should not be chained in this way for any portion of the day, let alone all of it. There is some effort being made to unchain them and keep them in pens where they can roam freely - but not nearly enough of the elephants in Chitwan are kept this way. My hope is that soon all the elephants will be unchained and kept in pens instead.Kathmandu is a very vibrant, albeit chaotic and somewhat dirty city. Pokhara is a bit cleaner and less chaotic, though still has a similar energy. I would recommend doing most of your shopping for gifts in Pokhara, though you can buy commodity items like t-shirts in Kathmandu. The food in every part of the country was absolutely superb and Dal Bhat became our favorite dish. We miss it terribly.The people of Nepal are some of the kindest and most hospitable people we have ever met in all of our global travels. We loved the country so much that we are already planning a return trip - and you can bet that our guides will be from Funny Nepal Treks!"

Email communication prior to the trip was timely and detailed; and everything went as much to plan as it could (bearing in mind hiccups always occur in places like Nepal, so you want to arrive with an ability to go with the flow).I had a great guide, Dipak Sigdel; and was well looked after from arrival to departure. Highly recommend.ps I wrote a much longer and more detailed review of the entire circuit and being in Nepal in general - but Trip Advisor won't publish yet it as I cut and pasted the review from myself to myself (new account to old account, once I realized I had two accounts that is), and it looks like I copied it from another. Hopefully they sort it out. In the meantime, happy to answer any questions - for I did travel as a solo female hike, post earthquake, during the fuel crisis --> and I would do it again, it was that good."

This was our second trip organized by Fanindra Dhamala of Funny Nepal trekking.We were coming back from Lhasa by road and were planning a few days of rest in Bakthapur before continuing our trip. As before Fanindra had organized everything to perfection and we were very happy by our visit to Tibet which had been a long time dream. Our favorite driver, Suvash, was waiting for us at the \"Friendship Bridge\" border.Within an hour the earthquake struck. We were on the road. The car was jostled violently. Suvash stopped the car immediately and we waited for the shaking to stop.From that moment until we left the country several days later, both Fanindra and Suvash were there for us. During the drive to Bakhtapur that day, when we had to stop several times because of land and rock slides, Suvash was a picture of calm at all time even though he must have been very worried for his family in Kathmandu. He only left us when he was sure we were safe in our hotel that looked solid and had not suffer damage. As soon as it was possible Fanindra contacted us and also reassured our family in the US that we were safe. He came to take us back to Kathmandu and helped us get to a safe hotel (the one we had booked had been damaged and was closed) and also get tickets to fly out. We left Nepal with a heavy heart and a lot of gratitude toward Fanindra and Suvash. We are planning our next trip there with them."

When you come to this part of the world and try your best to use local tour operators, many times you are disappointed. For while they do mean you well, most of times local tour operators aren't used to services or attentiveness needed and are familiar to travellers from developed countries. Things could move very slow, itineraries could not be kept, extra charges could apply, and the lack of English could make communicating a bit of problem as well. But Funny surprised me right from the get-go, with his excellent English, understanding of my travel needs and desire, and was very clear on things I wanted to know and wanted to do. More than anything, he was fast. If I wanted something, he took care of it right away. No waiting around. A rare feat in this part of the world. When I go back to Nepal this is the guy I'm going to contact upon. He might not be the cheapest tour operator around, but definitely most reliable. Highly recommended."

It was our third trek in the past 18 months with this agency, and the service of both Fani and our guide was yet again excellent.Upon arrival in Kathmandu on 1 January, we were debating between the Annapurna circuit trek and the EBC/Gokyo trek. Fani urged us to do the latter trek, but to walk from Jiri or Shivalaya instead of flying to Lukla. We are delighted that we followed his advice, as our 22-day trek from Shivalaya to Gokyo Ri, EBC and Kala Pattar exceeded our expectations in every way.And, as on our two previous treks with Funny Nepal, Fani was a consummate professional. He patiently answered all of our questions, gave us a lot of latitude to set our own trekking schedule, and promptly answered all of the texts we sent him from the trail. And though we had no health problems and suffered no altitude sickness, I am confident that, had we required evacuation by helicopter, Fani would have worked with our insurance company to aid us.Our guide, Mr. Phurwa Sherpa, was very familiar with the trail from Shivalaya to Lukla, as well as the rest of the route. He was extremely kind and conscientious, and even helped me attach my crampons to my boots without my asking. Nothing was too much trouble for him. He also helped cook many of our meals at the lodges and ensured that the chef honored all of our dietary special requests.We give Funny Nepal our highest recommendation, and will certainly book with them again. Trek with confidence: use Funny Nepal."

Also in terms of the price/performance ratio is the company a good choice. We went this time in the off-season time Deventer for trekking to the Annapurna Base Camp. It was no problem with the weather and it was nice because there were not to many tourists on the treks. Our guide Bishnu was a young, very experienced and funny guide.

I was a happy wanderer on a 9 day Annapurna Base Camp trek at the end of September with my guide, Dipak. Of course, he smoothed the organisation of transfers, accommodation, food and much else. More importantly, he was a good-natured, calm companion with quiet good humour and allowed me to feel connected to the local Nepali we met along the way. I would definitely recommend Funny Nepal Treks - Fani is helpful, unhurried and professional and has clearly being running his business in this way for a long time. Go, trek, enjoy!"

First we were a bit sceptical because everything seemed too arranged but we ended up with quite a good offer in our eyes. Our guide \"Ram\" was a lovely guy. His English was a bit limited but sufficient to communicate. Everything was well organized. On the trekking we met another guide from the same company \"Bishnu\" who was really nice, too and we had a great time all together. The only thing was that we found out later that we could have payed quite a bit less negotiating a bit harder. A guide was not absolutely necessary for the Poon Hill Trek but it was awesome to have a local person with us and we would not want to miss this adventure."

Nevertheless we enjoyed the companion of our guide(Bashu) and porters(Toran,Bimal) and they were excellent!Yesterday was the last day at Kathmandu and hopefully one day we will return and attempt Annapurna Circuit. *grin*...

The trek was easy as promised by Fani, to accommodate my travel buddy who was recovering from an injured foot. We're especially pleased with the guide assigned to us - Babin was such a lovely company, attentive to our needs and knowledgeable about the area. He made sure we were comfortable from start to finish. We drove to Bhaktapur to begin our hike. As we climbed higher, we were rewarded with breathtaking sceneries. Patchwork of paddy fields down below in the valley, above us blue skies, and all around, magnificent mountains albeit in the distance and mostly obscured by the clouds. We passed several little villages and village folks going about their daily life, tending to their goats, drying maize in the sun. Note to self: must bring sweets for the children next time around. In Nagarkot, go up to The Tea House for a scrumptious meal of briyiani rice and masala papad. Absolutely to-die for! Thanks Fani, and Thanks Babin for making this a fantastic and an unforgettable trip for Farhan and I. We shall be back someday soon, that's a promise!"

Funny Nepal organised every day we had in Nepal including rafting down the Kali Gandaki with the best company in Nepal (Swissa) for 3 days/2 nights which was amazing, then we did a 6 day/5 night trek in Annapurna including Poon Hill and then to Chitwan for the safari and back to Kathmandu. Everything went smoothly including the hotels in between the tours. The trek was amazing! Our guide was called Uttam and he was great company and a responsible guide for me and my boyfriend. He was patient and understanding throughout especially when I was ill. At the start of the trek we were also accompanied by Uttam's brother Ashok who was also great and his client Chris. We hope to keep in touch with both Uttam and Ashok. We had a great time and would definitely love to go back to Nepal and do it all again."

Well, Funny Nepal Treks is known for it's excellence with foreign entities, the high standard of their speaking language is a definite plus. This is the best opportunity to not only visit the famous places of Nepal, but also endurance your fun and gain a memorable experience, which you can remember for the rest of your life.

Fanindra (the company owner) was very professional in his responses to emails we sent during the planning stages. He always replied very quickly and provided practical answers to our questions and helped us to plan the itinerary to our individual requests. The costs suited our budget and were far cheaper than the UK based trekking companies. Once we arrived in Nepal the experience was equally excellent. We were picked up at the airport and taken to the office to finalise plans with Fanindra personally. We met our guide the next day and were off on our trek. The trekking was spectacular, the best we have done! Basu our guide was very friendly and spoke good English; he helped us a lot on the trek. He always new the best lodges to stay at and got us a good deal for food & accommodation. He knew the best view points for photography. Basu did a great job of leading us on the trek, he was happy for us to stop to take pictures and rest, but he also knew when to motivate us to make sure we stayed safe on the mountain, met our targets and finished the day before dark. We developed mild altitude sickness at one point during the trek and Basu dealt with the situation professionally and in his usual calm manner. We descended 300m the next morning, rested that day and then did a useful acclimatisation trek the next day (which sorted us out for the rest of the trek), we were then able to continue with our trek without problems. Back in Kathmandu, Fanindra organised a great 2-day sightseeing tour for us and took us out for dinner to celebrate the safe & successful completion of our trek, which was a nice touch at the end of a great trip!We would thoroughly recommend Funny Treks Nepal and hope to trek with them again in the future.

I stayed in Karma Hotel in Thamel, Kathmandu and got in contact with Fani, the owner of Funny Nepal Treks. He informed me about the possibilities and do's and don'ts. After booking I had a wonderful experience in the National Park. Everything was arranged carefully from the beginning untill end of the trip. Back in Kathmandu, I decided to also book my trekking with Fani, because the good experience in Chitwan. I wanted to walk the Annapurna circuit. Fani explained me about the trekking, the gear needed, the risks, the ins and outs and I was confident to go! He arranged a guide/porter and also a (very warm, thank you!) sleeping back and some walking sticks. I wished to do the trekking in a group, but when this was not possible, I decided to go alone with the guide/porter. In advance I was a little bit worried about spending almost three weeks with one person, but this was not necessary at all, we met a lot of other people on the way and had very much fun. I did the trekking with Binod as my guide/porter. A polite, very kind, warm, responsible and also very funny person. He managed to give me enough space and let me have my own experience, but was always there when I wanted to ask something and took care when I needed something. Back in Kathmandu, when his job was already finished, Binod was still involved and so kind to show me some beautiful places. My experience with Funny Nepal Treks was great! I can recommend everyone who wants to receive some help with organizing their trips in Nepal to go talk to Fani. He has very experienced and kind people working for him. They do not only know a lot about Nepal, it's culture and nature, but also express that they love their job and are driven to give tourists the best experience. Thank you Fani and Binod! I wish you all the best! Isabel"

Me and my girlfriend have chosen Funny Nepal based on positive trip advisor reviews - we had to make a quick decision regarding our holidays but definitely we didn't get disappointed with our choice :) Mt.Everest Panorama trek with Funny Nepal was a fantastic experience which provided us with amazing views trekking up the valley towards Tengboche (4000m) which was the highest point of our journey to get a great view of Mt.Everest in the distance. We had a good guide called Dipak always trying to meet our extra demands. We were also accompanied with a porter Raj who was really friendly and humble man carrying all our luggage throughout the whole duration of the trek. Clear sky and perfect visibility in November enabled us to see fantastic panoramas of the mountains and peaks around. Highly recommend this trek for those with less days to spend in Nepal and intention to see the Mt. Everest with your own eyes once in your life. Definitely would love to go back and explore more of this beautiful country in the future.Big thank you to Funny Nepal - especially Dipak, Raj and Fanindra to make this trip successful!You are all great and wish you all the best in the future :)Lubo & Julia P.S: Just one recommendation for the future treks - tour guide should be provided by the company with basic First Aid Kit at all times :)"

My friend and I were originally planning to trek to EBC without a guide but since we had no prior experience in the Nepal Everest Region and very little hiking experience we decided to hire a guide. We are so happy with Funny Nepal and our guide, Bishnu, that it was definitely worth it. Since we had 17 days available to trek to EBC, Fani recommended we trek to EBC via Gokyo and Chola Pass and we are happy to have gone the \"longer way\" to EBC. Bishnu exceeded my expectations as a guide. He is very mature, professional, and extremely knowledgeable about the Everest Region. He also has been a guide for several years that he knows many other guides from other agencies as well as owners/managers of lodges in the villages along the trek. His connections came in handy when making nightly lodging arrangements as well as discussing trekking weather/logistics with other guides as they were coming down from the trek and we were going up. There were times when I was nervous about the day's trek and he reassured me that we would be fine with a detailed plan of everything we would do and experience that day. He took care of the details of the trek that my friend and I didn't have to worry about such as handling all the checkpoints along the trek, figuring out what lodge we would stay at every evening, ordering our meals at the lodges, and ensuring we had enough blankets to stay warm every night. He would also ask us regularly how were were doing, if we were feeling okay, if we needed anything, etc. He certainly was interested in our safety and well being. He was also very patient with us as we walked slower than he did and we stopped regularly to take pictures-he did not mind. I highly recommend Funny Nepal Treks as a trekking agency and Bishnu as a guide in the Everest Region."

My friend and I just returned from a simply perfect 17 day trek with Funny Nepal guide Bishnu to Gokyo, over the Cho La Pass, and on to EBC and Kala Pattar. Upon arriving in Kathmandu a few days before our trek to find an agency, I chose Funny Nepal based off of other TripAdvisor comments. Not only was Fani completely professional and knowledgable, but he was helpful and flexible with our timeline. We couldn't have been paired with a better guide in Bishnu, who adjusted his rhythm and made our trip countless times better than it could have been, had we trekked on our own. I would highly recommend Funny Nepal for any sort of trekking or organized trip in Nepal. Thank you Funny Nepal for this experience!"

When my buddy and I arrived in Kathmandu a few days earlier than anticipated, we asked the owner of the hotel we were staying at (The Fuji Hotel, which was excellent), for suggestions. He said his good friend, named \"Funny\", ran a top-notch trekking and expedition company, so we set up a meeting later that day. Funny was great. Not only is he well-experienced and very knowledgeable, he's friendly, personable and speaks excellent English. Within 15 minutes of meeting Funny, we had every detail of our Temple tours around Kathmandu, Mount Everest Flight, and 2-day/2-night trek to Chisapani and Nagarkot all set up. All we needed now was some cold-weather gear for our trek, which Funny helped us acquire as well. It was great to not have to figure out all of the details - transportation, hotels, schedules, flights... they were all taken care of so we could focus our energy on enjoying Nepal. Our driver, Subash, was courteous, friendly and always on time. The flight to Mount Everest was awesome! Our Guide and Porter for our trek into Chisapani and Nagarkot were Uttam and Babin. Both Uttam and Babin were professional, knowledgeable, very friendly and spoke excellent English. The trek into Chisapani from Kathmandu on day one was a good challenge, and I must say, the views and fresh mountain air were spectacular! We enjoyed the rich conversations with Uttam and Babin about Nepal's people, culture, geography, politics and religions - they were both extremely well versed in nearly all subject matter, which made conversation effortless. Their passion for their country was delightful, and we learned a lot about trekking, the Himalayas and even the wildlife that lives there. After a great night's rest in Chisapani, and then enjoying a beautiful sunrise view from our hotel window the next morning, we began day two of our trek to Nagarkot. Walking nearly parallel to the Himalayas meant that we always had breathtaking views waiting for us at every turn. Uttam and Babin always knew where the best places to eat and drink were on our journey so that we stayed fueled and hydrated. When we arrived in Nagarkot, the views from this hotel were even more spectacular than in Chisapani (which we didn't think was possible). All-in-all, our time in Kathmandu was top-notch, thanks to Funny, Subash, Uttam and Babin. (Funny, Subash, Uttam and Babin - if you're reading this, thank you again so very much. Our time with you guys was the highlight of our entire 18 days through India and Nepal! Your service rocks!!!)"

My girlfriend and I hired Bishnu as our guide for the Gosainkunda trek, and were delighted with his service.We found Funny Nepal by sheer good luck; we were walk-in customers. After having visited numerous other trekking agencies, it was obvious to us that Funny Nepal -- and especially the manager, Mr. Fanindra -- was far superior to the competition. We had lots of questions, and Mr. Fanindra gladly answered them all. And he promptly replied to all of our phone calls, text messages and emails. In short, he was extremely professional.We chose Bishnu as our guide because he does not smoke or drink, is gentle and polite, and knows the trails inside out. Throughout the trek, he catered to our every whim, never complained, and did his utmost to ensure our comfort.While on the trail, we met numerous other trekkers whose guides turned out to be nightmares: rude, glued to their phones, drinkers, and nags. We were so fortunate to have no such problems with Bishnu. He is a saint!We highly recommend booking your trek with Funny Nepal. But please book in advance if you'd like Bishnu as your guide; he is very popular."

My husband and I had decided to splurge for our 45th anniversary and trekking was not an option!We contacted several companies by email and decided to use Funny Nepal treks because of Mr. Fanindra Dhamala always prompt and detailed answers to all our questions.Upon our arrival in Kathmandu we met Mr. Dhamala and he explained in details what the helicopter tour entails. For close to 4 hours we would fly first to Lukla then on to Everest base camp and after we would land at Mt Everest hotel for breakfast before returning to Kathmandu. Of course all that was weather permitting and we had a window of a few days. On the first day we were able to fly with perfect weather and no wind. Mr. Dhamala's young son came with us and he was the perfect companion for the trip. It was an unbelievable experience leaving the smog of Kathmandu behind and seeing the Himalayas come closer and closer. We loved every seconds of it. During our stop at the hotel we met a few locals and enjoyed coffee with Mt Everest right in front of us. We are seasoned world travelers but this was THE trip to remember! So ok: it is expensive but my husband and I can enthusiastically say that it was worth every cents. Thanks to Mr. Dhamala's attention to details we enjoyed the excursion of a lifetime.Finally a word about altitude: we live all year around at 2500 meters and even though it is \"baby mountain\" compared to the Himalayas, this probably provided us with a rapid acclimatization and neither felt any negative effect. We have asked Mr. Dhamala to organize a few other tours (without helicopter unfortunately...) and we will report on those later. But after our experience with the helicopter ride we can recommend Funny Nepal Treks as an excellent company."

Fanindra was extremely helpful and happily answered our many questions in the months leading up to the trip. The trek was amazing - beautiful scenery all the way up to Annapurna Base Camp. We initially considered doing this walk unguided, but we were extremely glad that we didn't. It certainly would have been possible, but nowhere near as enjoyable. Our guide, Hari, and porter, Debraj, were fabulous. They had exceptional local knowledge of the area, used their experience to guide us through managing the altitude appropriately, and helped us make it through some of the more physically challenging parts of the trail, such as river crossings. In addition, they were simply great company - we spent many enjoyable hours with them discussing local culture and customs, trying local food and learning the finer points of various card games in the evenings. We could not recommend Hari, Deb and Funny Nepal highly enough."

I am a slow trekker and he let me have plenty of rest and let me trek at my own pace. Encouraging me to go on when I feel like giving up. In between the trek, he suggested I take a day rest before carry on so that I can recover from the aching muscle and kneel pain. He prove to be right and I could continue the trek in a better health condition. I also made changes to the itinerary during the trip and Bashu was able to accommodate my requests without raising his eyebrow. He ensure all arrangements are made without problem.

Having them with us enhanced the experience so much as they know all the ins and outs of the circuit, the best routes/places to visit and are so flexible and attentive to meet your needs. They even helped us get the best prices whenever we needed to buy something for/on the trek. We highly recommend them both!! There is no better way to experience the Annapurna Circuit and Nepal than with Hari and Devraj as your guides (and porter), I think! We have such fond memories of our time in Nepal with them, and they really felt like family by the end of the trek. Fanindra was also so great to meet and work with - so patient, knowledgeable and very accommodating. Overall just an incredible experience!(PS: our only recommendation would be to try and get some small/light down jackets and sleeping bags to help lighten your load when you trek!)"

Phani met us at Karma Hotel in the Thamel of Kathmandu on the first day of our arrival and we went for a trek in the beautiful and quiet national park of Langtang only two days after. We found out on the way that our bags were so heavy that it took out a part of our pleasure, and Bishnu, our guide now friend, proposed himself to help us and finally carried one of our bags during all the trek!! Bishnu and our agency had to face our changes of mind: we were supposed to do another trek, more difficult, and realised it was going to be too hard for us. Instead, we chose another trek, the Taman heritage trail, which was in the end our favourite one, and got the total duration of our trek shorter. The agency made it really easy and found us good accomodations. We so much loved the experience of trekking with Bishnu that we decided to return on another trek just one day after the return to Kathmandu. Bishnu has so many knowledge about the culture of the villages and about the mountain that it was really fulfilling walking with him. Plus, he made it always easier when we had difficulties hiking. And thanks to him we had close contacts with the local population, as he knows very well the people from the mountain! One more great quality of Bishnu is that he's a great cook and often helps the didis in the kitchen. It was part of the experience seeing the cooking process, and we were able to do it thanks to Bishnu. At the end of our trek, one of us had a health problem and we had to be evacuated by helicopter: the agency arranged all of the transportation and arrival at the hospital and Bishnu was present during all the time, taking great care of us. We felt relieved being taken in charge like that at this moment. Finally, we recommend this agency and Bishnu as a guide especially because of their kindness and careness."

I didn't have a guide who could tell me where I was going to get the best views, which tea house was the most unique, and just make the overall experience more enjoyable and authentic. On my return visit to Nepal, I went to do the Annapurna circuit with a few friends. We didn't plan on getting a guide but when we got to our hotel we were introduced to Fani, Funny Nepal Treks managing director. We explained to him that we were not sure if we were going to get a guide but told he we would come talk with him. Right from the beginning we decided we wanted to trek with his company. He was very genuine and employs only the best guides he introduced us to our guide, Binod, and we immidiately bonded. He was a shy, young, knowledgeable guide who helped us with everything. Trekkinng with a guide comes with so many benefits that I did not realize before we started. Binod would always make sure the food we ordered was fresh, prepared fast, and would tell us if we were ordering something a little bit funky. This trekking company made our experience all the better. My other friends also wrote reviews because we enjoyed it so much so don't think that everyone runs into these problems, but good thing we had a trekking company because we ran into a bad situation. One of my friends and I got frostbite on the day of the pass. There is nothing that Binod could have done to help us prevent this, we just got unlucky. The next morning as soon as we told him our feet were swollen, he took a look at them and immidiately called Fani back in Kathmandu. I was surprised by how quickly we were evacuated via helicopter. I can say that my frostbite situation would have been much much much more serious if it wasn't for Binod. I will be forever grateful to these two men and will never forget their compassion and professionalism. I would highly recommend trekking with Funny Nepal and I would also recommend requesting Binod as your guide. I hope this helps and have a great trek!"

The staff at our hotel introduced us to Fani and we decided go with him due to the chance of bad weather and our inexperience trekking. In hindsight, this was a very good decision. We had a storm come through leaving 4 feet of fresh snow the week before the pass. Several of the places our guidebook suggested that we stop were closed. Our guide, Binod, would call ahead and schedule our stops, so this was never an issue for us. He knew the areas very well, so we generally stayed at the nicer/more fun places. He would also talk to the hotel staff and take our food orders for us, which faciliated and expedited the process tremendously when the few remaining hotels near the pass got crowded. After the pass, 2 of my friends got helicoptered out due to frostbite concerns. Fani arranged the entire thing and took great care of them while they were in the hospital. Beyond the logistics, our guide was a great person to have around. He knew all the scenic areas and shortcuts along the way. He knew great places to stop for tea and introduced us to very good food that we would not have ordered otherwise. All in all, having a guide allowed for a better experience and I would highly recommend setting up a trek through Funny Nepal to any family members or friends interested in Hiking in Nepal."

We came to Nepal expecting to do the Annapurna Circuit in February without a guide, but came to realize that the pass was snowbound and dangerous to cross. We decided to get a guide - Binod Dhamala- to take us through the trek. We had a relatively short timeline (14 days) to complete the circuit, and both Fanindra Dhamala (Managing Director) and Binod sat us down and went through our schedule t make sure that the days worked out. We immediately felt a big sense of relief having Fanindra (Fani) and Binod as resource for our trek. We set out on our adventure, and really enjoyed the first 5 or 6 days. Upon reaching Manang, we encountered a big snowstorm that forced us to spend 3 nights there instead of 2. We had to make some adjustment to our schedule, but it was no problem as Binod knew where would be best to cut out a day without missing anything spectacular. The day we left Manang, our group was extremely happy that we had a guide, as there was absolutely no trail to guide us to Yak Kharta. I can safely say that there was absolutely NO way we would have continued our trek in the conditions that day if we had gone solo. We pressed on, and joined up with a few other guided groups. Another great benefit of having a guide is that they will ensure your food is made fresh and fast with good ingredients- we saw a few unguided groups who waited 3 hours for dinner after a big day of trekking. Pass day came, and once again there was no trail and we were trudging through snow. Binod was at the front of the pack for most of the day, carving out a trail in waist-deep snow so the people behind. After we finished the pass (15 hours) we spent the night in the nearest town. Our group of 4 realized that 2 of us had gotten frostbite. Here is where we were most grateful...Funny Nepal sent a helicopter to the town to pick the two up. Fani arranged everything and really took care of the injured guys. I was among the 2 who luckily did not get frostbite. Binod kept us going and our spirits up as we continued the trek. He was also able to update us on the condition of the guys as well. He got us back to Kathmandu quickly, but we did not feel as though we missed anything on the trek. We had to take a few jeeps, but we definitely saw the most spectacular parts of the back side of the trek. We would have been deflated and lost without a guide. In conclusion, I would absolutely say that this company can provide your group and loved ones back home with a sense of peace and security. This company really does care about your safety and also your trekking experience. I highly recommend Funny Nepal for any adventure in Nepal."

It was also important to me that the company was affiliated with TAAN (Trekking Agents Association of Nepal) and that the trekking company provides for insurance and the other needs of the guides working for them - both of which are true for Funny Nepal.A couple weeks later, I returned to that same office thrilled with my experience. Our guide, Hari, was not only an incredible guide but also a really fantastic person. Throughout the trek, he made sure we had what we needed and that we stayed healthy and safe. Hari speaks excellent english and is a lot of fun to be around. I'm sure Funny Nepal has a lot of great guides but you should consider yourself especially lucky if you can get Hari.

In a new country the biggest need was to feel safe and be pointed in the right direction and with Fani, our Guide Indrha, and our two porters Dib and Kiran, we were looked after every single step of the way (and there were MANY steps!) Their combined knowledge of the country, people, food and wildlife is exceptional.At every moment our pace, safety and well being were being attended to, far above any beyond any expectations and I cannot thank them enough for this. Our most precious memories of our trek were enjoying fresh mountain air, sunrise and sunset, and hearty laughs around the dinner table with a game of cards and some fine Dal Bhat food (the very best and the staple diet of Nepal) with our guide and porters.Even when circumstances beyond Fani\u2019s control occurred which resulted in our request to change our itinerary at short notice, all it took was a quick email or phone call and he had it sorted in a flash. Trust worthy, honest, friendly and above all 100% reliable \u2013 what more can you ask for. Leaves you time to enjoy what you travelled there for \u2013 to enjoy a friendly and beautiful country. My wife, being a nurse, even wanted to take an unscheduled trip to a local hospital to look at the health system and Fani was able to arrange this with a driver instantly \u2013 so even non-touristy activities can be catered to.If you are reading this and debating a trip to Nepal, or debating which company to travel with \u2013 debate no more.

Our guide was so patient and kind, ensuring we had everything we needed at all times and took extra care of my husband who has a chest condition and struggled with some of the steep climbs. All hiking was done at our pace and the scenery was breath taking! They were happy to stop when we needed to and continue on when we were ready. We also had two porters to carry our bags who along with our guide were really interesting people who we got to know over the hike and ended most evenings laughing with/at each other over a game of cards and some fresh Nepalese food. I cannot speak highly enough of them. It was during our stay near the Chitwan National Park that we realised just how great Funny Nepal Treks are \u2013 We were so disappointed at the place we were staying \u2013 Finindra had wanted us to stay inside the park but the government had closed all the accommodation inside before we came so we were moved to Tigerland Safari. It was apparent on arrival once we saw the activity schedule of just 4 hours a day that this was not the place we had hoped for. A quick email to Fanindra and we were taken to a beautiful hotel in the hills above Katmandu a day earlier than planned where we enjoyed our time far more. I was amazed that he was able to change our plans at such short notice \u2013 he made our honeymoon so special. I work as a nurse in the UK and was really interested to see the Nepal hospitals. Fanindra arranged this for me, allowing me to see a hospital ward and donate some supplies that I had left over from our hiking trip. Back at the office Fanindra checked in with us that everything had gone well and we hadn\u2019t been sick at all. We hadn\u2019t. The food during the hiking was some of the best we\u2019d had during our stay and we had enjoyed every moment that his staff had looked after us. He explained that one of his guests had become ill in the hills and he had had to arrange for a helicopter to collect him to take him for a night in hospital. This is the sort of peace of mind that you need whilst travelling in a foreign country \u2013 someone is looking out for you and can take care of any difficult situation. Fanindra is fluent in English and Nepali ensuring that things run smoothly. He answers emails promptly and is always at the end of a phone. Fanindra and his team even gave us parting gifts \u2013 what a fabulous company!I highly recommend Funny Nepal Treks for all your travel needs in Nepal. They go out of their way to ensure that guests enjoy a personal experience catered to their individual needs and operate on a safe, professional level. I hope to travel with them again shortly."

The entire team, but especially Fanindra (Fani), made for an unforgettable experience. With limited time in Nepal, we knew trekking would not be an option this trip. Fani's personal attention to our time schedule and our wish list produced a flawless tour that surpassed every expectation. He even took the time to meet us at the airport upon our arrival in Kathmandu and knew us by name, evidencing his strong desire for customer service and the personal touch that he includes for every party that visits.Even if time is limited, Mt. Everest should be on everyone's must see list while in Nepal. Rather than a fly-over, Fani coordinated a personal helicopter tour for us. The views over the valley are stunning, but there is nothing compared to the feeling of landing on the mountain and experiencing the serenity of the Himalayas from the ground. It's worth the time and expense for this option as it will be hard to top this experience in future trips.Every detail was well planned and coordinated flawlessly. We'll definitely use Funny Nepal Treks & Expedition for our next trip to Nepal. We'll just make sure to give ourselves more time!"

When I visited Kathmandu, I found it very difficult to find a decent travel adviser, There were many tour companies in every corner advertised with promises about great facilities. These numbers were overwhelming so I decided phoned my siblings in the UK in hope of a recommendation of a good company as they were visiting Nepal last year. I was not disappointed when took my sister's advice and arranged a meeting with Fani, he was more than I could hope for in my time of need. Our meeting was brief, full of information and Fani proved exactly who I was looking for.My experience with Funny Nepal Treks has been very fulfilling. The staff were very friendly, professional and experienced. What pleased me the most was the fact that their amazing service required very reasonable amount of money, considering the excellent quality of their services.They provided extensive knowledge and facts of areas around Nepal, I particularly enjoyed the mountain treks, city tours and the safari tour in Chitwan. I am very glad of my decision about choosing Funny Nepal Treks to guide me around Nepal, It enhanced my visit to Nepal completely. I highly recommend this excellent facility with Funny Nepal Treks, as I am sure that those who decide to choose Funny Nepal Treks will be completely dazzled by their facilities."

He took really good care of us and made accommodations for my aged in-laws and infants needs. He also made sure that we went on good treks which of course were result of his spontaneous thinking and our constant nagging for adventure. My only gripe was with our driver but I was told that most drivers in Nepal are such. Although i would surely want to point out that the drive drove very very well.

POSITIVES: Fani is extremely personable and makes you very welcome in Kathmandu - he even picked me up at the airport and took me to dinner on the first night. You can completely rely that the service you have agreed to will be reliable, comprehensive and will not scimp on anything. My guide, Binod, was excellent. Good English, thoroughly professional, considerate and kind. It is, of course, far cheaper to organise your own trek (which is quite easy in Nepal) but if you want everything taken care of the Funny Nepal are an excellent option.NEGATIVES: One major complaint. The agency offered to book a hotel for my stay and asked what my budget was. After paying $25 dollars a night to the agency for about a week I found guests using identical rooms were paying $10. I expected commission, but this was extortionate. Perhaps, it's best to book your own accommodation. Also, strangely, I was not picked up from the airport after my Tibet trip. Probably a misunderstanding, but left a slightly bad impression."

Having done many treks in different countries over the years there are three main things I look for in a company that may provide you with some support information;1.Track record reliability / dependability / support2. Value for money and flexibility3. Ability to tailor a trek to your requirementsFanindra's Funny Nepal Treks ticks all these boxes.1. I have dealt with Fanindra over the last 17 years when he was a porter, then as a guide and as the manager of this trekking company. Over this time I've found Fanindra has always been professional and committed to ensuring the trek goes smoothly and enjoyably and has had the experience to sort out the range of problems that can arise while trekking. From my experience Fanindra runs a tight small and personal company with guides who have a lot of experience. Most of his clients (like myself) are repeat business and from personal referrals.2. With my treks in Nepal I have opted for a fully costed treks for 2 people (ie Guide, porter, accommodation, transport and food) and on recent research (for this review) with upper Mustang trek (which we did in March 2012) have found that the costs compare favourably in the median range to other companies. So from my experience its good value for money. 3. I've always found that Fanindra listens to what you want from a trek and can help advise and tailor a trek to suit your timing and budget.A final consideration when choosing an agent is to remember you are primarily paying to have a great experience and safe trip that you'll always have great memories of. Talk to your trekking manager and get a guide suited to your age and personality and get to know your guide and porter early on because you'll be spending a lot of time with them and they will add a lot to your experience.Have fun, happy Himalayan trails,Glen Scholz, Australia."

            "review": "Very personable and fun guide-Fani is a gem. The date choices for this review only went back to Nov 2010, so I had to pick it as the furthest one back, but I actually went to Nepal the first time in 1998, then again in '99 and was on the Annapurna circuit for Y2K. We were in a trekking lodge full of other trekkers from all over the world and everyone had a great time celebrating that New Year, eating awesome Nepali food and dancing to local traditional music. Even the lodge owners joined in. Fani was such a wealth of information, and proud of his beautiful country. He always made sure to point out scenic views for photos and described everything from vegetation to wildlife to local customs. I went on a trip to India with Fani on my second trip to Nepal and we went from Kathmandu to Darjeeling, all the way to Delhi and up to Dharamsala, then took a train back to Gorakpur from Delhi to cross back into Nepal. The trip was really awesome. When we got back to Nepal, we trekked up to the holy temple in Muktinath, and, as usual, Fani had so much knowledge to impart. Fani has since opened his own trekking agency, Funny Nepal Treks, and I knew it would be a success just because he is such a personable person and very interested in making your trip as memorable and fun as possible. I made a friend in Fani back then and have stayed in touch all this time. I am planning a return trip to Nepal, hoping for 2012 and a trip to Kailash for the first time, and I know that every detail will be taken care of by Fani. You will be in good hands with this guy :) And have a lot of fun along the way!"

We decided not to do the overpriced luxury trek once we found Fanindra's company which was much more reasonably priced and offered similar service packages. It is a pleasure to report that we were very impressed with Fanindra and his staff. They were very professional, knowledgeable and friendly, and accommodating to our needs in order to make stay in Nepal as comfortable as possible. They helped us with ground transportation and lodging in Kathmandu, they provided some spare jackets and sleeping bags at no extra charge, and were certain that all preparations and safety precautions were in place before departing for our trek. Our guide and porter were excellent - they were hard working, trustworthy and friendly. To this day we still think about our experience each day, knowing our experience was made in part by the company we chose. Thank you Fanindra and team!"

Even when my legs ached from the trauma of a previous day, he managed to motivate me to get up and move on. It was songs and laughter all along the way, from teahouse to teahouse. We clung onto the roof rack of a bus as it wound precariously around rugged gorges, rafted; rode elephants; drank Raxi; joined in with some traditional dancing and ended the time with a few days rest in Chitwan park. Value for money was excellent and the itinerary was very well planned. There are hundreds of trekking agencies out there and I just got lucky. I know that there were a few envious people in a large Gap Adventure group!Everyone at Funny Nepal Treks is professional and helpful: I cannot recommend them highly enough.

            "review": "Extremely reliable company providing fantastic treks in Nepal. In March of 2011, three friends & I came to Kathmandu with the intention of undertaking one of the fantastic hill treks in the mountains around Pokhara. It was our first trip to Nepal and when we arrived in Kathmandu, there were many different companies all vying for our custom and we didn\u2019t know which one to choose. At the hotel we were staying at, we met a group of Australian travellers who had just returned from a trek with Fanindra\u2019s company, Funny Nepal Treks & Expedition, and they recommended his tours very highly, so we felt sure this would be a good choice for us. From the moment we met Fanindra, he took fantastic care of us. He really listened to what we wanted from our trek and showed us lots of pictures and examples of different hill tours before we settled on the Poon Hill trek. We started the trek from Nayapul near Pokhara. Our guide Krishna was a really cool guy \u2013 very friendly and knowledgeable about the local area, but at the same time he had a quietness and serenity about him. He knew exactly when to chat and tell us about the villages and paths we passed on, but also when to stay quiet and enjoy the beautiful scenery with us in companionable silence. You could tell that he took real pride in showing us the beauty of the mountains and hills and he took really good care of us. The walking itself was challenging but not overly strenuous. Our cute and friendly young porter, known by the grand name of Mr Parshu Ram Owsti, found it extremely easy and every morning he would set off with our packs at a gazelle\u2019s pace, only to watch us grinning, as we arrived at the next village a few hours after him! We passed through some amazing little villages, Hille, Ullerari. Ghorepani, Poon Hill , Tadapani, Ghandrung, and at all times we were struck by the friendliness and warmth of the people in this beautiful and tranquil part of the world. The local children were particularly sweet, always watching us with smiling faces and curious eyes. We finished the 5 nights \u2013 6 days trek in Pokhara and then went back to Kathmandu where Krishna showed us the sights of that busy town. All in all, this trek was one of the best experiences I have ever had. The scenery was so beautiful, the mountains were amazing, and by the end of that fantastic week, we felt like we had made life-long friends in Krishna and Fanindra. Even after I came home, Fanindra has stayed in touch by email, and we can\u2019t wait to return to Nepal and see them all again! I now plan to return with my husband and daughter next year to do the treks to Tibet and Bhutan\u2026we can\u2019t wait! I would recommend Fani\u2019s tours extremely highly \u2013 they are extremely well-organised, with knowledgeable guides and friendly porters, and at all times they take care of you and ensure that you are not exposed to any dangers in the mountains. The experience and the sights we saw on that hill trek have created memories that will last a lifetime. Fi WhitcheloGlasgowScotland"

We had already been on an 11 day trip to China and we continued onto a 19 day excursion in Nepal. We arrived in Kathmandu with ease and met the owner of the tour company, Fani. He's a really great guy, helpful, knowledgeable, speaks good english, basically all of what you want when you're about to embark on a 10 trek in the mountains. We had a great time in Kathmandu, then moved onto Chitwan national park and had a great visit, then we went to Pokhara and began our trek. We were scheduled to fly to the start of the trek, but as we went in Monsoon season, the flight didn't make it, but we made it there and got started safely (but if you just want to fly, try going in September or even October). The Kingdom of Mustang was a very exclusive destination at this time, however. When we were there it was absolutely deserted so we had the stunning scenery all to ourselves. Our guide and porters were extremely capable and trustworthy, and the views were absolutely breathtaking. I have been to Egypt, Spain, England, Morocco, and a few other countries, and I have honestly never seen a more unique and absolutely beautiful place. I definitely recommend that you go with a guide (Funny Nepal tours have the best), bring an overcoat or a rain jacket, and be ready to have the most amazing experience of your life with Funny Nepal treks."

We found these guys really excellent from the start. The organiser, Kabi, met us at our hotel when we arrived in Kathmandu, again on the morning of our departure for the trek and then again after we had returned from the trek to make sure everything was OK for us. Our guide Om and our porter Kuran (I think) were brilliant throughout.Another guide gave us a tour of Kathmandu on the first day and that was brilliant. The hotel that we were booked into there was very good also.Our trek was from 27-Jun to 07-Jul but it is prob not the best time of year to go as it was monsoon season. There was a lot of cloud cover but it cleared sufficiently many of the days so we did not miss any of the views. We were very lucky because our flight to Lukla went on schedule but for the previous 10 days, no flights made it to Lukla due to the cloud cover.The trekking itself is hard but very manageable. The accommodation is basic but sufficient. Prepare not to have many showers when you get up past 4,000m because it is just too cold in the evenings.One negative point for me was that each day you finish trekking at around 14.00 / 15.00 and the rest of the evening can be very boring. Because we did it during the low season, most of the tea-houses we stayed in were empty of trekkers and we only had ourselves for company.Anyway, this company were excellent and we would recommend them for any treks in Nepal."

Our guide Kris was absolutely amazing. I cannot thank him enough for looking after my friend and I on the trek. My friend fell ill whilst on the trek and Kris prioritised her health and safety above all which was extremely comforting as it was a stressful situation. We had a helicopter flown out to us straight away to take us back to kathmandu, once arriving in Kathmandu Kabi met us at the hospital and from there showed amazing hospitality. Even though my trip was cut short because of illness, i still had the best time thanks to the company of our group, and our guide. I would HIGHLY recommend Kris as a guide, he has LOADS of experience, he has the best stories, handles stressful situations with ease, speaks amazing English and is an all round top guide."

However, if any unforeseen issues arose, I was confident in the support network available.The whole experience of trekking through the Himalayas is tough, both mentally and physically. However, having completed it, successfully reaching EBC, I can say with my hand on my heart that it was hands down the best experience of my life. I'd recommend the trip to all and pass on my strongest recommendation that you use Trekking Guide Team to organise it, as they do it in a safe and enjoyable manner."

During winter trek, essential to bring -20 sleeping bag for sleeping and fleece pants, fleece top, down jacket, warm socks, open fingers gloves, closed warm gloves, fleece neck and nose cover and fleece cap for sitting around during tea break or dinner or when sleeping. The nose cover is also useful during trekking to protect you from dust. The open fingers gloves are very useful during trekking to use your camera and take pictures, drink and eat. Do not wear too tight boots or too thick/double socks when walking. Rain poncho nor rain jacket is not necessary during my trip on 22 Dec 2015 - 01 Jan 2016. I love to see the animals along the trek, the suspension bridges, yak/mules crossing suspension bridge, the Everest view points, the scalp of yeti and learning 1 or 2 Sherpa's words."

Trekking Guide Team Adventure is an outstanding and excellent company which helped me achieve my life-time goal of reaching Mt. Everest Base Camp/Kalapatter (5550m). The company also organized my tours to Bhutan and Lumbini. Mr. Kabiraj Nepal, owner of the company and tour operator, professionally organized these three tours for me many months ahead of time. We communicated many times by email which eliminated my fears and worries. While I was in Nepal and Bhutan, Kabi constantly contacted me and made sure that I was alright with my health, accommodation, flights, meals, and hot water, more importantly road transport. There was a fuel crisis in Nepal. He organized a motor cycle or an electronic rickshaw when the car was not available. When I lost my money, when I needed rescue in the mountain and whenever I needed help, he thoroughly looked after me and assisted me to resolve my problems. He provided me with excellent guides in all destinations, especially my mountain guide, Mahesh, was an excellent guide. He not only carried my big duffle bag, but also took my photos and videos and professionally guided me in the mountain. Kabi took me to a cultural dinner with Nepalese food and dance, which was very enjoyable. Bhutan tour was also professionally organized through this company and I visited all tourist places I wanted to visit. I would highly recommend Trekking Guide Team Adventure to anyone in the world, both single and group travelers. I had the most amazing experience in my life!"

I highly recommend Trekking Guide Team Adventure for any prospective visitors to Nepal.With their assistance I was able to achieve my goal of reaching EBC. In doing so I witnessed and captured on camera some of the most breathtaking scenery I have ever seen in many years of extensive OS travel.I am from Australia, in my 30s, with reasonable though not extreme fitness. I had no previous trekking experience. My guide Saran was absolutely outstanding, competent and a wonderful bloke to boot. Ask for him by name. Nothing was too difficult and his guidance ensured my safety and enabled pure enjoyment and wonder whilst traversing the Himalayan region.I felt that I was being well looked after and safe at all times. As a result I feel I did not miss a thing!Thank you Saran. Your knowledge and professionalism contributed highly to making this one of the most amazing holiday experiences of my life!The proprietor Mr Kabiraj was also top notch. He was very involved in ensuring the trip ran as smoothly as possible and my needs were met.At short notice following the Trek I was also able to organise a 2 night visit to the Jungle in Chitwan. There I stayed at a beautiful lodge to view incredible wild life which I highly recommend. I topped this off with an immensely enjoyable white water rafting adventure on the day before I flew out.Have no illusions this is an outstanding operator. If you are thinking of going to Nepal, go. I found it very safe and to say it was well worth it would be an understatement.If you have dreamed of trekking to EBC, do it with these guys. You will not regret it!Many thanks and best regards again to the team,Andrew"

I wondered after circling in the air for over an hour on my flight from Dubai, if we would land at all and then wondered if the Trekking Guide Team rep would still be there. It was pelting down outside, but sure enough my transfer was waiting patiently with a smile. Kabiraj was at the hotel to greet me as he was on my next morning to start the visits to some of the most fabulous temples and shrines in Kathmandu. I was introduced a couple of days later to my guide, Mahesh, that I would spend the next 12 days with in LangTang Valley. As a solo traveller, Mahesh couldn't do enough for me, always going at my pace, took wonderful photos for me along the way, and saw to my every need. (sometimes too much - and always, always with a smile) A word of advice, talk to your guide, spend time finding out about his/her lives, family etc. Yes in the beginning the different accents made it difficult but perseverance certainly paid off. I learnt to speak some Nepali, learnt about customs of both Buddhist and Hindu and have great respect for the people of this nation - what has come before them and what is about to come, and how they have weathered through all of it. Although LangTang Valley is undergoing a lot reestablishing now, the Annapurna Circuit is also amazing. Pokhara is just a fabulous tourist destination, a visit to the Peace Pagoda is not to be missed and the climb to Sarangkot where you can get a beautiful veiw of Machupachare (the Fishtail Mountain) and the Annapurnas beckoning in the distance. I stayed at Century Guest House which I highly recommend in Pokhara. The Nepali people are so humble, helpful and are not so pushy to sell their wares to you. A simple No Thankyou with a smile is usually sufficient and don't be afraid to look - looking usually means you think you must buy, I didn't find that in Nepal.Coming back to Kabi raj and Mahesh they are really do look after you, nothing is too much trouble and if you want to include something out of the ordinary - Paragliding in Pokhara ??, they are only too willing to assist. My trekking experience with this company left me with feelings of great wonderment at the beauty, simplicity and acceptance. I felt the Freedom of being in these majestic valleys and mountains, not always allowing Wifi and technology to encroch on what should be time in seclusion to reflect, gather yourself and see with different eyes. My every whim was met with Fulfillment by the Company, the people, the sounds, smells and the wonderment which is Nepal. Don't hesitate to book with this company, I now call them friends."

We were met at the airport by a driver and then by Kabi at the hotel. The trip was well organised and we had a wonderful guide who we would go with again in a heartbeat. The weather was not the best in August when we went and visibility was poor, however we still really enjoyed the experience and fell in love with Nepal and its friendly people."

We are a tourist group from Thailand who are really like trekking and we luckily found this amazaing service from Groupon and Tripadvisor. Kabi always reply my emails for many months before I flied to Kathmandu and we met up at the hotel. My group are really had a great time and impress a trekking guide, especially Mr. Sunjan. He is a very nice and friendly guide. We like his smiles for everyday trekking. We also had a warm Nepalese dinner from the company at last day for the trip. Finally, I'd recommend this company to who are looking for a professional and reliable service. We'll come back to use our friend's service agian once we get a chance to Nepal :)"

Big thank you to Kabi and Ari for your wonderful service and help throughout my trekking experience even though my trip was unexpectedly cut short. Ari is a wonderful guide and porter, words can't express the gratitude and appreciation to him for all his help, meeting me at the airport, carrying all my belongings up and down those mountains, patiently waiting every 20mins for me to sit down and catch my breathe and those endless days of flight delays and more then anything always making sure I was happy and hydrated! Thank you to Kabi for all your assistance in Kathmandu and the lovely traditional dinners. I recommend this agency to anyone wanting to trek to Everest base camp, these people are honest, client orientated people who will do anything to make your trek worthwhile. I will definitely be back again,Thank youSabrina Warner -Australia"

The guides he provided (Mr.Nama and Mr. Shiva) for us were very caring, sincere and hardworking. They kept ensuring us that this is our holiday and they will do all the heavy lifting which was really a relief in our hearts. They were friendly to talk to and they truly can be trusted. It was well organised and everybody was very professional yet friendly. It was definitely a trip to remember. I went on the Annapurna Circuit and there were no set backs in organisation which was very good because that's what you want in a trip. I felt really thankful to this company. Mr. Kabi provided us with information; ie itenery, things to pack beforehand and later in the trip asked for our feedback and what we weren't all that happy with. All in all, it was a very pleasant trip and everything went rather smoothly."

We came from Abu dhabi and got into the airport, luckily they're was only one flight entering visa control, and got out 15 day visa, which we had to pay for in usd. We were met straight away by our trekking guide , Sauran, and the driver. Our guide was excellent throughout the trip, always making sure we got enough food, taking pictures and telling us about Nepal and his own experiences. We met the company owner, kabi, at the hotel and he was also very helpful and efficient. The hotel was ok, basic but the staff are friendly. The area was right in the heart of the tourist region with all the shops selling \"cheap\" north face gear, obviously not real but very cheap and they like haggling. We picked up nice ornaments and masks that are perfect souvenirs. The second day we saw all the sights and temples in Kathmandu. Most of the places were definitely worth seeing and the admission is quite cheap. The traffic is crazy which drags out the day a bit but it was enjoyable. We then left to go trekking and got a young porter to bring our bag, we left the other one with the hotel staff. It costs $75 for the 3 days. The first day trekking we got breakfast and left about 8ish. We got there about 9:30 and off we set. Just myself and my girlfriend did the trek which was nice , plus you didn't have to wait for anyone else! We trekked for about 4 hours and reached 2,500m, the views and weather were gorgeous and the village we stayed in at the top was actually quite nice. We were blessed with the weather, actually got burnt, which added to the views and enjoyment. The hotel was very basic and we got extra blankets as it got quite cold at night. The sunrise at 6:10am was beautiful and well worth getting up for! Then we are breakfast and settled out on our 7-8 hour trek through the jungle / mountain trail. It was a long but enjoyable day. We stopped half way for nearly 2 hours for food, which was just ok at best but we expected that ! We reached nagarkot and the hotel was fine, food was good, especially the steak for dinner! The views the next morning were a bit misty but nonetheless gorgeous and well worth seeing. After breakfast we headed on our last 4 hour trek and returned to Kathmandu in the afternoon. We got a nice massage, Sauran showed us where to go, and stayed in a much nicer hotel for our last night! We didn't have to check out until 3, which was brilliant ! We got our last few souvenirs and headed to the airport with excellent memories of Kathmandu and Nepal. We are already thinking of returning next year and using this company again. It was a well organized and hassle free holiday, everything was done in a professional and punctual manner. I can't recommend them highly enough. Thanks to Kabi and Sauran, along with the rest of the people who made our holiday so memorable."

Trolleys were nowhere to be found and it was hard to get near the belt. I was thankful to get all my luggages and quickly exit the airport. Manoj my arranged guide was there with a sign of my name and their company. We got in the car and headed towards the hotel. I spent the next 3 days with Manoj and the porter Mahes. They were both very pleasant company. I highly recommend anyone to request for Manoj as your trekking guide as he is joyful, outgoing and responsible.We were delighted by the choice of accommodation and food provided by this company. There was even a farewell cultural dinner with traditional dances and food to fill our tummy to the brim.Good job and thank you"

My husband and I used this company to trek Everest Base Camp that also included airport pick up and drop off, a tour of the city and a cultural dinner and show after our trek. We have had the most positive experience with this company and do not hesitate recommending this company to any future base camp enthusiasts. As a first time trekker I was apprehensive of Everest base camp. I emailed Kabi over 30 times before arriving in Nepal with numerous questions about the trek and expectations. Kabi never failed to respond within 24 hours to my emails and also provided me with detailed responses and assurances to all my incessant questions. It was unfortunate that I required a helicopter evacuation after succumbing to altitude sickness at 5100metres but Kabi handled it so professionally. He contacted my insurance company and made all the arrangements for me to get out of the mountains within 24 hours. Kabi was at the hospital when I arrived and liaised with the hospital staff to ensure I was comfortable and stayed for hours until I checked into my room for the night, called me to make sure I was okay and returned the next day to check on my progress before driving us back to the hotel. I felt very well looked after and cared for. Kabi is a very warm and affectionate man and no request was too difficult for him to cater for. I would highly recommend the services of Kabi and his team because they demonstrated the upmost professionalism coupled with genuine care for us for the duration of our visit to Nepal. Our trekking guide, Santosh, spoke great English and was very knowledgeable about the Everest area. As well as giving us information he also shared stories with us, spent the evenings teaching us Nepali card games and Bagh Chal (it\u2019s like Nepali checkers- you have to buy it when in Nepal!). He always made sure we were confortable and made us laugh after a tough day of hiking. Santosh had such an easygoing personality and we soon saw him as a good friend rather than just a guide. I was most impressed with Santosh when I got sick in the mountains. He showed genuine concern and would go out of his way to make sure I was drinking warm water and staying hydrated. Furthermore, we travelled with another couple who were inconsiderate travellers as well as very weak hikers. Santosh would recognise our frustrations and organise for us to leave earlier with the sherpas and/or liaise with the Sherpa\u2019s to return to get us so we could walk faster and reach our destination. It was very considerate of him to consider the level of fitness for the entire group and ensure that he catered for everyone\u2019s needs! His foresight and his interest to ensure that our needs were met were a testament to his proficiency and strength as a trekking guide. I would definitely recommend him for future travellers. I would recommend any traveler going to Nepal to check this company out. If you have any questions regarding preparing for Everest base camp please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me!"

It was a beautifull trekking with splendid sunny wheather, beautifull snowy mountains, friendly locals and my competent guide who encouraged me when it was (sometimes) hard to climb. One day we arrived in LowerPisang. At 16.00 o' clock he asked me to come and climb to Upper Pisang. When we arrived there was a ceremony in the stupa going on: 3 monks were sitting on the floor making music by long horns and saying prayers for almost 1 hour. Tea was being served by another monk who was also busy to enlighten the candles made of yakgrease. This was very special for me to witness. What I liked very much in the mountains is the silence and the variation of the flora. That's why I have decided to visit Nepal again this year in November. This time I'm going to do the Gosainkunda and Helambu trekking with the same organisation"

The earthquake caused some landslides but the route is already adapted to that. There are plenty of good and safe (earthquake proof) lodges on the way as well. Our great guide was very flexible in arranging good accommodation, transport and fulfilling our wish to go to Manaslu base camp. He makes very easily contact with the population which resulted in very nice interaction with the villagers. He could also provide us interesting knowledge about the area. It is good to discuss with Destination Himalaya in advance about the weight to be carried by the porters."

I had done a trek in the Himalayan Mountains the year before also organized by Destination Himalaya and had a great experience. That one was a 12 day trek and when I emailed them and asked about a longer trek that was even more challenging they emailed back with the itinerary that I went on this year. It was awesome! It was a challenging, exhilarating experience that was more than they had promised. The guide they supplied was very attentive to my needs and we became friends during the trek. I will definitely use this company again. Maybe even next year. Great mountains!"

The proposal to hire donkeys instead of human porters was really good because to see porters carrying the things in mountaineous areas was not very happiness bringing experience.The guide provided was very kind. Food was good. Accommodation also satisfied us.The 14 days spent in Upper Mustang kingdom will leave unforgettable memories in our minds. And everything because of very good and sincere work of Min Gurung-the owner of the Himalayan destination treks. Thank you."

I'd been journeying for a couple of months when I landed in Kathmandu, having walked in Patagonia as well as to Machu Picchu. But, this was my first time trekking in Nepal - a beautiful country on an altogether different scale - and I was nervous about the challenge implied. Min planned my itinerary with that in mind and Mo was supportive as well as terrific company for a lone female traveller at every step. The incredible sense of achievement 'on top of the world' is like nothing else I've ever experienced - can't wait to go back and explore some more! Highly recommended."

This valley is beside the normal Annapurna Circuit and requires special attention. We were very pleased with the way the agency helped us getting the special permit and traveling to the valley entrance. Agency CEO Min Gurung and assistant Tara personally advised us and with the help of the very good guide Mohan we had an wonderful experience. Good communication and support helped us doing this wonderful trekking. For many days we were travelling through fantastic landscape which reminded us to the Upper Mustang trek, we did some years ago, also with Destination Himalaya Treks. I recommend this agency as being very reliable and they know exactly how to organize this special trekkings, as well as the standard routes. From the arrival in Kathmandu to the departure home, they have eye for everything the traveller wants and needs. So if you want to go trekking in the Himalaya\u2019s or visit a remote place or just do some valley sightseeing, I really recommend my friends at Destination Himalaya Treks.

The first time we did the wunderful Manaslu Circuit as a camp trek and the second time the challenging Mera Peak climbing expedition.The Manaslu Circuit camp trek was excellent. All staff were very friendly, helpful and working hard all the time. We had a well experienced cook who made our trip successful by providing us well cooked, and important, hygienic food. Following our choice and request, Mr. Min Gurung himself guided us as during those 2 Himalaya experiences and we had such a great time, it was brilliant!The Mera Peak climbing expedition was quite challenging. But we worked together as a team, reached the summit and it felt like a family in the end which made this trip an experience we will never ever forget!All I can say is: \u201cAn EXCELLENT Agency\u201d. If you plans are to see a bit more of the unforgettable beauty of the Himalayas in Nepal, contact this agency and you will be in good hands with Destination Himalaya Treks!!Andr\u00e9 & Marianne Lambregts, The Netherlands"

It was our first time on such a high altitude, so we hired two guides just in case some people had to turn back due to altitude sickness and the rest wanted to continue. Both guides (Min Bahadur and Thapa Huk) were great, spoke good English, explained everything we wanted to know and made us laugh quite often. Thanks!"

We had a great experience, food was included, the driver would stop basically anywhere so we could take pictures. Overall, it was a worthwile experience, as it was very personalized.

Our first trip to Nepal and we were very grateful for all the organising he did, and that was before we set off! The 10 days were magical, easily the most beautiful country I've ever been to and I've seen a few now. Nepal speaks for itself. As for Tika, he was wonderful, constantly checking to make sure we were all ok and safe with the altitude. The one time I felt unwell, he reacted very quickly and took me back to a safe altitude without hesitation. His knowledge of the area was brilliant and much needed as maps of Nepal are notoriously not to scale! The tea houses we stayed at were so clean, welcoming and the food just right after a days trekking. I can't recommend Tika enough, he's part of our family now!"

As we were going on a short trek due to time constraints, we did not get a guide. This adds some complexity to the Lukla flight process since it's typicalky guides who get the flights and walk you through the madness of the domestic airport. Mr. Devaraj really helped us with securing the tickets, getting the earliest possible flights and managing the airline changes to end up eventually with one of the best flying experiences ever.While in Kathmandu, we stayed in his hotel (Hotel Horizon) and it was a great choice. It is located at the heart of Thamel but on a very quiet street, which helps a lot getting good sleep. The staff friendly and helpful and, for one of my worries, we had no issues getting hot water any time. The complimentary one-way airport transfer is another plus when you arrive to a new country for the first time.All in all, a recommended agency and hotel."

The all inclusive tour we bought is an expensive way to go but you have no worries and don't need to have rupees for the 2 weeks, if you want to save some money just pay your way for the food and accommodation. Destination Himalaya gave us excellent advice on which trek to choose, we joined the Annapurna circuit for a week after completing two weeks on Manaslu, we will use them and Sailesh on our next tr to Nepal."

Min Gurung from destination Himalayas did a fantastic job of planning our trip for us exactly how we wanted it to be. We discussed with him online over a few weeks and he was very forthcoming with all the clarifications to my many questions. Once we reached Nepal and met Min Gurung personally, we felt at ease as we knew we could trust him completely to ensure we have a great time. All his replies were honest which is very important for us to note that as it is monsoon season there are certain things we might not be able to do. He arranged a very learned guide, Min (Sanjeev) to follow us on our initial leg of the trip. If you do want to know more about a place you are visiting, I would totally recommend you request for Min (Sanjeev) to follow you. He speaks very fluent English and is very knowledgeable about the history and various parts of the country. Min Gurung also arranged a very reliable driver, Ram to drive us to Pokhara where he had arranged Paragliding for us. That was just fantastic! TO see the lake with mountains/hills all around us. Of course we were also lucky that we had a sunny day to go for this. After a couple of days, our driver, Ram brought us for Rafting at Trisuli River which was also arranged by Min Gurung. Another fun and brilliant way to look around Nepal's nature. Overall, I would say our 1st trip to Nepal was excellent & I would definitely be back for more! & this would not have been possible without the amazing planning and arrangement of Min Gurung from Destination Himalayas! Thank you very much. Nepal is a beautiful place with beautiful people."

The first I did was Mount Everest Base Camp in 2006 and the second Manasalu circuit trek in 2013 (I visited in March 2013 but Trip Advisor won't let me go back that far) and I very much intend to return to Nepal and do another trek with Tika!Both treks were absolutely fantastic and both were made much better by the fact we were with Tika. His English is good, he is very funny and always upbeat and encouraging, making it easier to carry on during some of the harder days. We shared some wonderful times with Tika and met his lovely family. Despite suffering from mild altitude sickness on both treks I was incredibly well looked after by Tika and I honestly can't see myself trekking in the Himalaya's without him. A side point here - the treks were both absolutely stunning and had some of the most breath taking scenery I've ever encountered.The price we received was very good (although if you are on a tight budget the all inclusive food isn't a necessity if you are willing to eat Dhal Baht every day like we did and sacrifice treats like chocolate and Coca cola) and I would highly recommend booking through either Tika or the company direct, rather than booking through an agency in your home country as you will pay far more to trek with a big group! For example one agency in England charged over double the price we paid to go with a group of 14 whereas we were in a group of 2. All in all two incredible treks for a great price. Thank you Tika and thank you Destination Himalaya! See you again soon."

Their frienschip and hospitallity is enormous and makes you feel at home and treated like real geusts. I remember our guide Mohan from DH-Treks waking us up early morning in the dark to overlook the Langtang Valley from Laurabina, overseeing the great Himalaya skyline with the sun coming up. Timing was perfect!So we strongly recommend the agency. Peter en Monique from the Netherlands"

Luckily had good weather, we could see so many mountains, green hills and landscape. On the way back we went into the Bhaktapur Darvar Square. Square is so creative, even wanted spend more time around but we didn\u2019t have time. In fact, this was fabulous day trip for us. Thank you !!!!"

The trek was challenging, yet self-paced to enable you to go as fast or as leisurely as you liked. Sali and his team of guides and porters were always there to assist you and support you. The mountain accommodation (tea houses) are basic and there were no expectations, hence no disappointment, but wouldn't mind any future upmarket tea houses :) Food was good and many a times Sali would ask whether we had any preferences and where possible he would do his best to ensure we got what we wanted. Its important to make us happy along the way and the team tried very hard to do that and hence, grateful for their efforts.One thing I would like to point out was the sleeping bags. As we elevated to the top and stayed overnight at our last teahouse; the sleeping bag was not warm enough for the cold temperature (for me anyways). Hence, I would suggest to get a slightly thicker type so that we can snuggle from the cold. No sleep, no trek the next day otherwise :) Other than that, I enjoyed the trek tremendously. Attention to detail and looking out for your clients is a must as a guide. We rely on their expertise and experience and would recommend Sali and his team without a doubt. The whole team including the porters were fun and helpful to have around. Thank you for the birthday surprise also, much appreciated. Thanks Sali and team. I shall be back, so look out....cheers"

As with all travels, the climax wasn't just the destination but what the journey helped you experience. Kudos to this esteemed organization from Saligram (boss) and Prakash (master guide), ensuring that our team was well taken care off from the time of arrival in Kathmandu, the smooth travel to Lukla airport, how accommodation and meals were arranged, attention to historical details, safety and personal care whenever warranted. To the review readers, do not waste time arriving in Kathmandu and then searching for a expedition partner. You have that with Mountain World Treks, a very professional establishment. Our guide Prakash extended his excellent guiding abilities beyond the EBC trek, while our porters made us feel more comfortable especially with the heavy loads. Spend a few more days in Kathmandu while recuperating after EBC. Sali and Prakash showed us more Nepali hospitality that I'd always cherish. Further tips. Kathmandu bazaars have all the equipment you might need for this trek. Get there a couple of days earlier for some shopping. MWT will assist you here. A good pair of trekking boots, broken in prior to the trip is essential. Follow the equipment checklist but do not bring redundant items. It's too heavy. Medical & evacuation insurance up to the level of 5,000m is essential. Finally, the guides and porters also rely on our tips for income. Do not be stingy if you have been taken care off very well. See you again Mountain World Treks, I luv you guys!!!"

Once we reached the top, the view was really breath taking. The charming sunrise made me silent for a few moments on the spot. I was blown away by the stunning scenery. Our team chose Mountain World Treks as our tour guide. Our guide, Saligram Aryal speaks Bahasa Melayu and English fluently. It was easy communicate with him. Saligram and his team were informative, friendly, and humorous. Always made we laughed. They are very charming, guys. Highly recommended. *thumbs up* Saligram had taken a good care of our team.

With all the oohs and aahs with the all the locals back in Malaysia, I have decided to engage Saligram from Mountain World Treks as our guide for this trip to Nepal. Saligram is a household name in the hiking community in Malaysia. And we were very lucky as Sali turned out to be a real asset during the trek. He has the entire trip well organised and in control from the very first step we set foot on Kathmandu until we bade our final goodbyes to the Himalayas in the horizon. He understand the needs and expectations of each individual members and his encouragements throughout the trek were the most essential element of a good guide. Not forgetting his jovial and charismatic characters make the entire trip a memorable one. So I strongly recommend Saligram and his team mates from Mountain World Trek to anyone looking for a guide in Nepal not just for trekking but city tours as well. And for those generous folks out there, Saligram is the backbone of Nalang Sewa Samaj, a project dedicated to providing better health care and education to the under priviledged children in the rural village of Nalang. So as you trek you will also be donating to this good course."

Saligram and his team did a great job in facilitating the logistics and transport. The porters and guides were knowledgeable, friendly and included us in their dance, songs and native activities. We all had a great time. Thanks!"

The experience of me with the team guide by Mountain World Trek give me a memorable moment in Himalaya region along with the stories shared by the team. Because of their professional in handling emergency situation during the earthquake in Nepal on 25 Apr 2015, I was much alive and went back home safe. For Mountain World Trek, safety is their first priority and take fully care of their trekkers until they reach the Kathmandu safe and sound. Therefore, I highly recommend Mountain World Trek to be your trek guide as I had been with them for two major expeditions which are ABC and EBC trip! Lots of awesome photos taken throughout the trip and I had ample of time capturing great moment along the way till I reached the base camp!"

Owner & Guide Saligram Aryal is exceptionally observant & sensitive to his clients needs and strengths; for example when he realized that we were a slightly stronger than the average group, he cancelled reservations at a lower elevation tea house, in favor of our staying at one at the Machhapuchchhre Basecamp, leaving us an easier hike up to our high point at the Annapurna Basecamp. And the trek was made even more delightful, having Saligram's strong and beautiful 16 year old daughter along on her first trek, as well. Thank you so much, Sali, for putting together such a perfect trek!"

I have used them for each one of my trips and have never been disappointed. Saligram is always very professional and knowledgeable about every aspect of the trek. From beginning to end he planned everything efficiently and always kept us entertained with his humor and wit. I was joined by two friends who had never trekked before, one of whom had recently had a hip replacement! We trekked to ABC and had no problems. It was a strenuous hike especially the day we pushed for MBC, but with Saligram's encouragement, we all made it without incident. When we eventuallly reached ABC,the views were worth it and amazing! We had wonderful porters, Suresh and Benod who carried our bags up and down all those steps and still served us tea with a smile. All and all it was a most successful trip and I recommend Mountain World Treks for anyone planning to visit Nepal."

It was very happy community. Because we had a big group we had few locals with us (guides and porters) and we dance, we sing and we learned about each other. The service were well above average. We found friends who cared for us and who wanted to show us different sides of Nepal. They were flexible and organized. They were professional and thoughtful.

A natural leader. His love for his country, village and people is infectious. He speaks excellent English and Malay (which puts me, a Malaysian, to shame)!His team of guides and porters (Sudip, Prakash, Raj, Suresh, Kaka, Dip, Robin and many more) are trustworthy and fun loving! What a crazy time we had in dancing, singing and card games!Why is this trip so MAGICAL...1) we took part in Nalang Village Project, a brainchild of Sali, to improve the lives of school kids and villagers. It made us understand his people and culture better. Keep up the good work, Sali.2) we had a beautiful Singaporean wedding at ABC - Nepali style - with amazing scenery all around, solemnized by none other than our Sali. It was so surreal!3) I suffered from AMS at ABC and was vulnerable, Sali was in total control and took excellent care of me. I owe you one, Sali. 4) some 20 of us who barely knew each other at the start of the trip, became firm friends! Already planning our next trek and how we could do more for this beautiful country.Lastly, THANK YOU EVERYONE. You are part of my life now. P.s. Already missing the mountains and your laughter.

I decided to go to Nepal after meeting Saligram and Yong at Mountain World Trek booth at MATTA Fair in Kuala Lumpur in September this year. These two gentlemen managed to convince me to go trekking in Nepal instead of normal vacation in other countries. And I'm glad I did it. Although Mountain World Trek have several certified guides, I was lucky to get Saligram himself to be our guide. He and our porter Lila, both can converse in Malay. There were only 4 of us including my partner. The trek was tough in my opinion for someone who is not familiar with trekking like me, you need to be in good shape and enough training. After all the hardship climbing uphill, the view of the mountains was stunning because I never see snow capped mountains back in my country. Lucky us, we were blessed with clear skies when we reached Ghorepani, Poon Hill, Tadapani, Chomrong, MBC and ABC. If you're going for trekking in Nepal for the first time, it is better to engage guide. I strongly suggest a licensed company like Mountain World Treks. In fact, I'm not hesitate to engage them again in my next trip to EBC in the future. They were not only guide and porter to us but they were also became our close friends. Such a wonderful people. Saligram went extra miles by accompanying us for a tour around Pokhara for 2 days. We went boating at Phewa Lake, visiting Davis Fall, caving and Gurkha Memorial Museum (don't forget to buy Kukri here, it is cheaper than other places).

We were recommended Mountain World Treks, specifically its company owner Saligram, three years ago from a friend who met Sali during his Everest Base Camp trek. At the time my friend was doing the trek with another company but was so impressed with Sali (who was guiding a separate group) both from his own conversations and the feedback of others he spoke with that he did not hesitate to suggest Sali as our \"go to\" man in Nepal.Finally, three years later my husband and I made our way to Nepal to do the Annapurna Circuit trek. I'd have to say that two of the BEST things about dealing with Sali prior to commencing the trek was that firstly as a local Nepalese we were supporting a local business and secondly he can tailor any trek to suit your needs. Through previous research we found that the tours offered by larger companies were set in stone but with Sali he tailored it exactly to what we were looking for in terms of enjoyment, budget and timing. We even did our tour privately with just my husband and I (plus Sali and a Porter) for the same price as doing a larger group trek...where else can you get a super deal like that!!!Upon arrival in Kathmandu, Sali showed us the utmost in Nepalese hospitality with a beautiful homemade lunch with his family and a relaxed, albeit insightful, tour of the sights. Throughout our entire time in Nepal, any question we asked of Sali he knew the answer too...even the height and names of all the mountains we passed on our trek. Talk about impressive!!! Furthermore, his spoken English is as good as a native english speaker, which definitely made our lives easier!The trek was a once in a lifetime experience. The beauty of the circuit is that you never see the same thing twice...every day is a different day. We started off in lush greenery, which felt as if we were walking through the set of Jurassic Park movie, and then slowly made our way past the tree line and into the beauty of the rocky and snow tipped mountains. I'd highly recommend travelling to Nepal in September too as you beat the chaos during the peak season of October and the changing colours - pinks, yellows, oranges - off the wheat and grain fields will take your breath away (this will have past come October). Sali loves to laugh, teach Nepalese card games, do magic tricks, and proudly show you his stunning home, Nepal. I couldn't have wished or hoped for a more enjoyable experience than the one that Sali provided us.We have memories to last a lifetime and for that we can only say THANK YOU Sali and Mountain World Treks. We look forward to returning for another trek in the years ahead xxx"

We agreed a trek itinerary from the UK and the trek was finalised by me sending a small deposit by bank transfer.My guide was Sam, an experienced man in the Himalayas for over 20 years. Sam did far more just simply show me the way. He was able to point out flora & fauna, mountains & rivers, recommend hotels/lodges (including the best rooms!) and we also enjoyed some great local food & drink.Sam's expertise really showed when we were stuck in a lodge in Dingboche at 4500m with snow falling outside for 4 days. I felt safe under his guidance and so did many others with guides from other groups looking to him for advice.I am already thinking about my next trip to Nepal and will certainly be keeping in contact with Saligram and Sam who I now consider to be friends.Dan, London, UK"

Company owner, Saligram was really helpful, friendly, funny and very responsible to attend with each of our needs although we were a big group of 31 people, but he paid attention to each of us. Other guides, Prakash and Sam, also all porters were also helpful and really friendly. At night after a hard day on track, we would always listen to the porters singing and learnt some traditional nepali dance. Great accomodation and most important of all, great and yummy foods! After trekking, Saligram and other guides also accompanied us to go shopping around Pokhara and Kathmandu, and showed us shops that have good deals. Saligram also showed us interesting places to visit around Pokhara. Until the last day, although we have different flight schedule, Saligram and Prakash make sure that we reached the airport safe and sound. Overall, 5 star service to Saligram and team! Also if you are Malaysian, be noted that Saligram can speak fluent Bahasa Malaysia.. That's a big big plus for us!"

My husband and I met Sali during our first trip to Nepal, and decided to trek to Everest Basecamp with him on the recommendation of a family from London, who were travelling with him at the time. I have to say we were hugely impressed with Mountain World Treks. Sali was so informative about Nepali culture, and having worked his way up from being a porter initially, was very careful to ensure that his own staff are treated well. Nothing was too much of a problem, and he was very supportive and helpful when my husband had difficulties with the altitude. We also had the opportunity to meet several members of his family and home village which was very special.Nepal is a very beautiful country and trekking here is just amazing wherever you go.

I saw only excellent reviews on TripAdvisor for Mountain World Treks and there was a lot more positive feedback on their Facebook page, so I found them on the internet. Saligram, the company owner, and I became friends on Facebook and we chatted regularly about my trip to Nepal. As the trip approached it made more sense to let Mountain World Treks handle the trip from start to finish. Their prices were reasonable and when I let them know the things that we wanted to see/do, they became part of our itinerary. We were lucky enough to\u00a0have Saligram as our\u00a0guide. Although he had other tours/treks\u00a0going on concurrently, we always had his undivided attention. We went during the biggest festival of the year--Dashain. On the 8th day, the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of animals takes place in temples throughout the nation. This was a big concern because I didn't want to witness any of this. I let Saligram know, and it never became an issue. We also had the\u00a0honor\u00a0of staying with\u00a0his family on their rice farm on the 10th day of\u00a0 Dashain, the 'Dashami'. On this day, elders put Tika on the forehead of younger relatives to bless them (simplified version). Not only did we witness this ritual, we were included. It was an experience I will never forget. This was a very busy time to be in Nepal, yet despite the crowds and cues, our guide made sure we never waited in any lines, and we always seemed to have the best room in the hotels / tea & guest houses. And if our porter is any indication, Mountain World Treks hires only the best. If you're planning a trip to Nepal, go with Mountain World Treks. It's a no-brainier."

I was the friend who became ill on the trip. Saligram immediately grasped the severity of my illness and summoned a doctor to our hotel. It was necessary that I be hospitalized for 24 hours and then be restricted to bed rest for several days. Saligram made arrangements with his family members at the Crown Himalayas Hotel in Pokhara to care for me while he and my friends went on an abbreviated trek for three days. His family members were absolutely wonderful and very caring. I felt like I was resting at a spa since the hotel also had a lovely garden. I don't want to limit my positive comments just to the time I was sick. I was also the friend for whom Saligram gave a surprise birthday party in his home. His family could not have been more hospitable and generous. No request was too much to ask of him. He delivered much more than promised. Saligram was not only professional, he became our good friend."

The scenery is incredible. Be aware that accommodation is very basic ( bathroom and toilet especially) so you should be ready for it. You are also very likely to spend the night before the pass in a tent at 4400m as there almost no rooms there. It adds so fun memories to your trip but pack some warm clothes!Finally keshab, our guide , Prakash, yadop and bassu were an amazing crew taking great care of our safety and needs at all Times.

            "review": "Annapurna Circuit Trek. My husband and I organised a bespoke Annapurna Trek via Chhatra. He was very patient, answering our hundred and one questions via email while we were working on our itinerary. We had planned to trek to Jomsom and fly to Pokhara, but upon hearing of a recent plane crash on that route Chhatra contacted us and suggested some alternatives, which was much appreciated. Having not been trekking at altitude before we selected to trek with a guide and porter. Our porter, Bishnu, was excellent. Our guide, Tshering, was very experienced. He knew the route very well and pointed out landmarks, some local history and the names of the mountain peaks as we trekked along. Both Bishnu and Tshering were courteous, never making us feel rushed and making sure they never lost sight of us or left us behind, particularly when we got higher in altitude. After having planned an itinerary with Chhatra, Tshering made changes from the outset without discussing the changes with us. As it turns out, this allowed us additional time at the end in Pokhara (and we really liked Pokhara), but we would've preferred to have a discussion about the changes first. Not all of the guesthouses we stayed in were ones we would've selected for ourselves, so if we come back to Nepal we would agree with the guide/company to select our own guesthouses along the way. Annapurna is an excellent trek; we would definitely recommend it and would recommend Nepal Eco Adventure."

So I decided to boot the Everest Base Camp Trek + Island Peak, which was a really good decision!Everything was arranged perfectly: the airport pickup, the Kathmandu sightseeing tour, the trek to Everest base camp, and the climb to Island peak. The trek to EBC was absolutely amazing. We had the best guide: Keshab. A great, knowledgeable local guide, always happy to help. Also we had two great porters: Bishnu and Santa, very strong guys. The trek is demanding (but very doable with some mountain experience) but really beautiful, great views!! Very nice lodges, especially the small ones owned by local family. And surprisingly good food, just make sure to be a vegetarian during the trek for safety reasons ;)The climb to Island Peak was really an unforgettable experience. Camping close to a glacier lake surrounded by beautiful mountains. Crazy mountain chickens. And a very, very demanding climb to the top. If you want it bad enough you can make it. What an astonishing view from the top. After the trek chhatra helped us to plan the rest of our trip to Pokhara, kayaking and Chitwan NP. We really had a great time in Nepal.I absolutely recommend this company! You will be assured of great service and an excellent Nepal experience!!"

If you are a solo traveller, I would strongly recommend this company as I would definitely have them as my first priority next when I visit Nepal even with a group of friends. Though there was a hiccup in my rafting trip, due to lack of time, I was asked to cancel my rafting trip which was a little disappointing (I was refunded for that part of my tour).

I have lived at sea level (Florida, USA) for the past decade and in no way trained for this experience. But it's Nepal and trekking is pretty much the top tourist magnet here. Turns out, it's totally worth the hype.This was my first visit to Nepal and a visa was pretty easy to get on arrival. Tourism is their biggest industry and it\u2019s down significantly after the earthquake so I highly recommend a visit. Normally I travel independently but I was glad I booked my trek with Chhatra & Nepal Eco Adventure (instead of trekking solo) because all the transportation and trekking permits were included. Pro tip: Bring several extra passport photos with you for the permits! That being said, the trips aren\u2019t 100% all inclusive. You\u2019ll need some money for souvenirs, meals in the cities and to tip your guide and porter and the end of your trek. The 10-day Annapurna Circuit trekking trip I enjoyed during March 2016 actually included a tour of Kathmandu beforehand which happened to be during the annual Holi Festival so it was an extra treat! All of the accommodations were clean and comfortable. You will also have a few nights in Pokhara, which is a beautiful little lakeside town with all the comforts of home to enjoy before and after your trek. Obviously the rooms are a little more rustic once you get on the trail, but they all had solar-powered hot showers and hot food. I am a solo female traveler but was glad to be grouped with fellow trekkers Julienne from Canada, Deepak from Singapore and our guides Kumar and Babu. This wasn\u2019t due to safety - I felt totally safe during my almost month total travels in Nepal - it is more the social aspect and having a few others to share this incredible experience with. D and I also shared a porter named Subus. (A porter carries your bag for you.) Everyone was so friendly and helpful and Kumar and Babu even prepared fresh fruit for us every night as an extra treat! The weather was amazing but the temperature obviously gets cooler the higher you hike so you make sure you have layers. I recommend packing as light as possible. You really don\u2019t need much: two changes of clothes plus an under-layer, hiking books plus one pair of sandals/shower shoes, scarf, hat, sunglasses and small, basic toiletries. Electricity and wifi can be spotty so just bring one electronic necessity like a smartphone or a camera. Pro tip: If you forget mittens or gloves like I did, just use an extra pair of socks!"

They took into account days where we weren't feeling our best due to the altitude or various reasons and planned our trip out such that we would not miss anything. Chhatra was extremely efficient in organizing everything from our arrival at Kathmandu to flights to-from pokkahara as well as the major part of the trip which was our Mustang trek. Since I was not in my best shape possible and found myself straggling at end of the trekking party most of the time, there was always one guide beside me to assess if I needed help and to encourage me to push on.

Chhatra (head of the company) is responsible person and answers all your questions before the trip. Also he is always trying to meet your wishes. We had two porters -Omit and Poti (sorry for the probably wrong writing) on 5 people and one guide - Shiva. They all were friendly with us and helpful. Especially I would like to thank Poti, who was very responsive and kind, great person! Shiva was ready to answer the questions about current place, culture and nature and was very polite. Our group was very diverse in a sense of physical training, mountaineering experience and age, but the Eco team found good approach. Also we had never lost the way. We think that our driver - Shreehari was the best driver in Nepal, many thanks to him one more time. After the trekking we had an excursion to the Kathmandu valley (Heritage tour). Our guide had a deep knowledge about the area and good English, showed a lot of amazing places. All team members were in time and picked us up directly at the hotel. Many thanks to all of you Nepal Eco Adventure members!'-': After the trip guys, who helped with rucksacks, were very disappointed about received tips, it was about 35 $ per person for 10 days. We paid to the company good money and were sure that guys have good salary. It was not a big pleasure to have such reaction taking into account that for us the price tour was not an easy weight. It seems that their salary is very small even in such company. Before the trip we talked with Chhatra about two peaks on a way: Tsergo Ri and Surya peaks. They both do not have technical difficulties. And our guide was aimed to show the way. With Tsergo Ri all was ok, however when we came to second one, Shiva did not know the way, which is of course can be, but he did not ask local people about the best route (there are several). After our question he talked with a men in our tea house and suggested one rout in an abstract manner. But he said that he will not go, because it is quite dangerous and did not recommend us to do it either, but this men can show the way for 10000 NPR. For my parents we ordered before the trekking trip to Nagarkot. In the end of the dry season there is zero visibility on the top of the hill, it is better to know this in advance."

Although, July is rainy season in Nepal, I decided to make the best of it and contacted Chhatra to get a trekk organized for me. Chhatra answered all my emails, which where both many and detailed, without any delay and within a few days he had a 9 days trekk to Annapurna Base Camp organized for me. Many thanks for all your help Chhatra! July is not a good month for trekking with all the rain and I was prepared for the worst. However, I got surprisingly many days with sunshine and good visibility. As well as a morning in the base camp when the clouds lifted from the mountains and the beautiful Annapurna was revealed to me. Having a porter and guide was really excellent. Especially since my guide, Bijayrah Karki, was very knowledgeable about birds and we had many excellent bird sightings. Definitely a good idea to have a guide with an interest that is interesting to talk about when walking through the forests up to higher ground. When returning to Kathmandu, I also got a very interesting cultural tourist tour of Kathmandu with Raju Suwal and I was amazed with his detailed knowledge about Kathmandu. One item to keep in mind when organizing a trip like this, I took the 7,5 hours bus between Pokhara and Kathmandu after returning from the trekk. Although, the scenery is great, 7,5 hours is a very long trip on bad roads. Next time I will pay the extra to fly home to Kathmandu rather than taking the bus. To sum up, a surprisingly good trekk despite being rainy season and a very well organized tour by Eco Adventure. Many thanks to you all at Nepal Eco!"

As I am not the best shape I found the trek relatively demanding but the tour itself was amazing. we booked a tour with guide, porter 3 meals per day and accomodation. The organisation was perfect. Nik our guide made sure that we are happy and safe all the time. We were very very lucky to have him as a guide. His english is really good and he explained us a lot. He\u00b4s also got a great sense of humour which was very helpful during the tough parts of the hike ;) Also the food is really good. In total we had a fantastic time and the best organised tour we could get for such a trip!"

From the first time I emailed Chhatra to discuss possibilities of my amazing experience, to the first meeting to introducing to me to my awesome porter/guide, (Santosh), to my sad goodbyes, they were nothing but caring, attentive, informative and passionate for their customer, ME!!! I was fortunate to travel 14 days solo up to the Thorong Pass on Annapurna (5416M) I was very nervous, unfit and unsure I could make it and Santosh lead me though the difficult times with great care and attention. I would HIGHLY recommend the Annapurna Throng Pass and definitely suggest you use Nepal Eco Adventure for your arrangement whatever they may be. Good Luck and if you have doubt DONT! JUST DO IT!!!!"

Despite it being a tough trek, the cloudy weather made it all so mystical especially with so many beautiful wild animals roaming around. Our driver (Shreehari), guide (Narayan) and porter (Janak) were excellent, patient and extremely kind. They looked after us before, during and after the trek - from teaching us how to speak locally, sharing stories about their country and its people with us and bringing us around Kathmandu after the hike. The Nepalese people are a wonderful bunch and our hearts were sore when we had to leave. Thank you Nepal Eco Adventure!"

The groups remained small and personable, for me 5 people + 2 guides. Guides were friendly, knowledgeable, with good english and made safety their number 1 priority. They traveled at a pace based on the groups discretion. We stayed at clean and comfortable homestays with excellent food options (Pastas, Pizza, and of course Dal Bhat and Momo). Price was budget friendly compared to other tour companies and we seemed to get just about everything that other companies provided to their groups staying at the same locations. I would highly recommend this company and experience of a lifetime to all adventure seekers out there! Thanks Nepal Eco Adventure for the memories!"

This was BY FAR the most fulfilling trip of my life, and I am so very thankful I chose Nepal Eco Adventure to help get me there. I admit there was a lot of anxiety about the trip before making the 8,000 mile journey to Kathmandu but whatever worries and concerns I had were quickly diminished after dealing with both the tour operator, Chhatra, and then with my Guide Bijay.  To start with, my flight was cancelled the day of to Abu Dhabi and the next wasn't available until 3 days later. I was so stressed that I was going to have to find a new guide company but Chhatra replied to my email immediately saying that he took care of it and rescheduled my trip AT NO EXTRA CHARGE! That includes my ticket from Kathmandu to Lukla, my guide who was to meet me in the city, as well as any lodging issues.  When I finally made it to Kathmandu I was introduced to my guide. I was honestly a little nervous about this as well, seeing as how I was gonna be spending day and night travelling with this person for two and a half weeks, but we got on great! Bijay was attentive, knowledgeable, and always carried a warm personality even when I was ill with altitude sickness. He made sure to get me a bed in the nicest lodges available and had fresh fruit every evening to go with my dinner. My oxygen levels were checked twice a day and we walked at MY pace, which made a big difference.  If you want to have the greatest adventure of your life, going in with confidence that you will be taken care of the entire way with a very professional company then I can't reccomend Nepal Eco Adventure enough!!!!! Have fun, and ask for Bijay!!!"

I spent close to 40 days in Nepal in April/May of 2016. I booked solo and met fantastic people in my hiking group and while hiking. Both the Annapurna Circuit and EBC/Chola/Gokyo are beautiful in their own way. I highly recommend doing both treks if it is your first time in Nepal. Chhatra is super organized and everything was taken care of. The lodges we stayed at were fine - no thrills but none needed - you're in the mountains in the Himalayan range which is all you can ask for. Our guide was great - Narayen. He knew all the ins and outs. The only snag we unfortunately ran into was in Lukla on our way back to Kathmandu at the end of the trip - but most of that was due to unfavorable weather, causing us to spend an extra 2 days in Lukla trying to catch a flight out. Perhaps more attention could have been given here to prioritize us on a flight out but it is what it is, no biggie. All in all, my experience in Nepal and with Eco Adventure was excellent. Please don't take high elevation lightly - make sure you've tested your body with previous high altitude hikes/climbs - just a general statement. Nepal is a beautiful nation and the people in the countryside are genuine and goodhearted."

Trekkers who required help due to medical issues and also, as in my case with AMS, guides were able to handle and deal with the situation well. The lodging and fooding arrangements while on the trek were also looked after by our Trek agency.Needless to say that with administrative arrangements being taken care of so well and medical issues being looked into ,our group had an excellent trek amidst the mighty ranges of Himalayas. By virtually being in the laps of Mt Everest for almost three weeks, we came back much richer and humbled. Given a chance i would like to trek again with Nepal Eco adventure and would surely recommend the agency to other trekkers.Thankyou Chhatra for making this opportunity a most memorable one!"

As part of a group trek, I did the Everest Base Camp & 3 Passes (Kongma La, Cho La, Renjo La) trek with Nepal Eco Adventure this Apr 2016, spanning around 3 weeks. This was a challenging and strenuous high altitude trek with all 3 passes above 18,000 ft, EBC at 17,500 ft and Kala Patthar at 18,500 ft. Chhatra Karki, who runs Nepal Eco, carried out the entire planning and logistics for this trek. Chhatra is extremely knowledgeable about the routes on this trek and was very responsive, detailed, helpful and flexible right from the first interaction we had till much after completing the trek. The trek guides and porters he provided were strong & competent, had a focus on safety, were polite and helpful and most of them had prior experience trekking these routes. Boarding, lodging and food was excellent throughout the trek relative to the tea house facilities available on these routes. Chhatra\u2019s information and advice around weather conditions, altitude sickness, safety, health, water & food aspects were very useful. Later during the trek as we improvised on the itinerary to save time, Chhatra responded flexibly (and patiently), at short notice, in re-booking flights, boarding & lodging to accommodate our changes. The trek in itself, for the most part, comprised of long 5-8 hour walks over 15000 ft, through steep inclines, snowy & icy paths, huge glaciers, moraine, scree and pretty cold conditions. These challenges, however, were well rewarded with magnificent views of the highest Himalayan ranges, stunning landscapes, mesmerizing alpine lakes, unique flora & fauna, serene monasteries, beautiful countryside, great food and lovely local people. All in all a truly memorable trek! As regards areas for improvement, some of the trek guides could develop deeper knowledge about the culture and history of the local places and people on these routes that would add to enriching the overall experience. Kumar Jirel, one of the trekking guides, while competent, could develop a bit more empathy for client trekkers not as experienced. As a disclaimer, I am not affiliated in any way or work for Nepal Eco nor do I write too many reviews. But, that said, I would have no hesitation in trekking again with Nepal Eco and would recommend them for those looking to trek in Nepal."

Last spring I did a 18 days trek in Sagarmatha National Park with my husband (30 years old) and my parents (58 and 65) - my best trekking experience ever! I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure and this trek, a beautiful and challenging one called the Three High Passes Trek. This was my second time in Nepal. The first time I was with another trekking company and Nepal Eco Adventure was definitely much better although the trek costed exactly the same price. Before the trek, Chhatra was very helpful and responsive, he gave us great advice to help us choose the trek and the equipment. Then he took care of everything very efficiently for us, including the trek permit and the hotel reservation in Kathmandu where he made sure we had the best rooms. The trek was wonderful, beautiful landscapes and people and excellent accomodation. Many of the owners of the lodges were good friends of our guide so there was also a nice and fun atmosphere. Our guide Rajesh was very friendly but also serious and responsible and he knew everything about the area. He spoke excellent English and some French too :) He told us a lot of interesting stories and we learned a lot about the Sherpa culture and Nepal in general thanks to him. Our porters, Man and Chhitra, were incredibly nice, friendly and helpful, they understood English well and we had an excellent time with them. Rajesh was very flexible and clever. When we arrived at EBC, my parents were very tired, they found the trek too challenging, had altitude sickness and didn't feel like crossing the remaining high passes. Instead of having the four of us go down together, Rajesh proposed an alternative that suited everyone: my parents went down with one of the porters while my husband and I continued and did the whole trek. The four of us were extremely pleased with our experience and if we come back to Nepal for a trek we will definitely choose Nepal Eco Adventure again."

Let me start by saying it was a wonderful experience and Nepal Eco Adventures is really the people you want to do it with. I am not going to lie, I was a bit hesitant about the trek and our ability to get to base camp before we started. Chhatra was very patient and offered a lot of good advice and assistance in helping us achieve this dream. He was always quick to reply our emails/questions, and always polite and courteous. His staff are also all very professional and friendly. We had Rajesh as our guide. He was very attentive to our needs and our health during the trek, always making sure we stay hydrated and keeping an eye on how altitude affected us. We were a bit slower on the trek, but Rajesh was very patient the whole way. We met quite a few other trekkers on this trip, and I really can't say the same about other trekking companies. We met guides who argued with their clients. There were also guides from other companies who drank too much off duty. My advice is be careful who you hire, and really consider Nepal Eco Adventures to make sure your holiday is safe and enjoyable. I don't work for Nepal Eco Adventures. I don't get commission from them. I am just another tourist from Canada. I don't write too many reviews but this awesome company really deserves a mention."

My husband did the Everest base camp trek last year and thought that it would be a good idea for us to do the upper mustang trek together. We did have our apprehensions but decided to just do it. We met part of our team in Kathmandu upon arrival at the airport and the others at Chattra's office and I felt like I could trust and connect with them almost immediately. After enjoying the chaos of Kathmandu and the calmness of Pokkhara, we took our flight up to Jomsom together with our guides Shiva and Narayan. We met our horseman Binod and his 2 horses. We rented 2 horses for the kids in case they got tired of walking. But I ended up riding the horse whenever I had a chance as it was so enjoyable. We also met our third guide Nikhil and our porter Munggal. Philipp our 8 year old decided that he was not comfortable on the horse on the first trekking day and Nikhil constructed a seat out of wood and cushion and piggy backed him through the mountains. They were inseparable after the second day.Narayan and Shiva were both great guides as they had different strengths. And we all got along well. Narayan had been on this trail often and he knew the trail inside out and shared stories about what the trail was like when it first opened up to tourists in 1992. Shiva shared lots of insights into the Nepalese culture and the current situation of the country after last year's earthquake. Although at certain points, we all experienced a certain degree of altitude sickness, were cold, got sick and were living outside of our comfort zone, we had full confidence in our team. The team was fun, my kids were happy, the adults were happy, the Dahl baht was good, my kids ate well, and the scenery was just amazing. We stopped at various tea houses and met strong resilient people who smiled a lot. I am humbled by our adventure and have a deep respect for the resilience of the people that we met in Nepal. Maybe we'll have another Himalayan adventure next year :)"

I was a bit nervous to embark on my journey as I never trekked before and it was my first time in Nepal, however Nepal Eco Adventure made me feel welcome and answered all my questions. Before arriving to Nepal I had several questions about the adventure, things to brings and what to expect. I contacted the company several times and got responses right away ( within 1or 2 hours) to all my questions. Chattra was very helpful and made me feel right away at ease.Once I arrived to Nepal everything was well organized and went according to the schedule. We (my father and I) were greeted by our guide and transported to our hotel with explanations of what will happen the following day ( city tour and meeting at the agency to have an overview of our trip).The following day as planned we had our city tour, with beautiful sightseeing and explanations about the local culture, customs and life style. Later that day we were brought to the office to pick up equipment that we needed ( sleeping bag, trekking poles) . We also met our guide who explained to us what to pack with us and how next day will go ( flying to Lukla).Next day we were transported to the airport and since we had an early flight that was booked by Nepal Eco Adventure we were able to fly to Lukla within 1hr of arrival to airport. Once in Lukla our trekking began with beautiful scenery surrounding us. Our trek included Everest Base Camp and then Chola Pass and Gokyo Ri. Throughout the journey we received many explanations about what we were seeing and where we were going from our guide. Our oxygen level was measured every evening which was very helpful and just re-confirming that we were all in good shape to continue our trekking. The acclimatization days were also very helpful to adjust to high elevations.Overall the trekking was absolutely amazing, we met interesting people, saw beautiful scenery and had personal experiences that I won\u2019t forget.Once we arrived back to Katmandu we met again Chattra from Nepal Eco Adventure who asked us how our trip went. We can feel and I know he really cares about our experience and works hard to ensure that we have a great trip not only trekking but also once we are back to the city. We spend 2 days in the city upon which the company arranged airport pick up for us and we were transported to catch our plane and be back to the reality as Nepal seemed an absolute dream!!!! I strongly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure to anyone who is planning a trekking trip to Nepal. They have deliver on their service, attention and care!Thank you!!!!!I will be back, Nepal!!!"

I landed in Kathmandu on the 14/05/16 greeted at the airport by Ram and taken to the Nepal Access Hotel.I then went to meet chhattra, the team, paid my deposit and had a briefing on what to expect whilst trekking, which would commence on the 16/05/16On the 15/05/16 we had a guided tour of Kathmandu which was excellent and a great way to get to know the group of people I was trekking with.The 16th arrived and so did the dreaded flight to Lukla (actually it wasn't too bad- Goma air has nice new planes) to begin our 12 days of walking... Every day was absolutely fantastic! our lead guide Ram was extremely knowledgeable, kind and supportive. He made sure we were all ok and tailored each day to meet all of our needs at a pace that kept us all comfortable. Santosh our second guide was there to lead the guys with a faster pace and kept us all amused with his sense of humour. I can't praise these two enough and I'm glad I got to spend 12 days under there care. If we had any worries or concerns they soon put our minds to rest which made me feel safe and relaxed during the entire trip.Our days were spent walking- taking in the scenery and our evenings playing cards together. My only query although not big enough to knock a star off my rating was that I booked this as 16 days rather than the 15 stated on the website at the agreed price with chhattra and then received an email from him (whilst in Kathmandu) stating I had to pay an additional $40 to the hotel Access Nepal to stay the final night or find a new hotel. I would have understood if this had of been mentioned at the time of booking the trip but it was a little inconvenient whilst actually in Nepal when I was under the impression that everything was paid for in the itinerary I received at the time of booking.Regardless of this, Overall the Everest base camp trip surpassed my expectations, I had the most fantastic time. I made friendships that will last a lifetime and to be in the company of the great Himalayas is an experience I shall treasure forever! You can't beat the knowledge and attentiveness of the guides, and the speedy response from chhattra, In my opinion you can't beat it and I would recommend everyone to use Nepal Eco adventures for their travels in Nepal.Hopefully I'll be back soon to tackle Annapurna :) thanks for everything Sam"

All the way from BhuleBhule to Porkhara.As an inexperienced and unfit trekker, it was nice to have a very knowledgeable and one of the most nicest guide and of course porter ever. Bam was familiar with the route and all the significant points and views. I found it convenient for me to have someone help with my luggage and a well laid out itinerary. That is what I would call a nice vacation. Hands off!!Remember to bring a camera, for those who love photgraphy, some reading material, some nice music for those who love their own company and some nice companion. But like a friend of mine said, always remember to savour the moment with your eyes before you take it all in the camera.In short, It was one of the best experiences I have had in my life."

With 3 weeks to prepare and as a solo female traveller, I feel lucky to have found Nepal Eco Adventures. From the very first correspondence, I knew I was in good hands and all the positive reviews only reinforced my feelings. Chhatra was very responsive and patient with my multiple email inquiries. I considered different times and trek options, eventually settling on doing the EBC trek with Gokyo Lakes and Cho La Pass. Even though it was longer than the standard EBC trek, it made for a more unique and breathtaking loop. The trek was very well planned \u2013 including 2 days in Kathmandu before flying to Lukla, and then having 3 extra days at the end to allow to return to Kathmandu in case of bad weather in Lukla. Our group actually experienced weather related delays on the way back, so I was lucky to have had all these extra days, otherwise, I\u2019d miss my international flight back to Canada. About the trek \u2013 it was a trip of a lifetime with breathtaking scenery, wonderful people, and memories that will last forever. Again, I was lucky to find myself in a group with 3 other travellers, all from different countries and even continents. We all got along great, had similar pace when trekking, and had a wonderful time overall. Narayan Rai was our guide. Not only does he have extensive trekking, mountaineering, and rescue experience, but I swear he knows all the local people and speaks a bit of all languages that you may encounter on the trek. Always in a good mood, smiling, and positive, he is a very gifted \u201cpeople person\u201d. Narayan made our experience very special by choosing to bring us to very interesting Tea houses and restaurants, some of which were owned by Sherpa who were either part of the Everest expedition now, or have done one (and even several) before! Imagine talking to someone who climbed Everest 10 times or being able to visit a tent at Base Camp! All thanks to Narayan. Narayan was also very attentive and helpful in all situations, including when I got stomach sickness and had to spend one of the rest days in bed. Having him measure my oxygen was helpful because it confirmed that it was not altitude sickness. During the trek, I tried to follow Narayan as much as possible- he made trekking look so effortless, no matter at what altitude. Later on, when I would get very tired, he stayed back and walked with me. I cannot say enough good things about Narayan and express my gratitude for this experience. As for my brief stay in Kathmandu, the hotel was very comfortable, even though I was worried because in some of the trip advisor reviews people were not too happy. All I can say is that I was surprised how luxurious it was and I would definitely stay there again. Our city guide was Raju, a walking encyclopedia! He introduced us to the culture, religions, history, politics, etc. Raju was not only knowledgeable but also very charismatic and personable. He also has a great voice - made a great singer together with the driver, which to this moment represents one of the happiest memories from the trip. Overall, I cannot say enough good things about my experience with Nepal Eco Adventures. I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone looking for an authentic experience of trekking in Nepal. Thank you to the entire Nepal Eco Adventure Team."

It was a spur of the moment decision-- 20% based on testimonials and 80% side-by-side comparison versus other companies.If I were to undergo the process all over again, I would look no further than the testimonials about this team. Surely, people will recognize the warm, personal, yet utterly professional approach that Chhatra, Ram, Santosh, the porters and even their drivers use.As we've experienced (you may refer to my wife, @patriciacpab 's posts), we were simply awed by the wonders of the entire trek despite the massive physical undertaking. And this is because NEA faciltiated everything smoothly. Some top strong points for NEA:> Chhatra's timely response to our first query. First impressions last.> NEA is very sincere with their recommendations, ie when to book your trip, the people you're going to be grouped with, why we shouldn't be anxious abut certain things... This speaks highly of the company's values.>Profile of their guides. I've met two of their lead guides, but I could only speak fully about RAM, the alpha-guide. His trekking skills are top-notch--from basic mountaineering to practical reasons such as when to take a shower. Ram is very reliable. Like NEA, Ram is sincere in ensuring that you feel safe and satisfied throughout the trek. Other trekking groups even consult him! This happened when one of the members of another group was suffering severe AMS-- good thing that Ram/NEA carries around their own oxymeter!>NEA maintains a good network among hotels and stops. You don't have to worry about missing a slot, or even missing a table.>NEA is a highly local company. We felt that in supporting NEA, a relatively small trekking company we were 100% supportive of the local economy. (Sure, they don't carry around reservation signs for our dinner table, but they make things happen!)Our EBC trek is the best, most out-of-this-world and exciting trip we've ever done and I just can't imagine taking NEA out of the equation."

            "review": "Awesome Annapurna Circuit. The Annapurna Circuit was an incredible and memorable trek organised by Nepal Eco Adventures: I chose a 18 day trek, which was actually around 14 days of walking from Besisahar to Ghorepani and then Nahyipul, 1 day acclimitisation in Manang, 1 full day in Pokhara and 2 days of travel (to and from Kathmandu). Our guide, Bam Magar, was phenomenal -- extremely knowledgeable about the different routes, very experienced (been a guide since the early 1990s), knew some really good places to eat and sleep, was very flexible, and was a good travel companion. Over the course of 14 days, I got to know quite a few of the guides, and Bam was definitely one of the best -- so would recommend asking for him (he also books groups privately).The route is very manageable and most days we would finish the days walking soon after lunch. Perhaps it would take an extra hour or two for a less fit group (so on average 5-6 hours/day, including stops for breaks and lunch). Our route was as follows:Day 01:Drive from Kathmandu to besisahar/Balbule (923m). -- VERY VERY long drive. lots of traffic, slow moving, took about 10 hours. Day 02:Trek to Jagat (1410m). -- Jagat is a beautiful town, but the walk here is not particularly exciting. I think Jagat or Syenge would be good starting placesDay 03:Trek to Dharapani (2160m).Day 04:Trek to Chame (2710m). -- beautiful locationDay 05:Trek to Upper Pisang (3240m). -- beautiful locationDay 06:Trek to Manang (3540m). -- recommend taking upper route, rather than the road.Day 07:Acclimatization day at Manang. -- must do walk to monastery, ice lake or Gangapurna glacier lake -- great viewsDay 08:Trek to Yak Kharka (4120m). --very short day, but necessary for acclimitisationDay 09:Trek to Thorung Phedi (4,560m). --very short day, but necessary for acclimitisationDay 10:Over Thorung La (5,416m) to Muktinath (3,802m). -- long tough day, but well worth it! I would recommend NOT staying in Muktinah, but rather walking to next town (20 minutes away) of Jharkot (much more rustic and interesting and less touristy). If you have the extra energy, can even do the 2-3 hour walk to Kagbeni!Day 11:Trek to Kagbeni (2840m). -- if you're on a tight schedule, can just walk through Kagbeni (to see the beautiful Mustang desert landscape) and stop in Marpha for the nightDay 12:Trek to Marpha(2670m) -- fantastic, must stay here! beautiful white lime-washed walled town.Day 13:Trek to kalopani(2530m) -- town has great mountain views, but town itself is dissapointing. Next town over Lede seemed less touristy and more beautiful.Day 14:Trek to Tatopani(1290m) Natural hot spring. -- I'm not that interested in concrete hot springs, next time will stay in smaller village.Day 15:Trek to Ghorepani (2750m). -- spectacular views from top of the hill (Superior Hill Hotel)Day 16:Early morning trek up to Poonhill and trek down to Nayapul then taxi to Pokhara. -- Great views from top of PoonhillDay 17: Pokahara -- worth spending an extra day here, drinking beer and relaxing by the lake.Day 18:Drive back to Kathmandu, transfer to hotel. -- VERY VERY long drive. lots of traffic, slow moving, took about 10 hours.I chose to go with a trekking company because I didn't want the hassle of organising transport, porters, accommodation, permits, food, etc. And Nepal Eco Adventures did a superb job, and I would recommend them to anyone. Retrospectively, it is relatively easy to organise these things, but it is still a pleasure to have everything sorted so efficiently by Nepal Eco Adventures. Chatra was also very helpful and quick in replying to emails, and very flexible with developing the itinerary. The company also gave the best value for money deal of any of the companies I explored.However, if you are a very fit/athletic person like me and experienced trekker, you may consider doing the route by yourself at your own pace, as it's very well marked trail and there are many places to eat and stay, and very safe. In this way you can adjust your route/walking distances as you feel fit. I would highly recommend the seamless experience provided by Nepal Eco Adventures for any standard trek in Nepal. But especially if you are NOT an experienced trekker, or don't have the fitness to do it alone, or don't want the hassles of organising any of the finer details!"

In addition to being patient (we were stopping all the time to take photos) Narayan was very observant, showing and telling us about wildlife and plants along the way and he knows a lot about the area and its history and culture. He is a very experienced guide as well as being calm, reliable and always in a good mood!We went on a six day trek from Syabrubesi to Kyanjin Gompa and a small peak just above the village. It was terrible to see the damage last year's earthquake had done in the valley, especially in Langtang, but everyone were working from early morning till nightfall to restore the the place. All the lodges we stayed at were very charming and the staff was always friendly and helpful, making us feel like home. We were very lucky with clear weather almost every day despite going trekking in the monsoon season, and I will absolutely recommend visiting this beautiful place with Nepal Eco Adventure. Having someone who takes care of everything; accommodation, meals, transport etc. is so comfortable, you won't have to do anything else than walk and enjoy the view!PS. Be prepared for a long and bumpy bus drive between Kathmandu and Syabrubesi, the view makes it worth it!"

They take care of everything for you (hire porters, take care of TIMS card, national park permit, book flights, sleeping bags, etc) and at a reasonable price! We were always in good hands with our guide Nir. Not only was he was very knowledgable and experienced guide, but also incredibly kind. When I was feeling some of the negative side effects of the altitude, he was always sure to check in on me and make me feel better. Plus he always had a good stash of Happy happy's(chocolate chip cookies) available! I'd highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventures to anyone considering doing trekking in Nepal - especially with Nir!"

We were very pleased with the organization for the whole duration of our first trip, so we absolutely did not even think to switch to another trekking agency. I can recommend them for any of the standard trips that are being offered in Nepal. In our case, we had the same guide on both trips but we have met some other of their groups on the way and all the guides that we saw all were very knowledgeable and friendly.

            "review": "Great Local Company & Tour to Everest Base Camp. We recently returned from a private tour to Everest Base Camp with Nepal Eco Adventure. I decided to go through this company due to the great reviews on TripAdvisor. We also decided that doing a private tour would be a much better option than a big group tour - as we could be flexible with our trekking times and walk up to Everest Base Camp at our own pace.From the moment I contacted their office, Chhatra (manager) was very helpful and very flexible in planning our trek for us. He speaks wonderful English and looked after us very well. Our booking was made in 2015 before the earthquake in Nepal. Due to nerves, we asked if we could postpone our tour to 2016, which Chhatra had no problem in doing for us. We are very thankful for this. His prices and itineraries are very good and you'll find them a lot better value than a majority of the other bigger companies around.Upon arrival in Kathmandu, the airport is a crazy place and were glad that we had our own private transfer waiting for us. They took us to the office where we picked up our trekking gear and then headed to the Radisson (great accommodation in Nepal by the way) for a couple nights. It must be noted that Chhatra provided us with sleeping bags, duffle bags and trekking poles - which saved us buying our own. A nice touch from the company.The first part of the tour was a city tour around Nepal. Unfortunately, a lot of the city is still in the rebuild phase after the earthquake and while it is sad to see, it was a rather long day looking at the same sort of stuff. It probably could have been half the length that it was. Our guide for the day was ok, but he did seem more interested in taking phone calls than playing tour guide. The driver was fantastic though and I was still glad to have seen everything I did!When the time came to fly up to the mountains and start the trek, we were picked up from our hotel and really looked after by our guide, Ram (there's 2 Ram's at Nepal Eco Adventure - we had Big Ram). He checked us in and helped us with getting our luggage sorted. He also helped us get the best seats on the small plane so we could get the best views over the mountains as we flew into Lukla. His 20 years trekking experience really shows as he knows everybody and everyone is so glad to see his smiley face.For the whole trek, Ram was very patient with us. We were very slow walkers compared to most on the trails as we had never been at altitude before, so some of the days really took it out of us. But Ram never complained and always stayed a few feet in front to help us keep going. We never felt rushed and he always encouraged us to stop and take rests and photos.The accommodation that was chosen for us was always indoors in cosy little teahouses. While these are fairly basic hotels, the ones Ram chose for us were of very good quality compared to what other people were staying in. The toilets were mainly western style and the rooms were generally spacious enough with comfortable beds. I felt this was a much better option than going on a World Expeditions Tour - where they have to stay in tents and use outside toilets! I could only imagine how cold those poor people would be! The communal dining area in each teahouse was always warm in the evening when they started up the fire. The food at every stop is basically the same - loads of carbs (pizza, pasta, sandwiches, potatoes, etc.)! But in saying that, it is fantastic food and we never went hungry. You all need to try a Mars or Snickers roll when you go - AMAZING! The owners at each guesthouse were friendly and very accommodating. The scenery itself is what you'd expect in the Everest region - spectacular! Every day would bring new views, new mountains to see and amazing photo opportunities. The weather was great - sunny skies every day until about 2pm, and then the afternoon cloud would roll in and cool things down. While it did snow and the winds were cold, it was quite pleasant in the sun while we were trekking and by the time is cooled down, we were generally indoors anyway. Some days we braved very cold winds and cloud (about -15c), but if you're dressed appropriately, then it's fine.The trek itself is not for the faint-hearted. It is pretty tough going and there were times where we wanted to turn around and just go home. But everyone has these thoughts, and it is a mental game to make it all the way to Everest Base Camp. When you finally reach it though, you are glad you stuck it out and put in the massive effort to make it. It's a once in a lifetime experience that only very few can say they have achieved.One of the highlights of our trip was actually our porter - Rodna. He was a young, 26 year old Nepalese lad who grew up in the mountain region. He was so little and skinny, yet so strong as he carried both of our very heavy duffle bags each day. He worked so hard and we are so very thankful for all his hard work. We could tell he was very poor, but he always had a smile on his face and went out of his way to look after us. While he spoke very little English, we believe this brought an extra charm to his ways. He taught us card games, was always singing and never failed to bring us fresh fruit each night after dinner. I really hope Chhatra knows how valuable Rodna is to his team - a wonderful little porter!Overall, this was a fantastic trip that has memories that will stick with us for a lifetime. While it is tiring, it is definitely worth the effort to say you've made it to Base Camp and to see the wonderful sights of the Himalayas! We wouldn't have made it without our wonderful guide Ram and his little sidekick Rodna - thank you ever so much, boys! Chhatra's experience in trekking and running a business is wonderful and it was a pleasure dealing with him. Thanks for making our EBC dreams come true!If you're a bit worried about heading to Nepal after the Earthquake, don't be. While some older buildings and roads are still getting rebuilt in Kathmandu,the mountain region is fine and there are no signs of the earthquake even occurring. The danger of another earthquake has passed and you should feel safe knowing you're in the very capable hands of Nepal Eco Adventure!Thanks for the wonderful adventure!"

Incredible scenery in an amazing country, along with Chhatra and Nepal Eco Adventures really did give me an unforgettable trekking experience. When booking the trip online, I was naturally a bit reserved as the package sounded extremely reasonable and I assumed there would be some hidden costs. However, I was wrong as everything was seamlessly taken care of and included, from airport transfers to hotel bookings to trekking permits! Chhatra is a lovely man who truly takes care of his customers, and really does go out of his way to give them unforgettable experiences. When speaking to Chhatra about his philosophy, he realises that price in no longer the determining factor that Trekkers look for when booking treks and therefore strives to deliver exceptional experiences (although the price is still really good!). I can confirm his company did this and cannot recommend Nepal Eco Adventures more for Nepal trekking holidays."

You will not find a better treatment and experience than the one Nepal Eco Adventure can provide through their dedication, experience and motivation to make everyone get the very best out of their travels in Nepal, this i guarantee.They were the best travelling partner i could ever have hoped for. My objective in Nepal was to go to Sindhupalchowk to see the true Nepal and to experience and document what life is like for those hardest affected by the earthquake. My translator, guide and now friend Raju was smart, knowledgable, kind, funny, courageous, reliable and indeed a great guide- but an even better person. My requests and destinations were by no means easy and accessible but Raju and Chattra did everything i could have ever wished for- and more in our attempts of getting there. Basically i could not have requested a more difficult task but with the help of Raju it was made overwhelmingly easy. Together me and Raju went to places very few ever go but in his company i couldn't have felt more comfortable. Nepal is a beautiful place with wonderful people and scenery and sharing them with a person as Raju added so much to an already incredible experience. Thank you so much for giving me an unforgettable time, i will stand by this agency as being the best in Asia for the rest of my life."

I travelled with two friends to Nepal in January and would highly recommend Nepal Eco Tours!Although January is not peak time to trek to Everest Base Camp, Chhatra was very enthusiastic for our trip and organised all the details with prompt emails - the process was very straight forward. He welcomed us to Nepal and is a very friendly guy. Nir was our guide for the trek and he was great. Knowledgable of the area and supportive when we had difficulties. He regularly checked our oxygen levels and heart rate to make sure we were acclimatising to the altitude. Our porter Mekman deserves a medal for carrying our gear!When one of our group fell ill, Nir and Chhatra were excellent at organising a helicopter back to Kathmandu and a hospital bed.We had great weather - very cold but sunny most days ensuring we got spectacular views. Also by trekking in January the route is fairly quiet so you feel you have it more to yourself but we still met great people to share the trip with.Our whole experience in Nepal was amazing. The Himalayas are incredible and I can't wait to return to the mountains. Our trip included a guided tour of Kathmandu which was fascinating and we enjoyed exploring vibrant Thamel.Trekking in Nepal is an incredible experience!! Go for it!"

He was what made the trip so special knowing you were in safe hands from the start. I would highly recommend the Everest Base Camp trip with this company as they made sure we had the best accommodation and food throughout the whole trip. The porter we had was friendly as well. There were times when I felt worried about things due to altitude e.t.c and Ram made me feel I was in the right hands at all times. Not at any point did I fear for my safety. They use a heart and breathing monitoring device as well that most companies don't use which again makes you feel safer. Anyway you won't regret using the company take my word. I plan to use them again next year for the Annupurna Circuit. Thanks again Chhatra and Ram. See you soon."

Being my first solo trip for my 30th birthday, this was a big deal to me. As said in a lot of other reviews, Chhatra is very timely and thorough with his responses. before my arrival we only communicated via email however he answered every one of my plentiful questions and put my mind at ease especially since this was my first solo trip ever. I booked everything 1 week before and they were still able to accommodate me. It's nice how Chhatra comes to the hotel in Kathmandu to meet the guests and answer any other questions they may have and just have a good conversation. After our first meeting at the hotel He took me shopping to find a few things I needed, and that really made me feel comfortable and less anxious as I was a bit scared to go out alone. After that I was walking around Thamel like a local. The Nepali people are so lovely, kind, humble and smiley. My driver in Kathmandu - Shreehari - is so cool, he could totally run his own party bus and drive around Kathmandu playing awesome music, as we had done a few times. Raju my guide for the whole trip is amazing - very attentive, accommodating, knowledgeable, funny and kind. My porter Govinda is so sweet, always smiling and never complained about my incredibly heavy bag which he carried with absolute ease, while I'm struggling up the steps with my backpack weighing 500grams. The lodges we stayed at on the trek were on point, I paid for a single room and always had private facilities. My favourite place was Ghorepani, met some really cool locals there and had the best time ever. I am planning on doing a longer trek the same time next year with Nepal Eco Adventres. Nepal is such a beautiful country with beautiful people. My advice when travelling in general, have a open-mind, a positive attitude and ALWAYS make time for the locals.If you're in a group or travelling solo, don't hesitate. Book now!"

He was really funny, didn't bombard us with facts about flora and fauna and the politico-historical situation, he just let us ease into the trek. We were paired up with a couple who never stopped complaining for the first few days and they were really high maintenance but once they finished we were able to properly enjoy the views, the walking and the tea houses. Our porter initially was a puny 22 year old student who was too weak to carry our bags so we replaced him with a proper local Sherpa who did a great job. I'm so grateful to Nepal Eco Adventure for organising all the paperwork to do with the climbing permits, assigning us such a great guide and plotting out an achievable and stunning route for us to do. So many great sights and variety in scenery - it was honestly amazing and humbling."

Was not that keen on the Katmandue hotel was in a noisy area and the linen stank of smoke. Breakfast next day was good. The 6 hour bus ride to Pokhara was very unpleasant. We only took the bus as we believed from the company litreture that we needed to allimaitse to the altitude. Pokhara it's self is a much more relaxed place than Katmandue and the 2nd hotel the Third Pole was basic but clean with friendly helpful staff. Start of the trek went well until, we started to clime the hundreds of steps and our guide was keener on keeping up with another party than staying back with us. It was very obvious from the start that our pace was much slower but he still talked us in to completing all the steps in one day. Again keeping up with the other party. We could not keep up the pace and insisted the guide stay with us. The next 2 days were much more enjoyable as we slowed our pace and were able to take pictures and rest when we needed to. I expected the accomadation to be basic but it was more so than I had thought. We changed our plans on the way back and took a jeep which cut out 2 hours walking. Back at the Third pole hotel we got a room with a bath which was really appreciate. (Will review hotel separately) We flew back to Katmandue (prearranged) We declined to stay in the original Katmandue hotel and booked into the Hyatt. (Was worth every penny)ConclusionShould have done more homework my selve and not relied on company information (to general)Wish I took thermals and a hot water bottle. Annapurna mountain range and Rhodadendrum Forrest spectacular sights. I am glad I have seen them."

The hotel choice is not good from Nepal Eco Adventures.Take a hot water bottle and get used to using a bucket at night. Take the sleeping bags offered and learn the Nepalise for slow down."

If you are considering a trek in Nepal and are based in Kathmandu, Eco Adventure Nepal should absolutely be first choice!Chhatra, the chap who will fill you in on everything about the trek that you are curious about, is an ex-guide and the business owner so knows his stuff! We turned up short of a few bits we required initially and were fitted up and supplied with the gear we lacked immediately at his office.We chose the Langtang Valley trek which begins in the Village of Syabru Bensi. Our guide, Nikhil Basnet (Nik) was excellent and more than willing to go over and above if needed! He sorted a more comfortable trip for us on the first leg (Kathmandu to Syabru Bensi). Which gave me some peace of mind considering my nervous disposition as a passenger on the road. We travelled by jeep instead of local bus at no extra cost.Each day we set off early and our meals were paid for breakfast, lunch and dinner as part of the initial cost. Each night we were given fresh fruit after dinner that Nik carried along the way in his bag. Along side this, a medical kit and phone for outside the mountainous region contact.We had chosen not to take a porter and carry our own kit.My friends and I struggled to keep the pace that Nik had. We are all in our early twenties and Nik is 10 years our senior. However, he caught on to our slow moving trekking and stuck either close in front or behind with us, letting us stop for a snack and drink when we were in need. We trekked to Mundu, the next village onward from Langtang around 3400m. All along the way Nik was very informative of the surrounding area and path we trekked. Being a former porter (since 14!) he is very aware of the landscape and knowledgable.Unfortunately one of our friends fell ill with a cross, we believe, between altitude sickness and potentially something he had eaten or had to drink.Nik was quick to act and without fuss called Chhatra who then called in an emergency Helicopter to transport us and our sick friend back to Kathmandu. A normally 3 day trip back to the city had only taken us 20 minutes by chopper. The Insurance covered this no problem (a must have and not to be scrimped on!).Previously on the trek we tried to reduce our backpack weight by leaving clothes and other items at various villages along the way. Nik made room in his pack and sacrificed his quick getaway to Kathmandu and made off down the hill to our stops before, collecting 6 different items scattered between villages, only to return them to our hostel in Kathmandu a day later!We were incredibly grateful.A couple of days later when our friend returned from the hospital Nik joined us for lunch for a chat and a Laugh.Chhatra even left his office too to visit our sick friend in the hospital and see how he was! Excellent experience, always more confidence inspiring when you have people who enjoy what they do and know what they're talking about.Neil."

We were blessed with clear sunny weather everyday which I didn't expect for winter. The views and sights were breathtaking!My guide Ram was a gentleman, he was diligent at taking care of all of my needs. He was very sociable and spoke perfect English, it felt like trekking with a friend. He is very fit so even though I felt like I was pushing my limits physically he always was able to stay with me. We were able to squeeze 2 days trekking into a day (from Gorak Shep to Namche Bazaar), just because I wanted to use wifi and have a hot shower.Many people consider doing the trek without a guide or porter to save money, although its possible, most people who I met were struggling carrying their bags, constantly counting their pennies and having to find accomodation. Sure, they will have some saved money but their experience seemed a lot more stressful. I would recommend paying a lump sum and not having to worry about anything. I had 3 decent meals a day during the trek and with Eco tours I felt I got the best room where ever I stayed.If you go trekking take some books and cards (the guides usually know some fun card games). As some days you will arrive as early as 1pm with a whole day to kill, but no TV or internet. My porter was also very kind and humble. I was able to have dinner at his house and meet his family during the trek which was a fascinating experience for me.I couldn't recommend Eco Tours enough. Thanks!"

I was ridiculous the amount of care, effort and time they put into me to make the trip as worthwhile as I had imagined it to be. Chaatra took time out of his schedule to meet me at the airport, make me feel comfortable and even took me to a place to purchase all of my trekking gear to avoid being ripped off. He even lent me his personal items so that I could minimise my spending and future carrying load (as I was going to continue travelling after the trek). It was so generous of him! Ra Ju took me on a tour of Kathmandu and taught me so much about religion and culture- he's such an awesome dude and is the reason why we still keep in contact today! I originally booked a tour with 3 others, who unfortunately cancelled last minute due to the fuel crisis (that how now ended) and last years devastating earthquake (which does not effect the trek at all).. this meant that it was just going to be me, my guide and my porter on this trek. I was a little bit uneasy as I didn't know if the guide and porter would be able to speak English and would be as festive as me over Christmas... After the 3rd day on the trek every single one of my fears and worries were overcome. My guide, Tshering - the coolest guy in town- and Pemba my porter - the happiest man to walk this earth- were the best company EVER! They took care of me and my fear of the dark, made sure I was comfortable every step of the way and altered the itinerary to suit my physical needs. They did this all in the goodness of their hearts! They spoke awesome english and had the best sense of humour which meant the 6 hours of downtime we had everyday felt like 1... We even met solo trekkers on the route who ended up trekking with us until the end. Tshering opened up his expertise to everyone that he met on the way and when I thought I was never going to make it over the pass, he stuck through with me in the blistering cold. I learnt enough Nepali to impress the locals and even learnt how to cook with them! It was just so amazing having Tshering and Pemba- they were so open to teaching me and the 3 boys that we met the ins and outs of Nepali culture and history! I really felt like a local! I went travelling solo for 5 months around Europe and Asia. People ask me what my favourite part was and without hesitation it would be the 18 days I spent on the mountain with Tshering, Pemba, Aaron, Sander and Jo (the 3 boys we met) all because of Chaatra from Nepal Eco Adventures. If you want to be seriously looked after at a personal level you would be absolutely kidding yourselves if you didn't book Nepal Eco Adventures. They're the most flexible, understanding and caring group of people you will ever meet. Will totally be back in the next year or so to do another with them. Come as strangers and leave as friends!

From the very first moment I made contact with Chattra, I knew we would be in good hands.I had put together a brief of what I envisaged our family holiday to be, emailed several top tour operators (many recommended) and Chattra from Nepal Eco Adventure was the only one who was quick, responsive, professional, knowledgeable and experienced.We worked on an itinerary for a private tour, which later was changed following the Earthquake.Our trip took us on a mix of 'Nepalese flats\" (never believe a Nepalese flat) and cultural experiences. As we only had 10 days on the trek, we hiked part of the Annapurna circuit, starting at Pokhara (private jeep/bus to Tatopani) Walking from Tatopani through to Shikha - Ghorepani - Poon Hill - Tadapani - Ghandruk - Landruk - Phedi and back vehicle back to Pokhara.Life in the mountains is beautiful, basic, with warm hospitality and spectacular views. We loved every moment of the trek and although classed as an easy trek, there were many ups and downs which challenged our fitness. We were three people - my husband, 14 yo daughter and myself. We organised for a guide and two porters. Our wonderful guide Ram (although his real name is Jirel Hukum) was very experienced and he spoke very good English. Our trek was a holiday for him as he is used to getting up and down Everest Base Camp! He was respectful, warm with a gentle demeanour. He made us feel confident all the way. The two lovely porters were Santos and Mr G. The trio were a bubbly bunch when they got going in their native language or singing out loud their favourite beautiful Indian or Nepalese songs. My daughter, who was faster, enjoyed speeding ahead with the porters who looked after her and answered the endless questions.Our meal times took a while to get used to because they would ensure we were fed and settled before they ate anything. Even though we asked them to join us, very few times they did, as they sat with the 'family' our of respect.Our head porter, Santos, brought to our table a beautiful platter of slices of apple and pomegranate after every dinner. It was their way of saying good night. A lovely unexpected gesture, which was much appreciated and will be remembered.In a nutshell, our experience was wonderful and we would recommend Chattra and his crew to any of our family and friends wishing to have a similar adventure.I can't wait to come again and this time do the entire Annapurna Circuit!"

Both Chhatra and Raju did a very good job in giving me an amazing experience and I felt perfectly safe the whole trip as a female traveler!After the trekking I decised I wanted to go to Chitwan very last minute. Everything was handled just in 1 day. All in all I had an amazing experience with Nepal Eco Adventure which I would definetly recommend to others!"

We had a rough itinerary that we were aiming for, but we had no idea how to go about it.We sent our itinerary to a few of the top listed TripAdvisor tour companies and Chhatra from Nepal Eco Adventures was not only the first to respond, he was also the only responder that seemed to have thoroughly read our itinerary. He not only understood what we wanted, but he was able to recommend some improvements to the trip that proved to be EXACTLY what we wanted. I could list all the times that Chhatra went above and beyond, but there were too many! He was always available, very communicative, knowledgeable and more than anything - willing to help.For the trek itself, Chhatra introduced us to Shiva, our guide. Shiva met us in KTM and took us all the way through the things that would have caused us dramas if we had been on our own i.e. flights (which can be a nightmare), permits etc.Shiva was a fantastic guide, he knew everyone! He was friendly, charismatic and engaging. There was never a dull moment around the fire at the end of the day! We were very lucky to be looked after by such a character. By the end of the trek, we were tired and sore, but thoroughly impressed with every aspect.I cannot recommend Nepal Eco Adventures enough. Chhatra and Shiva are two fantastic blokes."

(Honestly we dabbled with booking a US-based company but decided we liked the idea of supporting local business more.) We ended up picking the trek to Gokyo and hiked 12 days.Upon arriving to Kathmandu, Chhatra and his friendly driver met us with big smiles and got us to our hotel quickly - this was greatly appreciated after almost two days of flying. We were greeted with marigold flower necklaces too, which my wife definitely loved. The hotel selected by NEA was clean, centrally located and luckily equipped with a nice bathroom. Chhatra really put us at ease, we felt well prepared for the trek and he answered our endless questions with a smile. The day trips he arranged before and after the trek were lovely, it was great to get out of the \"touristy\" area and see other parts of town. I can't say enough about how professional and pleasant Chattra is to work with.Once we arrived in Lukla, we met our guide, Ram. My wife and I hit it off with Ram immediately, we are all around the same age (early 30s) and we ended up being the only two on the trek. Ram was such a great guide, he was patient with our questions and shared tons of trivia and information about the various mountains and history of the trek/Nepal. At night we often played card games ..where Ram beat us at numerous rounds of a local game ha. After a few days of trekking we all discussed our \"next trek\" and if we do venture back to Nepal, we would definitely book with NEA and request Ram."

All aspects of this trip were amazing--from the booking of the trip with Chhatra, to the tour of Kathmandu with RaJu, to the actual trek around Annapurna Circuit with Ram and Santos! Everyone was a pleasure to be with--friendly, helpful and welcoming. The trek over the Pass was a challenge, but the fact that we went higher gradually made it possible--even for a sixty something year old woman like me! The mountains and villages were amazing! It was cold (December) but most of the tea houses had a woodfire in the dining area. Food was really good--\"Dal bhat\" power! The fact that there were problems between India and Nepal (and a gasoline and propane shortage) did not affect the trip. We met other trekkers who did not have guides--including quite a few who were heading back the way they came because they didn't make it over the high pass--I wouldn't recommend going that route--especially when the weather can be questionable. We learned so much about the country from our guides. I'm looking forward to my next trek. This trip was really affordable--both the trek and the $650 plane ticket from LA to Kathmandu!"

I used Nepal Eco Adventure for Poon Hill trek and a trip with my family around Nepal.I had limited time for hiking so was looking for a 3-4 day hike in the Annapurna region. Poon hill trek was one of the top rated short hikes online. So, I contacted Nepal Eco Adventure regarding that hike and Chhatra got back to me the next day with a detailed itinerary. The cost was good and he took care of everything from right when I landed in Kathmandu - pick up from airport, hotel in Kathmandu, transport to Pokhara, food and accommodation during the hike, hiking permits, etc. It was nice to not have to worry about any of that during the trip. My guide, Ram was great. He was very friendly, accommodating and was happy to go at my pace. He made sure I got the best from the trip. The hike itself was great. The views from Gorepani and Poonhill were absolutely stunning. I had seen the pictures earlier; however, the views in person were surreal. We got lucky with the weather, it was completely clear.I also planned a trip with my family through Nepal Eco Adventure as well. After my hike I met up with my family in Pokhara. We stayed in Pokahara for a couple of days which was nice, then went to Chitwan National Park. This was the highlight of the trip with my family. Highly recommend canoeing in the river in the morning mist. Last part of our trip was cultural and architectural tour of Kathmandu. Our guide Durga was very knowledgable and friendly. Nepal Eco Adventure took care of everything - flights / buses between cities, accommodation, local tours. Again, not having to worry about any of that, made our trip easy and fun.I would highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventures for hiking or architectural / cultural tours. I'm already starting to plan my next trip - Everest Base Camp. Hopefully in 2017!"

            "review": "EBC and Trip Around Nepal :). I returned from Nepal just a month ago, having visited Kathmandu, Pokhara and Chitwan, and of course completing Everest Base Camp Trek with Kala Pathar. I initially only planned to do EBC and contacted Chhatra, the owner of Nepal Eco Adventure about, who immediately won my trust with his timely and knowledgeable answers. Thanks to this I also decided I wanted to to visit Chitwan and later Pokhara, which Nepal Eco Adventure arranged for me. Chhatra was very nice and obliging as my plans changed, making everything possible to realise them swiftly and smoothly. He also offered to provide down jackets, down sleeping bags, trekking poles and duffel bags to anyone in the group who didn't have any and did so free of charge - unlike most agencies who rent them. Of course, the highlight of the trip was the trek to Everest Base Camp, and I cannot thank enough my guide Ram, who was the best person you could hope to guide you through the mountains. He was always very informative about the places we visited and the peaks we were seeing as well as the local customs, and his English was fluent. The accommodations he chose for our group were the best we could hope for under the circumstances and he made sure everyone was comfortable. He advised us on food and made sure to check our oxygen levels twice a day. But the best part is, he was just fun to be around.:) I travelled as a part of an international group of six, with none of us knowing anyone in the group before, yet the group got along perfectly well and became friends. All of us reached EBC and summitted Kala Patthar. No one suffered from altitude sickness despite no one in the group taking Diamox, and I feel that this was at least partly thanks to the good care of our guide as well as the good acclimatisation routine we followed. Overall the EBC trip was a great success. The following visit to Chitwan was a nice contrast to the busy days on the trek. The jungle safari and the exposure to the Tharu culture were very nice, entertaining and relaxing. The resort we stayed at was also very nice, and our jungle guide was kind and knowledgeable. I also stayed in Pokhara for a couple of days, the second biggest city in Nepal, yet in many ways the complete opposite of Kathmandu. Chhatra helped arrange a trip to Sarangkot for me, but I also had plenty of time to wander on my own. I used the time to visit a Tibetan refugee camp by myself, where I met and talked with the Tibetans which was a very enriching experience. I also wandered around the lake, took a boat trip, visited the World Peace Pagoda as well as some local markets. Kathmandu was also nice, I had a personal city guide who took me around the city's landmarks. Again I had time to wander around on my own and very quickly felt right at home there. The best part was, that everywhere I went I met someone from my EBC trekking group. So even though I came to Nepal completely alone, everywhere I was with friends. If I visit Nepal again (which I plan to do), I would surely use Nepal Eco Adventure again. Happy holidays, Nepal Eco Adventure!"

From the word go, the exact price including what was included in the total price and what we had to pay for was explained. Very professional, honest and trust worthy. Our trek was pretty remote and we had to have a guide, which was part of the permit deal, unlike Everest base camp and Annapurna treks. Our guide Pemba a local of the area, was brilliant, telling us about the local culture, and supportive, keeping us right, especially above the 4000m mark. The teahouses were pretty decent considering where we were. The chosen tea houses appeared to be the best in each village. And all under 4000m had really decent options other that just dal baht.There were very few fellow trekkers on this trek (and not WiFi or phone coverage) which was pretty magic. However all of them appeared to have significantly more for their trips than us. Word of advice go with a reputable Nepalese company. All the European, UK, US and Aus/NZ companies outsource to them but charge you thousands extra for the privilege!"

First we went to Chitwan, where we had two night safari package, and we enjoyed it a lot. The hotel was nice and our guide for the jungle treks was incredible. Only a small minus comes from the misunderstood of the elephant ride; I didn't want to take the elephant safari because of the bad reputation of those (all over the world, not precisely in Nepal) and we had asked for a jeep safari. They didn't know this in forehand at the hotel, but they managed to book us to the jeep safari instead of the elephant safari for extra money. So everything sorted out and the jeep safari was excellent!Then we had the ABC trek. We decided to finish the trek in 9 days, if something doesn't (sickness, injuries) come to our way. Our guide was Raju, who took very good care of us. Special thanks also to our porter, who also took care of us and asked how we feel etc during the trek, despite his limited English :)All of the tea houses and meals were better than we expected, and Nepal Eco Adventures offered fruits for dessert, which was a nice extra!Overall everything worked out really well and we were satisfied. All the people in Nepal who we met were incredibly nice to us, no hassle or anything and we felt very welcome, all the time. Highly recommending Nepal Eco Adventures and Nepal!"

My guide, Thakur, was excellent. With over 25 years guiding people round Nepal, there is nothing he does not know about the country and he knew every step of the Ghorepani Poonhill Trek. He paced the trek ideally for my fitness level and knew every stop for the best possible photos. His choice of stops for food were well placed, the food was great and the accommodation for every night was better than I expected for the middle of the mountains. Well known and respected by his many friends and colleagues, I would trek again with Thakur any time.In summary, this was the trip of a lifetime. The sense of achievement in climbing to over 3,200m and the scenery when I git there was breathtaking and worth every step of the way."

From arrival to airport in Kathmandu until our departure, we felt completely serviced both by our guide, and by Chhatra (monitoring us from NEA's headquarters ).NEA provided us with a great and experienced guide, something that became very apparent when we compared with various other groups along the way. The difference in experience and professionalism was palpable compared to other outfits. Our guide verified our oxygen levels regularly, modified our diets for maximum calorie intake despite lack of appetite at higher altitudes, and provided lots of colorful stories along our trek. We felt we were trekking with long time friends. Their choice of tea houses was also very good- something you come to appreciate very quickly. They did not cut corners and it showed. At the end of the day, the real value of an outfitter comes when you hit a snag. And sure enough, when we did, Chhatra and our guide Nirs did everything right so that we had a safe and terrific experience. I would feel totally comfortable sending my children to Chhatra and his team. My only advice to trekkers, take NAE advice- if they say to take a few more days to your schedule, DO IT. Adding a few more slack days to your schedule so that you have the flexibility to adjust your calendar to the inevitable snags you are bound to hit will make a huge difference to your experience. Running tight on days is unnecessary when you come from such a long way. Thank you NEA, and hope to be back in the coming years."

Chhatra was quick to reply, gave excellent advice (we decided on a cultural tour, with a mountain stay, sunrise/sunset trip and lots of history) and guidance and was a pleasure to meet in person when we arrived. The price was very reasonable as well and it was good to have everything clearly included/not included. Our guide and driver were faultless. They gave us the opportunity to tailor the trip how we wanted, were faultless in terms of knowledge, skills and enthusiasm and most importantly were a real advocate and insight into Nepalese culture, society and history. They were both such an asset to Nepal Eco Adventure - it was sad to say goodbye to them! We are often travellers who 'diy-it', but we wanted to take the stress out of it for our honeymoon and we were so overwhelmed by the educational, relaxing and mesmerising experience we had, all thanks to Nepal Eco Adventure. 5 stars doesn't seem enough! All I can say is thank you so much and we would do nothing but recommend them for your trip(s) in Nepal."

All the places we stayed were great depending on how far up we were. Food was always plenty.

Upon my arrival to Kathmandu Chhatra arranged airport pickup and personally met me even though it was 9pm, he made sure that I safely checked in in the hotel.Both of the guides Chhatra provided me with have shown great level of professionalism and were really nice people themselves. Ra Ju, who has shown me around Kathmandu, was not only very knowledgeable in terms of history but also had an awesome sense of humour which made the short tour quite a pleasant experience. Kumar, my guide for the trek, had a good level of English, and made sure that I had the best experience on the trek. He is a really caring guide and throughout 3 weeks treated me like his little sister. He shown a great level of flexibility as well. When I had an idea to opt out for Tilicho lake we worked on the alternative route to sqiz it in without affecting safety (we still had to accent slowly due to risk of AMS). As well we did all the possible side treks to avoid the road which made an experience even better. The lodges included in the package were quite good and offered wide variety of food.The views on trek were breathtaking and I really hope to come back soon to discover Everest region.Overall I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure as a company of great professionals and people.Thank you, Guys for this unforgettable experience!!!"

Very capable, professional, knowledgeable, approachable and friendly. From our initial enquiry it was clear that this agency is very well organised, very knowledgeable, and willing to be flexible to incorporate any extra requests. Once we arrived at Kathmandu airport, we received personal attention from Chhatra, and that lasted throughout the entire time that we were visiting Nepal He was always on hand to answer our questions, advise us and point us in the right direction. Chhatra has excellent English so there was no language barrier, and he was able arrange English speaking guides to explain the intricacies surrounding the historic sites that we visited in Kathmandu.Once on the trek, the guides were superb. Very patient, loyal, funny, and knowledgable about the areas we were passing through. Their English was also very good and they always took the time to point out interesting features and were very attentive to see how we were all coping with the altitude. They were also integral to offering advice about getting wifi, hot water and decent toilets where necessary. Our blood oxygen was measured daily to ensure that we were all managing the altitude. All the guides were aware of health and safety and were able to break the group, or alter the speed, in order that everyone could achieve the trekking stage. Very quickly they became not just guides, but our friends. The weather forced us to alter our plans three quarters of the way through the trek, and this was accommodated by Chhatra and his team with minimal fuss, and they were able to arrange an alternative plan very quickly. From historic sites, to mountain trekking and safaris, Chhatra and his agency were able to devise an itinerary to suit our wishes. They really made Nepal accessible and provided the best opportunities to see a truly beautiful country. I would highly recommend them to anyone considering a trip to Nepal."

It was easy communicating with him and booking the trip before I reached Nepal. Once there, he was extremely patient and helpful preparing me for the journey. He met me at my hotel after business hours, brought my guide, and went over what to expect. He delivered true to his word without any high pressure sales tactics. On the day of the tour, Nir met me on the way to Nagarkot and made sure I was very comfortable for the day's trip. He was very patient with me, allowing me to enjoy the scenery an photography opportunities at my leisure. Both Chhatra and Nir showed their professionalism through their coordination and communication, making sure I received special treatment serving my personal interests. Nir made sure I got a tour off the beaten path, giving me a very up close and personal look into the village life in rural Nepal. Nir was also very knowledgeable, with a full understanding of everything that met my eyes. He was also very easy going, and I appreciated the warm small talk along with ample time for me to get my own space.I would without a doubt book a Nepal Eco Adventure tour the next time I'm in Nepal. I am currently looking forward to coming back, as 4 days in this magnificent country are not nearly enough. When I do come back, Nepal Eco Adventure and Nir will be my first choice. Although they have been in business for roughly 2 years, both Nir and Chhatra boast a combined 35+ years experience giving tour guides. I can't wait to see them and their majestic country again.

They did everything from arranging a dedicated car for the entire tour, booking hotels at great prices and organizing guides and porters for our treks. Their specialty is mountain trekking and anyone looking to discover Nepal on foot would be in good hands with their experienced guides and we would surely use them again on other adventures. Unlike many corporates, Nepal Eco Adventures was started by a former local trekking guide and I would like to thank Chharta (the owner and our point of contact) for making this a most memorable trip. We are now inspired to train for the Everest Base Camp trek in 2016! On a side note, Nepal is as enchanting as it ever was. Tourism is thinner than usual post the earthquake but that was an incentive rather than a deterrent for us - and we were amply rewarded. Top notch service, less crowds and the same gorgeous walks and views."

I decided to initiate correspondence with them and this is when the excellent experience I had with them began. Chhatra, who is the owner of the company, always responded to my emails in a timely fashion. If I emailed in the evening I would usually have a response by the next morning. This worked well for me as there is a 11hr45 minute time change from where I live. I quickly gained confidence in Chhatra as he answered my many questions and made recommendations to me. When I arrived in Katmandu all of my expectations and needs were met or exceeded. I was met at the airport by a driver and an English speaking guide who took me to my hotel. The next day I had a tour of Katmandu by the same guide, which included seeing a lot of temples, shrines, and palaces. Chhatra picked all of the hotels I stayed in which I found very comfortable and nicer than I expected.All of my trip was customized just for me. I trekked the complete Annapurna Circuit with just myself and a guide [Pemba Sherpa] that Chhatra assigned to me. Pemba is not only a very good guide, always looking after my needs, but a great guy. He was my friend, companion, and also my cultural liaison. He told me about sites, history, mountains, time to next teahouse [which proved to be quite accurate] and life in general in Nepal. He also knew that route so well that we could take alternative trails thus avoiding roads in the area almost entirely. All of this proved invaluable and I had a fantastic trip. I often travel, hike, sail, by myself, but Pemba provided a great value added. I'd use a guide again.After trekking I visited Chitwan National Park which proved to be a relaxing change of pace and allowed me to experience other aspects of Nepal such as elephants, rhinos, crocodiles, and beautiful birds I had never seen before. There are also about 200 tigers in the park, but I never saw any of them.In summary, I found the Nepalese people very friendly, and I met many guides and porters along my route who became my friends and I believe were competent, but the main reason I would recommend Nepal Eco Adventure is that their organization and advice made it very easy for me to have a great trip without knowing much about Nepal beforehand."

Firstly I would like to say that Chhatra (The Managing Director) is a very patient and understanding person who tirelessly attended to my numerous inquiry emails and the subsequent changes I had to make to the itinerary when my travelling companion pulled out. Arriving to Nepal alone and doubtful, I was thankful that he faithfully waited nearly 3 hours for me outside the airport, due to baggage delays, and was still very cheerful about it and pleased to meet me. I did a 27 day trip (ABC + EBC treks) and Chhatra customized the itinerary for me to minimize any unnecessary costs and allowed me to transit hassle-free and seamlessly between treks all the way to my return flight back to Singapore. When the earthquake slightly damaged the original hotel included in my package, he upgraded me to a better hotel without additional charge! Trek-wise, my guide, Narayan Rai, had a very good command of English and was very friendly and caring, treating me like his little brother. He would go out of his way to explain to me facts about the mountains and villages along the way. He also plucked berries and various fruits from trees for me to eat and always tried to ensure that I got the best room in the guesthouse. In addition, he was totally flexible in changing the itinerary based on my needs and wants on any particular day and made my trip unique and memorable. Though I was alone for this whole period, but my needs and safety were always taken care of and I never felt lost or abandoned in any way. So now that I am back safely and happily in Singapore, I would like to thank Nepal Eco Adventures for orchestrating such a pleasant experience for me =) I recommend that you try and speak with Chhatra should you ever think of coming to Nepal on vacation, you will not regret it."

My husband and I were usually at the back of the group and Santosh, one of the guides, stayed with us all the time, he didn't rush us or make us feel uncomfortable, we passed others, who, when the last members of their group arrived, set off again, meaning that the people at the back never had chance to recover. When we arrived at our hotels and joined the rest of our group, they all encouraged and supported us and didn't make us feel as though we were holding them back, we couldn't have asked for more and we successfully arrived at base camp and achieved our objective. On the last day of our holiday, when the rest of our group flew home, we experienced the earthquake and even though we were still having aftershocks and just a couple of hours after the quake, Chhatra came to our hotel to check that we were safe and after we had spent a sleepless night, he was on the phone at 5.00am keeping us informed of our flight details and turning up at 8.00am to check we were still fine and arranging a car to take us to the airport. Nothing was too much trouble and our safety was his priority.I would advise anyone thinking of visiting Nepal to make sure they speak to Chhatra, he will make your holiday one you will never forget and when we visit Nepal again this is something we will certainly do."

Kumar picked us up on the morning we set off for Pokhara and was by our side for our entire travels and trek, taking care of all arrangements for bus and taxi travel, hotel in Pokhara and for our trek including all meals and guesthouses. We found the hotel in Pokhara to be first rate and each of the guesthouses along the trek were very suitable to our needs. The menus at the guesthouses were pretty standard and offered a reasonable variety of hearty, home made and most often delicious food served in large portions. Personal favourites included Dal Bhat, moo moos, the soups and awesome wood fired pizza.Kumar was an excellent guide and his English served us well. He had a quiet disposition, a great sense of humour and was very knowledgeable, informative and professional. He kept a close eye on us and set a varied pace to match our speed that was never hurried, allowed for many photos and other stops and yet always got us to the next guesthouse in good time. It was very evident that our safety was always Kumar's first priority and his diligence and caution served us well when the first earthquake tremor and the many follow-ups occurred. Always under Kumar's watchful eye, we safely completed the last three days of the trek back to Pokhara.The trek route itself was very enjoyable and not too taxing to a moderate level. The sunrise at Poon Hill on day three was so incredible as to make it all very worthwhile. Because of the earthquake we were unable to complete the safari.When we arrived back in Kathmandu after completing the trek Chhatra was there to meet us and take us to a room he had secured at one of the few operating hotels in the Thamel District. He was constantly in touch by phone and in person with us over the next several days as we worked to secure new flights home. Whether it was 8 in the morning or 930 at night he was there for us and other of his clients who were at the same hotel. Despite the pressures that the earthquake must have brought him and his family, Chhatra provided my daughter and me with an incredible level of service and support during those challenging days for everyone. From first contact to our goodbye, our experience with Chhatra and his team were first rate. Everything was as we expected and we found Chhatra to be very professional and trustworthy. We were left with no concerns or complaints whatsoever.As Nepal and Chhatra and his team all recover from the earthquake tragedy, we would very much encourage people who are interested in any of his treks, safaris etc to contact Chhatra to plan future visits. I am confident that Chhatra will give an honest assessment of each region's recovery and guide you to a most enjoyable and memorable experience in beautiful Nepal. We will definitely return as soon as we can."

Babu was a very skilled mountain guide. Our porter Umesh was very outgoing, an excellent assistant guide and great company. We had to improvise quite a bit due to weather conditions, but every circumstance we met was solved rapidly. For example, the second part of our trekking we were taken to Langtang as we could not proceed on the Manaslu circuit.Traveled as a single female, never felt unsafe or unpleasant.Thanks team at Eco Adventure for the excellent trek and great time. So glad to hear that you are all ok after the terrible tragedy that hit Nepal. Hope travellers will return soon, beautiful Nepal and the wonderful Nepali deserve it."

We used Nepal Eco Adventures for our entire private trip to Nepal which included an 8 day trek in the Everest region, sightseeing in Kathmandu and a Safari in Chitwan National Park. I can only agree with other comments. Chhatra did a great job of promptly answering all my e mails, addressing any questions or concerns, and organizing every detail in a professional manner. All the arrangements made were done precisely to what had been agreed upon and all transactions were handled professionally. If Chhatra is the brains of the organization, then Nir, our guide, is the heart and soul! Nir won us over from the first moment we met, with his enchanting smile, excellent English and engaging personality. On our trek he took especially good care of us and accommodated our needs, modified plans without any problems, when things did not go exactly as planned (my husband got the flu). We loved the many details that Nepal Eco Adventures attended to, that ensured our comfort and safety especially the fact that Nir had a pocket pulse oximeter to monitor for altitude sickness which is important when hiking at high altitudes. Overall a terrific experience I would recommend this company to anyone traveling in Nepal."

I initially signed up for the 17 day Annapurna Circuit in February '15 but finished 4 days ahead of schedule, this was never a problem and suited me as I wished to spend more time in certain areas - Tatopani and Pokhara. I received regular updates from Chhatra and quick responses to any questions I had from booking to completing the trek. Specialist equipment such as sleeping bag, down jacket and walking poles were also supplied with no additional cost. My guide Nik was fantastic had loads of experience, so much fun and I felt like I was treated as a King throughout my trek. Most importantly though when I had really awful symptoms of altitude sickness (feeling like death approaching), with Nik's experience, reassurance and the kindness of the tea lodge hosts I survived and still completed the circuit (if it wasn't for them, I would probably not have completed the circuit). I would thoroughly recommend this company to anybody who has not done any trekking before (like myself) or just wants a more care free approach to trekking as all your worries are in the very capable hands of Nepal Eco Adventure. Only recommendation the hotel you stay in at Pokhara - lovely but please not on the 5th floor I have had enough steps for the rest of my life after Ghorepani. Thank you very much for such a brilliant trek and adventure in Nepal."

We acclimatized slowly so we did not get altitude sickness and were healthy throughout the trek. Our guide Ram knew the region, trails, and teahouses well.

Our initial inquiries were promptly and thoroughly answered by Chhatra, and in the end we booked our trek for an excellent price on the precise dates we wanted with all the extra equipment we didn't have included in the price (jackets, sleeping bags and trekking poles). We had a bit of a problem getting to Nepal (a Turkish Airlines aircraft had been damaged on landing at Kathmandu, closing the airport for 4 days), but Chhatra maintained constant email contact with us on the situation, and in the end we managed to depart on our trek only one day late. Our guide, Jiba, and our porters were truly outstanding. Jiba spoke excellent English (and good German, too!) and our helpers went above and beyond their duty to make sure we were comfortable, well-fed and happy throughout the trek. Alas, deep snow prevented us from making it through the Larke pass, but the views need Lau and Samagaun were still stunningly beautiful. Nevertheless, Chhatra treated us to a wonderful dinner out in Kathmandu to make up for not completing our circuit--a very generous and kind gesture that we all appreciated. Chhatra also arranged several day tours in and around Kathmandu at very reasonable prices. All in all, I have trekked in the Alps, the Andes and the Rockies, and this was absolutely the best experience I've had with a trekking agency. Highly recommended."

When I was planning my adventure to Nepal, Chhatra was fantastic. Great at replying quickly, professionally and totally flexible with regards to planning the trek. Our guide Ram was also fantastic, he knew the routes very well, shared all of his knowledge and experience. He was also funny and would hang out with us every night, playing card games etc. Also our porters were equally great, even with their low level of English they tried their hardest to communicate and be part of the group. The only bad thing was flying to and from Kathmandu - Lukla. We had a two day wait on the way out and a three day wait on the way home. I only just made my international flight the following day! The company I flew with was called Goma Air. They are by far the worst company, aviation and otherwise I have ever encountered. On the way back to Kathmandu, we had tickets from the company but they had no record of us on the flight manifest... I would 100% recommend not flying with them if possible!! This however, was no fault of Nepal Eco Adventure, Chhatra tried his hardest to help us throughout. Without his help I imagine I would still be stuck in Lukla 4 months later!! The trek itself (Everest Base camp with one pass) was such a positive challenge. One of the hardest physically and mentally challenging things I have done but so worth every ounce of effort! The scenery cannot really be described in words, amazing, and you meet some awesome people during your travels there. To summarize, Nepal Eco Adventure was great. Chhatra, our guide Ram and our porters were all fantastic. It is diffidently one of the more affordable companies but does not lack in quality services. Do not fly Goma Air!! With the exception of that.... AMAZING !! Thanks to all at Nepal Eco Adventure :)"

I contacted Chhatra and he was professional, knowledgeable, and very quick to respond. He was able to accommodate our group for the dates we wanted at a great price, and was able to advise on logistics and gear. All safety concerns were addressed beforehand, so we arrived in Nepal ready for an amazing adventure.Throughout the trek, the guides and porters were incredible. They made sure we were all well fed and had everything we needed for a great trip. I had the unfortunate situation of becoming sick early on in the trek. I had terrible gastric issues followed by symptoms of acute mountain sickness and, in the end, needed to be heli-rescued from the Everest region (Note: this is rare- so don't let that deter you!). The guides Ramesh and Nik monitored me the whole time and put my wellness as their priority. I was taken to a hospital in Kathmandu where Ramesh and Chhatra checked in with me regularly and made sure I was okay. After I recovered in hospital, I now had a few days free, so Chhatra helped me arrange a side trip with Ramesh to Pokhara and Australian Camp to view the Annapurna Mountain Range at sunrise. All to say, the care and consideration from Chhatra and his team were there the entire time I was in Nepal, and they made sure my trip would be a memorable one despite having to cut the trek short.If you're looking for prompt and attentive correspondence; very experienced and personable guides; and a team with a high level of service who makes your health and safety their main priority, then I definitely recommend booking with Nepal Eco Adventure. You will not be disappointed."

Partly due to his excellent knowledge on cameras and photography which distracted me on our journey. My daughter and I had the best photography lesson ever. Raju managed to encourage us to climb the additional 4 kilometres uphill to the tower for sunset on the Himalayas. The experience of a lifetime and I felt so proud to have achieved my goal & climbed to the tower at Nakarkot.

He loves to travel also and as a result understands the needs of a modern traveller. I trekked solo for 17 days with an excellent guide and was impressed with the standard of the tea houses and the quality of food provided. The walk itself was phenomenal, there aren't enough adjectives to describe how beautiful it is up there!

The trek itself was absolutely amazing (one that anyone who enjoys getting out in the wilderness should definitely consider doing this in their lifetime). I am very satisfied that I booked this through Nepal Eco Adventure. The owner - Chhatra - is a wonderful human being. Throughout my entire time in Nepal (one month) I visited Chhatra multiple times, choosing to use him for other adventures (Chitwan, Pokhara) after completing the trek. I'll try and summarize the reasons I would recommend Nepal Eco Adventure to others: Safety: Chhatra was always prompt in replying to any emails I sent him and incredibly helpful with all my questions and concerns. Chhatra connected us with a guide who has extensive knowledge of Sagarmatha National Park (has summited 6000m+ peaks, 16 years experience guiding, etc.) and provided an Blood-Oxygen Saturation Meter for us to help alleviate any concerns we had with AMS or our safety in general. I always felt that we were safe throughout the trek. Hospitality: Chhatra picked me up/dropped me off from the airport (saving me from the throngs of eager taxi drivers when I arrived around midnight) and ensured I got checked into my hotel after hours. Whenever I visited his office, he always had time to talk with me about my questions, experiences about the places I visited/planned to visit in Nepal, offering suggestions and recommendations. His english is very good, he's personable and it was easy to talk to him.Value:There are many trekking companies that head to EBC and they range in cost and quality. I was very happy with all that Nepal Eco Adventure offered for the price. They even go the extra step in providing down jackets, sleeping bags and trekking poles for those that need them.I can't wait for the chance to travel back to Nepal. Thanks again to Nepal Eco Adventure for making it such a special experience. I hope to see you again in the future."

My friend and I contacted Chhatra from Australia and he did a fantastic job organising our itinerary to fit in with our travel plans. From the moment we landed in Kathmandu, we were well looked after by Chhatra. He not only sorted our accommodation in Kathmandu, but set about organising an amazing trek to Langtang National Park and Gosaikunda Lakes. He introduced us to our guide and porter Dawa and Irra, who were to become good friends by the end of our two weeks together (and fierce competitors in card games- Dhumbal)! We saw the most amazing scenery everyday, but it was really the Nepali people who made our trip so special. Thank you to Dawa for being the ever social 'Red Panda' and introducing us to so many people on our walks. Thank you to Irra who not only carried our bags, but patiently taught us some Nepalese language along the way. Chhatra did an amazing job in organising our trek, and we look forward to returning to Nepal for another trek with Nepal Eco Adventure in the future. For anyone travelling to Langtang, you will read in Lonely planet about the long bus trip (9hr) to travel 120km. They are not kidding. We caught the public bus to Syabrubesi to start our trek, which took over 9 hours with a lot of bumps and upset tummies along the way. For the way home from Dhunche we opted to pay the extra money for a jeep which took about 4.5hrs. Thanks to Dawa and Chhatra for organising this, it is well worth spending the money. The cost of a jeep is 10 000 Rupees and comfortably seats 7 people + driver. We found many travellers willing to share the cost of the jeep. We highly recommend this, as the public bus is over-crowded with people, goats and chickens; and is subject to many stops by the local police/military for some time as bags are searched. Nepal is an amazing country, I am already looking forward to my next trip."

Like so many others, I found Chhatra extremely responsive, friendly and knowledgeable. He patiently answered all questions both via email before arrival and in his office before and after the trek. He also provided a great set of walking sticks as my sister hadn't brought her own.On the trail, our guide was Ramesh and I can't say enough great things about him. He's worked as a guide for 15 years and his experience shows. His knowledge, patience and kind demeanour were all so much appreciated. I always felt very safe as a female traveller and he was an excellent sport when asked for \"protection\" from the odd goat, buffalo or spider! He was also happy to talk as we trekked but provided plenty of space for us to do our own thing.One thing of particular value was that we were permitted to customise our trip once on the trail. Upon getting to Jomson after all the days of peaceful trekking, it became clear that walking on the hot, dusty road was not going to be much fun. I proposed hopping the bus to Tatopani and instead spending those days trekking in the Annapurna Sanctuary - and that was what Ramesh ensured we did. That level of flexibility just made the trip and ensured we enjoyed our whole time on the trail.Lastly, our porter was well equipped for the trail, personally known to Chhatra and compensated properly which was important to us.I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure, Chhatra and Ramesh - all contributed to an amazing first time trekker's experience and I will be travelling with them again when returning to trek Everest in years to come.Tip: When you arrive at the airport you will be swarmed by men trying to carry your bags. Resist! Your guide and driver will take of you and you will avoid dealing with an aggressive group looking for outrageous tips.  "

He answered our every question about the trek, about life in the mountains and Nepali culture, and was always at hand with facts about the Himalayas and its many mountains. Having never been on a trek before, I was glad we had Ram to guide us. We had no worries, just time to enjoy the beautiful views.Having spent hours researching this trek online, I am surprised that so many other groups trek to Gokyo first, before crossing the Cho La Pass to base camp. I'm glad Eco Adventures took the eastern route first. Not only is the route a safer choice for altitude acclimatisation, the scenery ascending to base camp via Tengboche and Dingboche is far more spectacular. It also makes crossing the challenging Cho La Pass more manageable, going down the steep western side rather than struggling up it. The scenery going down from Gokyo was beautiful too, but less dramatic, and the journey down takes less time than going up. I was glad to spend more time dwarfed by the snow-capped mountains.I'm a person of average fitness, but believe most people would enjoy this trek. There is no pressure to go beyond your ability, just take your time and enjoy. Do it and you will not regret it!"

He has excellent leadership and organisation skills, excellent English and is fun to be with. Chhatra took our group on a sightseeing trip around Kathmandu, 6 day trek from Jiri to Junbesi (the original Everest route), helicopter flight back to Jiri, white water rafting, elephant safari where we saw rhino, crocodile spotting in dugout canoes and exotic bird watching in the jungle of Chitwan National Park. As if that wasn't enough to pack into 2 weeks, we ended with an early morning unforgettable sightseeing flight to Everest from Kathmandu.Chhatra organised all accommodation, food, transfers etc. On his treks he uses well equipped porters all personally known to him who are paid more generously than many of the workers from other trekking companies. I have no hesitation on recommending Chhatra as a competent, knowledgeable and friendly individual who ensures you have a positive experience travelling in the amazing country of Nepal."

Months prior to my trip, we coordinated with one another via email. As I never had been to Nepal, I was a bit skeptical and we got pestered at the airport and our hotel hosts were not exactly the most accommodating. When I met Chhatra, I could not help to feel skeptical and felt a little scared given my experience already in Kathmandu. I was NEVER more wrong!!! He turned out to be the best surprise of our trip. He was friendly, engaging, honest, helpful, and kind. Not only that, he went out of his way to help us after our trek to Annapurna. This guy is incredible. He gave us everything we wanted. He made us feel comfortable, supported, engaged, and most of all excited about our trip. We are hoping some day to return as I keep telling my significant other I want to return. I can guarantee you that we will be looking up Chhatra and his company to help us with our trek needs. You won't be sorry!!!"

For some reason, those two things go hand-in-hand. Everyone always asks me,\"Where was the best place you've ever traveled?\" I have a few places that will remain close to my heart, and Nepal is absolutely on that list. People then ask, \"Why?\" Well, it's easy to say that Nepal is serenely beautiful and there is just something very special about the way this place made me feel. But I've learned from my travels that my 'favorite' places were better judged by the company I shared the experience with. Positive energy is something you cannot 'pay' for, but greatly enriches your experience.

Chhatra, the owner of the company, was very helpful in helping me organise the trek, making sure I had all the right gear before the trek and was a great friend too after the trek. He's actually the nicest, funniest most generous person ever. My guide was Siva who was also fantastic. It was just him and I and he always made sure I was feeling good and made sure I was included in conversations with local peoples and teahouse owners. Siva also taught me lot's of Nepalese language and taught me lot's about the culture, history and surrounding mountains which I would not have learnt had I not been with him and greatly enhanced my trekking experience. I did the Annapurna Circuit Trek, walking the entire way from Besisahar to Nayapul. Siva was very flexible and let me set the pace (walk more or less) in a day so we weren't tied to the itinerary. I was always happy with the accommodation choices Siva chose for us and he obviously knew where the best local lunch spots were!I felt very safe at all times (safety was a concern of my parents because I was a young female travelling alone) because of Siva and Chhatra's professionalism, trekking experience, loyalty and kindness. I felt the price was excellent value for the hospitality, guide service, food, accommodation, transport and the whole experience I received. I did not feel like a 'customer', but was treated like a guest and friend. I would definitely recommend Chhatra and his company Nepal Eco Adventure Treks to any person or group looking to go trekking in Nepal and I will definitely go with Nepal Eco Adventure again."

So we had no hesitation in contacting Nepal Eco Adventure for our 2 week trip to Nepal. Before the trek, Chhatra offered a series of different treks to suit my indecisiveness. He also offered great advice based on our preferences. Chhatra sorted out our internal flights to Pokhara and even booked us an early morning Everest scenic flight. When the flight didn't take off, he assisted in us getting all the money back quickly and efficiently. During the trek itself, Chhatra was our guide. He was great to be around and really helped us get a good understanding of the local culture and customs in the villages we stayed in. I really did get so much out of our holiday and for that I must thank Chhatra and his insight and advice.I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure if you are looking for a safe, reliable and professional trekking company to the Himalaya."

I saw Nepal Eco Adventure online, did some research, and emailed Chhatra, the owner of the company. Chhatra was prompt, extremely thorough in answer questions and making suggestions to fit my criteria of a 14+ day trek with a few high points to climb. I ended up booking a trek tailored specifically to my dates through Langtang National Park, Gosainkunda lake region, the Helambu valley and Nagarkot, followed by a night in Bhaktapur, a beautiful city near Kathmandu. Chhatra was very clear on what was included in the program so there was no confusion and he even picked me up at the airport and dropped me off when I left. Chhatra runs a very thorough and intelligent company, plus he was a guide himself, so he understands the other side of trekking, so you end up with a company owner who understands the intricacies of all sides of this business. Chhatra found another person to help drop the costs on my end and quickly set up a porter to help the woman with her bag. Our guide, Jiba, was very experienced and knowledgeable. The accommodation was nice and the food was good and plentiful. Whenever I come back with the intention of using a guide, I will contact Chhatra only. I fell in love with Nepal on my trip and for good reason. Before I even left, I was trying to figure out what my next Nepal adventure would look like."

            "review": "Trip of a lifetime!. Hi, my review is long, but I hope you\u2019ll agree, worth the read. Chhatra at Nepal Eco Adventure was my guide for an unforgettable 23 day trek, last March, from Giri to Gokyo, Cho La Pass and finally onto Everest Base Camp, then back to Lukla for our flight back to Katmandu. On arrival, I was greeted at Katmandu airport with a friendly face and reassurance that Chhatra would look after me while in Nepal. We had previously been in contact by mail and I\u2019d felt I knew him before we had meet from his mail correspondence. Chhatra organized the accommodations in Katmandu, as well as each night along the trek, all the necessary visas into the parks etc. I had a fairly rough idea of where I wanted to visit along the trek, before reaching the main goal of Everest Base Camp as the highlight. I had a few last minute supplies to pick up before the trek and Chhatra was very helpful taking me around Katmandu to pick these up as well as a tour of Katmandu\u2019s main attractions the day I arrived and more attractions following the 23 day trek. Day 1 comprised of an 8 hour mini-bus twisty ride to Giri. It was a good experience, enjoying the local daily on-goings as well as providing an intro to Nepalese life, while providing a buildup to starting the trek. Along the trek, Chhatra was very informative of the surrounding village\u2019s main attractions, local mountains etc. and any local info that was worth mentioning. I did have a porter and felt a little guilty at times, but Chhatra reassured me that I was providing employment in the area. We stopped off at Chhatra\u2019s parent\u2019s village for a night to meet up with his family and see the various local projects, which Chhatra helped secure the financial backing for and helped with securing local labor, providing jobs for the local community. One of the many projects in his village was a new school, built from the financial help of a Scottish group which Chhatra guides on a frequent basis over the years. I have to say that Chhatra is a friend that\u2019ll watch your back, tend to your every need and provide the upmost service that you require on a once in a lifetime trip, that you won\u2019t forget. If you want to experience Nepal at its best from a trekker\u2019s point of view, I\u2019d highly recommended starting your trek from Giri, if you can afford the time. It\u2019s also a great way to acclimatize your body to the altitude. This is similar to the route that Sir. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay took while on their way to conquer Mt. Everest, so you\u2019ll be walking the route that\u2019s been part of history for the past 60 plus years. For the first week of the trek, I only saw/met a handful of trekkers. It wasn\u2019t until we joined the main route to EBC, that within the first hour, I\u2019d saw at least 100 tourist trekkers. Starting the trek from Jiri gave me more of an appreciation of the Nepalese locals and scenery, away from any tourists. A majority of the trekkers are in the 50 \u2013 70 year range. This must be due to the fact, that this type of trek is a once in a life time trek for them, or on their so called bucket list. You\u2019ll notice a majority of them won\u2019t make it all the way to EBC, due to altitude sickness. The route can vary from, normal hill walking to steep hill trekking. We passed by the famous Gokyo lakes and climbed the 5,000 plus meter Gokyo RI mountain peak the following day for a fantastic view of Mt. Everest and local glacier. The only deviation from the trek was that we could not trek over the Cho-La-Pass due to heavy snow blocking the route. This wasn\u2019t an issue, we just took an alternate route and kept on schedule. The alternate route was just as impressive. I was glad that Chhatra kept my safety in mind.You can build in rest days, which is recommended, not only for rest, but to visit local sites while acclimatizing. Chhatra will help you tailor your trek to your liking and time constraints, but you can\u2019t predict the weather at times, but Chhatra kept us on schedule. My trek started on Feb 28th 2013, for 23 days and had no major issues with the weather apart from the odd rain and snow shower. The trek is very manageable, but you do need to be fit. The Giri-Gokyo-Cho La Pass and finally Everest Base Camp trek will guarantee you fantastic and unforgettable views along the way, especially of the mountain peaks the higher you get. The snow covered hills and mountains can be surreal at times, with Everest and surrounding mountain reaching up to 8,000 meters. As soon as we reached our daily destination, Chhatra was on the case of organizing my room for the night. Before he and the porter got their room, I\u2019d have my bags in my room and the low down on the t-house, regarding the shower and meals available. All you need to do for the night is pick a good book and put your feet up, chat and plan your next day\u2019s route.When my wife came to visit me following the EBC trek, I booked a separate trek, again through Nepal Eco Adventures, with Chhatra and the porter to Phoonhill, to witness an unforgettable sunrise. She was feeling a bit under the weather at the time, but Chhatra stayed by her side for the duration of the 3 day trek. No matter how long the trek took, Chhatra stayed with her and treated her with the utmost respect, which we are very grateful. Chhatra and his guides will help you sculpt the trek you\u2019ve always dreamed of, focusing on your schedule and objectives from your bucket list trek. He\u2019s a very trustworthy guide and companion. He speaks fluent English and is very knowledgeable of the routes and locals along the way. You\u2019ll enjoy amazing hikes each day, where you can get into in-depth conversations with Chhatra or he\u2019ll leave you walk away, while you listen to your favorite tunes or eBooks.There\u2019re plenty of trekking companies out there, but I can\u2019t recommend Chhatra and Nepal Eco Adventure Ltd highly enough to book your next trip with. His rates are very competitive, but companionship, trust and most of all an unbelievable guide, which is priceless away from home. I hope you book your next trip with Chhatra\u2019s company and have the unforgettable trip as I did.All the best,Pat."

He knew the most secret special spots to visit, and only took us to great local guesthouses on our trek. He even took us to a local restaurant when we got back to Pokhara which was the most amazing Nepalese food I have ever tasted, and without our friend Chhatra we would never have known that doorway with lots of people milling about was actually a restaurant!Chhatra enriched our Nepalese experience so greatly, I can't imagine how it would have went without him.

In September 2013 I went to Nepal alone as a woman to explore Nepal and go trekking.From the beginning, Nepal Eco Adventure organised everything really well, they picked me up and took me to a great hotel in the middle of Kathmandu.After 2 days of sightseeing I started trekking to Everest Base Camp and Kala Patthar. My guide was Chhatra Karki, he was more than great, professional, helpful andreally experienced. I wasn't sure what it would be like to do a trek like this on my own as a young female traveler, but Chhatra made me feel comfortable and seemedto intuitively know when I needed help and when I needed space. I felt very safe throughout and he explained me very interesting things about nature and culture.It felt like trekking with a friend I know a long time, which was great. Chhatra knew so much people in the teahouses along the way and he had a good relationshipwith all the people there. Everyday he was open and flexible for my ideas, we did some great and isolated side trips and everyday was an adventure. The highlight was the peak day on Kala Patthar with sunrise behind the Mount Everest in the early morning. The trip was one of the best things I ever did and their could have been no better company and guide for me to organise that!After coming back to Kathmandu, Nepal Eco Adventure organised a relaxing trip to Chitwan National Park to do some Elephant Back Safaris and to watch Rhinos in the jungle anda trip to Pokhara. Within this time of the side trips they organised my Indian Visa and everything worked out perfectly.The whole stay in Nepal was well organised and just awesome, I cannot recommend this company enough!I felt safe all the time and I can recommend Nepal Eco Adventure to all females who want to travel alone.Highly recommended to all people who want to explore Nepal in an authentic and amazing way!"

We had contemplated doing the Annapurna circuit on our own, but ultimately decided to go with a guide--great decision. Our guide (Shiva) was fantastic--excellent English and a lot of fun! Chhatra (owner, trek coordinator) was extremely responsive and accommodating--very knowledgeable and genuinely a great guy. We made several last minute changes to our trip and he was able to work them out without delay. We will definitely recommend Nepal Eco Adventures to friends and family and will most certainly use them again when we return to trek the Langtang region."

I\u00b4ve been in nepal in 2005 and was completely overwelmed by its beauty and peace. it took me some time to convince my lady, cause she was not that much in trekking. so i decided to arange a guided tour with nepel eco adventures and it worked out great. Transport and equipment and all this outher stuff around were perfectly organised and chhatra our guide took so much care about us. with his clear english he could give us an extensive introduction to country and people. Lang Tang during beginning spring was amazing with its rich colours and the warmth of the people. Threre were just a few outher tourists around during that time which made it even more peaceful. i can highly recommend chhatra and his crew for doing reliable service and giving a familiar feeling."

I have used Nepal Eco Adventure three times in the last four years, travelling with two of my sons on one occassion (Annapurna Circuit), a group of friends (Makalu Base Camp) and a couple of months ago a solo trip(the high passes of the Everest region)This company have the versatility to organise a remote camping trek or just ensure that one gets the most from the Teahouses routes. Whatever it is you have in mind the Guide will have excellent English and the ability to ensure you are aware of all that you are seeing around you, particularly the cultural aspects of whatever region you are travelling in. The customer service ethos is strong and there is an empathy with a western client that results in their willingness to show off the full glory of Nepal.Both Guides and Porters have a willingness to interact - so expect to trade knowledge and opinions about the West - and lots of banter! They are a hardworking company that want to see you again and that shows in everything they do."

The first time was in the Annapurna region, over the ThrongLa Pass. Back then Chhatra was the lead guide and I knew then, that should I return to Nepal, I would like to trek with him again. I am lucky enough to have returned and this time used Chhatra's very own company, Nepal Eco Adventure. I am delighted that Chhatra Karki has made this progression as he certainly deserves to do well. My second trip was to EBC. All my airport transport was well organised and even though my flight was delayed, Nepal Eco Adventure (NEA) waited for me to arrive. Accommodation in Kathmandhu was organised for me and was very good as well as some of the friendliest lodges along the trek. NEA arranged other side trips for me to participate in. These included a jaw dropping trip to the Temples in Bhaktapur and a relaxing stay in the national park at Chitwan where I was able to observe Rhino in their natural environment and many species of birds as well as crocodiles and elephants. Back in the mountains, after each days trekking, I was able to enjoy a short, interesting talk about the area, culture and religions of Nepal. I always received excellent advice on health and safety and felt very well looked during both my trips. Finally, two further reasons why I would only trek with NEA and Chhatra Karki. He pays his porters a proper wage without fleecing westerners, unlike some of the larger western companies and on my last trip I suffered with altitude sickness but NEA got me down quickly and safely. While I was recovering back in Namche Bazaar I witnessed another trekker being helicoptered out with HACE. My family will always be grateful to Chhatra and his company for getting me down safely and recognising early enough how sick I was becoming. I owe Chhatra and his company such a lot. I cannot recommend this company enough. I had so much fun with NEA, Chhatra and all his porters, I cannot imagine trekking with anyone else."

This is NOT the case with Nepal Eco Adventure; every rupee counts towards an authentic, honest and eye-opening experience. After some months in Kathmandu me and a group of friends decided to walk the Annapurna Circuit and luckily found Nepal Eco Adventure and Chhatra Karki. Chhatra was our guide for the 20+ day trek, and knew the circuit like the back of his hand. Speaking fluent English, Chhatra had answer for all of our questions, and often a story to go with them. He was as chatty and affable as he was serious and alert, and wherever we went, Chhatra always seemed to know where to stay and who to talk to. We would often talk during the course of the trek and once it was over we all felt that we had gained a friend as well as having shared a wonderful experience.No matter the trail that you decide to walk, choose Nepal Eco Adventure and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

It made everything so easy from explaining menu's, paying for things, knowing the best places to stay/eat and of course local history and a great interest in his environment and global matters also. Excellent English with even a hint of a Scottish accent from his yearly Scottish HIkes. Chhatra is a very genuine guy and I'd have a drink with him as easy here in Ireland as in Katmandu. Down to earth, open and intelligent. I'd have no problem recommending Nepal Eco Adventures to anyone and if you'd like you can PM me and I can discuss costs/Annapurna/times etc. I also did a 3 day Chitwan National Part package with NEO.

Having trekked to Everest Base Camp in Khumbu, Nepal with Nepal Eco Adventure, I cannot recommend them enough.A local company using only local staff, the guides and porters are of the highest quality, with a rarely seen zest and contentment in their work. My guide had an enormous amount of experience, was deeply knowledgeable and was better equipped than any of the guides you will find in the mountains. The team were naturals at their work and extremely professional in their duties, and really made the difference on this trek \u2013 making a great trip into a truly unforgettable experience.The trip was absolutely incredible and I would encourage any able-bodied and properly-equipped individual who is considering it to go for it \u2013 from the chaos and diversity of KTM to the landing at Lukla to the endless 6000m+ mountain vistas and the unique landscape of base camp and the approaching glacier, which is like an alien planet. There are too many great things to experience and remember about this trip, is was a complete sensory overload. Things went pretty much as expected, I had planned to go to EBC, then over Cho-la and Renjo-la Passes and back down through to Lukla via Thame. However after EBC we reached Dzonghla, which is the only stopping place before crossing the path, only to experience heavy snow overnight making it too difficult to make the pass so we had to head back. That was disappointing but freak unusual weather can occur anytime.I would use Nepal Eco Adventure's services again without question. I saw many guides, some of which were substandard and didn\u2019t really do anything more than the minimum required, their customers were complaining but I did not have a single thing to complain about. The service started as soon as I arrived in Kathmandu and lasted for the complete duration of my trip, despite some large changes of plan during the trip. They have plenty of solid international references, which checked out very well and having used them I now add myself to that list of references, please feel free to contact me direct if you need any further information. Using Nepal Eco Adventures is the only way to trek the Himalaya - you will be provided with sincere support from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave; you will experience a deep sense of local life and culture which many trekkers do not see; you will have the best photos of your trip; you will be contributing only to directly to the people of this wonderful country. It is 100% guaranteed."

I'm glad we went with them over others."

As it was my first time trekking in 10 years, I booked a trek with Above The Himalaya. The owner of the company, Puru, was very responsive through email, and made the entire process very easy.On the day I arrived, Immigrations took about an hour to clear. Despite the long delay, the driver was still waiting at the airport to pick me up. If you've never been to Kathmandu airport, it's pretty chaotic. It's nice that I didn't have to navigate my way over to my lodging after a 12 hour journey.The second day was a tour around Kathmandu, visiting three famous temples. Note that you have to pay the entry fees for these temples (as stated in the itinerary). Just for your information, the ticket fees were 200 Rs, 250 Rs and 1000 Rs, so bring enough cash and small change. My guide was Kumuda, and he was very knowledgeable about the history of the temples and various landmarks in Kathmandu.I have a back injury from military training a decade ago (annular tear), so decided to go with an easy trek (Annapurna Panorama View Trek; Nayapul to Ghandruk, then to Jhinu Danda, then to Pothana, then back to Pokhara). My guide and porter were Bassu and Sorus, and they were a pleasure to be with. The first day's hike was from Nayapul to Ghandruk. I am reasonably fit, but there were way more stone steps than I expected. Those of you with back injuries will know that this is bad news. At Ghandruk, Bassu came up with a new itinerary to avoid too many steps. We thus changed the remainder of the trek to Pothana, Sarangkot then Pokhara. Bassu was thus able to turn what would have been a miserable experience into something memorable and enjoyable.One regret I had was not bringing enough cash. I've just recently graduated from grad school (which was the reason for the trip) and was trying to spend as little as I could. But seriously, it felt ridiculous that I was privileged enough to travel yet still tried to scrimp on things like tea. I'd advise you to bring more cash, and in small denominations. Many of the villagers can't make change for large notes. You can use your large denominations in the supermarkets in the city before you start your trek. If, however, you're really tight on cash, be sure to check how much things cost before you use them. E.g. Wifi and hot showers cost about 100 Rs at the altitude I was at, and I didn't know until the next day when my guide told me before we left for our next checkpoint."

However, Nepal offers more than trekking, Kathmandu valley have more UNISCO World Heritage sites than any country in the world. Walking in Kathmandu Durban Square, Bhaktapur, or Patan is like walking into an open museum. Also if you cannot do trekking in the mountains, you can drive to one of the hill station near Kathmandu like Nagarkot, Sarangkot, Dhulikhel and watch sunrise/sunset over the peaks of the Himalayas. In this trip I stayed in a hotel in Dhulikhel (recommended by Mr Puru) where the view is amazing overlooking terrace gardens and the Himalayan peaks in the background; adding to view, the sounds of birds singing, it is so serene. If you like more adventure, you can go on Safari in Chitwan, you can do rafting, Paragliding, and many more activities. Don\u2019t get discourage to visit Nepal by the earthquake of 2015, Nepal is very safe, only old historic buildings seen damage but hotels and new buildings are mostly untouched.

Prior to our trek, Puru was easy to communicate with via email, accommodating and quick to answer all of my many questions. They helped set up our transportation to/from Pokhara, helped make sure we had the correct equipment, and gave advice prior to the trek. Our guide, Basu, was extremely knowledgable and experienced. He made sure we felt safe and incredibly well taken care of during our trip. Our porter, Pharlad, was a true superman! Together, the two of them made the trek fun and looked out for us the entire time. We truly felt that the Above the Himalaya team had our best interests in mind the entire trek -- keeping us informed of every detail, being flexible to our requests, ensuring that we were taken care of in all guest houses, and teaching us about Nepali culture and language. Definitely consider booking with Above the Himalaya!"

He even rearranged our hotels when we opted to extend our stay in Pokhara.With respect to the trek guide(Basu) and support person(Prahlad) they very knowledgeable of the history and terrain.

We considered changing out plan to go there in a few years and do somewhere else instead for our Christmas/New Year trip. However we decided that it would be better to support the Nepalese community now with our tourist dollars, rather than wait until things started to get back to normal, and I'm glad we did.I looked at lots of different companies to run a tour for my wife and I, and decided that we would prefer a local company rather than one based here in Australia. Not only were they cheaper, but to have true locals organising and running the tour I thought would be the better option, and I'm confident it was. From the get go Puru was excellent at helping me sort out our overall itinerary, advising what we should do each day, where we should go etc. I honestly left it all to Puru, when we arrived I didn't even know the name of the hotel we were staying at the first night - that was the amount of trust I had in his ability - and he deserved it.My wife and I had a total of 15 days traveling, including a 5 day trip in the middle to Bhutan. My advice to everyone is if you're going all the way to Nepal, spend a few days in Bhutan as well. It's very expensive there (because it's all run by the government) but the experience is definitely worth it.At all times we were extremely happy with our drivers and guides, who were always knowledgeable, polite, helpful and willing to change plans to suit what we wanted to do.I have no hesitation in recommending people to book with Above the Himalaya."

We also accompanied him to a traditional Nepali dinner with traditional dancing. This was a fantastic experience.The trek itself was both physically and mentally challenging, but the most rewarding experience. The views are breathtaking and you feel a real sense of achievement when you reach that days destination.I would encourage people to purchase Aqua tabs and bring your own toilet paper. Both water and toilet paper cost a fortune the higher you go. Thank you to all at Above the Himalaya for a trip of a lifetime.

We contacted Puru through his website & found him to be excellent in his speed & clarity of communication through email.There was just myself & my wife & he arranged the whole trip well. Sadly, due to weather conditions we had to cancel the EBC trek & switch to ABC which he arranged within hours. As it was my wife's birthday on the day we were due to fly to Lukla he, very kindly & unexpectedly, took us out to dinner with his wife & son to a traditional Nepalese retaraunt that we would never have discovered.The next day we flew to Pokhara with our guide Purna & met our porter Sumain. Purna & Sumain were both brilliant ar their jobs & excellent company throughout the trek. The ABC trek was excellent & we soon forgot the disappointment of not being on our 1st choice.For those of you that aren't sure about whether to hire guides & porters, I would really recommend that you do. Apart from employing people who know what they're doing, having someone who understands the language & customs is invaluable - plus Purna was an expert at queue 'management' at the airport!!!We plan to return to Nepal in November/December 2016 to have another go at EBC & will be using Above The Himalaya again without hesitation.I'll be in touch soon Puru................."

The first four days in and around Kathmandu, spending nights also in Nagarkot (view of the distant Everest if it weren't foggy) and Godawari (Botanical Garden and a splendid rice-paddy view from the hotel). Lots of Hindu and Bhuddist temples with a very informative guide. Then two days at Chitwan National Park (a somewhat commercial place where the main excitement is to ride an elephant to disturb a sleeping rhino, but a full day canoeing plus birding drive back were excellent activities) with a very knowledgeable birding guide. Then a long but beautiful drive through the Terai to Koshi Tappu where one lodges in a very pleasant \"tent\" (more like a bungalow with a fully equipped bathroom) and then a day bird watching there, with again a very good and pleasant guide. We scored 95 species, many new to us. The 11-hour drive back was long but spectacular going over the mountains south-west of Kathmandu. The driver was extremely safe and very nice. Upshot: also arthritic elders who can't trek anymore are well-advised to use Puru's company."

The jeep transport was a good solution to the nature of the Dunche road, and the two drivers there and back were skillful and alert. Considering the buses we saw, the road covered, and the two recent bus accidents with multiple deaths, we thought we had very good value (transport from door of Kathmandu valley accommodation and back). Think of the jeep expense as a safer and more predictable flight, compared to flying to Lukla.Possible improvements \u2013 our combined load for our porter was less than 20kg (and Gyan and Mani could see/feel this when they came to pick us up), but it may help the company to weigh the loads before starting (and also for trekkers to weigh beforehand their potential loads for porters).What would we do next time: Go for shorter walking days with less altitude gain, especially going from the road at Shyapru up to Langtang village. Far better to spend more time enjoying the great scenery of the Lantang river gorge and cataract, and the surrounding forest. One of things we enjoyed most was the day walk from Tholo Syabru along the \u2018easy\u2019 route through Brabal to the road at Tholo Bharkhu (we did this because we had been delayed with colds). The route had very few trekkers, and some of the best scenery of the trek \u2013 forested and with views up the Trisuli valley into Tibet, and across to Paldor and Ganesh Himal."

He went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience.Planning:He is very easy to work with remotely. He responded to email within a day, usually within a few hours. His English is excellent and provided detailed answers to questions. He was also very understanding and accommodating of our changing itinerary, dates, and complicated logistics. Trips:We did 2 trips through Above the Himalaya. First we did a Kathmandu Valley site seeing trip. He provided us with an excellent driver and a nice car at reasonable price that made for an enjoyable and efficient day. The second trip was Tibet Overland Tour--8 days, Kathmandu to Lhasa. Although his company (being based in Nepal) cannot run trips into China, he set us up with a good tour partner in Tibet and handled all of the complicated logistics (including very complicated Chinese visa issues). Most noteworthy, he fought for us with the China tour operator when they overcharged us for train tickets from Lhasa into the rest of China. When he couldn't get them to refund us he personally refunded the overcharge. This was way above and beyond what he had to do, and made us feel wonderful about the whole experience, especially working with him. We would definitely travel with Above the Himalayas again if we return to this part of the world. Thanks Puru!"

I searched on the Internet and found Above Himalayan Trekking. I spoke over telephone many times with Puru, Managing Director and asked to arrange the trip for 25 days. Puru was young man of late twenties at that time, and I was not certain. But, he arranged trekking guide, Phurwa Sherpa, climbing guide, Lakupa Sherpa, both are reliable and I was satisfied finally. Since I was 60 years old and it was my first trip to Nepal, I gave up at 5,900m at limit of my power. It was unforgettable days. Years later, I tried Lobche East 6,100m, a trekking peak located west of Lobche village on the way to Mt. Everest, and asked Puru to arrange 1 person trip for 25 days. The trekking guide was Phruwa Sherpa, same as before, and climbing guide was Cetem Sherpa, a resident of Lobche. This time, with their suitable support, I climbed to 6,070m, almost summit, and safely returned. It was very satisfactory. In this November, I am planning with Puru 17 days trip with members of my mountain club to climb Naya Kanga 5,850m, Yala Peak 5,520m, located in Lantan Valley."

No other web based company came anywhere near matching Puru for communication.Once arriving in Kathmandu we met our guide Basu. We immediately felt comfortable with Basu and he reviewed our trekking clothing/equipment and went with us to Sportswear International to hire sleeping bag and down jacket, plus purchase a few items we still needed.Basu had a chat to us about how to enjoy the trek - stay clear of meat, drink 5 litres of water a day, trek steadily but not fast and give way on the inside (not outside) to animals and porters carrying loads. Basu was extremely attentive to our needs and when my wife showed disappointment in her face at not getting a private bathroom in Namche he immediately changed our room to one with a private bathroom. I believe Above the Himalayas stayed at the better tea houses/lodges on the trek and Basu always tried to get us the best rooms He was extremely observant to how much we were eating, drinking and whether our walking pace was slowing. He also would always ask how we were feeling and if we had headaches.The trek was fantastic but we did have some health challenges early. At Namche my wife was feeling a bit nauseous and flat, and Basu advised that this was just adjusting to altitude and another day in Namche would do the trick - of course he was right.Then when trekking from Namche to Tengboche I struggled with a bacterial stomach bug and was unable to complete the days trek. Whilst resting at a tea house Basu contacted the closest doctor and the consensus was that if I didn't improve I needed to see the doctor. Basu was concerned that we were at a very small tea house and that if I got worse in the middle of the night there was nothing that he could do. As I didn't get better, Basu hired a horse and I was transported for 2 hours to Khunde/Khumjung to visit the doctor. Not a fun ride,but a wise decision. I had already started taking antibiotics that we had,and the doctor was reassuring in advising that I was taking the right medicine.That night, Basu talked to my wife and myself and said if we both did not start eating and get stronger, that it would be unwise to go higher where you really need your strength to handle the altitude and cold. We discussed an alternative trek.Miraculously the next morning I was much stronger and eating so we agreed to continue the trek to Tengboche on the proviso that any repeat of illness meant turning around. Fortunately we had extra days up our sleeve.Fortunately the next 2 days went well and Basu agreed we could complete the full EBC trek, arranging with Puru to have our flight from Lukla resecheduled - he was happy because he wanted a successful trek for us. It was fantastic as we got up above the treeline and the landscape changed, and we were surrounded by large snow capped mountains. To reach EBC and to do Kala Patthar were highlights.Note, we did come across others who had to turn around due to altitude issues - fortunately as we went higher we coped well with the altitude. As the trek went on, we got to know Basu better and he was great fun and liked to joke and laugh. We cannot thank Basu enough for making sure we had a great trek. Upon returning from the trek, Puru made sure we were happy and comfortable in Kathmandu before returning home. We cannot speak highly enough of Puru and Above the Himalayas."

Because communication with this company was sporadic and unclear, I switched to Above the Himalaya. Puru answered each email inquiry promply and clearly. Skype was also used for our conversations. I explained to Puru my idea of doing the Annapurna circuit on a solo basis. It was a risky journey for me. I am a 65 year old female post cancer and heart attack. So why would I choose such a challenging trip?...Puru matched me with guide/porter Suresh. We travelled together for 15 days/ I was free as a bird to listen and watch all around me because Suresh took care of all the details that might stress a foreign trekker. He carried my backpack, knew the quiet and clean lodges, expedited the meal orders, ensured tea stops and took care of all the paperwork at police checkpoints. These things were not my concern. He was my mentor in the ways of Nepali custom. I have the feeling that travelling in large groups takes away the capacity to hear and see the many subtleties in the environment. I remember the language and moods of the Nepali village people, the smells of the pine forest, the spring flowering trees and shrubs, the aromas of incense and simmering curries, and the roar of wind and rivers.Yes, I took away more than I expected from this journey. It was a challenging trek. But the satisfaction and education that I received was priceless! Without the support of AHT the journey would not have worked for me. THANK-YOU ABOVE THE HIMALAYAN TREKKING."

Actually, it before he became the manager of \"Above the Himalaya\" when he was still a guide. I will not extend my talking about how outstanding guide he was, because he is the manager now. Nevertheless I would talk about how reliable and responsible this man is. While me and my partners were trekking the Annapurna circuit, the civil revolution(taking the King's rights and founding a general government) started. During the trek, we almost haven't felt anything, but when we finished the trek at the city of Beni, we found that there was no transportation. Also, all the roads were under a curfew. Allegedly, our deal with Puru was suppose to end there. Beni is not a touristic city, without any English speakers, and it is very hard to get along there. Nevertheless, Puru didn't leave as. He found us place to sleep, and at the day, he lead us to a double day trek, from Beni to Pokara, with no extra charge! Puru stood by us when we were in a non-easy situation, and that I will never forget. Therefore, I believe that with the same decency he treated us, he manages his agency.I also believe that he hires outstanding guides, the same as he is. So, an unforgettable experience is guarantied.Have funEviatar Kheneviatarkhen at gmail.com"

We emailed a few local operators and settled on Above The Himalaya Trekking. From the initial contact Puru adapted to all our requirements. We had a fantastic time and all that was arranged by Puru and his staff and guides worked out great. Our guide Vasu and porter Hari were always helpful and obliging and flexible to our requests, ability and schedule. They looked well after us for the whole six days. City guide Anju also gave us a good tour of the temples and stupas of Kathmandu. The transport arrangements were always on time. An arrangement at short notice for the flight over Everest to fit in with our schedule was also appreciated, it was the one time when we saw the full extent of the mountains. Unfortunately, whilst the weather was very good during the trek, the mountains were hidden most of the time in a haze, but at times they did pop out. So our timing was unfortunate. We were warned that this might happen toward the end of the season (second half of May), but it was the only time we had available this year. I hope to get back sometime to trek a bit further up into the mountains or do agreater part or all of the Annapurna circuit. So thanks to Puru for a well arranged holiday. I can recommend Above The Himalaya Trekking to anyone wanting to go on a holiday to Nepal. Walter Pippan"

He was more than flexible than we decided to change our plans just 4 weeks before our arrival as we were afraid of flight cancellations to Lukla /at the beginning we were dreaming about EBC via Gokyo trek/. Puru arranged all the permits and TIMS as well as the tickets for our KTM-Pokhara flight and we collected them on our arrival day so we could start our trek the next day. Everything was as promised, our porter-guide Suresh was waiting for us at the Pokhara airport and arranged the taxi to Phedi. During all the trek Suresh was a great companion, who answered all our questions and explained us about plants, animals, the mountains and the country. He was respecting our wishes as for trek itinnery, lodges etc. and he was always more than helpful with all the arrangements of the accomodations and meals. We appreciated his company and his sense of humour. It was thanks to his advises that we could extend our trek an make the trek to PoonHill in the limited time we had. It was a wonderful trek and we would do it the same way with Puru and Suresh anytime again.

Our trip started a year before we set foot in Nepal, searching for a good, reputable trekking company to handle all of the logistics of our trek. Our group of 5 friends had decided to tackle the challenging Everest High Pass Trek which, rather than following the main trail from Lukla up to Everest Base Camp (EBC) and back, follows a circuitous route off the beaten track to reach EBC. In the process, trekkers climb through three high passes (the Renjo la, Cho la and the Khongma la) with each topping out well over 17,000ft. Needless to say, finding a trustworthy company was a high priority for us.After reading guidebooks and searching through countless websites, we had narrowed our search down to a handful of companies. E-mail exchanges and phone conversations were next \u2026 and after skyping with Puru, our decision was made. Above The Himalaya offered favorable rates, experienced guides and porters, and the luxury of a private trek (which ensured the flexibility to change our trek as needed). We were not disappointed. Puru and his staff capably handled all of the logistics, from our arrival in Kathmandu to our departure 21 days later. Our guide, Phurwa Sherpa, was tremendous \u2026 always cheerful, always helpful, he and our porters made the trip the experience of a lifetime. When a snowstorm closed the Cho la the day before we were supposed to cross, Phurwa smoothly altered our itinerary without missing a beat and we still made EBC and Kala Pattar. He was an exceptional guide and, I think I can safely speak for all of five of us, a good friend.We had a fantastic experience and I would recommend Above The Himalaya to anyone considering trekking in Nepal."

I started corresponding with him almost a year in advance of my May-June trip. He was always very responsive to my many emails and always offered good, sound suggestions for a successful trip. We had limited time 9 days which is very short for a country like Nepal. I had traveled to Nepal 3 times before in the 90\u2019s for business so I basically knew what I did and didn\u2019t want to see. It was my daughter\u2019s first trip there, so I really wanted it to be special. We were professionally met on time at the airport by Puru along with traditional Marigold traveler garlands. We stayed in a five star hotel while in Kathmandu. We were able to tour the whole Kathmandu valley with all of its temple sites with a wonderful tour guide, Koumara, who was well spoken in English and a wealth of knowledge about the Buddhist and Hindu cultures and religion. We also toured the walled city of Bhatkapur. We then flew on the Mountain flight past Everest and the rest of the Himalayan range. Then, a quick flight off to Pokhara, again all connections were met on time by representatives of the company. Due to the heat of the season and my health, we opted last minute, to change our trekking plans and remain in Pokhara. Puru completely altered our itinerary and within 1 hour our plans were changed to accommodate our new schedule. New tours were added and all worked seamlessly. All for only a nominal charge since we were adding nights in a good hotel and not staying in tea houses as originally planned. My daughter then flew on a Micro light aircraft into the Annapurna range, truly a once in a lifetime experience! We toured the Pokhara valley and explored around Fewa Lake, truly a beautiful calming place after the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu. We then again were met by our driver for our drive to Chitwan Park. While en route we had a wonderful white water rafting experience on the Trisulli River (Class 3). We saw the diversity of the countryside and the way of life of the people of the region, everything was so GREEN! After the raft ride we drove on to Chitwan Park. We stayed in a brand new hotel with beautiful grounds, rode camels and then elephants! We then saw an excellent cultural show of the Taru people, half dance and half martial arts! The next day our elephant safari was terrific, although no tigers were spotted, we saw Asian Rhino\u2019s and spotted deer and a multitude of birds. My daughter then went for an Elephant Bath, where you ride an elephant bareback into the river and you get the full elephant trunk shower experience! She then rode her elephant back into town. After a wonderful meal prepared by our hotel staff, we packed for our flight back to Kathmandu for our last evening in Nepal, again staying in a five star hotel. We woke already packed and did a final walking tour of the city to Durbar square and some last minute shopping. Again we were met on time and whisked off to the airport for our trip home to NYC. As a parting gift we were each given a silk scarf as a token of friendship and safe travel. I would recommend Above the Himalaya Trekking to anyone wishing to go to Nepal. The itineraries can be combined or custom designed by Puru and fit into any travel schedule. They also have well designed preplanned treks throughout the region. They are a responsible, professional, honest, safety conscious organization, which you can rely on when booking from continents away. His prices are extremely competitive and a great value. I have visited over 52 countries and have never had better service! Jeffrey Gaal, New York City, USA"

Mr Puru Timalsena was excellent from the very beginning, replying to me emails courteously and VERY quickly. He was able to organise the exact trek we wanted, when we wanted, and was very happy to work around my travel times and flight changes etc. We were absolutely at ease when being transferred to and from the bustling airport - our pickup simply waited for hours until our flight, which was late, arrived. It's comforting to know that they will simply wait for you, and not leave if your flight is late!While on the trek, one of our group experienced acute mountain sickness, and required a helicopter evacuation down to Kathmandu. A scary experience! We had the travel insurance to cover such an event, and both Puru and our Guide (who knew exactly what to do), organised everything so smoothly. The helicopter was called, the doctor was visited, and Puru dealt directly with our insurance company (he has experience in this department) and took care of EVERYTHING. It was completely 100% stress free, in a worst case scenario. On top of this, the trek itself was highly enjoyable, thanks to a great team of porters and our guide, who took excellent care of us and made sure we had a great time! (Oh, and Puru really gives you the best price around, which includes tours of Kathmandu and a traditional Nepalese dinner and entertainment at the end of the trek! Great value for money!).If you want peace of mind that you are getting an honest and reliable company when booking your next adventure in Nepal, choose Above the Himalaya. They really go above and beyond your usual trekking deal. If I ever go back, or visit the neighbouring Bhutan, there is no doubt I will be giving Puru a call to organise it!"

Three of us (all girls) went to Nepal for a 15 day trip and Puru arranged everything for us - an 8 day trekking leg on the Everest route up to Tengboche followed by a trip to Pokhara with paragliding and a few days in Kathmandu itself. We had an excellent experience with a great guide, Hari and our 2 porters, Tika and Umess. We did not have to worry about anything at all, everything was well planned and we felt safe at all times. Our flight from Lukla to Kathmandu was cancelled due to bad weather but Puru managed to get us seats on a flight the following day - it was very, very impressive!Despite the change in schedule, the rest our trip didnt feel rushed. Puru simply rearranged our activities. All we had to do was enjoy ourselves - the hotels were clean and in convenient locations. Transport was all taken care of and we always had someone accompanying us to the bus stations and airport. We would highly recommend making a trekking trip to Nepal - the views were breathtaking and the experience unforgettable. A big thank you to AHT and Puru and his team and we're looking forward to our next trip to Nepal!"

We hiked to Mount Everest base camp and up to Kalapathar with an exceptional guide, Phurba. Without going into detail we were forced to modify our route rendering out trip shorter by a few days, and Puru was incredibly kind to us, even giving us a refund on the island peak part of our trip that we were unable to do. Our hike was still an incredible success, made all the better by our guide who literally carried my bag when I was at my weakest (I had gotten sick in Lungden), held my hand when I was scared while walking on a skinny, windy exposed trail, and whipped out a never ending number of chocolate bars when my energy was low. He even went back out into awful weather as it was getting dark to go find our porter who had gotten lost, carrying all our gear including my stash of daily contact lens! Puru, the organizer, met us at the airport, installed us into our hotel in Kathmandu, ensured we were picked up for our cultural tour, prepared us for our trip both via many emails and then in person, and then kindly helped us out when we changed our itinerary mid way on our trek. There are so many variables when choosing this type of trip, one of which is finding a trustworthy company to help you fulfill your dream. Puru is reliable, knowledgable, has excellent guides and is fair and kind. Definitely the sort of company you can trust your life with. He still keeps in touch today which is how I learned that my original, and much lengthier review, had gone missing."

Puru at Above The Himalayas quickly organised a custom tour for me after just a couple of emails. One of his guides met me at the airport in Kathmandu and basically took care of all my needs until I left 2 weeks later.The hotel he arranged for the first night was fine and looked after the luggage I didn't take with me on the trek. My guide, Goki, took me around some of the outdoor shops to hire equipment and collected me from the hotel the next morning for our flight to Lukla. Bad weather at Lukla meant we sat around at the airport all day until the airline finally cancelled the flight. We tried again next morning and after a couple of hours delay we were on our way. Since there was just me and Goki we were able to move more quickly than the typical larger groups on standard tours. Trekking at altitude was noticeably harder than trekking at sea level but the stages were easily manageable in 4-6 hour days and we made up the day lost at the airport. The trekking was brilliant and the scenery fantastic. On our final ascent day we couldn't get to base camp because of bad weather. With no spare days in this custom itinerary we had to turn around and head down the mountain. We shaved a day off the already shortened descent time and flew out of Lukla a day earlier than planned. Puru arranged a sightseeing trip around Kathmandu to soak up the spare day and one of his staff collected me from the hotel and took me to the airport the next day.At all times Puru and his team were friendly and helpful with a \"can do\" attitude. The custom package he organised was exactly as I wanted it and competitively priced. I thoroughly recommend Above The Himalaya Trekking for your Everest and surrounding areas trekking. I also recommend building at least 2 or 3 extra spare days into your itinerary to allow for delays caused by bad weather or acclimatisation issues."

Accommodation and meals were arranged along the way in teahouses, were the hosts were warm and accommodating. I was able to set the pace of the trek, as I am not the most atheletic person and sometimes struggle at high altitude, which was a blessing. On talking to my guide he advised he was able to tailor it to suit the trekker, so anyone who wanted a trek at a faster pace would also be in good hands.The length of the trek was perfect for me and I got to take in the amazing sights of this beautiful part of the world. The highlight for me would be reaching Namche Bazaar and seeing the setting sun over the Himalyas. I also loved the bakeries, as they had a great selection of pastries and biscuits, must haves after you've been trekking a few days.Chitwan National Park was three days of more natural wonders, again a guide was supplied and all transfers included.

Puru is a logistics master as well as leading an incrdedible staff to support all the wonderful adventures that can be arranged.Since that time, Puru and I have remained global friends as well as business schemers together. I have had the pleasure to revisit Katmandu last year and meet with Puru and his lovely whole family. While I was there working on my business project I came across a woman from Peru, she had landed in Katmandu without any organized service to assist her. She was not in a good state as she had found it quite difficult to feel comfortable with what she had found. I told her, \"you are in luck, I know just the Man\".

As it turned out, a family emergency back in the U.S. necessitated a quick departure, and we had no time to retrieve our belongings from the hotel in Kathmandu. A phone call to Puru resulted in being met at the airport with all of our luggage, and we were able to get home on the next available flight. Without his help, this would not have happened. Truly a professional and a genuinely nice person. I'll absolutely go back to Nepal and would not call anyone other than Puru to help plan my trip! Thank you, Puru and Above the Himalayas!"

We had never been to an Asian country so I researched the internet and discovered Above the Himalaya to look after our needs. From my very first e-maiI I was impressed with Puru. He was quick and precise with his responses no matter how many questions I had for him. Every little detail from our airport pick up to our guide for the Annapurna Panorama Trek was looked after for us. Not a single hitch in any of the itinerary and we were most pleased with his choices. We spent a few days initially in Kathmandu and did two day excursions that were extremely informative and interesting. We learned so much about the Nepalese people and their culture from our guide Purba on the trek. A three night stay in Chitwan National Park completed our vacation. Another worthwhile portion of our time in Nepal. We experienced the jungle through jeep safaris and rode elephants in search of rinos. Many thanks to Puru and his staff. Everyone was extremely professional and personable and we left feeling like we had made new friends. I would highly recommend Above the Himalaya for any arrangements that you might need in Nepal."

There are 3 very special memories I have of our trip to Nepal; and these were only possible because Puru organized such a personalized trip for me and my adult son. He ensured we were well taken care of and didn't miss any aspect of this beautiful country; and yet was always available himself to answer our questions and offer recommendations.We had incredible guides for our walks, who understood that part of the wonder of visiting a country is to meet the real people who live there. When I was surrounded by a group of singing, laughing children, I was delighted to be so accepted into their group.We loved the elephants at Chitwan, especially the mischievous youngsters.And, of course, the mountains of the Annapurna are indescribably beautiful.A tour company which offers such individual service makes a perfect vacation."

I was very satisfied with Puru\u2019s polite and detailed response for my e-mail question. He did perfect explanation of trekking, even if the question was so stupid and so small thing. Hari Acharya(Guide/Porter) made me feel very happy in doing this trek. He attended to all of my needs, from evacuation, sickness, communications to meal preferences. In particular, he accepted all my request for side-walk(walking around Khumjung, hiking Nangkar tshang, Italian Pyramid etc.) without any hesitation. Thank you so much, Hari. We will meet again whenever, wherever\u2026Again, I would like to give my big thanks to Above The Himalaya for the wonderful time with Mt. Everest.

The first day was a great tour of Kathmandu - monkey temple, Crematorium, Kathmadu palace tours etc. very interesting. The trek was amazing, and our guide, Toby (Chhabi) was unreal - he looked after all our needs and was a great guy to trek with. Very knowledgeable and a real support for my wife and I (who are not experienced Trekkers). Everything was looked after and well organised. They ensured we had the best accomodation in all villages. Pream, our porter was amazing - took our two bags up and down the mountain and they were ready and waiting for us at every village we stayed at.

He was as flexible as we wish and manage to work in extras as we became aware of the options available. Lastly his inside knowledge and connections helped us do all this avoiding typical delays common to travel in Nepal.

After various inquiries with different tour operators, I finally decided to let Outshine Adventure handle my family's cultural & sightseeing tour of Nepal. The main reason is that the owner, Mr. Gokul Sapkota was quick to reply to my queries. Pricing was reasonable and he was able to offer all that we required- comfortable hotels, private vehicles with air-conditioning, knowledgeable guide & airport transfers. Had I asked for a helicopter in case I needed to be bailed out of altitude sickness, I'm sure he could have easily arranged it too. Okay, I'm going too far talking about altitude sickness. There's no such thing when just visiting UNESCO sites & looking at the Himalayas from a low hill, sipping organic Nepali tea if you please. To put it simply, Gokul is very resourceful & trustworthy.We arrived late at night with our flight delayed for an hour. I thought we could get out of the airport easily as we already filled out our Nepalese visa application online. But then, the airport carousel took so long to spew out the last luggage, with none of ours arriving. We got more delayed coming out of the airport because we had to file for baggage tracking. Anyway, after that arrival hiccup, we were quite happy to see the Outshine representative whose name I forgot meet us when we got out. He & the driver were very patient in waiting for us & i commend them for that. The following morning, we met up with Gokul in his office right in Thamel. He briefed us about our tour. We paid him the balance of our tour cost. He also helped us with currency exchange, giving us a much better rate than at the airport or elsewhere. He was very cordial & we felt assured that we could count on him.Siri, our guide for our day tours in Kathmandu, was knowledgeable, helpful & professional. We also felt safe with all the drivers. All the vehicles used were comfortable and bigger than the typical car in Nepal which can be quite tiny.Before we left Nepal, we had dinner with Gokul and met his beautiful young family. I'm so glad I went with Gokul & his Outshine Adventure team. You can easily see the passion he has to succeed as well as helping others.Overall, we felt safe & had a great time in Nepal. Do go if you haven't. I want to go back someday. Thank you, Gokul and Outshine Adventure team."

We arrived New Years eve, with the plan for the next few days to check out all the tourist sites ourselves. Well, a few days of travel from the states and having to switch hotels after one night left us a bit exhausted. We opted to utilize the services of a Tour Provider in the area. We found Gokul and Outshine Adventures here on Tripadvisor. Our hotel was only a 10 minute walk from the office, so we decided to go over and see what could be arranged for the next two days in Kathmandu. Even though it was last minute, Gokul put together an excellent itinerary with one of the best guides I've experienced during my travels! Gokul also advised against some of the items we were asking about (His thoughts were, the weather wasn't clear enough to see anything....he was totally right!)The driver and car were both great as well! I really can't say anything bad about the tours Gokul setup. The guide even helped us with buying some medicine at the pharmacy, and was very understanding when one of us was feeling a bit under the weather towards the end of the tour and just wanted to relax. (Sorry to the Thangka School we were touring at the time....the work was beautiful and If not for starting to not feel well, we definitely would have stayed longer and bought something!) Gokul even helped arrange our airport transfer back to the airport.The trip ended up being such an incredible experience, thanks in part to Gokul. If I find my way back to Nepal (which I very much hope I do!), I will absolutely be utilizing the services of Outshine Adventure. Thanks again for everything!"

I did so based on the many excellent TripAdvisor reviews. I was travelling with my 20 year old daughter who was living in India at the time. Gokul (the owner) was very responsive to emails prior to departure and was very clear about exactly what was included and what was not included in our tour package. We were very late coming out of the airport because of long visa lines and also because the airline had lost my luggage. I was worried the driver might not wait so long but he was waiting there with the sign even though we were well over an hour past our planned arrival. Our trip went exactly as planned. Our guide, Amit, was very friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and spoke very clear English. I was worried about our luggage, but Amit put us at ease, saying \"your worries are now my worries, so you can enjoy your visit\". He and Gokul took over all communication with the airport regarding my luggage and I indeed didn't have to worry about it at all. Amit delivered my luggage to the hotel soon after it arrived at the airport. This would have been very difficult for me to arrange by myself.Another major event happened during our visit. A Turkish airliner crash landed at the airport, which caused the airport to close for 4 days. Our outgoing flight to Varanasi India was cancelled and there was no indication when the airport would reopen. This is where Gokul's services really shined. He took us under his wing and informed us of several options we had of getting to India. We ended up booking an overland bus directly from Kathmandu to Varnasi. Gokul handled everything including buying the tickets, arranging for an extended stay at our hotel, and having a driver take us to the bus station and make sure we we got on the bus successfully. I don't know what we would have done without Gokul and Outshine Adventures. Through the whole trip, Gokul was always working in the background, ensuring we knew exactly what was next. He seemed to anticipate our every need before we even knew what we needed.I highly recommend Outshine Adventures for any trip to Nepal. You can rest assured that he will take care of you, even when things don't go as planned."

All in all, they aimed for customer satisfaction and to ensure our stay is pleasant. our guide even told us how certain things work in nepal and it saved us from being hustled from other Nepalese. if i do come back to nepal, definitely it will be sunshine =)"

There was a time when we got a bit hesitant because of the late replies when we were making inquiries and making our transaction, but it turned out that we had nothing to worry about. Gokul and his staff were very accommodating and helpful during our entire stay. They didn't even mind our last minute adjustments during our trip. Will definitely contact Outshine Adventure again when i return to Nepal."

They arranged everything so well including our flights from Kathmandu to Pokhara and return. We were met at the airport. All connections were perfect. We had a chance to meet several guides from this organization. All were personable and professional. When we left, we felt we had made new friends. Gokul has built a top notch organization in a relatively short period of time that now includes 17 guides. (Our guide, Dambar, had to be the best.) They are worthy of their #1 ranking and I would highly recommend them. We hope to book another trip in the future to a different area - maybe Tibet or Bhutan."

I scheduled 2 private day tours and Gokul was extremely helpful in suggesting how I should spend my time. He also helped me set-up a guided Trekking tour with his staff as well. I very much enjoyed the entire planning process and most importantly the actual delivery was above my expectations.For my private tours of Kathmandu Valley, I had a fantastic guide. Bijay took me to explore so many fascinating sites around the valley. Bijay was so friendly, welcoming and his English was extremely good. I would highly recommend scheduling private tours to explore the best of the Kathmandu Valley and I strongly suggest you do so with Outshine Adventure. My trekking expedition was also amazing as it was a private one. My guide and porter were both fantastic. One of the best moments of my entire \"round the world\" trip was when both Shankar and Nabarad sang to me a Nepalese song as we trekked our way through the forrest. Just priceless!Hope you find this review helpful."

My daughter meanwhile enjoyed Chitwan National Park. She kept gushing about the rhinos, and crocodiles she saw even after we went home. I think the best reward for us parents during that trip was the relaxing experience at Pokhara where we went boating and enjoyed the sight of the Himalayas. I loved how relaxing that went.

In short Mosiac were excellent during all stages of our trek from initial emails, delivering what they promised and their staff and accommodation.As close to faultless as you could get.I arranged an EBC and Gokyo trek for 6 friends to be followed by a Chitwan and Pokhara tour by two couples following the trek.Madhav was by far the best of all the companies I approached initially. He replied promptly to all emails and also answered all questions fully as they arose.Our group arrived all at different times and all were met on time. Hotel Moonlight was great accommodation which drew comment from two of our group who have been to Nepal many times and they both claimed it was better than any others they had previously used in other treks.We had major issues with weather conditions for our trek but both Madhav and our guide Bhabanath Adhikari AKA BN always met with us all, laid out our options, and allowed us to formulate any changes if necessary. Luckily although two days delayed we managed to complete all parts of our trek due to the flexibility of the Mosiac team. The guides and porters were great fun, honest and made our trip fantastic. The tea houses were all above my expectations and again them and the meals were great quality.The post trek dinner was a great night and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and Madhav's company on the night.Following the Trek as it transpired only three of us went on the following trip to Chitwan & Pokhara again Mosiac's flexibility on the cancellation of one of the guests was commendable and more than fair on refunds etc. (Keshar) the guide supplied for Kathmandu tours and Pokhara was excellent and all vechicles, drivers and hotels were really good, made us feel safe and comfortable. More delays with weather flying back from Pokhara but Madhav kept in contact from Kathmandu so we at all times were aware of the changing conditions of the airport and flights. To sum up I am a first time Nepal trekker but could not have wanted for a smoother organised trekking company. Madhav had everything covered. This message was again also relayed from the two in our group who normally have trekked using a bigger international tour company in their several other treks, they were doubtful at first but came away so impressed with what the small local company had provided. Really pleased we were able to deal direct to a local company cutting out the big multinational tour group"

He responded promptly to any email or query that I had.Pralhad, our guide, was an exceptionally attentive guide who made the trek a fantastic experience.

They were better than I expected by far, even the toilets!!!The food was always hot, plentiful and delicious.With only thee days left of our trek I was flown out by helicopter, from Macchermo, as I suffered from HAPE. Pralhad was efficient when he organised the airvac. I couldn't have had a more compassionate person to be there with me. My disappointment at not completing my trek was at times overwhelming but Pralhad was understanding and supportive in all ways.Madhav was at the hospital when I arrived and dealt with all the details of insurance as well as a daily follow-up on my condition while I was hospitalised.The hotel, Hotel Moonlight in Thamel, in Kathmandu went out of their way to make me comfortable when I was discharged from hospital.I have absolutely NOTHING negative to say about Mosaic, it's employees or the service they provide and I would certainly use the company again in the future.TIPS: Take more money than you think you will need, there are delicious bakeries en route and as you climb higher all items (water, phone charging, drinks) are all more expensive.Consider a small solar charge pack for your phone.Take time to talk to people and slow down, the people of Nepal are a gentle race and the scenery is beautiful."

I visited Kathmandu in September 2016 with the intention of travelling to Lhasa; however, after my application for a permit was rejected I was stuck in Nepal with no plans. Staying in Thamel, I googled for reputable tour companies on my phone and came across Mosaic, which happened to be nearby my hotel. I turned up at the office to see how much a trekking tour may cost and what might be possible to arrange last minute. I received a full briefing on the possibilities for last minute 6 or 7 day trek in the Everest Region or Anapurna, as well as advice on gear, plan B if flights didn't take off on the day of departure, and very reasonable and fair prices. I felt very comfortable and paid by visa that day for a trip departing two days later - 6 days trekking to Tengboche in the Everest Region. Mosaic was very professional - enquiring about my travel insurance and also arranging a meeting with my guide (Pralhad) before the departure day. Although I only planned the trip two days in advance of departure, everything went incredibly smoothly and without a hitch. My guide (Pralhad) picked me up at my hotel and we flew out to Lukla. From then on, everything went perfectly - Pralhad knew everything about the trail and I was more than satisfied with all of the teahouses that we stayed at. He arranged everything, including the porter, meals, etc. and I feel like we stayed at the best places on the trip - I had my own room each time, most times with my own bathroom and even hot water sometimes. Pralhad came across as a very experienced guide - and I could tell he was paying attention to the effects of altitude, hyrdration, and also hygiene in the sense that he offered useful advice of not eating meat (because it is not fresh in the mountains) etc. I thought this was a good sign - particularly for tours going further because my opinion was I could trust him should anything ever happen in terms of injury or sickness (so if I return to trek t basecamp I will definitely look him up). Also important to note - as a solo woman traveller in my twenties I originally thought that a woman guide would be the best option (but none were available), however, I felt completely at ease with Pralhad due to his easygoing nature and professionalism.At the end of the trip, our flight back to Lukla was delayed due to technical difficulties and we risked being stuck in Lukla for another couple of days. Pralhad transferred us onto another airline at no extra cost to me despite the extra cost to the company and we got back to Kathmandu on schedule. In comparison, the other trekkers on the flight with different companies who did the same were charged extra by those companies. Given that I practically found Mosaic Travel on the street, I was completely impressed with how smoothly everything went - and some of the other trekkers asked me for the name of the company and guide while we were on the trek based on things such as how the flight delay was sorted out and Pralhad's knowledge of the area and professionalism while we were trekking. I'm tempted to return to Nepal next year to trek all the way to base camp this time and I'd definitely use Mosaic again. I visited the offices of a couple other tour companies in Thamel randomly and although everyone was very nice and the prices were good - and I felt like the tours would be arranged - I felt most confident at Mosaic's office based on their professional vibe and luckily, I was right."

My girlfriend and I did the Gorepani-Poon Hill trekking (5days) with Mosaic Adventure this summer (2016) and it was one of the best experiences we've had in all our travels!We found Mosaic via tripadvisor and decided to look them up in Kathmandu. The office is a bit hard to find in Thamel, but later we were told that they don't mind picking you up at the hotel if you prefer so. We were warmly welcomed and spent a good hour discussing our plans with Raj (founder). He gave us very useful and very honest advice, making sure we would get the best possible experience during our trekking. Next morning we were introduced to Rishi and Purna, our guide and porter. It was really nice meeting them before the trekking. These two guys turned out to be the best guide and porter in the world! Rishi really made sure our trekking was as comfortable and interesting as possible, and Purna is a super friendly father of 2 kids who was always fun to be with on the trail. We enjoyed a lot our evenings with the guys, playing cards and having good talks.The trekking itself was amazing. The 1st day was very easy (just 3 hours walk), and the night was spend in a nice Teahouse on a beautiful location. The 2nd day was very intense (7 hours walk) with 3 hours of climbing 2.000 stairs. But it was a victory at the end of the day when reaching Gorepani. Day 3 was also tough, going up Poon Hill and down to Tarepani. Day 4 and 5 where easy again, but beautiful nonetheless. All together a very beautiful trekking, quite intens but manageable if you are fairly fit.After the trekking we were invited by Raj back to the office to review the trekking. Her truly wanted to make our experience the best possible. We also had dinner with Rishi and Purna, who have become true friends and we will stay in touch with these great guys!I can recommend everybody to book their trekking with Mosaic Adventures. It is a very well organized, honest, friendly and affordable agency managed by some great people :)Thanks for everything Raj, Rishi, Purna!!"

From there I have been constantly sending him mails as this is my first trekking in nepal and in just few minutes I get a great response from him. He gave me options to maximize my stay and I chose the Expat 3-day trekking weekender (Nagarkot-Chisapani-Sundirijal trek). My guide Bhumi is perfect!! He is fun to be with and told me a lot about Nepal. The clouds mostly blocked my views of the mountain since it was raining during my trek but Bhumi make sure that I'm having a good time by sharing stories. Thank you and it was a wonderful experience."

I decided to fly to Kathmandu just 5 days before the actual departure and to plan for such a trip in such a short time, it is thanks to Mosaic's great service. Everything was catered for and communication was very very swift.I spent the most wonderful 2 weeks of my life there with Bhabanath, who is a wonderful guide. There are many guides out there who can bring you to EBC, but not a lot who can turn into a dear friend of yours like Bhabanath. BN was extremely helpful and also immensely experienced. I twisted my ankle on day 4 and without his help and care, I wouldn't have been able to finish the trek. It is during this kind of unaccounted situations that the experience of a guide really matter and I am really glad I chose BN and Mosaic.All in all, highly recommended and I am a very very satisfied customer"

I am delighted to have booked a trek to Everest Base Camp with Mosaic Adventure, and I do not hesitate to recommend this tour company to anyone else doing this amazing trek. Mosaic was friendly and helpful, and their service was impeccable. The incredible natural beauty of the area, the colorful monasteries and prayer flags, and the smiling Himalayans will make you want to visit this country again and again.

There were four in our group, and we were able to see different attractions in Nepal, experience Nepalese culture, and to learn about their history and religions. We also got to experience a flight over Everest, a jungle safari, paragliding, and bungee jumping. Mosaic took care of all the logistic arrangements, so all we had to do was just enjoy. The Mosaic team, especially our guide Dhiren and our driver Suman, made it an amazing experience. Mosaic says that \u2018once is not enough\u2019, and they are so right!

I simply cannot say enough good things about this Nepali owned and operated tour company.I recently completed their \"Taste of Nepal\" tour which included a guided tour around Kathmandu, the famed Poon Hill Trek, and a visit to Chitwan National Park. I also added a flight to view Mt. Everest and the surrounding Himalayas.I had extensive e-mail communication with Madhav, one of the owners, in the preparation phase for this trip. Even before I had agreed to anything, he was very responsive to my questions via e-mail, discussing various trek options and the status of facilities following the 2015 earthquakes.. He must never sleep because many of his replies came at what must have been middle of the night in Kathmandu. The cost of such an inclusive tour was very low, and the down payment at the time of booking was minimal (the balance of pay,ENT was not made until I arrived in Kathmandu). He continued to provide helpful information and prompt replies to my questions during my preparations. He was present on my arrival in Kathmandu, and made sure I was clear about the upcoming details.One of the main logistical challenges of this trip (that involved multiple locations) was that of transportation. Here, the arrangements made by Mosaic went as smoothly as possible. Road conditions are very rough compared to US and European standards, and traffic is nothing short of chaos; however, my travel to and from the airport, around Kathmandu, and between cities went very smoothly. Again, the details were clearly communicated.I had 3 excellent guides for the various portions of my trip. Keshar gave me a great tour around Kathmandu, providing information about the various sites we visited, as well as background about the history- old and recent- of Nepal. Sundeep, my guide in Chitwan, was a great resource about the flora and fauna of the jungle, and made sure I saw as much of it as possible. A special word of commendation must go out to my guide and porter on the trek. Panu, my porter, was a beast as he carried 75% of my gear plus his own up and down the steep and rocky trails, seemingly without effort. He spoke limited English, but seemed to understand mine well enough. He was always eager and willing to help. Rishi, my guide, was nothing short of outstanding. I began the trek at less than full strength, yet he was patient and helpful as I acclimatized to the heat and exertion. Fortunately I grew stronger each day. He handled all the details at the tea houses. We laughed, joked and told stories as we became great friends. He always kept me informed with any necessary details about the trek.I met Raj at the end of the trek. He was extremely gracious, and sincerely wanted to know if there had been any problems on the trip that needed to be addressed (There were none).It is without hesitation that I recommend Mosaic Adventures. The people are committed to providing excellent service, and certainly did so for me. One can take chances with any of the myriad tour operators in Kathmandu, or even attempt to handle the details by oneself, but I cannot imagine the trip could go as well (or much less expensive for that matter) as mine did. I am extremely grateful to everyone at Mosaic. I look forward to returning to Nepal, and trekking with Rishi to Annapurna Base Camp."

Hi all,In August last year, we went with Mosaic tours in Kathmandu to do the Mount Everest Base Camp Trek and some day tours. We would highly recommend them to anyone who is keen on doing a tour in Nepal. They are reputable, reliable, well priced, trustworthy and most importantly they put our personal safety above all else. All ran smoothly from start to finish. We started our experience with Mosaic Tours the day we arrived in Kathmandu with our guide Pralhad and tour organizer, Madhav. They met us at our hotel in Kathmandu and gave us an in depth run down on everything we needed to know for our upcoming tours. They lent us down jackets and Sleeping bags (free of charge) which saved us lugging them half way around the world. The morning of the trek, Pralhad meet us again at the hotel and we were off on the most amazing adventure ever! If you can get Pralhad as your guide, we would highly recommend him. He really knows his stuff! He is extremely experienced, kind, understanding (especially appreciated by my wife who was a novice trekker), knowledgeable, good fun\u2026 and good at cards! Between Prahlad and our fantastic porter Jetha, we had an awesome experience. When we arrived back at Lukla it was too foggy for planes to fly in, so we ended up having to get a helicopter at our own expense. We were escorted by Pralhad to the spot where we were collected (about 1.5 hour trek) where he dropped us and then trekked back up the mountain to Lukla, which we appreciated SO much. One week after leaving Nepal we noticed our credit card had been charged an EXTRA $1000 USD for the helicopter trip, which we had organized using another company outside of Mosaic. Although the helicopter was arranged completely externally from Mosaic tours, we contacted Madhav and asked if he could help us retrieve our lost funds. Within 2 days Madhav had resolved the issue with the helicopter company for us and had our money refunded!If you are looking to trek in Nepal- Mosaic are awesome, they are the real deal. They are a reliable, safe and a \u2018no-stress\u2019 trekking company in Kathmandu, Nepal!! Cheers Madhav, Pralhad and Jetha! Joe and Soph."

In addition to being extremely competent and flexible, Madhav is a kind and caring person with great love for the people in his country. In the midst of the need for housing reconstruction after the earthquake and a fuel crises causing shortages of materials for daily life as well as for the repair work, Madhav remains upbeat and optimistic. We participated in a five day rebuilding trip in a village 7 hours from Katmandu ( the last 50 km took 4 hours, so you can imagine the roads!), which gave us insight into life in a village. We worked and laughed alongside the Dalit, or \"untouchables\" as we shoveled dirt, broke stones into gravel, and the stronger of us carried heavy rocks from a quarry. Madhav did all this alongside us tourists, and it was a joy to watch his interaction with the villagers, who clearly admired and appreciated him. We also painted the three rooms of the grade 1- 3 school, and then spent a day at that school as well as at the 1 - 12 school when supplies for rebuilding were delayed by the fuel embargo. At the school, we taught about hygiene and taught some songs and expressions in English. The children were delightful and responsive. Asseem cooked delicious meals for us in the village. After the wonderful, heartwarming time in the village, we parted from Madhav and went to Pokhara. Our guide for our \"easy\" three night trek, Pralhud, was extremely helpful, competent, and flexible. When he realized that we didn't have the strength for the original plan, he quickly revised our itinerary and we had a great time. Many thanks to Pralhud and our porter and guide in training, Santos, for their assistance down all those steps from Ghandruk!Not only did we do the rebuilding, trek, and city tour...but Madhav also arranged a day long visit to a school in Kathmandu ( I'm a retired teacher), and a meeting with a public health official for my husband. He drove us to the school and meeting, and we learned more about health and education in Nepal. It was a fascinating day. All details of our trip were expertly planned, and we strongly recommend Mosaic Adventure for great adventure in Nepal. I chose the company online because of the great reviews, and was pleased by all the prompt, thorough email exchanges with Madhav. Please don't hesitate to visit this beautiful country with very friendly and beautiful people. Nepal has much to offer."

Well organised, informative and, above all, fun. We booked the trip pre-earthquake for our 4th Trekking trip to Nepal. We settled on Mosaic because of their prompt replies to any enquiry, detailed answers on every aspect and reasonable pricing. We ended making changes to our itinery for various reasons but none of this was any trouble for Mosaic to accommodate. Our Guide BN along with our porters Purna (Dr. P) and Dinesh (Nurse D.) were all a pleasure and gave us a real insight into Nepal. They were a good laugh too. I picked up a dodgy knee halfway in and they thought nothing of bandaging it each night using medicinal herbs (no not that). I would heartily recommend Mosaic and especially the people here mentioned who made our visit one we will never forget. Anyone having doubts about travel to Nepal-fear not. Nepal is a magical place so get on a plane and visit asap. Leave the leg work to Madhav and his great team"

They were very patient with the constant revisions to our tour before we finalized our itinerary and very prompt in returning our emails. We arranged a diverse tour which included stops in Kathmandu, Pokhara, treking to Poon Hill and a jungle trip to Chitwan, for our group of six. Every part of our tour was arranged as we had planned and a representative was there to meet us on time, every step of the way. Our guide Rudra who accompanied us on the trek was excellent. He was attentive, patient and could not have done more for us. At the end of each day Rudra and our great trio of porters made sure we were well taken care of before their day ended. If you are putting off visiting Nepal due to the earthquake don't delay the trip any more. The people are very warm, hospitable and rely heavily on tourism. It is a beautiful country with amazing scenery waiting to be explored."

We would very strongly recommend Mosaic: Madhav responded to all enquiries within 24 hours, the information was comprehensive, we were met from our flights, trekking permits etc were organised in advance. Why pay an intermediary when you can go directly so easily?Our trek to ABC was superb. The views were beautiful throughout, and Annapurna Sanctuary was genuinely breathtaking. We took literally hundreds of photos, but they can't capture the massive scale of the Himalayas. A special thank you to our guide Rishi and porter Krishna. Rishi made sure that everything worked smoothly and was able to tell us about life in the mountains, and entertain us with his card tricks and flute. Krishna carried our bags each day: he was a real gentleman and very strong indeed.I hope we'll be back in Nepal soon, and will definitely arrange our next visit with Mosaic."

Roshan was an excellent guide; his enthusiasm, knowledge and support, as well as his exceptionable English, made our trek a hugely enjoyable experience. Puna was also very friendly and helpful (as well as incredibly strong carrying our bags up the mountains!) and we believe he will make an excellent guide once he has finished his training. Indeed, the other trekkers we met along the route also told us how impressed they were with our team.

I booked with Madhav in Kathmandu and went for the the Everest Base Camp trek via Gokyo Ri and the Cho La pass. Our guide from Mosaic Adventure was Shanker, with Mingma and Rama as our porters. The company was great about all aspects of the hike. We got in to Lukla on a day where most flights missed out. The accommodation was good and the itinerary coming via the Cho La pass made for a far more interesting trek than the standard Everest Base Camp route, and also a fair bit more challenging.I would highly recommend trekking in the Everest or Annapurna region with Mosaic Adventure, as they were a great team to hike with. Two members from our crew decided not to go over the Cho La pass and Mosaic were happy to split the group and managed the trip so both groups had an enjoyable time. The guides and porters were happy to point things out, go at our pace, laugh and joke around with us and each other. If anyone was not feeling well it was looked after immediately and professionally.The Everest region itself was beyond spectacular with highlights including Gokyo Ri, the Guzemba glacier crossing, Cho Las pass, and Kala Pattar. I would absolutely trek with Madhav, Shanker and Mosaic Adventures in the future, and recommend them to anyone looking for a great company to trek with. Thanks guys!"

I made it clear to Sushil when we met that I what I was most interested in was the \"real\" Nepal, and Sushil delivered beyond all expectations.

Overall, it is a highly recommended tour & trekking company given its reliable and personable service as well as the professionalism in organizing tours to best suit the needs of their customers."

I would highly recommend Mosaic (and Shanker as a guide) to anyone planning a trip to Nepal."

We just got back from visiting Nepal, with the highlight being three weeks trek along the classic Annapurna trail with side trip to Tilicho Lake. Working with company owner Raj was amazing. He was very approachable to my various questions about the trek and he always provided quick and honest answers. Level of attention we received during the trip by both the guide (Harish) and the porter (Rajan) was incredible. Thank you Raj, Harish and Rajan and I strongly recommend anyone consider Mosaic Adventure as your guide to visit the wonders of Annapurna trail."

When you are out exploring wild and seeking adventures it is extremely important that you be in safe hands should something go wrong while out on the trip. And with Mosaic Adventure there was nothing to worry about. They provide all the necessary information and support that you need. It was very clear from the outset that they would leave no stone unturned to make our trip an epic one. They were willing for thorough and helpful conversations before we had arrived there. We got prompt responses to our queries and advices too.They can customize their packages according to your desire. The testament to their professionalism is a month we spent with them. My wife and I went there with our three kids and they adjusted our trip plans so much so that both we and our children felt at home and did not have any hassle at all. The extra care they took to make sure of our children\u2019s safety got us to believe that Nepalese people take their guests for god in every sense of the word. To our surprise, amid all the strenuous treks and busy schedules they managed some time to play with our kids. Nepal is not an easy place to travel, that everyone knows. But what people should know is that there is a group of people called Mosaic Adventur that have altered this belief with their impeccable services and the seriousness they show in the business. I think people need to know about them and I am definitely telling the rest of the world that only Mosaic Adventure can make your trip to Nepal a different from others and fun."

It is also because of the Nepalese people and their hospitality. I think it is partly because Mosaic Adventure played a significant role in making my Nepal tour a grand expedition. Honestly, I didn\u2019t know what to expect when I landed at the airport in Kathmandu. It didn\u2019t take long for my apprehensiveness to fade. Once I met Madhav at the airport I knew I had made the right decision. I can\u2019t thank you enough for the arrangements you and your company helped me make. I really appreciate you people bearing with us. Most of all, the package you provided was very reasonable and it felt like we got so much for the price so less.

The only thing to look at is their beautifully designed website. But once we started off our campaign we had the strong feeling that we were well watched and in good hands.

After reading of several reports we decided to buy fly tickets and to book the hotel for two days in Kathmandu. Trough the book service i booked Great Wall. My choice was accidantal. I just wanted to secure our staying in Kathmandu for the short time and in case we wouldn't like the hotel we were ready to change it. The first pleasant surprise was when i received the e-mail from Madhav offering the pick up service from the airport. Later i understood how important was it. The hotel locates in Tamel - district in Kathmandu, actually it's old part, close to Freek Street and to many of historical objects. There are no exact addresses and we had the problems with taxi drivers in finding the right way to the hotel. Anyway Madhav send the car to the airport and we were successfully driven to the hotel. As we understood the hotel is under management of Mosaic Adventure. This circumstance was very helpful for us. So Mosaic arranged our trekking to Everest inside of an hour: all permissions, fly tickets to Lukla, guide, porters, equipment, accommodation, transfers and so on. Unfortunately we had bad luck and on the day when we had to fly Lukla was closed due to bad wetter. We were short of time and decided to rearrange our rout and instead of Everest to go to Annapurna. Many thanks to Madhav - he re-booked and rearranged everything very fast and next day we landed in Pockara and started our trekking to Pon Hill. Now after the trekking I'm sure it was the right decision and only the highest professionalism of Mosaic and especially of Madhav helped us to spend the great time in Nepal. Every country is introduced by the people and such guys like those who are working with Mosaic adventures make Nepal very attractive for visiting and traveling. Herewith i would like to express my personal gratitude to Madhav and very friendly stuff from the hotel Great Wall. They did everything to make our staying in Nepal comfortable, interesting and unforgettable."
