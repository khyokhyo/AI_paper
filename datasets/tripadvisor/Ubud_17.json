Our driver took us to a part of this Rice Terrace where it was nestled inside a village away from the main strip so we are able to take some awesome photos. Good thing was we did not have to pay as it was about a 2min drive from the main strip and it was quiet with a few people. Downfall was the locals are very pushy for you to buy their stuff. Trying to take a video and I had one of the locals tapping me and asking me to buy her stuff. Besides that this place was awesome. Nice place to fly a drone if you have one! :)"

Because you get to walk around it? While trying to fight off the ladies selling warm drinks and the children trying to cling on to get 'tour' fees. Real touristy. Wouldn't recommend it."

You might want to have sneakers on ( I walked in teva sandals with no problems) as you are climbing up narrow paths. There are locals along the way with huts charging you as you go. Some have water or coconuts, others want you to take a picture with their props! We gave them each a small donation, after all everyone's just trying to make a living!! I also got a bamboo stick from them to help with the climb! Very useful for my knees!! It took us about 1 hour and then we ate lunch at a cafe overlooking the terrace's! By far one of the prettiest places I've seen!!"

First off, when you drive along the road in front, you get stopped to pay 10,000 each. Not sure where that money goes. We figured it was a ticket. Then you walk into the rice terrace and someone asks for a donation. However, it's a minimum price so not a donation at all. It's 10,000 again. Then you get a bit further and you're asked again. It's mad. I'm all for helping the Indonesian community but just charge for a ticket price and ensure the money is going to the right cause, this just felt like begging."

They had small tables along the side of the hill, giving a complete view of the ride paddies. The view is completely breathtaking and it is great to stop here for lunch with a view.

Yet, I\u2019d say it looks quite touristy and not a \u2018must-do\u2019 item (maybe it\u2019s because we had visited some rice terraces with a much larger scale in China and other Asian places with less shops nearby). You would need to walk down quite a bit to get into the rice terraces \u2013 please do expect your shoes will be all in mud! There are also a few stations / \u2018check-points\u2019 with farmers and children who seem pushy to ask visitors to buy postcards, take photos with the farmers or donate \u2013 we did buy/donate as there were no way to resist and it was around US$3-5 each. Suggestion is it\u2019s not a must for you to go down to the rice terraces, you can spend more time in the cafes/restaurants nearby to enjoy the wonderful panoramic view instead."

We were there when the rice plants were not yet flowering, so they were fields of gorgeous green. Else at other times they'ed be a field of yellow (flowering, harvest time) or just reflective brown (just planted). The road parallel to the fields are congested with traffic and lined with souvenir shops. Very very touristy and crowded, as with most Bali attractions. Have to trek down dirt/muddy steps sometimes, so wear good shoes if you can. It was in the afternoon that we visited, so it was VERY hot! There will be locals carrying baskets of grass, hoping to take a photo with you with payment of course. This place is near the central Ubud, so visit if you're in the vicinity. Else if you have more time to travel out to the mountains, visit the Jatiluwih Rice fields which are much bigger, more expansive and more breathtaking."

I have visited most of the Europe. But this kind of places are not available near to us. You are in an interesting kind of green. Terraces and walley is very interesting. As all the travellers recomend, the season is very important. We went at the beginning of April and it was wonderful. Try to hire a Taxi for full-day for visit. Combine the rice terrace visit with Volcano and Temple Ulandanu. It takes around 30-40$. On the return way, try to reserve time for visiting wooden furniture stores. They are also very exciting."

Absolutely gorgeous view but be careful with your steps as we chance upon a snake during the trail. Btw, it will be nice to donate a little to the local farmers whom had managed a good job for the rice terrace. Apart from a very obvious pavilion at the top of the terrace that you are requested to donate a small amount, please also donate to the old farmer at the foot of the terrace, he does not have a tin for collection but this old friendly farmer is located at the bottom of the terrace. Do be a little generous for him."

If costs nothing to have a walk down to the river and up the other side, though at one point we were asked to donate to charity. The paths are not well marked. If you do not find a proper path and choose your own route down you are at danger of putting your foot and ankle into thick mud. We saw a number of people do this ( me included). There is plenty of running water to wash off the mud. The slopes on the road side have restaurants. It is a good place to sit and have a coconut and drink. I would advice a walk- we have seen plenty of paddy fields in travelling, rarely getting the opportunity to walk on a terraced slope. You can appreciate the work that goes into constructing, keeping, and using the fields."

Good place to get rid of a few 2000 or 5000 notes :) There was also an old lady with baskets of grass who seemed to be working but actually was just taking photos with all the tourists and taking between 5000-10,000 approx per person. Got some cool photos with her so I didn't mind and I gave her 5000. You just give what you feel my guide said otherwise she will take much more!I wore jandals which was hard to mountain goat in, so I took them off and went bare feet, it's just smooth dirt and was quite nice going barefoot especially as some parts were muddy and I just washed my feet in their little waterfalls.

The last time we visited, is was very dry and didn\u2019t look anything like before or the mainstream pictures. It is also much too crowded now. Still, it is worth a short stop on the way between Ubud and any of the northern tourist attractions (e.g. Lake Batur, Kintamani). However, I would not go here just for the Rice Terraces, but rather stop on the way while visiting other places in the area. You can find Rice Terraces much closer to Ubud (e.g. Penestanan or Campuhan), although a bit less spectacular, but far less crowded and accessible directly by foot from your Ubud accommodation. We skipped it entirely this time."

You must have a good cardio to walk this terraceIts much more vertical then others and in the middle of some valley so you need to go down first and go up for otherside.Which needs good cardio. Or you can just watch terraces from top.You should wear sandals not slippers because ground is very muddy and slippery. I have been inside mud till my knee few times and need to clean up some water ( most probably polluted ) few times. So watch your step. In this places locals love money. You pass a bridge to other side and they ask for money for the \"maintenance\" of bridge which is made of scrap metal and wood stuff probably collected around and sticked together :) On the top side they placed some rice baskets and when you take photo owner of plantation comes and ask for money. When you go up on other side there is some kind of \"cafe\" and they ask for money. When you are in top some people try to sell you coconut in middle of rice terrace and asks for money.So its all about money here. And they say its some kind of \"donation\". Most probably the only word they know in EnglishBut need to be cautious about insects because this places is crowded with them. Some bite my wife and we have been to BIMC hospital in same night :)We had good time anyway, a must see place but dont forget to bring some small Rupiah like 1000-5000-10.000 because you will need them till otherside :D + For scenery and beauty of place - For payment in every corner and tricky locals"

We went to a lookout and I took some pictures- I did not want to go down into the fields- although many tourists did. There was an older gentleman with baskets - tourists asked for pictures with him and the baskets- my tour guide reminded them that he was there for photos and relied on donations- which I thought was good. I love the glass bowls draped over wood- so I bought a small one here at one of the shops for 200 000. Probably way over price- but I saw it as helping the community ;-)"

We said we were just going to look round before we stayed, but the other couple paid straight away. We then just walked off to the paddies. This fee isn't legitimate and you do not have to pay to park on the street. Just avoid the man and continue your day. Also on our way in, some girls told us they were annoyed that around the paddies there are many huts that ask for donations for you to continue and they used a lot of their money just to pass through. Knowing this, we didn't follow the sign that said 'trek starts here ->' and instead went the other direction, exploring the paddies freely. We only ran into one hut where we were happy to donate. Although they ask for a large amount, you can just pay what you have just don't show them you have anymore!"

The farmers were cool, they didn't ask for a specific amount or pressured you into giving more. The walk within the terrace is not for the unfitty within you. It does take it out of you especially if it's a hot or a humid day. Our visit was a humid day and Wow did we sweat. My wife is fairly fit but she refused to walk certain paths because she felt it was unsafe. Unfortunately we didn't explore the entire terrace but from what we did see it was inspiring.

Tegalalang rice terrace is perfect view for visit, pictures and walked down over the paid field... very beautiful and very nice.if you are in bali, this one of a must since it gives you the experience of \"real indonesia\"when entrance the village, each car will charge 10000 Rupiah (around 1$) per person and you get ticket. make sure you pay with quite big print, so you can exchanges a lot of small money since there is some spot in this area that you have to put \"Donation\" another 2k, 5k or 10k Rupiah/ person depends on what you have or you cannot keep going, so better save some small prints.picture with the woman/man is not free. they will offer you to take picture with them in paddy field, or with their props such as the paid basket etc, its quite recommended and quite a good souvenir for you! but to avoiding awkwardness when they ask you money, keep in mind its not free, at least you can give them about 10k/person who takes picture and they usually tell you after... (one woman ask for 20k but you can always bargain).i love take this picture, specially with the one old man that very kind. some of them also sell the coconut leaf hat, its PURELY HANDMADE and i am support their local creation. they sell it for 50k/hat, since i am indonesian, i am bargain to 30k-35k/hat (i got to bargain because i buy 2 hats :)) but PLEASE don't bargain for less than that! its a purely handmade and consider that this 3 dollars might help them. this is very good hat and it last long, even when its dry and become brown, its still can be use! and its cute too!i suggest you take some coconut water during hot day! the coconut water can replace your body ion (body liquid) faster than water...! Try the young coconuts water from real coconut, and do not only drink the water! do you know that you can scoop and eat the coconut inside with spoon... (you might know or might not, my fianc\u00e9 did not know, and i am happy to inform him)use comfortable Shoes and Clothes, the path needs some climb and hike. Use Mosquito repellent since there is a LOT in Indonesia, and if you don't get use to tropical sun use SUN BLOCK at least Spf 50! its very HOT!"

The view is like nothing we have ever seen before, very beautiful! We didn't get stopped once or asked for a donation by anyone. We passed a farmer who had lots of rice in his baskets who we had a photo with and he asked for some money which we think is reasonable. We weren't forced for a photo. We stayed for around a hour or so, walking down and looking around taking lots of photos. It's rather difficult getting back up to the top if it has been raining but you can get great pictures staying at the top! Shops at the top selling food and drink. Well worth a visit!

What a massive let down. It was very touristy and very small. It was hard to take a photo without getting a tourists head in the photo. We were gutted. I had to confirm with the driver that we were actually at the right rice field because it was so disappointing. Perhaps he did take us too the wrong spot!There were a lot of children begging you to buy postcards etc and there was hardly any room to move to take photos. The rice field view is only in one direction. As our driver pointed out, if you walk down into the rice fields or walk to the other side of the rice fields and look back, you will have a view of the street and not a perfect rice field view. Our driver told us to take photos of the rice fields with the shops and road behind us. It took us quite some time to drive there and we felt our time would have been spent better elsewhere. Next time we will try the Jatliluwih Rice fields instead. I think they would be worth the extra effort.Overall, if you have other places to visit in Bali, don't bother having the Tegalalang Rice fields high on your to do list."

Otherwise, this is just one those many touristy and highly commercialized places in Bali. If you are genuinely interested in learning more about rice field, there honestly isn't information about the subject here unless you have a guide with you. While we were on our way to the terrace, we actually happened to pass by some farmers and their rice fields. One of them was kind enough to show me how he diverted water into the field. This experience, to me, was a much more enriching one than this over hyped rice terrace!"

However, these terraces are very much about the tourist buck. When we were there, the terraces were teeming with tourists, and the only \"farmer\" we saw was an enterprising guy who was hanging round with a yolk getting tourists to pay him for photo's.If you want to see a more authentic view, just walk another 200 metres up the road and you'll see natural terraces being farmed.

The view is awesome from the side of the road, unfortunately from the other side it's not so spectacular because of all the buildings (I've called them favellas). There is also a problem that every 100-200m they collect a toll on the main path (for a bridge, for the path etc) so get some rupiah for the visit. There is a small beer shack at the top of the hill with a nice view. The view is totally worth the little price."

We spent about 10 minutes before going off to find our driver who had to park further up. However, that gave us a different view and we managed to get some photos with nobody in them.

As the reviews below me also mentioned, there's a lot of children begging for donations (\"for my schooooool\"...you'll hear it over and over), and they're quite aggressive and don't take no for an answer. One child nearly tripped me while begging, and I could've gotten seriously hurt as we were trekking back up the terrace. This sort of begging should be made illegal. It was a bit of a tourist trap, as well. So many people that it was hard to even take a picture without someone else in your shot. It's hard to make room for other people passing, as the little paths are quite small. People were just pushing through without regard.The area would be nice if it had a sign to explain how to get to one end from the other...we figured we'd have to walk down to the bottom, but a sign would've been nice, too. We were also charged $5 AUD to enter and walk around the terrace...apparently if you go before 7am no one is there to charge you.All in all, the terraces are beautiful, but the experience wasn't great.

The people are extremely friendly and welcoming. I find it very peaceful and fascinating. It's a great experience in the heart of indonesia. The scenery is unique and I enjoyed sitting by the terraces and staying quiet, taking a break there. I'd advise to stay in an area that is not too high during hot days, it can be a strenuous walk uphill, be sure to hydrate!"

We didn't trek around the terraces as we had already done a lot of walking and it was super hot, but we found a local restaurant that overlooked them and admired the view. It was lovely and well worth a visit. It's 10000 IDR to gain entry, and you could spend hours there if you are mobile and love a hike, very affordable. The area is along a stretch of road filled with shops selling local crafts, souvenirs and places to eat and drink. Watch out for the rogue chickens wandering along the pavement, clucking at you. Lovely site to see, just not very accessible for those with mobility problems."

The rice terraces are absolutely stunning, and I can imagine when this place wasn't a tourist trap it would have been really serene. It was lovely to walk through the terraces although the view is slightly marred on one side by all the shops along the Main Street. We gave a (mandatory) donation to enter the fields (we gave 11,000rp for two of us - they didn't check or suggest a price). However we were also charged again near leaving as we entered a different farmers fields and gave 2,000rp for the two of us. It is a lovely place and worth seeing but be prepared for hawkers and donations. We visited in the afternoon when it was fairly busy, but it's probably best to visit earlier or later when it's quiet."

Also note local leaders are collecting a fee to visit $R10000 per person. It is not a choice. Just pay it. He's wearing a police neon vest you or your driver can't miss him. We were there on a clear blue sky day. Amazing views. These terraces take up hectares and feed a large community to work the land for each other. I had never seen this before and understand it is the way rice is grown in communities throughout Asia. In addition you could see another rice terrace being built. I would put this on a must see on a trip to Bali. A good driver can get you there. You can ignore the tourists w selfie sticks and just hope they don't step backward off a terrace. Enjoy."

This one is probably the most famous one in Bali but there are actually 3 or 4 others in the area which are larger and maybe equally picturesque but less \"touristy\". Once you're here you can walk down to the ricefields and walk around there, but it's pretty steep. If you don't want to walk down, then spend 15-20 minutes here. Or you could stay here much longer if you're doing the \"hike\". Not a place to visit if it is a rainy day.

Also I would recommend not parking right in front of the terraces because some local people there or even the police will ask you to pay. This is just another way that government and some people take advantage of tourists. From the moment when you arrive in the area, children will be coming from left and right to ask you to buy something or support their school and pushy sales ladies trying to lure you into their shops without taking no for an answer. Also had an encounter with an aggressive dog, almost bit my ankles for no reason, just came running up to me from the other side of the road to give me a scare.Overall beautiful rice terrace but it has been ruined by locals taking advantage of tourism.

The steps are uneven and quite steep, if you have bad knees or mobility problems be careful - you might get down but have trouble getting up.

If you arrive at the Tegalalang Rice Terrace you got an impressive view but when you try to take some pictures you always get asked by some annoying locals to buy some useless souvenirs. Also many young children try to sell useless postcards in 2016 and they don't really accept your friendly \"no, thank you\". As the terrace is part of many guided tours you also have many western tourists all around the firlds that make it hard to take authentic pictures."

You will need about 25 minutes driving from Ubud market with a scooter.To see the rice terrace view is quite easy and free. It gives you a good idea on the complexity of terrace rice farming."

            "review": "Breathtaking views of rice fields . We arrived quite early at Tegalalang with our scooters, to avoid traffic and massive groups of tourist. That was quite a good idea as the access to the rice fields is through tiny narrow paths.These are not flat and large rice fields as you may see around in the region, but rather terraces and one plantation above the other.I went with slippers but ended up more comfortable barefoot, as the ground was sometimes wet and muddy, almost felt into the wet rice field. Take some sandals or sport shoes, it's safer. Upon arrival you will see many caf\u00e9s, you do NOT have to drink and stay, just go through them to access the rice fields at their stairways. You should manage to make it down the valley and up again towards the opposite side of your arrival side.There is no entrance fee and no need for guides, BUT be prepared to spend some \"donation\" as the different land owners ask you money to maintain the paths and won't let you past their barrier. I paid three times 10.000 IDR (I saw some tourist paying 20.000 and 50.000! way too much), but it is worth if you want to make it up to a hidden valley which I accessed walking passed an upper lake with a yellow umbrella.There you will find a charming old and smiley farmer, musician and proud to show and play some of his instruments. He also sells you young coconut, by far my best in Ubud area although the price was ridiculously high, 30.000 IDR but which I bargained a bit and got lots of nice pictures of him in return. Avoid buying the postcards the kids arriving in swarms try insistently to sell. It is always \"for their school\", really don't know in who's pocket that money will end but sounds like local family-mafia to me, same scam as in other countries. Overall the visit shouldn't take more than 45-60 minutes. Nice place, beautiful scenery, worth the visit."

You need to pay about 250-300k IndRup for that. On either side of Monkey forest road or any other busy street you have owners of vehicles calling out to you 2. Its really hot and humid out there and so an early morning trip really helps. We left at around 8:00 am - may have been better to leave earlier. 3. Takes about 30 minutes to get to Tegellelang. Your taxi driver will need to park at the designated area - go quickly to the side that oversees the terraces and figure out the public steps that take you to the rice fields. You go down the constructed steps and after crossing a small brook start climbing up the terraces where you see farmers working ( some will smile and wave at you )4. You will have to pay small amounts as donation at points during the walk. Keep some smaller value local currency handy Its a nice walk through greenery, interesting to watch the terraces and local farming, also a great place for pictures"

We said ok, gave 10k, and went on. After about 100m, there was another man asking for donations at another shack. We said we already donated, he said this was a \"different\" one, and when we stated we already gave a donation, he told us we couldn't pass, and told us to go away.He was a terribly rude man, and it was good to see people who came up after us did not give him anything and turned back (as we did). Even people who came from the other side, he barred their way along the path and told them to donate.Clearly a racket, so advice is to enjoy the terraces from the road-side of the terrace.

If you have independent transport, check out a map and you will see it's easy to take a circuit back to Ubud, adding to the interest and scenery.

We paid for the entrance fee therefore it is ridiculous to be paying for \"gantry donations\" in the ricefield area. We came across at least \"gantry\" areas by the locals. And dont have a choice but to \"donate\" some money. And the locals were aggresive too as they insist to be paid before allowing us to go through their make-shift gantries."

The office looks very legit with the workers all wearing uniforms but it's not - no one ever checks your ticket and you are never told where the money goes. Furthermore, when you get to the top there are locals demanding you make a 'voluntary' donation before you are allowed entrance.

There's not really any obvious parking, we just ended up pulling over and parking where a few other scooters were parked. There's also no really obvious start and end points, you just go down into the terraces at some point and walk along the edges going up, down, or whichever way you please. The initial areas are quite full of tourists, local children trying to sell you postcards or act as your guide, and locals offering you a chance to take a picture holding their baskets (for a cost of course). You can go as off-the-beaten-path as you want, but be aware there won't be an obvious way out unless you go back the way you came (which is how we ended up stuck out in the rain!). If you do get stuck in the rain be careful as things will be very soggy and slippery very fast! It would be advisable to wear proper shoes (either hiking shoes or sneakers) as opposed to flip flops as even when it's not raining there are some descents without a good path/steps down.

At the time we visited the terraces were being smoked for bugs, which left even less to see. If you've never seen rice terraces and you have limited options, this is worth a stop, but if you've been poring over Nat Geo photographs of the gorgeous Balinese rice terraces, be prepared that this may not match up. Also, depending on the time of the year, the terraces may be filled with rice, and the prettier photographs of the sun reflected in the terraces come later when the terraces are flooded for harvesting. Rice is typically harvested twice a year - all guides should be able to help you time this."

Great views of the rice terraces and excellent souvenirs en route ( don't buy when you get there as the prices are a lot higher). Lots of the shops en route are wholesale businesses but you are able to find some good bargains on wood and metal products. If you're travelling by scooter it is so easy to stop on the side of the road.Scooters can be hired for 50,000 per day (at current time about 3 pounds which is an absolute bargain!)Went onto see lemak coffee being produced - about 2km up the road.

Entrance fee is usually about Rp 10,000 per person or so. This usually includes even just stopping to take photos vice walking up and down the terraces. Bring small bills as there are numerous stops along the way as the owners/workers of their respective paddies will expect a small donation (Rp 5,000 per stop/toll is fine). Same goes for taking pictures of workers in action. The terraces themselves are essentially family plots and none is exported from here. It's associated with the village of Tegalalang located just behind the paddies, so not a bad idea to stay in a villa or homestay in the area if this will be one of your primary stops. There are eateries/warungs overlooking the paddies, so not a bad spot for those not wishing to hike the paddies can lounge.If it's rained the night before or morning of, expect the trail to be muddy and slippery. Wear good shoes. Not a very safe excursion for small kids, probably better for those at least 8 years and above with the reason being there are steep sections on the pathways where even adults can easily take a bad fall. Just be careful either way.It gets hot as well as the paddies are exposed to the sun, bring water, wear a hat, and use sunscreen. Also, check ahead before visiting as if it's harvesting time the views aren't as good unless you don't looking at fields of brown/yellow stalks instead of green or freshly replanted paddies. Found a good guide for the hike though who also showed us his family's plot as he lives in the village (Rena - 085-338160441). There are many guides/drivers in the area, but we found him to be especially helpful and polite."

(would advise minimum of trainers to walk in, flip flops not really practical).There are a few nice restaurant's available to eat in, overlooking the amazing view, if your looking for something to eat and quite a few tourist shops, with various items for sale.Overall a nice place to stop for a while or go for a walk if your feeling fit.

We took a hotel car to Tegalalang, took some photographs from the main central street and had a walk along to see what stalls were selling etc. We then found an incredibly steep staircase down into the valley which turned out to be one of the two entrances down into the rice terraces. we walked along and through for about 20 minutes before reaching a 'checkpoint' where they ask for a donation - I had read about this, but seeing as there wasn't anyone at the entrance I decided we would give the 10k rupiah here and resist elsewhere as its not mandatory though we did hear some stories that the locals get aggressive and threatening if you don't donate... it then isn't a donation in my mind if you 'have to' give... anyway. we walked on for quite a while and felt that after about 45 we'd seen most of what there was to see and so turned back so s to avoid any confrontations, we had plenty of picture opportunities along the way and didn't feel doing the extra hour or so (although we were close to half way) was really worth it for us. we had done what we wanted and see what we wanted to see. very beautiful and amazingly well kept. point to note is that its difficult to find a taxi back to ubud so you will need to look for local drivers, we asked a shop owner who also works as a driver and cut a deal with him!"

There are some complaints that the trip is over-priced and touristy however, we planned our visit as part of a day tour, thus significantly reducing the cost. The attraction itself is actually free, you're just looking at rice fields though you can go on a little tour which will cost, how much I do not know. Additionally, visiting in November, the very beginning of rainy season, we were able to avoid the tourist crowds that flock here in dry season and December (Christmas break)."

This turned into a highlight of our visit when we were caught in the middle of a huge downpour of rain about a third of our way into the terraces. We found shelter with some locals but eventually had to give in and work our way out of the terraces in the pouring rain. To be honest, the family thought it was a terrific adventure trying to find out way out of the maze like terraces. There are a lot of stairs down/up to the terraces, and the terraces themselves are often thin walkways and steep ascents/descents. But if you are up for it, it was a great walk \u2013 in rain or shine. Stunning views in every direction and a chance to see up close just how well rice terraces are created."

Fair enough I guess, but was a bit awkward as we didn't have any small notes on us!A better way to see the beautiful Balinese countryside would be to take a trip with Bali Quad Discovery (or similar) where you drive around more remote countryside of a quad bike."

I would suggest you visit here early in the morning, before 10 am should you wish to avoid paying viewing fees, crowds of people and beggars.This is a very beautiful view point for viewing rice terraces but also a total tourist trap should you allow it. Go early enough to avoid crowds of people as to enjoy the tranquility of this majestic place.Remember tours are coming into Ubud from the coastal areas for a one day tour to see everything in one day. Everyone is in a hurry, hot and bothered, hunting for the best shots and dashing off again. So if you are like me who stays in Ubud for two weeks at a time for peace and quiet, the last thing you will need is a ton of frustrated tourists. Well worth the visit, it only takes 15 minutes from the main area of Ubud, up Tagalalang Road and you are there. If you are staying a while in Ubud a walk to the terraces are very possible , l do that myself but take cover with you for your head like a hat or umbrella, it gets very hot at midday. Enjoy!"

There were many people in front of the rice terrace begging for money so be forewarned. Once you get on the rice plantation, there are men who let you take pictures of the rice baskets and the hat to go with the scenery, but they expect payment afterwards so be forewarned of that too. A little tip: instead of stopping at the main gate, if you stop a little beforehand, there is another side of the Tegalalang Rice Terrace with less tourist, which means less people and more enjoyment!"

We stopped and had a drink in one of the warungs looking over the view - Orange juice was about \u00a31 a glass which was very cheap for this location. We had the bikes so couldn't walk down through the terraces but if you want to spend more time here that is what you should do."

With so many tourists all over the rice terraces and the walk ways weren't wide, it was easy to fall into one of the many puddles. I saw a teenager taking a picture and he fell down the next level because the ground wasn't very sturdy. I recommend wearing water shoes, if you fall into one of the many muddy puddles in tennis shoes, it can be quite unpleasant. It is a fantastic place for pictures if you can find a spot without many tourists. Great place to see from afar but maybe next time I will try trekking further in."

I was wondering when to visit to see the rice-terraces all green.No entrance-ticket needed but they charge for parking.Small cafes are around offering views for visitors.You can walk down to the terraces, I think the steps might be slippery when it's raining.Anyway, great place to relax while enjoying authentic's rice-terrace view."

It cost us about $30 Aus or IDR 300,000rp to take us from Ubud to the terraces he also took us to the coffee plantation not far from there (also worth checking out, coffee plantation is free and staff are very friendly!) and also to a near by waterfall and back to our hotel. The rice fields are thumbs up all round, great views nice work bit of an exercise is you want to walk all the way around and makes for great photos. The only downside is they have \"donation booths\" scattered around the terraces, basically you have to pay them a small amount of money to keep walking.

If you are in Ubud, you are certainly crazy if you don't take the quick drive to Tegalalang! This place is beautiful. I hiked around the rice terrraces in about 30-45 minutes. A nice quick visit. Go early in the morning to beat the heat!There are shops along the way, but from my own personal experience, I didn't feel these sellers were extremely aggressive in their selling tactics at all. They were very kind and welcoming. I stopped at one and had a nice refreshing coconut while he played us the flute! Very sweet experience.Other reviews state lots of trash. I did not see one piece of trash on the rice terraces. Not sure where this is coming from. Maybe on the street they were talking about? But certainly not on the trail. And besides, have you honestly been anywhere in Ubud where there was a village/shops and not seen trash everywhere?Some people state that the \"tourist-trap\" road with shops takes away from the beauty of this place. I also disagree. This place is stunning, with or without the backdrop. You are visiting a poor country, people. Keep in mind these people have to make money somehow. It sucks for you, yes, but what person in a third world country wouldn't take advantage of selling items where thousands of people visit? Besides, from the road you are able to take pictures without the backdrop of the shops. It is a simple solution to a minute problem.Visit here for sure! and please make sure to wear sturdy shoes! I can't stress this enough. The trail is decently maintained but there are some spots where it was difficult. My hiking sandals broke the day before so I had to go in flip flops and definitely struggled. Where the water drains from irrigation there were slippery spots and muddy puddles. Be careful and walk with caution. Some of the steps are just dirt and have very high heights to step up. Shoes with good traction are preferred. I went with people who wore Toms and they were slipping in some spots as well!"

The terraces are in a beautiful setting and was a great experience walking through them. It is as green and lush as it looks in the pictures. You don't need a guide or anything and can just walk around yourself, the paths around the terrace are clearly marked and is difficult to get lost in. Just a tip, to my knowledge there are three families that own the terrace and each have their own \"station\" along the path. At each of these the families require a \"donation\" (5 000Rp or 10 000Rp does the trick) to allow you to walk through. We had no problem paying and would highly recommend it to others. Other tips:- get there in the morning to avoid crowds, we got there around 9:30am and walked around with very few people on the rice terrace.- there are great cafes and restaurants on the hill looking over the terrace and is a lovely spot to enjoy a cold drink or meal after walking around."

Obviously donation is not what they want but rather tolls. You are not given a choice. If you refuse they will act aggressive and start using their hands to block you or pull u back. They will also try to act blur when u run out of small change and had only larger notes. You have to be forceful with them. I had visited several tourist sites during this bali trip but there were no other places like this. My advice to all: if you really want to visit the terrace, don't bother walking through them.

Probably could've gotten a cheaper price to go straight to the rice terrace. The rice terrace had a lot of good views. There are some people with hut set up throughout the path asking for donations. The first one there's a guy with a gate and he won't open the gate to the path without a donation. Don't give too much 1K or 2K. Further along the path around the rice fields there are more aggressive people trying to block the path with their arm for a donation. Just say no and walk past them sternly. They targeted me and my friend because we were 2 girls, but a guy ahead of me signaled to me not to pay."

We enjoyed beautiful scenery while hopping from one square field to another square field. Path ways are already prepared for easy walking. Despite no significant mark on which direction, but we can follow the path ways.Paid Rp 10k as entrance fee to the village (Tegalalang stated in this one village, run by the locals) by using car. While we were walking we found 2 major stopping points, where you \"should\" donate for rice field maintenance. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind pay any cost or donate for the maintenance. Hence I would recommend to put all cost before people start wandering in the rice field. Let's say Rp 30k - 50k to include village's entrance fee and \"donation\". It wasn't very pleasant when you're struggling to climb the path ways or just want to enjoy scenery, but you can only pass it through the stopping point after pay certain amount of \"donation\". Less practical, I must say.Road leading to Tegalalang (to be fair, all area in Bali) is rather small, thus have to be carefull."

The whole road side was full of vehicles when we arrived around lunch time, and choked with the usual shops/cafes catering to the tourists. It's not an easy climb down the side of the slope, there are no defined steps or handholds, made worse by the high human traffic all using the same few passages. If you wanted to see padi fields, there are many in Bali which do no require you to exert yourself so hard. It is very scenic, so you can choose to just soak it all in by enjoying a cool drink at one of the many cafes overlooking the terraces. My two boys loved the challenge of the climb and racing to the top of the opposite slope, and declared it the highlight of their day."

It is a bit confusing and there are no signs indicating where the exit is. There are also local people set up in strategic places who ask for a 'donation'. Just tell them no, they are not official (except the one at the top with a barrier, you must pay otherwise you're stuck).Even with all these drawbacks, the terrace is an amazing place.

The parking is free, which is fine.The fields itself are very steep, so I would not recommend to go there during noon. Fields are very nice to see, but it depends on the season. If it is after harvest, you wouldn't see much. At the top of field is something, that will be shop in the future. There you have to pay another fee to get further. But 5k for two two is OK, so don't worry about be scammed.I would not recommend to go to the spring , because the walk does not worth it. The view is the same as from the walk to the field, and the way at the end seems to be collapsed, so it is very hard to get to spring itself.If you compare it with Jatiluwih, there are nicer pictures in Jatiluwih, if you get lucky.

You can basically spend the whole day walking around there...Also always take small notes as some of the locals ask for donation in some parts of the field, and they are usually grumpy ladies that wont let you go to the other side haha :)Sunset time is the best to go!!"

Top Tips: There are free viewing platforms for photos and free stairs to the right of the shops as you're facing the rice fields. Ignore all the signs that say \"come down / beautiful view, etc\" as you'll find yourself inside a restaurant or unintentionally browsing souvenirs and have to climb all the way back up those steps!! The free stairs doesn't have a sign, but you'll recognise it straight away. It's just a whole lot of concrete steps. Wear good shoes as there are about 200 steps down, and then you have to walk up slippery mud steps on the other side (some \"paving\" with tree stumps, but be careful stepping on these). I saw some elderly Chinese women struggle even with the concrete steps. Would not recommend this activity with wheelchairs / prams. A walking stick might be useful if you have bad knees.Remember to talk sunscreen, mosquito repellent, a hat, and a towel (for the inevitable sweat). Don't rest your bags on railings or tables unless you want ants over them."

You can wander through the various levels of the fields, but they have fences up so like many people, you think you are following a path, then cant get back onto the main path because they have put a fence up to stop you. Its not logical at all!When I say locals harrass you, its because they are dotted throughout the fields trying to get people to make donations ALL THE TIME! One isnt even a donation, they actually forced us, blocking our path so we couldnt get past till we put 10K each into their pot! These guys really spoil the place!

Once you go into the area there will be someone asking for donations and since the terraces are used by different families and farmers this is something you will see a few times as you walk around. When they are growing rice the terraces will be flooded and you will have to watch your step. The paths can sometimes be hard to figure out but that is part of the charm. The views were wonderful even if when I went it was a rainy day. It was great because me and my friend were the only ones walking around as all the other tourists had left because of the rain.It felt like for those 2 hours it was our place to explore because everyone else stayed by the road to take pictures as we went in and explored the farms and watched the locals do the their work."

It was reccomended we don't walk around down there. Way too many insects and parasites in the mud. A morning rice patty walk with good shoes might be a better way to experience the countryside."

Be sure to take a walk on the terrace but have some small money ready to pay for \"entrance fee\" (locals have built stairs and railings and charge for it, around 5000-10 000) It's amazing to walk along the side of the terrace so be sure to do it! If you walk to far into the terraces (locals don't care if you trespasses their property) but they will ask for \"donation\" to them but it's up to you if you want to support begging."

We enjoyed very much the visit, especially the courtesy and genuine welcome of Wayan, a old peasant that offered us fresh coconut and a nice performance with a traditional instrument. We were happy to pay the 20k rupees he asked for the coconut.Unfortunately, the others families owning land in the valley (yes the rice paddies are divided in many families) just stopped us, blocking the way while walking asking the payment of a \"tax\" to go further. We refused to accept this approach and rudeness and walked away.Go early in the morning before it gets too hot and bring a lot of water with you. A ticket to access the rice fields shall be paid to access the area, something equivalent to few euros per person."

This really isn't a donation, you should look at it as part of the admission price. The only downfall was all of the little girls following you around putting the hard sell on for post cards.

To enter the area, each visitor is imposed 10,000 rupiah. The area is really crowded with tourist rental cars and coaches. The road is lined with stores that sell cheap and tacky souvenirs. The attraction which is the terraced rice fields is only a small area. The paths going down to the rice fields is crowded and there is a risk of falling down if one is not careful. We didn't bother to go down to the rice fields because of this risk. Moreover to get to each patch of rice field, one has to pay an additional fee to the owner of the respective rice field. Its a waste of your time going there. You are better off going to the vast terraced rice fields in Vietnam or Myanmar."

Actually if anything the pictures don't do it justice, it's an amazing sight!We visited at lunchtime as we were stuck for time but I would recommend visiting either early morning or late afternoon as firstly because it's obviously so open it's incredibly hot! And secondly it was soooo busy the day we visited, it was impossible to even find a gap to take a picture at one point. The only reason I gave this a 4 out of 5 is if I'm honest I hated the area and road looking over the terraces, in the end I was glad we only had about an hour spare. Like with many parts of Bali, Ubud in particular it just felt unsafe. I know it's normal in Bali for locals to 'claim' ownership of the tourist attractions and charge people to visit them (which I did without complaint every time) but for me it ruins the experience slightly. If they weren't so aggressive and forceful towards people who are there to appreciate the beauty of their island they would stay longer and spend more. whereas following people for 10 minutes because they didn't 'donate' 1,000,000 rupiah like the person before you (which is lies btw as we spoke to the elderly couple in front of us and they terrified after being followed too!) at the THIRD donation checkpoint is ruining it for themselves and everyone else."

You will need to pay 10 000 IDR to enter the grounds (not bad at all) however when you begin to walk down into the terrace, this is where the ugly truth is shown. You will enjoy the small huts along the trail with people asking for donations. Sorry let me rephrase that, there will be locals who block your path and demand a mandatory donation. This money is meant to sponsor the \"bridges\" that they have built for you to walk. Well let me tell you now that laying down a 2 ft 2x4 plank is not worth money. I only had a 10000 note in my wallet so I gave it to the lady expecting to pass. She then replied \"not enough. More\" in disgust I showed her my empty wallet. She then moved out of the way as she yelled at me in what I presume were derogatory words. Towards the top of the terrace was yet another hut. I explained to the man that I had donated all my money down below. \"Different family different donation\" he replied. He refused to let me pass as I showed him my empty wallet. This guy was the turning point for most visitors. Even those with money were displeased and left. I would not be offended to donate to people who have done some work or if the cause had merit, but this was obviously a scam for tourists. Further more it is not a donation when you are forced to pay. I have spoken to many people since and they are appalled by this behavior. If you want to see rice terraces without the scams. There are plenty more in Vietnam and other parts of SE Asia."

Walking along the terraces is pretty easy although it was also annoying to pay to cross a bridge because a local woman said I had too. She wasn't an official anything and when I initially paid her, she said it wasn't enough, typical. I decided not to pay her and went around the terrace a different way. Kind of unbecoming to demand payment for crossing a ten step bridge. It's not a money issue, it's just spoils nature to be handing out money, left and right, to take a simple hike. Every culture has their village idiot, I suppose. I would recommend going to see the bigger rice terraces to the west, less touristy, or even just going on the rice treks around Ubud, which in my opinion, were a lot better views and not many other tourists."

I went there few years ago with a tour and again this time by myself.Easy access from ubud town , 15mins by car , just get some taxi , will cost you 20000rp max ( Aud $20) for the car not by person and just couples of hours if you having a drink there.Or just rent a bike , pretty nice ride from the town.Nice walk , you also can choose to buy a ticket ( 10000rp from memory , Aud $1 ) to go everywhere on a field but don't really need it for a quick view.Or if not book a day trip with a driver from Kuta it will cost you 300/400k rp ( around $30/40) with stop at some shopping area and restaurant with a stunning view , I can't remember the name unfortunately but sure every tourists informations will help you out."

Glad to have met a former farmer who now has a restaurant. Her friendly chat with us explaining the current state of affairs in the area. Youngsters moving to big cities to work. Totally uninterested in farming as souvenir shops have a thriving business. Tourists are attracted by the rice terraces and mainly visit for this reason. The rice terraces is supported by tourism. A brilliant idea!"

You can walk right down in to and through the terraces, quite hard work in places as it's quite steep and slippery. A few of the farmers have set up some 'gates' where they take some money from you to walk through their fields (which is fair enough). They get you on the way back as well, so make sure you take plenty of small notes with you."

We went there on a hot sunny day and walked down and up the hills to the other side of the terrace and enjoyed the beautiful scenery of this lush place. While hiking up the steps of the terrace, you will come across a few booths set up by locals who ask for \u201cdonations\u201d. Oh well, as per my understanding, donations should be voluntary and not enforced payments, right?! They don\u2019t ask for much. Around IDR 1,000 (less than $1 USD) is required to be donated in order to continue your hike up the terrace. One visitor behind us did not have any change with him, so these \u201cenforcement officers\u201d did not let him pass and he had to end his hike at that point, which was not nice of them (the locals\u2026). After all, pretty much every visitor who passes that point donated, so they should have just let one slip through without paying, since they already made a lot of money that day \u2013 box of money was full (around noon when we arrived). A few steps further up during our hike, there was a local lady, \u201cdressed up\u201d as a rice field farmer to pose for pictures with tourists. To do so, another donation was required.I don\u2019t mind donating money to locals, especially since we were visiting the grounds that they had been keeping so beautifully for visitors to enjoy, but to demand donations to enjoy the beauty of a country/location is too commercialized in my opinion. However, we still enjoyed visiting the Tegalalang Rice Terraces very much and would still recommend a visit."

I didn't expect to actually be able to walk along the terraces so I suggest you wear shoes that you can climb and jump in (some areas require a small leap) and that have a little traction since the dry areas can have loose dirt that can cause you to slide. The place wasn't overrun with tourists, though there were quite a few. I don't know if it's the time of day that we got there, which was around 11 am. We walked quite a ways across the terraces - we were wearing flip flops so we had to find our footing well and I ended up with a muddy foot and muddy, slippery slipper when I made a jump and landed in some mud. Also, don't carry a tonne of luggage with you - who wants to miss out on an opportunity because they have too much stuff with them? I took off 1 star because of the man who refused to let us pass after we almost got to the top of the other side. There was a sign asking for donations to help maintain the bridge and to me a donation is not mandatory but he literally blocked our way and wouldn't let us pass. He wasn't verbally aggressive or anything but you can't physically move an old man out of your way. A couple happened to be there at the same time and they had already paid and gone to the other side but wanted to turn around and go up again and the man was insisting that they had to pay again to pass. I didn't like the pressure tactics so I remove 1 star. Be prepared to pay (I don't know how much, I didn't ask) if you want to make it all the way to the other side. Even so, this was a beautiful experience because the rice terraces are simply beautiful to behold!"

So when a bunch of my Dutch friends visits bali and told me (to be exact, forced me with near colonial Dutch brutality) to come with them and see the rice fields, I already know its gonna be a GOOODD trip.And so i went, half drunk and half effected by not so legal substances. Now I'm going to review based on two different views:The dutch truly enjoyed the view, they go up and down the rice fields, took photos with the local, hang out and have a nice coffee in some of the cafe located on the edge of the rice fields, as if they reminisce the good ol' VOC colonial days. To them its just good nature, good landscape, something new apart from all the tulips and windmills that they used to see.The Indonesians, we expect more from all the hype. But it only brings what is promised by them, rice fields. And more rice fields. Albeit, the new found popularity of this place had become a new source of income for the locals, as now they can sell many arts and craft to the Bule in higher price. We went back, the Dutch still mesmerized by the view and the Indonesian nearly sober.All in all a very nice scenic place to visit, especially if you're not from Asia or you've been living in the city all your life."

It was a beautiful rice terrace, but a pity it was raining on the day we were there.Many tourists stop to take photos just slightly below the roads and not head down. However, if you are the adventurous kind, you can take a walk but be prepared to be approached by young locals who would ask to be your guide (they will say they need the money for their school fees and sell you post cards as well). Be in comfortable shoes and not slippers as the slopes may get slippery, especially on rainy days. We saw a couple of people with abrasions on their knees while trying to clear the \"obstacles\".There are a number of cafes as well overlooking the rice terrace. We chose the easier option of getting a drink (around 30-40k) and banana crepe (around 25k rupiah) in Teras Padi Cafe. You can get a good view of the entire terrace. Not too expensive for such a view.We heard from the waiter there are stairs by the side of the rice terrace which may be easier to access the lower levels.. Didnt get a chance to try it though. You may want to check it out if you visit."

More fit and adventurous tourists are able to walk down into the paddies and up the hill on the other side.The main road goes through Tegalalang and the road can get rather congested.

It was amazing seeing this from top of the mountain looking down in the fields. The shades of green are so beautiful and not as the shade of the Irish Mountains. It was fascinating seeing how these fields have surpassed the test of time and still are working rice fields. A classic Balinese photo op"

Nice to stop and have lunch overlooking the terraces (as you can see pictured with the beam in the foreground of the picture). You can also walk along some of them (unsure on cost) but we didn't do this as it was so rainy. I'd highly recommend visiting here, especially if you've got a driver or someone who can give you information about the terraces. For example, our driver told us that white rice takes 3 months from planting to harvest, and that usually they plant different things at different times of the year but due to tourism they are growing only rice all year round now."

Slightly commercial & has a \"for display\" rather than actually for farming feel. There's another area at Jatiluwih which could be better. Certainly Longjing rice terraces in Guilin China is larger, more natural & breathtaking. Anyways, here goes:1. Entrance fee Rs.10000pp, payable at the entrance roadThereafter, there are 3 other \"huts\" set up to collect \"donations\" to go to the higher levels of the terraces. This leaves a bad taste though it's not expensive Rs5000-10000pp (fixed, not \"donation\"). 2. Go in the morning - less people & less hot!3. Explore the back ways (not facing the houses); there are some good photo vistas & small huts offering refreshing whole coconut juice (~Rs20000ea), a chance to meet the local family/s who actually live onsite4. No toilets inside - use the ones belonging to the cafes before/after entering the terraces5. Low to medium physical fitness required. Shoes/ sandals preferable to flipflops."

Tegallalang Rice Terraces in Ubud is renowned for its spectacular scenes of rice paddies involving the ancient subak (traditional Balinese cooperative irrigation system). This is exactly what you will witness here; a wonderful display of traditional agriculture. Tegallalang forms the three most splendid terraced landscapes in Ubud's shared region, with the others being in the villages of Pejeng and Campuhan.Of course, it's similar with countless other destinations on the island, Tegallalang\u2019s rice terraces have a distinctly \u201cfound out\u201d feel, but the view is especially hard to beat. We found this a superb morning activity (could easily fill an afternoon too) and we didn't get charged to enter. We grabbed a bowl of fruit from one of the stalls, sat back and appreciated what was in front of our eyes. Admittedly, it is rather touristic but where isn't these days? Considering Bali is still revelling at finally being recognised on the UNESCO World Heritage List for its rice-growing traditions, it's definitely worth coming to see why."

This is one of Bali's famous rice terraces but what makes it unique is that there are restaurants in the area where one can soak in the beautiful view while dining. Ask your tour guide (I highly suggest Made from Mayor Bali Tours) if it's the best time of year to see it. It certainly is not as pretty just after the rice has been harvested, which is done on a rotational basis."

Of course I was expecting this, but still crowded places are not my favorite. Just expect lots of people and little children following you around trying to sell postcards etc... There's nice places to sit and have a cold drink or a meal if you want along the top of the valley. To see the terrace it takes 1, possibly 2, maaaaybe 3 hours if you really hung out and relaxed. Not counting getting there and back. I biked here 10k from Ubud which I would recommend, so long as you don't mind biking in traffic and aren't afraid of a little ( ok a lot) of sweat. The place I rented my bike from was about half way between the palace and the monkey forest, they've got a lot of bikes next to their shop it's hard to miss. The bike ride is simple, you follow the same road for most of it. It's uphill pretty much all the way there so get an early start! Way back is downhill and much easier!!!"

That way when your friends back home ask if you saw them, you can answer \"yes\". We had a private tour guide, and did not run into swarms of tourist, or souvenir hawkers, so an extra thank you to Gusti, for taking us there at a time when we were able to avoided them. I believe if you have never seen the terraces you will always wonder what you missed, so take the time it takes to drive by if nothing else."

There are beautiful rice terraces all over this island and at the rate of spoiling a beautiful and pristine location and turning it into exactly what I don't like about Tegalalang - the views at Jatiluwi are worth the trip. Tegalalang are an easy reach from Ubud, so if that's all you have time for I get it. Ubud is surrounded by rice fields, so just venture out a little and you'll see for yourself. Get up early and meander - a much better use of your time."

Have something cold to drink in one of the warungs and enjoy the view.I would recommend renting your own bike, so you have a bit more freedom. The 20 min drive from Ubud centre is mostly straight forward on good roads. Plenty of fun places to stop along the way. Most people stop right when they see the first parking so it gets super crowded. Try driving a little further to find a spot away from the masses. Also I would try to visit as early in the day as possible, before it gets to crowded and hot."

It was lovely & green & the grey clouds were rolling over thick & fast which was a nice cool relief. My daughter was hungry so we stayed up at a place which had a buffet lunch for $10 each but I have to say, the only thing that looked edible for us was the rice, so it ended up an expensive meal for what we had. My husband & son went for the walk through the rice fields and they came back with some very nice photos. Glad we stopped though, was nice to see another side of Bali.Oh and the road leading into this place is shocking - the money they make on entrance fees, they should get this fixed."

You have to pay to drive into the area, though this is minimal...20 IDR(about \u00a31GBR) Your drive takes you into the village....this is not a quaint rustic village of palm leaf huts, but modern buildings and aimed at the tourist, with all the tacky souvenirs. From the street you get a stunning view across the valley and rice terraces...from here, though stunning you really only get the one view. It was pouring with rain when we arrived so we didn't get any closer, but if the weather is nice and you have the time make the effort to go down to the terraces, i think you'll appreciate making the effort.You could say you'd done this sight in 15 minutes but equally if you go down to the terraces you could spend much longer."

In fact, I arrived so early that I disturbed one of the gatekeepers still sleeping in her tiny shelter and I had to wait for her to get dressed so that I could pass : )Make sure you wear good walking shoes or boots and try not to damage the fields when you are clambering around. Respect the local farmers, but feel free to ask them about their work, most of them will be happy to talk and pose for pictures, especially if you have taken the time to learn a little Balinese."

At these huts they'll ask for a donation. I wouldn't pay more than 5,000IDR if I were you as you'll have around 8 of these points. Also be aware that the lovely old people carrying the rice on their shoulders that offer photographs also want money. One lady asked me for 50,000IDR so I deleted the photo. They don't make you aware of a charge before hand so be prepared. It is not offensive though, just letting you know to take small change. Well worth a visit to see such an iconic view."

There weren't so many tourists and it was just breathtaking the views of the terraces.You are able to get great views of the terraces along the road or you can venture down a little to see more uninterrupted views. We ventured down a little and I spoke to a lovely local cafe owner who had various cattleya and phalaenopsis orchids on display around his cafe, his knowledge and hospitality was just as memorable as the views. We weren't pressured to eat there or buy anything but I gave him a donation for using his toilet."

You will pass through several huts where you will be asked to pay a small fee to continue on path it's well worth it when you reach the top.There are also photo ops to don a hat and rice buckets and have one of the riceHarvesters take your photo fun of course there is a fee but it's small.

Whether there are better ones around, I don't know. But this one is obviously well known, and offers quite a beautiful view. There's nothing really to do there, other than have lunch while enjoying the view. We did a mountain hike in the morning so we didn't walk through the fields. Summary: We did the Mount Batur hike in the morning. 2am pick up at our hotel. 4am start for the walk and finished about 11am finish. We hired a driver for the rest of the day. We picked our itinerary which included a coffee plantation, Tegalalang Rice Terrace for lunch, 2 temples and the Monkey Forest. This is pretty much the stock standard day trip to Ubud.

They are functioning food sources and they are attractions co-created by man and nature.I would warn you though that it's a bit diffucult to experience this site deeply given the many tourists going for that 'jump-off-the-cliff' selfie shots and whatnots...Be ready for some walking. If not, ask your driver (do get a driver if you plan to visit bali. Message me to get a reco) to drop you off at one of the scenic spots to just enjoy an overview of the terraces.For shoppers, you can haggle for better prices at the shops on top.

To experience the little homes where locals live amongst the rice paddies was so interesting and I'm so pleased my 9 year old daughter was able to witness this. Make sure you wear good walking shoes as some of the paths can be slippery and unstable. Wouldn't recommend this for the elderly or families with children who need to be carried.

It's pretty widely accepted that Jatiluwih is a better set of rice terraces to visit, but also much more out of the way, depending on where you are. If you're coming from Ubud, Tegalalang, along with Gunung Kawi, is a conveniently located stop that will satisfy your itch to see the spectacle of Bali rice terraces. You'll probably only spend 20 minutes here, but it's still worth it."

It was pretty difficult to find the entrance as it was remarkably busy on the street. Beware of the locals demanding donations and make sure to have cash on you if you want to take photo's with the farmers or locals as they will ask for about $1 per photo...we only realised they charge to have photo's after the fact. The view is spectacular, if you can visit during low season it might be a little better as it was busy when we visited in December which is expected."

If you want to have a walk in Tegalalang terrace you will be asked for COMPULSORY DONATION. Though it is made ridiculously funny. First you will be asked a COMPULSORY donation to cross a bridge. But then, when you crossed the bridge, in 50 meters you will be asked another COMPULSORY DONATION. And the woman which collects them will not give you to go further if you do not pay. We somehow avoided the bridge donation (maybe the collector run to the toilet). However, we couldn't pass by the women, so we turned back. Somehow i just didn't feel like paying to the rude person. I think the better way would be to place a ticket booth somewhere at the beginning so that you pay for entrance instead of having dodgy compulsory donations :)"

If u can get someone who speaks English well to help you communicate with a local about their rice cultivation that'd be cool. Heaps of stalls with pretty nice knit work, blankets etc. The road out to the south has some great places where you see the wood carvings and other art being made."

I was shocked by how overbuilt and commercialized this place (and frankly everything in the Ubud area) has become. If you possibly can get to other parts of Bali (east, west), do it because those places are far less commercialized and far less touristic with much better scenery and authentic local culture. On the other hand, if your travel schedule or budget doesn't permit a trip to a far-flung part of Bali, then definitely you should come here and check it out. This is like a miniature preserved rice patty, scenically positioned on a steep slope. Very photogenic. From the Ubud area this is a short trip. From the resort area Nusa Dua this is at least a one-hour trip, maybe more, but if this is the only place you can see outside of the resort area, you should make the trip."

You stop by the side of the road and there is a small view terrace. That's it. Nearly impossible to walk down to the rice terraces itself. I reckon Jatiluwih, another rice terrace and Unesco site in Bali, would offer a better trip option. Overall Tegalalang was a disappointment for us."

It's akin to travelling to Nepal for Everest which would be further away, instead of going for a local hill which is closer and more accessible.

Paddies, paddies, paddies everywhere you go.As with all rice field related attractions, the beauty really depends on the timing of your visit, whether it is after or before harvesting.I guess the management realizes this, so they never plant all the rice at the same time, otherwise it will loose its attraction when all are harvested. Expect to see some brown patches amidst the green rice field."

There is a cafe facing the fields and as you might expect with a captive market they charge a premium on their food. On the roadside there are many little shops all plying their wares. We found people to be friendly and mostly willing to negotiate on prices for clothes and carved wooden items. The children selling postcards are experts at pulling the heart strings. We did not want any postcards but they were happy to receive a silver coin. If you want good photos catch the eye of the 90yr old woman carrying her rice baskets on the terraces, she will let you lighten her load for a while and pose for photos. If you go via your own transport be sure to travel further along the road uphill from Tegalalang to really experience the genuine Bali."

Lots of shops & cafes overlooking the terrace so a nice spot to grab a drink & relax. If you're interested in shopping, plenty of options. The sellers here seemed a little less pushy than some other places, maybe because there were so many tourists. I say its definitely a place to see while you're here but only if you haven't made arrangements for some other rice field experience."

You walk along the road and can stop anywhere you want to take photos and more photos! At the other famous rice terrace we stopped at a few days before, you have to pay to enter into the village and the terraces were not as attractive there as in the Tegalalang location.There are vendors, but they were not aggressive. We stopped at a \"cafe\" store and bought a fresh coconut to drink. The owners are so charming and showed us their baby. We took a photo this lovely family.Yes, it is definitely on the to do list if you visit Bali. Don't miss it."

Batukau at 9 am, after a one hour uphill drive from Ubud. After paying the 30K entry fee, we noted the mountain's powerful streams supplying the intricate Subak canal system over the miles of rice terraces below. We were dropped off at the trail head where a map detailed the 1 km or the 2 km trail along one of the canals. As we walked, our attention was riveted to the one mile views of long curving terraces with occasional cow sheds, small temples, and distant farming villages before the green forested mountain. The morning light was perfect for pictures and we appreciated being nearly the sole strollers along the nice trail. Near the end of this marked walk, we came upon a lone farmer plowing a small terrace with his single water buffalo. He stopped to toss buckets of water over her back and head as the morning sun began to warm this wide valley. From here we walked up to the Unesco Viewpoint Memorial where we met our waiting driver. This one hour walk produced the best of our long rice terrace views in the three day trips we took around this beautiful island."

Beautiful but totally over exploited..you are charged as you drive into the village, village entrance fee, parking fee, then you have to pay gratuity to people on rice terrace to let you cross at varying levels of the terraces,,they won't let you pass until you pay, there's some cozy cafe and restaurant in the area but not much to do or see other than take a few photos."

I explored and trekked on my own but you can definitely get a guide here if you must!First thing you'll notice is the endless choices of vendors along the street selling awesome Balinese souvenirs! There are also some food places near the stairs so you can grab some much needed refreshments before or after your trek! Anyway, make sure to make time for this! The views are very nice and worth every step and sweat, lol! There are locals in small huts in some areas and a small donation is greatly appreciated by them! TIP: it would probably be best to visit the terraces early morning! I was here mid afternoon and I was sweating bullets just walking down the stairs!!! Regardless it was an amazing experience and it was not crowded so it was very easy to climb up and down and take pictures!"

The wind chime at the top of the hillock can be heard right till the roads . The journey way up is almost a 45 mins to 1 hr trek , the locals have created intermediate toll shacks were they might ask for donations and also serve fresh coconut water if you are puffing and panting due to the walk up hill . i would not recommend the trip during the noon as the heat is too much and the walk is not suggested for kids or aged folks"

So we started to walk down, the track is quite difficult in flip-flops I'd recommend trainers as its quite muddy and dusty. You get up to where the good views are and there is a lady asking for a \"donation\" for the bridge, basically there's one path and she stands in front of it until you pay. Oh and it's a minimum of 10k, I didn't realise there would be a minimum for a donation..Then you get to the next bit and there's a man holding the baskets that hold the crops and asks if you want a photo. You take it and then he says MONEY. Then there's a little girl asking if you want to have a picture. The views were nice but I got fed up of being pestered for money. She probably had more money than I did in that tub of donations."

            "review": "Nice Location but beware...... . This is one of the well known and heavily visited rice terraces by tourists exploring just beyond Ubud. The difficulty with visiting is getting your timing right to beat the traffic jam and also to see the terraces while they are at their best and beautifully green. As with all crops the latter is much more difficult to determine, however, even if the greenery is lacking the ingenuity of the subak is worth the trip. The chaotic traffic is due to tourism and small roads that cannot cope with parked vehicles. Patience is your friend. Sadly though, making cash is the main theme here.......make sure you bring plenty just to cover costs, then extra if you want to risk shopping and bartering for highly priced items. Arrive in your own vehicle or on a scooter and expect to get slugged left, right and centre. First of all you will be required to pay an \"entrance fee\" upon entering the area from either end. If you ask what the entrance fee includes e.g parking, walking the terrace etc. you will be told \"entry only\" and it's not cheap. Balk at the price and you will be told \"if you don't like it, leave\"!! (Seriously?!). You will also find that you get slugged a parking fee when you're leaving too. If you decide to walk the terraces be prepared to pay another fee that is supposedly a \"donation\"......this donation had a starting price of 10,000Rp/person but drops to 5,000Rp if you are prepared to argue the point. When you think you've got over that annoyance you'll soon discover that you'll be up for another donation in three more locations. Some of these collection \"agents\" are pretty aggressive and will not let you pass until you pay. Again if you argue that you have already paid you will get the \"if you don't like it, leave\" attitude. We saw people getting turned away because they refused to pay again. It's a very disturbing trend in Bali at the moment to grab as much money as possible from tourists and tell them where to go if they don't want to pay. Very poor for tourism. Also, be careful if taking photos. You might find that the farmer, old lady, kitten owner etc etc will want a \"fee\" for your shutter button going off. They will ask a crazy amount too and get pretty narky if you disagree.  Then there are the restaurants, if you're lucky to choose an OK one you're set.......but good luck with the toilets (that you'll pay for \"maintenance\" and wonder where the money goes). The restaurants make a killing on over-priced food for the most part but generally the few I've tried have served pretty good meals. I go to some of these places more than once in a year as they're not far from Ubud and a nice change from eating locally. Tegalalangs Ceking Terrace is a nice view but it's very touristy and overall it's expensive. Sadly, I've seen many people leave feeling very disgruntled and unimpressed with the locals. I have to wonder how long it will be before tourism will dwindle as it has in Kintamani due to the aggressive nature and money grabbing of the community?Wake up leaders of the Banjar, you're milking the cash cow dry."

Visited the rice terraces last week as part or a day trip and we enjoyed it even though it was so hot we didn't walk through the whole terrace (it was midday and there is no shade when you are on the terrace). It was busy but not as busy as we expected, and people asking for donations to walk past their bridge/hut on the terrace were friendly and it's so cheap for us there is no point arguing (10,000 for the 3 of us). The terrace is big and beautiful just like on the postcards and we saw different types of rice and learnt the principles of rice farming thanks to our great guide. Had lunch in one of the warungs overlooking the terrace which was really lovely too, and not too busy."

You can just bypass and avoid them. Not impressed, although, this once was a marvel of useful engineering."

I decided not to do this and just walked back, as I really didn't need to hike the terraces anyway given I had already done so after being lured into another tourist trap (a guy offering to show me nearby rice paddies).

Some reviews mentioned payment at some point, but I did not come across any need for payment anywhere. However, perhaps I would have if I had walked down amongst the terraces? A grizzled old farmer with shoulder baskets was offering selfies with the tourists, and he happily smiled for many photos with people, which was nice. An old lady farmer took my hand to (unnecessarily) help me down a steep portion of the track, and was smiley and helpful, and did not expect payment.

This place had working rice farmers and the only note from me is to not get suckered to take a picture with one of these farmers. They are tricky and will ask for money after you've taken a picture with them or of any of their tools."

It's lovely! One caveat -- when we entered the area, we were solicited for a donation of 5,000 rupiah per person and happily gave our 20,000 (under 2 USD). A few minutes further on, another request. Then another, and another. We gave further donations at some, but were a bit put off by the persistence, and in some cases, the aggressiveness. One man actually even grabbed my wife's arm and pulled on it! I do get that different families are probably soliciting for themselves, but it is awkward. People, you need to get together and POOL YOUR \"DONATIONS\". And by the way, if you call it a \"donation\", that means it's supposed to be voluntary. No grabbing people!"

You have stalls mainly on one side selling all the Balinese stuff and of course even some on the rice field side. So you got out and ventured down by the rice fields we did not walk into the rice fields or really explore into the rice fields we stayed on the out skirts and had a snack at one of the restaurants that had a gorgeous view. The green layering of the rice fields is just mesmerising and I just loved it. I wished I could have walked out into the fields but with kiddos it didn't work out that way but it was lovely to see and of course the rice is delicious."

There were so many people in flip flops and sandals and the paths aren't meant for flip flops. The workers are actually barefoot. The fields are owned by many families so when you walk through the rice fields you'll go through gates where they ask for donations. I didn't know this so i gave a \"hefty\" donation (20k) but then had only 8k to give when I reached the next gate. I think 10k is standard practice.Definitely a beautiful place! I would go back!"

We were left at the beginning of the hiking trail where a map shows two routes, we wanted to take the longer one but after following the signs we were dissappointed when we finished 20 or so minutes later so we came back and took a road outside of the hiking trail, the day was very hot and we got tired very quickly (take food and water with you), after one more hour walking we turned back. We were not asked any money and the people we met on the road, mostly road workers, were very nice and friendly. We wanted to buy some brown rice from the ladies next to the Unesco commemorative plaque but we found it too expensive, so in our way back we stopped in a small town and bought some at a reasonable price.It is a long way to Tegalang Rice Terrace from Ubud but it is worthy."

It is certainly not for the unfit; and for people with mobility challenges, I suggest you can visit and take in the stunning views, atmosphere and sounds from one of the bars that overlook the site.For those stepping into the adventure, please do as I say and not as I did and take a decent pair of of walking shoes with good grip to navigate the uneven terrain. The site attracts all sorts of people and can be quite busy, so watch your step when passing people - the ledges can be thin. At the various stalls with the donation sign, the sign says donation, the expectation is pay-up. I did it once as a gesture of goodwill, but it got a bit frustrated as I passed more of these stalls. Suggestion is: know how much you want to 'donate' upfront and spread it amongst the stalls. There are two or three of these, plus some random photo ops that some of the paddy farmers will create and ask for payment in return. It is good to know what to expect.On my visit, the most functional stall was the first that sold coconuts. If you have not already hydrated, take that opportunity to do so to avoid heat exhaustion during your walk.The site is beautiful and set against a back-drop of luscious greenery. The wind-powered cog instruments fill it with evocative sounds that can transport you into space and time - just close your eyes for a second and take it all in.I loved it as a day-time, better still, early morning excursion when the day is still relatively cool. It's about a 1 hour exercise - two if you include breakfast or lunch after."

The walkways are smaller so maneuvering around others was difficult. They do charge for each destination point up the terrace. You pay 10,000 rp to get but then 5,000 more and then another 5,000 luckily our driver told us this because they call them \"donations\" and one guy tried to take our 1000,000rp and give us no change so be careful!

I have encountered much better terrace farming fields in India, up north, so I was not quite excited by that. However, the handicraft market near this place is a must to hang around. People of Bali are real talented and this is the right place to experience their gift. In handicraft market, you can always buy gifts for your loved ones at a cheaper price, if you can showcase some good skills of bargaining."

It's a completely different environment. TIP: bring some bills in smaller denominations. You're basically walking through the village farm - access is free, but donating something is expected... multiple times. The locals build bridges and paths for themselves to access and tend to the terraces. And tourists stampeding through them inadvertantly cause some damage. There are collection baskets scattered throughout the terraces. I think we encountered 4 during the hour or so that we were exploring."

Although it's a relatively small area, the climbs are very steep and can take a while. Plan to spend some time here because you won't be able to run back to the car quickly.Tips:--As with all things in Bali, come prepared with bug spray, sun spray, and plenty of water. --You access this place from a tiny little path in between shops on the road - ask for directions from your driver.--Arrive at 11am or earlier. There were no crowds and it wasn't hot yet. --We paid for tickets at a parking lot nearby, but then no one checked for our tickets. Then about 15 minutes into the hike, we passed a \"donation point\" where we gave 5000 rupiah to a random man at a little stand. It was definitely odd, but completely expected that these types of things happen while traveling through Bali. It's not a big deal. Come prepared with smaller bills on hand."

The place is very busy with lots of shops along the road and hardly any space to park. As with most of Bali you have to pay/tip for various things. Our driver dropped us off but needed money to pay for a space some way down the road where we would meet him later.Although it is free to wander onto the rice terraces, there are a number of sellers who will try to get you to buy something as you are wanting to get onto the trail. I found the sellers near the entrances (of which there are many routes) to be more persistent than at other places we visited in Bali. However, maybe that was us being unlucky.There were also a lot of young children trying to sell us postcards and other small items as we began our decent onto the rice terraces.Now while it is free to access the terraces themselves, there are a number of \"stations\" which have been set up on the trail where you will be asked for a \"donation\". The first of these I found amusing as it was labelled \"the bridge donation fund\". Funny because the bridge was obviously not really maintained. A small donation of 10,000 or so is fine.The next checkpoint we hit merely said donation and as we tried to pass it we were physically stopped by an old man who would not let us pass without putting money into the pot...not really a donation then is it?! Again something small like 10,000 should be fine.Overall, the views are lovely on a good day, though the physical exercise is probably more than you think...we were sweating. Also, it can be quite slippery and there are no safety features like hand rails on most of the route, even though it can be very steep and uneven. I would not recommend it to anyone who does not feel confident on their feet or has little balance. There aren't really many \"passing points\" so you have to try and squeeze past other people coming from the opposite direction without pushing either off the edge.Definitely worth a visit, but remember to have small change/notes for the \"donations\" and that however long you take going out into the terraces, you will need to trek that amount of time back when you turn around...it's pretty big!"

The terraces are impressive as machinery can not be used so they do things the old fashioned and traditional way (although I bet they have a few technological aids these days).

Quite touiristy, would recommend shoes and it can be quite slippery in some places but we did ok in jandals. Nice photo opportunity. Heaps of cafes and market stalls on the side, would be a nice spot to stop for lunch. Enjoyed visiting here :)"

No one tells you what it's for, who they are or how much is reasonable. Luckily we had enough to get up over to the other side and back out. We encounter 4 toll donations. 5000 seemed to be normal each time and certainly lots of those notes in the boxes. Oh yes, that's around \u00a30.23p. :-) not much but it would be nice to know in advance. Especially as we were usually carrying much larger denomination notes. Else you'd have more wads of cash than Harry Enfield's loadsamoney character. Certainly something to do in Bali and if you like shopping then driving through Ubud is an eye opener too."

Not far from ubud and if you feel adventureous you can also go to another temple close by and walk down to the Kings and Queens temple which is divided by a small creek. The King is one side and the Queen is on the other. These are built into a sandstone wall and monks take care of the both. I was told that these are somewhere around 1000 years old, go and have a look. I have to tell you that it is a long walk down and many steps back up but the steps are quite wide not like the ones you walk down and back up doing the water rafting."

The Terrace is pretty enough, but is so overrun with tourists (at least, when we visited in high season) and traders targeting them that it was impossible for us to appreciate on its merits. We had a coffee overlooking the Terrace for ten minutes, and got back in the car. However, if you can stand the crowds, are passing through and don't have time to see rice terraces elsewhere in Bali, it's probably worth a quick stop-off."

I could imagine the Terraces being full of green rice fields with locals harvesting the rice, but unfortunately it has turned into a major tourist scam. You pay 10,000 rupiah a person as a toll to the police to enter the area. This is reasonable. I understand the need of the locals and lets be honest 10000 rupiah is less than 1 US dollar, even the budget traveller can afford that. But then you walk down and someone asks you for a donation to help maintain the rice fields, though I dont think you can call it a donation if they dont let you pass with out paying. I was still okay with this, I donated 20000 rupiah and my friend 10000. But then we walk to the top and there is another man asking for donations, I said I already gave a donation and he blocked the path refusing to let me through. I turned back, it didnt look that amazing past him, but all the money asking really ruined the experience for me. There is lso the faxt that most of the rice paddies are just muddy ponds that it doesnt seem anyone is tending. Driving around Bali I saw plenty of more beautiful rice paddies and people."

If you are feeling energetic you can walk along the rice terraces. I visited with a great driver, Wayan Naja who I always book when I'm in Ubud. Wayan is a very professional and informative driver and passionate about Bali. He also took us to a really beautiful cafe for lunch that was about 5 minutes drive from the tourist area and away from the crowds. Wayan's numbers are (+62) 081 999 967 686 / (+62) 812 3936 7929.

As soon as we exited from the car parking space on one side of the road, a person wearing a traffic police like fluorescent green vest approached us. He said that 10000 IDR per person was to be paid for entrance to the terrace and issued receipts. We paid up and walked in search of sign boards leading to the terrace. There weren't none. As we could see the terrace from the road, we finally just took a random entry point which had a flight of stairs leading down the small hill. We could see the rice terraces on the other side. Although we couldn't see the verdant green blanket of paddy fields as the paddies were just starting to grow, we were struck by the overall beauty of the terraces and the ingenious construction and irrigation method. We could see several tourists climbing on from the other side to the terrace. As we were climbing up, we were stopped rudely by a person who demanded that we pay a donation for visiting the terrace. When we mentioned that we had already bought the tickets, he became angry and started trying to block our way. When we said that we are going back and will see what can be done, he allowed us to pass but kept shouting at us and staring aggressively as we climbed up. Although the terraces were beautiful, we couldn't enjoy much because of this incident. There was another shed almost towards 3/4th of the terrace climb who was equally rude and said that we need to pay donation to climb higher. We said no thanks and climbed down. We tok some pictures after getting on the main road. Overall, it was an experience quite unlike how we were treated by the Balinese people so far. While it is possible that the people asking for donation are the actual farmers or owners of the place, the issue of donation is to be settled between them and the main ticket staff. Harassing tourists doesn't seem like the best way forward. Be careful to clarify this issue with the ticketing staff or your driver before visiting the terrace."

This was the last straw so we turned back as we weren't ready to be scammed again and there pretty much wasn't a lot to see past his donation booth. These people pretty much ruined the experience for me although the place was beautiful."

Step off the main road and you are greeted by lush, layered and amazing rice fields. We arrived and the rice had been harvested 3 weeks earlier but I don't think it matters. It's the sheer scale and working conditions you have to admire from the farmers and then there is the natural beauty of the scenery. We wished we had asked the driver for an hour here just to be able to sit and take in the views with a drink or walk more of the fields (well the edges). Well worth a visit."

Get out and take a tour of the Tegalalang Rice Terrace, where you might see the farmers planting or cultivating rice, depending on when you go. Pay attention to your surroundings as there are monkeys in the trees, and some aren't too shy if you leave your bag unattended. We didn't have any encounters with the monkeys, but we could hear them, especially towards the evenings.Enjoy your time in this cooler elevation, and slower, more peaceful area of Bali."

Many many shop spread along the street, from candle sticks to statues,most of the product for export, you drive a car to see the stepped rice field scene and it's so nice to watch the shops along the road, but now business seems falling down. Lot of guest search their product from Java, I think a lot of Balinese product came from Java from a long long time....There was a time you're free of charge to see the Terasering (stepped rice field), but now they ask you paid small fees if you stopped by. At least you must pay for the stop or parking your vehicle. It's okay, maybe the fee is for the development of this area, but it seems like you're in Jakarta, where you must pay even for walking in the beach......The view is pretty nice, you can take photos and buy your soda in here. But for me the view is far better Jatiluwih than this Tegalalang...."

We saw others further down, so headed down after them. It looked lush and productive, with the odd tourist picking out a pathway on the lower terraces. There was no farming activity as the rice was growing, not ready for harvesting. It didn't take long, and we felt that the drive to the terraces was just as interesting as we could see more people going about their daily activities.."

What a spectacular sight to see how these rice paddies are carved in to the landscape is something that you should not miss if you are in the area. You can even take a walk down from the road to the river then up the other side winding through the paddies looking back across to the main road. It can get very busy so be careful getting in and out of the car or bus, the best time to visit is in the morning around 11am as it is a little quite and the sun is at its best location to view the Terrace plus a bit cooler more comfortable. You can get plenty of refreshments or even have lunch as there are plenty of restaurants to choose from."

It took us 15 minutes for us to look and take some photos, but that was it. The main street was so busy and crowded. Avoid June as there is no rice or any plant growing in the rice fields. It was just some mud, nothing interesting to see. We had a specific restaurant we wanted to have lunch on the way, but our guide said he would have recommended a restaurant by the rice field if we didn't have a plan. May be if we had lunch there, could have had a better experience. But it was just too busy, too crowded, too noisy with so little to see."

You do need to donate money at the start of the terraces and then to get up a bit higher to the upper terraces I donated more money - here there was a man who I thought was just doing the thing for the tourists - holding the baskets with rice, wearing a rice farmer hat - I gave him the smallest note I had (not a small one!) which was way too much for just a photo but he then led me all around the rice fields and to the most beautiful views of the less tourist trampled rice fields - well worth $10AUD in the end!

We walked up that street, very steep, hoping to get a better view. We got talking to a local guy who then took us on a 2 hour guided tour of his family's rice terraces. We met his family and watched as they worked the fields. They even let us work with them for a short time harvesting rice. He then took us to his village on the other side and invited us into his home. He showed us things we never imaged seeing, even a secluded shrine deep in a gully that you wouldn't know existed if you weren't shown it. Yes, we were hot and sweaty by the end but we got more than we ever bargained for on this trip. Absolutely excellent and the photographs we got on the day were sensatational. Spend a bit of time and you won't be disappointed. Yes, we did tip the guy at the end but it was well worth it."

As well as on what you might call the trail, there are many young children and old women with hand out asking for money, which can pull on your heart strings.For first timers, definitely go have a look. It's not that far from Ubud and across the road is the Luwak Coffee tour which was enjoyable. Do all three and make a day out of it."

To walk up through the rice terraces you need to pay a donation at each of the booths. Our driver advised us to pay no more than 5000 rp per donation & we did get asked for more at one (Bali just seems to be like that...just felt like there was always someone with their hand out) but we were more than happy to pay the donation...blows me away how much work has gone into the rice terraces.We stopped for a drink at one of the cafes on the way back up...and really wished we had stayed for lunch here, the views were stunning with little low tables set in 'huts' the side of the hill overlooking the rice terraces.Be warned that there are no public toilets here and I think (understandably) the local cafe is sick of providing toilets for every visitor to the rice terraces so plan to have lunch or at least drinks & snacks at the cafe if you want to use their toilets."

As mentioned in other reviews, you can view these fields from the roadside. There were many small cafes here where people can sit and enjoy the views, but these are just the cheap cafes. As the sun rose higher after 8am, it would be facing you and not ideal for photographs. The best time to take pictures would be in the later part of the afternoon. When green, the fields look nice, but the slopes are just a small area and hence, not a magnificent view. You could visit it if you happen to be in the Ubud area, but its not worth making that special trip just to see these fields."

The rice terrace itself is very nice. Steep steps going down and up the terrace. Watch out for mud. I went there when it was almost harvest time so the rice was almost golden brown. Would have loved to be there when it was during the planting season where the waters in the terrace would make great photographs. Remember to donate a small fee when crossing the bridge. Overall a nice place to visit."

The only tip I'd give is Bali Pulina Coffee Plantation and tasting is literally right across from the Tegalalang Rice Terrace and is really worth a visit.

You can get the best overall view from the road or cafes, but if you want to go down into them you will need good footwear and some money. It is a steep climb down and then you start the gentle paths of the terrace. There are stop points where you are told you need to give a donation to get further. Typical donation is 5000 rupiah per person. We spent about 45 minutes here and then we were blistering hot as it is not in the shade, so we made our way out. If your staying in Ubud there is no need to hire a driver to get here, rent a scooter for 45-60,000 ($4-6 US). Take Raya Ubud east all the way to the statue and at the statue turn left (north) then stay on this road all the way to Tegalalang (approx 10-15 mins). There's tons of street parking for your scooter. *I've read on here that Tegalalang is very busy..? We barely saw 20 people in the fields and we were visiting mid day. So we never witnessed crowds. Well worth the visit, so close to Ubud!"

            "review": "Rice is Nice. Wherever I went in Bali it seemed I was surrounded by small paddy fields usually tended by a stooped old man or woman who trudges bear-footed through brown turbid water, inspecting each plant and moving slowly on. These tiny plots are planted either as a community project or for the needs of a single family. When the rice is growing the paddies look like deep green patchwork quilts undershot with a shimmering muddy silk sheet. The gurgle of running water is not far away and the chirruping of bugs a constant companion to the heat and humidity. Growing between the paddies are banana plants and coconut palms and mature rice plants heavily cropped heads bowed and stooped while small birds dart from one plant to the next oblivious of the flags flapping in the thin breeze.But the Tegalalang terraces are rice farming on a semi-industrial scale. It seems as if the terraces have been carved from the earth itself and formed into a stairway for Balinese giants. The verdant steps seem to tumble down a hill side into the valley below. The effect is of an amphitheatre padded with green velvet and a backdrop of tall lush-canopied palms.For the more energetic and adventurous a climb through the terraces to the top-most point is rewarded by hauntingly beautiful views.These ancient terraces are recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and besides supplying a staple crop the terraces are an ancient form of water management. I stopped at a small caf\u00e9 and enjoyed a Java tea while marvelling that these terraces have been continually worked for centuries. The green was occasionally broken by the bright crimson flash of hibiscus flowers that grows on the edges of the terrace. Bali is famed for its paddy fields and the Tegalalang Rice Terraces are a relaxing stop and one of the true marvels of the ancient world.  As more and more rice paddies are being bought for commercial use the protection of the UNESCO is to be valued."

That is a much much prettier area with no roads, no tourist buildings and pretty much no tourists - just a few friendly farmers.

There are a few restaurants but we did not stay. You can use the rest rooms for about IDR 2,000 (US 0.15) so you don't need to buy anything. By all means plan your drive so you go by Tegalalang -- but I also liked the big wide-open rice terraces at Jatiluwih further north. There, they go on for miles and have walking trails. (You can also hike through Tegalalang but we didn't have time.)"

There is nothing wrong with the terraces - the view is nice, although you can see equally nice or even nicer views driving between Ampapura and Chandidasa. It is just they every tour operator in Bali brings their tourists to Ceking, Tegallalang to view the terraces, and as the result there is a constant traffic jam.Road is narrow anyway, so just to drive through can take half an hour. Locals are also desperate to get their share of the action and are following the unfortunate tourists trying to sell them all sorts of goods which are cheaper in villages up and down the road - which makes it all a bit of a nightmare. Every organised tour will take you there, so if you go on one of those you will not manage to avoid it. But my advice would be to hire a car (135000Rs to 150 000Rs - \u00a313 to \u00a315 per day), get a map of Bali and go and look at rice terraces elsewhere. Or get a motorbike if you know how to ride one from before (Bali is the wrong place to LEARN to ride a bike). Or hire a car + driver if you are not happy about driving yourself - about 350 000 Rs per day - still cheaper then tours that charge $50 or $60 per person"

When she sees you she'll smile and welcome you to take photos with the Balinese working hat and the bamboo stick. However, after you had you're fun she'll tell you to pay 10,000 rupiah which is around USD$1.

Just a little up the road, we stopped at another small viewing area - but this was very unpleasant, with families of hawkers becoming relatively aggressive trying to sell their souvenirs - and demanding parking fees also.

There are many tourist shops if you want to buy something and small coffee shops on the hill if you want to drink your coffee seeing the view. Of course it was too crowdie, but everyone should expect that in places like that.There were many people who walked through the rice terraces all the way across the hill and up to the next one. Firstly, if you want to do that you must wear appropriate cloths and shoes. Just think that you should go down and up again from small paths across the terraces. Another thing you should be careful of are the spiders and the snakes\u2026. Yes, you think that with so many people all the creepy things will be hidden somewhere away from you, but no\u2026 this is not true! While we took photos with my husband and when I was next to a banana tree I saw next to my face the biggest spider ever. I screamed, my husband took a picture of her in order to keep scaring me with it\u2026 not the best experience. When we saw a snake among the rice plants, we decided to leave and that we do not love nature that much.Concussively, everyone should visit Tegalalang Rice Terrace at least for the view from the safe coffee shops and balconies.

It's a green heaven I could spend days in. There are however a few things to know:- prepare change, a small donation/fee is required (like RP. 5000). You'll also be able to get a refreshing coconut down there- have good shoes, it's not the easiest terrain to go- I recommend to start the visit a bit downhill (not a the top with the nice view) where you will find a nice, concrete stair that will avoid you to break your legs while falling! Then go up and climb back on the top, were you'll finish with a nice view over the fields."

As a photographer, typically the 'golden hour' is best for images; that point where the sun is almost up and the colors are very vivid. We were there in early February, and I had not researched where the sun would rise. And, unfortunately, it rose right over the terraces, a bright star aimed right at the camera. Dang. It would have been a much better shot if the sun was rising behind you as you look from the road to the rice fields.My suggestions for images - evenings, for good sunset and low light.However, the best part was that we were the ONLY ones there. Had the terraces all to ourselves. No tourists, no venders, no people at all. It was very peaceful. I really don't think the street shops open until about 9 or 10am, and then, from what I understand, they are very persistent. We would take this short 15 minute drive again, but only at sunset next time. Or, drive further on where there are many more rice fields."

Not recommended for the elderly or disabled, to attempt the climb, or for anyone if it's raining.That said, you don't need to be fit to do it, and it's not that far, but some parts can be steep, narrow and slippery. The views are stunning, and it's well worth a visit. So green and vast! Great for panoramic photography.There are annoying hustlers along the way demanding \"donations\" (firstly, you don't demand a 'donation'). This isn't real and not necessary. Of course it's up to you, and some offer a free coconut juice in return which might be a welcome refreshment, but know you're being scammed. And there's not just one. There are multiple people asking for these donations along the route to the far side of the rice fields, and some really don't want to let you pass. Even if you say you already made a donation, they say \"this is different\" and one man even put his arms out to stop me passing until we'd given money. So be prepared. If you're feeling cornered, 10,000rp is more than enough to get them out of the way. Often these people leave once they've made enough easy cash for the day, so I expect there's less of them in the afternoon. Don't let that put you off though. You don't have to climb in the terraces if you don't want to. The view is spectacular from the roadside. And there's plenty of caf\u00e9s, and souvenir shops there. You can sit and have a drink while admiring the view. Allow an hour or so if you want to explore the terraces. Sensible foot wear might be a good idea, but not necessary - I did it in flip flops. Take bottled water, a hat, and a good camera."

Firstly - the location of this place is not where the trip advisor map says it is.Obviously our fault for not double checking, but we rode a motorbike south east of ubud down to the location marked on the trip advisor map where we found next to nothing, besides a nice man who told us we'd gone to the wrong place.After finally getting to the rice terrace it was quite nice, a very direct ride from ubud. Although the rice had been harvested shortly before we arrived, but it was still pleasant and picturesque having lunch overlooking the paddies."

It is a very beautiful terrace and you can take many good shots there. There are also some free-wifi cafes around the terrace where you can have some fresh coconut juice and take a break. But honestly I have seen many other terraces in China which are greater than this one.So my suggestion is: only go there if you have plenty of time to spend in Ubud. (In bad traffic it might take more than 2 hours to go there and come back to Ubud center) Otherwise the local shops and markets are more worth going."

It's an impressive rice field and much cheaper to visit than the others in China and elsewhere in Asia.From the top there are steps leading down, which are pretty central in relation to the rice field. At the bottom there is a bridge and we paid a small charge (a dollar I think), which was well worth it. We were then free to wander about the fields and take a few photos, and a few of our friends took photos of us from the top.Most people were just jumping out of their tour buses for 2mins but it's worth spending 30mins or so on the actual fields."

Yes, the place is rather touristy but what can one expect on a small island whose poplulation is 90% tourists anyway? The veiws are absolutely stunning, and it is one of those occasions when one needs a good panoramic camera to capture at least a glimps of the views as most of the photos simply can't do this place any justice. It is still very tranquil and you don't see/feel the hords of tourists there at all: the place is so vast that all these people simply dilute and disappear. Have stroll through the fields, enjoy the breathtaking views that have no time-stamp attached to them: they looked exactly the same a hundred, five hundred years ago and even earlier than that. The place looks like an astonishing formal English garden rather than an agricultural facility, especially as all the labour there is still manual owing to the very intricate and complex relief of the landscape with valleys, hills, and even mountains, small brooks, rivers, an occasional flower oasis, and volcanos at the background. The place is easily accessible from the road, and even before you pay a nominal fee to drive into it and park, you can and should enjoy the breathtaking panorama of the place from the top of the hills that embrase the place.There is a cafe, lavatory facilities, some souvenir shops, and a small bar there, so you can enjoy a light meal or a drink while you are there. The place is mostly disabled-friendly, and you won't have too many problems with a buggy or a wheelchair there though you won't be able to have a long stroll over the fields as they have to accessed via steep but very short staircases and the paths through the fields are proper narrow footpaths and field tracks. Tranquility, natural beauty, and serenity of this place has to be experienced personally as words fail to describe it adequately. It is one of the most stunning sights of Bali."

Take a look if you are in Ubud its only a short drive, but you need to travel for a good couple of hours further north to see the real thing and be really amazed..."

The view is positively stunning. Be warned, the footpath can be steep, narrow, and even slippery so be sure to wear sturdy shoes and be careful if you are a klutz like me."

I was hoping to see the terraces during the rice planting time when water would be flooded into the fields and create beautiful pools od water. That's the time when they are most photogenic. Unfortunately I was in Ubud in November and the weather had been quite dry and the rice had matured. I was still lucky because I arrived there around 3 to 4PM, and the sun had just started to cast beautiful shadows on the terraces. And everywhere looked so green and fresh. So when you go visit, pick the best time of day and I guarantee you would be rewarded with many gorgeous photos. Also the area is very touristy as many reviewers suggest."

The terraces of rice fields that have been cultivated for over 1,000 years are simply one of the most sustainable organic agriculture system around. It is spectacular to look at especially when the rice grains have turned yellow about to be harvested. Plenty of cafes around where you can enjoy a cuppa and taking in the amazing sight. Short walks along the terraces are also possible and well worth a try. It is probably the reason why Indonesia can sustain such a massive population of people despite the corruption and lack of governmental support for the community."

The first time I came, I was bothered by the sellers but this time they were very quiet which made the trip much more enjoyable.I thoroughly enjoyed the very elderly gentleman with his pole and baskets of rice, complete with 'coolie' hat who posed to have his picture taken with everyone...he smiled and said cheese and then put his hand out to be paid for the privilege. My husband offered him a note and he responded by giving it back and taking one half the value. He was delightful.Like most places of interest, there was a fee to pay to be able to view the terraces but it was only about the value of $1...well worth the price."

As we had previously read, you have to pay 5,000 rupiah per person when entering via car - that was fine and we of course paid. We then got to the rice paddies and left our driver so we could walk around for a while. You initially come to a small bamboo bridge which you then have to make a donation when you get to the other side, that's another 5,000 rupiah. Again, we were fine with this. You will see various huts dotted around the rice fields - please be prepared that the people here will demand more donations to allow you to pass. Unfortunately we were met by a very angry man who ended up spitting in our direction when we decided to just walk back on ourselves rather than 'pass' through, with the fear we would just have to pay more! The views are stunning and we were lucky it was quiet and not many tourists but just be wary."

It's less than 30 minutes from Ubud and you can get a cab there, have him wait for you, and then drive you back for about $10 (negotiate price before you leae Ubud). Once there it costs 5,000Ru to go across the bamboo bridge and then another 5,000Ru to climb all the way to the top. For roughly $1 per person it's an incredible value and helps maintain the site for the local farmers to make it both a tourist attraction and a working rice paddy so make sure you don't cheap out, the memories (and photos) are worth it."

I asked her to let me go down first and sit down as i might slip again. I sat near their hut and she took my shoe and socks and washed it. The husband then got a leaf and asked me to put my feet on the leaf so it wont get dirty. He tried to wash my feet and arm with water ( dont know if its clean though) , and even offered me a fruit to eat. Was really grateful for both of them, thinking that really everything happens for a reason, i got to talk to them and asked them about their family,even took their picture. I really love moments wherein i can talk to the locals and just know about their story and background.

I really thought they did all that out of concern, but then again NOT. Or maybe they really needed the money"

When you think of Bali you think of beautiful beaches, amazing cuisine, traditional costumes/dances and of course rice terraces.So many postcards have photos of amazingly beautiful, bright green rice terraces. If you what to witness their true beauty then you must stop at Tegalalang Rice Terraces; they are truly breathtaking.Please note there is a small \"entrance\" fee to the area and traffic can be quite full on. There are a lot of pushy sales people(just remember this is how they make money; so kindly say no thank you an move on)We did not stop for very long as we had two small children; but still worth the stop and we willvisit longer to explore next time."

Visited here as part of a private day tour with Bali Sun Tours (reviewed seperately).It's about an hours drive from Kuta/legian/seminyak area depending on traffic so make a trip of it! There's so many things to see around Ubud.Your driver will just park on the side of the road along many MANY tourist shops with hawkers and wait for you there. From there find a vantage point and take it all in. After the photos have been taken just look for stairs to enter the paddies through one of the cafes. Be aware that it can be deceptive because your doing the easy (downhill) first but remember you'll have to walk back up at the end so take plenty of water, a hat and sunscreen. You will need to pay a donation down in the paddies if you want to walk around so take small notes with you. We put 50k IDR in (5USD). The money allegedly goes towards maintaining the walkways and paths for tourists. There are some really nice spots through the paddies and it was worth the effort to walk though. Many reviewers have complained about the area being too touristy and a tourist trap but what do they expect? Nowadays its a challenge to find anywhere in the world thats amazing AND unspoilt. Sometimes you just have to step back onto the tourist trail and enjoy attractions you cannot find at home. Expect to spend around an hour there if you want to walk through the paddies. A bit longer if you want to have lunch (some nice places overlooking the paddies). Or less of you just want a photo and a look from the top.Enjoy!"

The offer was to give this pretty rude Balinese lady US$50 with a change of 2500 Rupiahs back ... kidding! So we were not allowed to pass. That was a real disappointment. So we walked to a cafe that claimed they served Kopi Luwak. The waiter swore it was the real stuff. It came as water downed bad coffee, nothing Luwak about it. I had and sold Kopi Luwak before, so I know what it's like. Pity Bali has become a tourist trap."

We were asked for a 'donation' at the beginning so handed over 10,000 but then when we got to the top of the other side, another man wanted a 'donation' and when we decided we'd just head back down instead of continuing past his checkpoint he got quite angry and shouted at us as we walked away."

The narrow street is a bottleneck of cars driving in both directions, cars & bikes parked, and shops / visitors along the walkways, so it is not really a quick-stop but it is well-worth the time. I did, cheerfully, feel obliged to do some souvenir / gift shopping there as it is not easy to see to what extent the locals benefit from all the hectic activity on their streets - there is a huge range of patchwork quilts at great prices to choose from, for example.The only negative experience on my last visit was the number and almost-aggressive persistence of young children selling packs of postcards: having a gaggle of kids surround you as you try to navigate the road / path is nerve-wracking."

If you choose to climb down the steps to the bottom of the fields and then climb up to the other side you will be asked to donate some money to locals that block your path. You only need to give them a few rupiah to pass through. I would wear normal shoes as opposed to flip-flops if you do plan on walking through the fields.When you arrived there you will be on a street that runs along the top of one side. You get great views from there and there are quite a few restaurants where you can sit and enjoy the view while having a bite to eat or drink.If you go by motorbike from downtown Ubud the ride will take about 30 mins. There is some traffic jams along the way. If you go by car I would imagine it takes 45 minutes since you have to sit in the jams."

They are a 20 minute or so drive from Ubud, and we booked a taxi for 3 hours so that we could stop and take photos on the way. The terrace itself was smaller than we expected it to be, and unfortunately the terraces were mainly bare as the rice harvest must have just finished. Having said that, the scenery was still really lush and beautiful. We were there from around 8-9am, and at that time the sun is right in your face. The views and quality of photos were much better if you crossed the valley and climbed up to the other side. This took about 10 minutes and was muddy in some areas but well worth it for the views. Afterwards, we visited a nearby place which produces luwak coffee. I cannot remember the name of this place but it was on the opposite side of the road from the main rice terrace. The staff there gave us a tour of grounds, explained how luwak coffee was collected, and let us feed coffee beans to the luwaks. They also showed us trees producing cinnamon bark, cocoa and vanilla pods. We were then taken to a cafe-type area and given samples of teas and coffees. To our surprise there was no charge for these drinks. The views from this place were also beautiful as they looked down over a valley. The 'tour' ends at a shop selling a range of coffee varieties. There was no hard sell. It was a nice place to end our visit to Tegalalang, and quite educational for our children who had never seen where cocoa, vanilla etc came from up close."

They're located about 15-20 minutes by car outside of Ubud, so you'll have to hire a taxi there and back. (Pro tip: make sure your driver waits for you as you explore Tegalalang. I didn't do this, and it was very difficult to find a ride back to Ubud.) The area is rather small, so it won't take you more than 45 minutes or an hour to hike around the rice terraces and take a few photos. Admission is \"donation-based\"; we felt 10000 Rupiah (about 1 USD) for 2 people was an appropriate donation, and the man accepting donations seemed to agree. My only gripe with the rice terraces is that for the trip there and back, which amounts to a total of 30-40 minutes, there's not a whole lot to see in Tegalalang. As I said, it won't take you all that long to hike around the rice paddies, so is it worth the trip? Maybe it'd be better to make this a 30-minute stop on a day trip from Ubud to Kintamani, rather than a stand-alone afternoon trip from Ubud."

All of the rice is hand-planted - imagine how much backbreaking work goes into that.The view depends on the season. Rice is harvested every three months. If you happen to arrive just after harvest, you'll see lots of brown mud instead of the luminous green blades of padi leaves that you expected. Unfortunately, it was also raining when we were there, so there was no chance of walking among the padi.There are also some cafes overlooking the padi fields, so do note that this is an option if you're not in the mood for climbing the terraces.It can get chilly and wet, so bring along a light jacket, and shoes you don't mind getting wet and dirty. Do note that cobras can hang out in padi fields too. They tend to shy away from humans but you should watch your step."

So pretty and magnificent! I expected something similar to the tea or paddy plantations i've seen in Malaysia but this was really something. Some parts have already been harvested but it wasn't bare and brown but still very green! Would recommend to come here before paddy harvesting period because that's when its the prettiest! :) Would definitely come here again :)"

It is all about visiting which rice terrace (Pacung, Tegalalang, Jatiluwih, Tampaksiring, etc) that can give you the maximum pleasure to enjoy the scenic views. I rank Jatiluwih ahead of Tegalalang in 2 simple reasons :a) Jatiluwih allows you to trek the entire valley (as huge as kilometers end to end) whereas Tegalalang is just one small valley (football size).b) View of Jaitluwih has a mountain backdrop and this makes Jatiluwih excellent in photo-taking.Tegalalang is worth visiting as it is strategically located in Ubud, hence for visitors taking a tour to Ubud, it is convenient to stop by as part of the attraction.The plus point is after visiting the rice terrace in Tegalalang, visitors can stop by at \"jalan raya tegalalang\" where you can shop for handicrafts. This is the reason why I return to Tegalalang.I was there at Tegalalang at 3.30pm on 11 July 2014. Not crowded at all. It is worth going. The handicraft shops at Jalanraya Tegalalang is very worth to stop over too."

The drive out was so quiet which in itself was a breath of fresh air. If you're looking for wooden bits and prices, or lead light lamps, there's lots of good shopping on the way and cheaper than in Ubud. 1590 rupiah per car gets you into the gorgeous little valley and the views are terrific. A couple of caf\u00e9s and a few young kids practising their tout skills with postcards - shy and not at all pushy so do be polite with them! I hate seeing tourists being rude to the street sellers - we all need to earn a living and a simple \"no thank you' surely isn't too exhausting. Take a scenic drive back thru the lush hills and quiet little villages and enjoy the gentler pace for a wee while. Well worth the trip from Ubud."

We arrived around mid-afternoon, car parking was at a premium but we did find a spot, then it was quite difficult to walk back up the hill to view the terraces as the \"path\" alongside the road was either non existant, broken up badly or simply blocked, however once able to get a sight of the terraces all that was forgotten. We felt it was too warm to go down the hill to get closer, perhaps we will have to revisit another day!"

Since the paddy was all harvested, there's nothing much to see, but the barren terrace. Anyway, Bali is all covered with paddy fields and terrace, that you don't actually have to visit any specific site to see paddy field or terrace. That long travelling time could very well spent on other interesting activities, like strolling down streets of Seminyak, Kuta and Ubud."

According to the guide, entrance fees goes mostly to the govt and local community. and when the local farmers as you for donations, those money goes directly to them. they're the ones who's truly manning the place as a tourist attraction for tourists like us, so why not give them a small token of appreciation? We donated just RP 10, 000 to each 'donation spot' along the way. Not much of a difference to us, but might be a substantial difference to them. :)for more details with pictures, visit http://molly-mia.blogspot.sg/2014/05/mias-travel-log-bali-day-2.html"

The waitress at the cafe could not wait for us to sit down to take the order - we were intercepted as soon as we walked down the steps. She pushed the menu right into our face and said we had to order first before we are allowed to proceed further. Sigh, what have become of this village and nature?

It was like the other side of Bali besides beaches and beautiful sunset. We did not enjoy our walk in the terrace, since we were all wearing sandals and flip flop, it was really difficult to walk without a pair of sport shoes! Thus, i recommend you to wear old sport shoes when you pay a visit there, you could be more comfortable while walking and you don't have to worry about your shoes getting dirty! While you follow the path, you will discover several \"donation spots\", locals would stand there asking for donation, we did pay a small amount when we encounter the first booth, and didnt donate afterwards, some locals would still let you pass through. One more thing to note is that when our driver arrived the \"entrance\" of the rice terrace, there were (securities?) asking us to pay for rp20000 entrance fee, which was not really expensive, and reasonable for parking! Anyway, it is a good attraction to enjoy another type of beauty of Bali!"

Mainly because it is the man's first trip to bali, and also because he is a nature buff. So i knew this would be of interest. I have seen countless pictures of the rice terrace while doing my research...and really...you gotta see it in person. AMAZING. We hired a driver for a day, one that came highly rated on tripadvisor, and well lets just say...he must either give caucasians a better service OR we were just unlucky. He wasn't that great...and he definitely took us to places where he gets a commission (which other tripadvisor posters have said he doesn't). But this review isn't about the driver but about the rice terrace and kintamani. We got to the rice terrace at about 9.30am...stunning. It was not flooded with tourist and we did not need to fight for a birds eye view. The place is so peaceful, the view was breathtaking. Tip: Give the restaurants facing the rice padi a miss....very expensive..you are just paying for the view."

You choose to go down the rice field and actually \"get into\" the picture, but roads down can be muddy and slippery so be careful if you do so. However, the vendors (Cafes, restaurants, souvenir shops, random kiosks) are super pricey and can be quite pushy. Whatever you decide to do, unless you're gonna spend lunch there I higly recommend to skip your purchase there."

There are still plenty of opportunities to purchase goods from the local stores and there are a myriad of restaurants with million dollar views to eat your lunch.A recommendation is to head back to Ubud via Tegalalang and Mas villages to see the local crafts and handiwork.Highly recommended if in Bali"

Up to the terraces the roads were lined with small shops specializing in wood sculptures, glass sculptures and hand woven products. On the street above the rice terraces was a small street also lined with restaurants and shops where you can buy souvenirs, hats, shirts, etc. don't be afraid to haggle prices! From the street you can take some great pictures of the green terraces below. We went after harvest so the crops were just planted. Locals said that it looks more beautiful when the rice is matured but seeing all the terracing and the traditional irrigation system that they employ might not be as clearly seen with matured rice. All in all a place definitely worth visiting!"

Perhaps it goes to the maintenance of the little tourist huts that line the facing slope where one can chill and just spend the day watching the farmers go about their business..

The rice terraces are located below the road level but there are steps leading down to the paddy fields for those who want to see the fields up close. Photo opportunities abound and we even had a chance to take pictures with a rice farmer complete with his grass hat and baskets. Do give the locals a small tip if you wish to take photos with them. There are some restaurants with views overlooking the rice terraces but we did not visit them. Plenty of small kids trying to sell you trinkets and postcards but they were not particularly pushy. These kids were just trying to supplement their family's income by selling stuff to tourists. This place is definitely a must-go only to see the magnificent rice fields and the rural beauty of Bali."

The walk is not easy, and I fell twice. My spouse took only one tumble. I eventually took off my footwear, and went barefoot, which was much easier! One warning - if you have a fear of heights, there are a couple of fearful places, But I managed, even with some vertigo. Prepare to get a bit dirty, and to trip a few times. That being said, the bruises were so worth it. The Balinese people who work in the fields are so friendly and pleasant. We also hiked up to the Temple within the fields. I cannot express just how beautiful it is. A little slice of real Balinese life. One last reminder, all those stairs and hills that you go down, will be waiting for you on the way back up!

The terrace are on one side of the road, on the other side of the hill. There are heaps of shops, all selling the same souvenirs. he view is nice, but because it's a so touristic place, it's just over crowed! And We are not sure they still use these terraces for growing rice, we had the feeling they just keep them for tourists to go, pay, have a quick look and that's it. It's definitely something to avoid, especially because there are so many and better rice fields all around Bali that it's really stupid going there and paying to see something that it's everywhere else and free. For example, we've been driving from Semyniak to Tulamben and unexpectedly we passed through this amazing and huge rice cultivation, without paying for any fee and without being in the middle of the most crowed part of Bali!We also had amazing rice fields just outside our hotel in Ubud, so have a look on internet and look for the closest rice fields or the one that you can see driving around the island!"

The road is narrow and crowded with many drivers waiting for the tourist beside the road. But no worries, you can park a little bit far and walk back to this place"

Ticket vendors would sell tickets through car windows and that somewhat cleared the traffic uphill a bit.As soon as we arrived, we saw that all the action was down the valley. So we went down some steps, found a shop, extricated ourselves away from the persistent shopkeeper, landed on the entrance to an eatery with private verandahs, and finally saw the paddy in all its majesty.Just one word should suffice. WOW!We quickly took all the pictures we wanted and then wound down at that hillside bar. We ate ice-cream and drank coconut juice. For some reason the menu was also in Japanese. We did see a lot of Chinese-looking tourists, just that we couldn't be sure of which country they were from. The menu clued us in. There were toilets and a praying room for Muslims. We could see some visitors actually going down to the paddy fields themselves for a true hands-on, or rather, feet-on experience. Earlier on we actually sat at one of the verandahs on a nice sofa for picture-taking and to tell you the truth there was nowhere better to be at that moment than that very spot. For the first time we weren't bothered about what time it was, what could be selling at the shops and what else was there to see. Honestly, we never wanted to leave.Truly words could not describe what we saw and we shall never forget it. Thank you Bali for giving us one of the best times of our lives!"

So instead we sat and had tea at the restaurant overlooking the rice terraces and asked them to dance some of their local dances for us. They were so adorably cute and were happy to dance for us.

We lucked out and even though the workers were bundling the rice stalks there was still plenty of lush greenery. It is picture worthy and breathtaking. I chose to ignore the shopkeepers who were interested in selling their goods but they were nice and not bothersome. On the way back we topped at an Eco-agriculture place that featured tea and coffee as well as spices grown in this region. It was quite interesting and - free!

Me and my friend decide to go to this place to enjoy its beauty and take a breathtaking picture of the nature. After almost 8 km drive from Ubud (just drive straight , following the main road from ubud to tegal alang (take a left turn from Arjuna statue in Ubud)) we finally saw the sign of 'welcome to Ceking-Tegal Alang rice terrace view, about 1-2 min drive we found some local administrator who collected the fee 1 pax Rp.5000,.We then have to found a place to parked our motorbike, as it was sunday and many visitors, and this place has no special parking lot due to its location (hills). We then found a place to parked our motorbike, take a little walk to the observatory bridge, then take a picture, the observatory bridge is less than 500 metres i guess. Yes, there is many cafes, and art shops, but you can always find a nice spot to view and enjoy the magnificient beauty of nature, or take a picture. From my experiences the sellers is not pushy like you might find in some other places in Bali. The minus so far for me its the parking lot, but then due to its location its quite hard to build decent parking lot.If you happen to be here from your trip to Kintamani or Ubud, spent arround 30 minutes to enjoy the magical scenary, dont forget your Camera, this is the view you will regret to not capture before back to your country."

We also noticed that most people stopped at the beginning where all the shops and vendors were, without really seeing the real views much further in. We hiked all the way down and to the far back fields; we were the only ones there, balanced on the edge of tiers of tiers of magnificent, dazzling green! And yes, to go back a little farther they request a donation/fee- but all together it's still less than a dollar. (perspective) If you really want it to yourself, trek it while it's raining. Word of warning though- all the trails become a great series of mudslides. I slipped once and got quite a slide ride. I hauled myself up, covered almost head to toe in mud, not able to stop laughing.

I had heard that the Balinese were a gentle people and I have travelled all over S.E.Asia but never have I met with such agression and frankly it was quite off putting.

There are some souvenir shops outside the rice fields which you could buy beautiful souvenirs at great prices, but please remember to exercise your great bargaining skills (ask for 50% off from what they quote)!"

This is an amazing look at how the rice terraces are created with their irrigation systems and winding areas. TIP: be sure to wear decent shoes and be ready for a little workout.

The Tegallalang rice terraces are nice nevertheless but this technic of rice cultivation by cutting, shaping and making plain-land strips in the slopes of hills is not unique to Bali! Even the hill people of hilly districts in Bangladesh have similar technic of rice cultivation (locally called Joom cultivation). Anyway, visiting Tegallalang Rice Terraces is worth if someone is visiting Ubud or passing through Ubud! We stopped there for half an hour on our way to Kintamani (Mount Batur) from Jimbaran. We cherished that time and enjoyed the greenery of the rice terraces sloping downhill and having plenty of coconut trees and other trees as well at different layers of the terraces. But again, probably we wouldn't have liked it that much had we put all that effort to see the rice terraces alone!"

The aspect that distinguishes this attraction from other rice fields is the ability to walk down and see the rice fields close up. The terraces are interesting to look at, but you can't help feel this has been commercialised and the effect somewhat spoilt. On the other side of the road is a long row of shops selling food and souvenirs. You also have to pay for going through this area (Rp 5000 per person). When we went in the afternoon, it was also quite crowded, so I wouldn't recommend going here if you don't like crowds and traffic jams.If you're passing through the area (e.g. on the way back to Ubud from Sebatu), it might be worthwhile dropping in. Otherwise, if you are going to eastern Bali, you can see lots of examples of interesting rice fields on a journey from Tirtagangga to Klungkung via Sibetan and Sidemen (albeit at more of a distance than you can at Tegallalang). The examples on this road seem much more genuine and give a better idea of the \"real\" Bali. On a smaller scale, drop in to Boni Bali in Sebatu and have lunch overlooking rice terraces."

You can walk down all the way into the fields and then cross over onto the other side. Its a nice walk down through the terraces and although it might take a while figuring out the way down, once you get used to it , it can be quite fun. There was a local offering to give his rice basket for a picture at a price but we didn't give it a try :)There are cafes at the top with great views of the terraces and you can sit here and enjoy the views if you dont want to walk down.

They probably thought he was a local who just happened to have finished work. :)Some walked further down to the terraces to take pics and if we had done that, I guess it would have been lovelier but we were keen to take our pics and move on as it was so crowded.As I had thought it would be miles and miles of these terraces in a natural setting, rather than a designated spot that tourists (millions of us - I exaggerate but it was hard not to get people in the background when taking pics) were given, I was disappointed. Anyway, maybe next time we will go to Jatihluwih but perhaps that is also similar to Tegallang. The paddy excursion/walk that our hotel had taken us on was a lot more natural and peaceful than this."

I believe they use the picture of a rice terrace which looks very beautiful. 99% of those beautiful pictures were taken in Tegalalang Rice Terrace. Me as a local people in this area still love to spend some times to see the beautiful nature art created by the farmers. It seems that the farmers have counted very well the proportion of the rice terrace so that will look good from other standing point. If you are a photographer, this is a truly great spot for your journey."

Took a couple pictures then pretty much spent 3 times more time haggling with the store we were standing at over a little dress for my daughter. If it's not along the way, probably not worth the trip. But if you're close by, it's worth the stop but it will be a quick stop."

It is definitely an impressive sight to behold, although there isn't much here to warrant staying longer unless you wish to eat with a view, or look in shops that are typical of many places in this part of Bali. It was a bit of a surprise that they charged an entry fee - although it was peanuts - 1000 rupiah per person. On the whole, rice terraces are a typical feature of Balinese landscapes and can be seen at other attractions such as Gunung Kawi. If it will be your first time to see something like this, it can be worth a look. Beware the traffic which is wild and wooly like any major tourist spot in Bali.s"

But always beware of the seller around the area, only ask the price is you really wish to buy, or else they will push you to buy something even you not wish to. We really annoyed with the seller that kept pushing to buy something from them. (no wonder at first they seem to be so nice help us captured our photo together.)"

They were the most spectacular place we saw while in Bali. It was like viewing a piece of living modern art. It is amazing that they are not only beautiful, but also functional. The Balinese have been farming on these rice terraces for hundreds of years. Please do not miss these terraces if you travel to Bali. They are unforgettable and mesmerizing."

I was impressed with the beauty, a bit disturbed by all the tourist excesses, and also left with the impression that it was the only \"iconic\" rice field in Bali. Now that I live here I have seen many more beautiful rice field areas far removed from the tourist circuit. If you have the chance to get out on your own I would encourage you to explore Bali and get away from the tourist areas, otherwise you will be overwhelmed with the excesses of tourist mania that plagues much of the more popular areas of Bali. However, if this is the one chance to see an iconic rice field then I would not want to discourage you from going, it is spectacularly beautiful. However, instead of looking at all the tourist trinkets for sale everywhere on the road, instead look for someone who will be willing to take you on a walk down into the rice field. You would offer him a nominal fee. (Bargain if it seems extreme the amount he asks for, but remember that this is the money he earns to help take care of his family, so don't be stingy either.) You will enjoy taking that memory of your walk home far more than a trinket that will most likely end up in a future garage sale, or even worse on the rubbish heap. This is a great place to bring inquisitive children and they will enjoy their time immensely exploring the intricate environment of a rice field. Enjoy!"

I've been to Tegallalang before - back in 2008 when we barely stopped long enough to take a photo before I was hounded by locals to buy something, and the tour guide hurried me back to the safety of the car. IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT NOW! It's true that it's changed enormously. The rice terraces are still breathtaking, but the locals who have set up their shops have also set up little cafes for us to take refreshments in. If you didn't read trip advisor, you really wouldn't know they were there. The locals are far more friendly now and apart from encouraging you to come closer to look at their wares, they don't accost you anymore. And because of that, I was more than happy to go closer, and i did end up making a purchase. But what was the highlight, was being able to venture down some stairs, and find little open air huts to sit in and order our favourite drink/food. I had my standard watermelon juice, and my husband order Luwak Coffee - a delicacy he said (I'm scoffing - so read up on it before you go). We sat there for ages, taking in the view, marvelling at it's beauty and enjoying the break. We actually did a cafe-crawl, and moved to the next one for lunch (the biggest one) and then the last one for another drink before we left. We got photos from all angles then. Then we got back on our motorbikes and drove back to Ubud. This in itself was a hoot as we had no real idea how to get there, we just kept asking locals, and they kept pointing us in the right direction. The Balinese really are lovely people. If you go by car, you have to pay per person to stop there, but it's some piddly amount which is barely worth worrying about. Hope you enjoy it, and do buy something, these people actually rely on visitors to feed their families. :) Enjoy."

I'd advice you to take your time in one of the villages around Ubud. To get out of the car, walk around, breathe the air, hear the sounds of the birds and watch the farmers o about their business. Try to go at the end of the day. The villages of Bali come alive with people living their every day life coming out after the heat.

Very few of the cafes that are on the rice paddy view side are open past 5pm either so we couldn't have an early dinner. We did sit down at a local cafe and had some refreshments before heading back home. It wasn't until later in our trip that there are more charming and better rice terraces near our accommodation down in Canggu that I wished I had known about earlier. If you don't have much time and you're making up trip up to Ubud or to Gunung Kintamani then this is a great stop. It's basically a 15 min stop at most."

We were rather surprised coz they actually shouted the converted the cost of their items to singapore dollars/malaysian ringgit! And when I replied politely we were not keen on any, a seller snapped in his language, \"Come on, it's just one dollar! not even enough for your coffee back home!\" I just smiled and walked away quickly. There are plenty of shops on the strips of the road. Saunter along and you can find really good stuffs. I bought a hot pink sun hat for only S$2.50! My friends and I managed to sit outdoors and drink bottled Teh Sosro from a tiny shop, overlooking the stunning view, just basking in the ambience.

After dessert, there was even a Balinese lady who came and sold us durian - yummy (if you like durian that is). Enjoying the food and the view was just half of the adventure though - after a good meal we actually walked down and took a walk through the rice fields - this was the highlight of our afternoon. Coming by for a few minutes to take a picture of the view is simply not enough in my opinion.

For the reasonable cost of a drink, you can take your photos in peace, from what must be one of the best spots in town, and even take a few steps into the paddies if you wish. We did not sample the food due to the time of day. The kitchen and menu look simple and straightforward with reasonable prices. Others eating there expressed great satisfaction with the food."

It is very beautiful and impressive - you can take photos by the road.There are many vendors, but really, they didn't bother me. As soon as I said 'no thanks' they left me alone. Yes you have to ignore them to a certain degree.I'm glad we visited the area. The drive there is pretty as well, ask your driver to take the back roads where you will see the real compounds and more normal rice paddies."

These terraces are beautiful and it is well worth the visit. The downside is being harassed by the locals wanting you to buy their stuff. The locals were very pushy, much pushier than other areas we visited in Bali. There were even children selling postcards and one told me he can not go to school unless I buy postcards from him (did not work on me!). Once we got passed the small shops and cafes we were left alone.I think the locals add to it and it is a poor country and these people make their money from us tourists.We had lunch at a small cafe overlooking the terraces, this cafe was called Alon Alon. The food was pretty average but having the view of the terraces from your own little covered 'hut' allowed you to take in the area for a bit longer. They also had clean toilets which was a plus in an area like this. Worth the visit for sure!"

There's also an outdoor cafe where you can look at the surrounding views while sipping a cup of coffee or tea. The cafe was packed when I went there and unfortunately it rained, so I didn't get a chance to stay a little longer"

This is ok enough if you are on a day long sightseeing trip and Tegallalang is on the way. Good for a 2 min stop. It overlooks a 300 mt long patch of rice terrace. Hawkers hound you constantly throughout so you cant enjoy the stop in peace. Not worth going out of the way...and rest assured if you driving down to Kintamani etc, you will get to see lots of rice fields n terraces along the way."

Rice fields never seems to get borring and after seeing many of them here on Bali I still love to see more. The Tegallalang Rice Fields are definitely one of the best rice fields on Bali. The way these rice fields clime up to the mountain is breathtaking. It is perfect for a quick stop as you can not really walk through the fields and you can only watch them from one spot close to the road. The vendors of course try to sell you all sorts of nonsense, but you can just ignore them. You cannot miss these rice fields when you are in Bali."

It's truly gorgeous. i was disappointed you couldn't walk into the area, but it must be someone's rice field farm and private property which is fine. As soon as we got out of the van we were swarmed by locals to buy post cards and batik sarongs. They would never leave us alone. This has never happened to me in Ubud after 3 visits."

            "review": "Not impressive enough. On our way up to Mount Batur, we stopped for 15 at the side of Tegalalang (not Tegallalang). The terraced field can be seen just beside the road. However, tall coconut trees planted beside the field flawed the good view. The information we had stating Tegalalang is 500 m above sea level, which cannot be linked to the hot and sweaty weather we experienced there (suppost to be colder, right?). The farmers just finished harvesting, leaving behind brown and muddy field by the time we visit the field. The view would be better one month earlier when the paddy just turned into golden in colour and about to be harvested.Our advice, stop there for a while is ok, but it's not worth to have a lunch or dinner there. Mount Batur is the place that we should stop for a longer time to take a break.

Batur volcano, our guide took us to the rice paddy fields which you can always imagine but is far more impressive in real life. To see the countryside carved into terraces is very impressive.Next to the terraces is a pretty waterfall which was quite weak during the time (dry season) and alongside are the houses of the village which are held up on what seem like very feeble sticks. As this is a well-trodden tourist path, we were harassed by many villagers trying to sell us souvenirs and even constant 'No thanks', shaking heads and simply ignoring them weren't enough to put them off so you should be prepared to tolerate them until you get back into your car.Other than that, everything added to the overall experience of the village and it is this that I am recommending people."
