The palace differs from many others in that sense that the interior is renovated with furniture etc. to resemble as much as possible it`s interior in the 18th and 19th centuries. And this makes it far more interesting than average old royal palaces in Europe.The gardens are great and the fountains are the top attraction there.Best in a warm beautiful summer day and coming with a hydrofoil vessel from the centre of StP."

It is situated at the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, demonstrating Peter's desire to have access to the Baltic for Russia. The gardens are immense and beautiful, but the real attraction is the set of fountains. These follow the original design of Peter, and the basic mechanisms have not been changed for over 300 years! When they are started, the theme music for St. Petersburg is played over loudspeakers, and the entire production is quite amazing."

Guide was very good but you could not take any photos anywhere inside of the palace buildings. The tour was very fast paced with timers in the rooms to keep you walking through and guards urging you along. Very narrow roped off areas to walk through so there was no stopping and enjoying the exhibits and preserved areas. The Hermitage and Catherine's Palace are much better, but, if you have time, this is worth a trip. Outside gardens and statues are magnificent."

Peterhof is divided in two parks or gardens with a number of palaces and fountains. There are plenty of descriptions of this amazing place, I just want to give some advices:- visiting the Peterhof should be given a whole day and besides it should be a clear sunny day;- you should take some food and water with you, because prices inside are quite high;- the best and cheapest way to get there - by microbus from metro stations eigher \u00ab\u0411\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\u00bb - \u2116 404 or \u00ab\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u0412\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u00bb \u2116 343, \u2116 639-\u0431 or \u00ab\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u00bb \u2116 224, \u2116 300, \u2116404, \u2116424, \u2116 424-\u0410. It will cost about 70-80 rubles;- the ceremonial opening of the fountains in 11 hours;- there are a lot of jocular fountains, running under which you get wet, so don`t forget to take a change of clothes for children.That`s all. Hope it`ll help you. And, in my opinion Peterhof is absolutely fantastic place which you obligatorily must to see))"

Originally laid out by Peter the Great, making use of the natural slope of the land to incorporate abundant fountains. Many of the fountains include gold plated figures or motifs. The figure of Samson slaying the lion (representing Russia Defeating Sweden) is a highlight. The gardens and palace badly damaged by the Nazis during the Second World War. The garden also includes a small palace, Mon Plasir, which was the home of Peter the Great. Later Catherine the Great was incarcerated here, before she and her lover rode off to the Capital, killer her husband the Czar, and assumed a very long and fruitful role as the Czarina."

We were here during the summer in a particulary nice sunny week, so this place was just spectacular and we were even feeling like the approx 3 hour visit that had be arranged as a part of the tour was not enough to enjoy this place, we knew what kind of place it was but really if you can go from one garden to another, then relax at some spots, walk a little more, stop at a fountain, admire the views, take tons of photos and walk some more get into the crowded areas or away from them as you wish... time really goes by and you just dont seem to notice because it is so nice to be here! there are restrooms, with long lines but they move fast so you do not wait in a queue for long....there are some dressed up people by the big fountains offering to take a photo with you, which they quickly print right away and it turns out pretty good, and it is cheap I think 5 euros, And really neat if you want a quick souvenir...but they too let you take pics with your camera if you want...we were there in the afternoon and it was perfect cause it wasnt too hot. beautiful and worth a not so short visit."

This was my second visit to Peterhof and I was lucky enough to arrive at 11 am- just when they turn the fountains on as the anthem of St Petersburg is played. I visited 3 years ago but I think this visit had even more tourists than previously. The line was long but having a private guide got our group of 4 through quickly. The tour through the Palace is regulated but very tightly packed! Afterwards, the stroll through the lower gardens was much more pleasant and the beauty unbelievable. Well worth the crowds and plan to spend 2 hours to thoroughly enjoy it."

At precisely 11:00 AM each day the fountains are turned on to the accompaniment of grand music. Find yourself a good location above or below to take photos. Afterwards, stroll the extensive landscaped gardens. The palace and grounds were designed by Peter The Great after a visit to Versailles in France. I guess he didn't want to be outdone. The gardens sit on the edge of the Gulf of Finland providing spectacular views. You can get a ticket to include the palace and grounds, or for the grounds only. Expect to spend most of the day if you plan to do both."

Wow, first saw the amazing sight of these spectacular fountains and gardens from the air as we were flying in from Helsinki....what a sight....nearly fell out of the plane with excitement! We already had prepurchased our entry tickets and hydrofoil...so was well and truly anticipating the experience.....and it didn't disappoint. The hydrofoil is definitely the way to go and an interesting quick trip up the River Neva. Unfortunately it was raining the day we went, but we had taken raincoats and umbrella with us and a plastic bag just for the camera (the stalls @ Peterhof charge inflated prices for these essential items apparently it rains regularly....hence the availability of water for the fountains). On arrival, there is a short walk up from the pier to the lower gardens.....didn't seem to be much of a queue, but we went straight through with our tickets. Important tip.....the upper gardens don't have an entrance fee but if you leave the lower gardens and go to return from upper to lower, you will need to pay for your tickets again! No pass outs at all, we looked over the barrier at the upper ones and decided the lower ones were much preferable anyway. Another tip.....if you can manage the timing.....get there before 11am so you can get some photos of the fountains before they are switched on and enjoy the classical music and show of the water trickling in and up, then obviously, the photos with all the fountains flowing freely.....spectacular. We chose not to go into the Palace as we were going to Catherine and Pavlovsk Palaces later in the week....wise decision, we ran into another couple who had done this palace too and they said there was a sameness to them....whereas when we went to the other palaces, it was all a fresh new experience. There really aren't enough superlatives to describe this place.....not to be missed...even in the rain!"

            "review": "Breathtaking Fountains and Gardens. During the summer season, Peterhof was somewhat of a mixed bag of goods. Getting there from St. Petersburg was exceptionally easy via the hydrofoil boats that leave regularly from a dock just outside the Winter Palace on the Neva. The boats are quite comfortable and make the trip along the Gulf of Finland in about 45 mins or less. Once off the boat, that's where things get dicey. The ticket kiosks are located in the absolute worst place for the hoards of people coming off the boats from the city. Whomever planned this should be shot. Once you've dealt with that and make your exit from the dock area, you are treated to an impressive view of the palace along the arm of water that connects to the fountains. To either side there are expansive and lovely gardens and parks with tree-lined walking paths and small fountains. Once you get up to the palace itself, you get the full effect of the magnificent golden fountains and the expanse of the palace itself. You really could spend most for your day just taking this all in and enjoying the parks and gardens without ever setting foot inside the palace museum. The queues are huge and entry into the various segments of the palace museum can be confusing. The tour of the interior rooms was lackluster. Our visit was on a warm (though not hot) day in August, and the crowds were oppressive, almost beyond belief and endurance. And there is no AC inside the palace, which all made for an incredibly uncomfortable experience (we couldn't wait to get outside for air). Perhaps off season it is much more manageable as far as the crowds go, but during high season, it is not fun. However, and in spite of the crowds, the fountains alone really are worth the trip, and the parks and gardens and views are simply stunning. It was very sad to see from photographs how badly Peterhof was damaged during the war. A great many things, including palace furnishings and the fountain statues, were taken away at the start of the war to save them, but the palace itself and grounds were virtually destroyed--only the shell of the palace was left standing, so that virtually everything you see has been rebuilt and/or restored. But what an incredible restoration to its former glory it is, and all things considered (which is a lot), it is an amazing sight and worth every effort to get to and see."

We had a private guide to show us around, which was nice, because getting there and finding your way around would be difficult without a plan of Peterhof, which we did not have. The palace is very pretty, kind of a slightly smaller version of Catherine's palace in Pushkin, and the fountains are marvelous. The grounds are expansive, with plenty of other things to see.

We booked a 2 day tour of St Petersburg with Best Guides as Russia has changed their entry requirements and all tourists must now apply for a visa or book a guided tour. We opted for the tour and enjoyed every minute of it. We could never have seen all that we did on our own agenda. Peterhof was my main goal and we travelled there by hydrofoil after a tour of the city. Speeding down the River Neva, which is extraordinarily wide and arriving by water was great. It was remarkable to arrive just in time for the waterfalls to start with the operatic music. Then we did a tour of St. Peter the Great's private cottage which we chose from 3 options. Our guide Elena was a veritable encyclopaedia of facts, information and appreciation of art. We were ushered in to all the museums on an early pass to miss the crowds and crammed as much as possible into the time we spent at each place. After a lovely lunch we went onto Catherine's Palace in Pushkin. The next day was an exhausting day through the Hermitage, Church of the Spilled Blood, a very interesting ride on the metro and visiting the markets and a boat ride on the Neva. There is so much history and places to visit that I feel we need a second visit to truly appreciate this city."

A massive park with more than 150 fountains (some form large groups), the Grand Palace with a few smaller interesting buildings, canals and artificial lakes must be seen between late in May and end of September when the fountains are working. The sight not to be missed is the daily ceremony of starting the Grand Cascade and the Samson fountain at 11.00. There is sort of an open car trip arouns the park which lasts 40 minutes but the commentary is in Russian only, so I would suggest reading about the sights on their website first. Allow at least 4 hours, but there is enough to do if you want to stay longer. There is a decent restaurant/cafe, though quite pricey."

I was with a tour group, had a long wait to get inside of the palace, and once everyone was herded inside, we were all taken from room to room, not allowed to take any pictures. We just walked through fairly quickly because there were so many other tour groups waiting to get through. The rooms were beautifully decorated, but I thought Catherine's palace was much nicer, and you were allowed to take pictures there. If I were to do it over again, I would skip the tour of Peter's palace, maybe just take a walk around the gardens which you can do with one of those tours that just takes you around to highlighted areas and stops long enough for everyone to take pictures."

            "review": "It's about the Gardens!. We took a full day tour (9 hours) that included the Peterhof and Catherine's Palace/Pushkin. Between the two, the actual palace at Catherine's Palace was more impressive and bigger than Peterhof. However, the gardens at the Peterhof are just spectacular. I've visited Versailles a number of times and it's to that palace that the Peterhof often is compared. While Versailles' gardens may be bigger, the ones at the Peterhof, in my opinion, were not only better preserved but are just more stunning and grand. The centerpiece of this, without a doubt, is the jaw dropping serious of fountains at the staircase around the palace's back. You may have seen the pictures, but it's all that more incredible in person. I remember when I first saw the Eiffel Tower, I was so taken aback by how much bigger it was than what I imagined it to be; this is the same impression I got when seeing the grand fountains at the Peterhof staircase. I could have easily stood there for an hour and just observed and not be bored for a minute. The gardens also have a manicured French section and a more rambling English section, both with different fountains all around. We walked all the way back to the Monplaisir cottage (which we did not enter), on the Gulf of Finland, and were able to get a distant view of Kronstadt and St. Petersburg itself. We also had lunch at a restaurant nearby, very much in the woods on what appears to be palace grounds but you really have to look for it. It was touristy, definitely geared for tour groups, but it was actually good. By the way, there are two gardens at the Peterhof. The one I've been writing about is the lower garden. Beside the gardens and fountains, there's a large canal that runs from the palace all the way to the Gulf of Finland. Per our tour guide, this was the way to arrive at the Palace if you came by boat. What a welcome!! The upper gardens, while beautiful as well, were at the front entrance when arrival was by coach. Peterhof is definitely a must while in St. Petersburg but if you have limited time, make sure you at least visit the lower gardens (oh, and grand fountains do not function during winter and other cold times of the year so check the schedule). A beautiful tour."

They use gravity to make the flow. The Peterhof sits on the Gulf of Finland and was Peters summer home. It is filled gilded rooms, Chinese cabinets, and wonderful parquet floors. But really the outstanding thing for me was the myriad of fountains that dot the grounds. we hired a private car and guide who was able to get us into the palace before it opened. We were done touring and outside on the grounds before the busses arrived. Well worth the extra money. The fountains are turned off in the late fall..so be careful of your visit dates"

This is a must for anyone visiting St. Petersburg as it gives you a feel for the countryside and then palatial grandeur of Tzarist times. The Peterhof Palace is on the banks of the Bay of Finland and hides in the forest until you are adjacent to it when all its spledour is revealed. TRAVEL TIP - visit it by coach on the outward journey and return via the Peterhof Express hydrofoil for a journey to remember up the Neva River to the Palace Square. Inside the Palace, is a maze of beautiful gold gilt rooms in honour of Peter and Catherine. There is a set tour which speeds you through at haste !!! You will be expected to hand in rucksacks, outdoor coats, umbrellas and made to wear overslips on your shoes to preserve the parquee flooring. The manicured gardens are a joy to behold with paths, fountains, water features and a central canal that leads to the hydrofoil pier.....a motor train is available if you do not to walk. TOP TIP...the main cascade fountains do not get switched on until 11.00am so get there by 10.45 to get a great view. Peterhof Palace is a very popular place to visit with thousands of visitors daily but it is so well appointed that at times you can feel as if you are there on your own. Facinating."

It is a campus of palaces, museums, secondary buildings, gardens, walks, fountains and more, located about an hour outside of central Saint Petersburg. The gardens are much more formal than those at Catherine's Palace and they are populated by fountains of two basic types - regular decorative fountains of the kind with which we are all familiar (although these are on a grand scale) and \"trick\" fountains which do not appear to be fountains but are designed to catch the guest unawares and soak him (such as when you approach a particular bench in a glade). Peter the Great must have had an interesting sense of humor. The grounds are extensive and beautiful. We did not do the main palace but did the grounds and gardens, the bath block (with an amazing shower) and the Hermitage (with an ascending and descending table - worth a visit) and that took us three hours. Each palace or attraction is priced separately; there does not appear to be a \"all-included combination ticket.\" The Museum's website (in both Russian and English) gives detailed information on the nature and price of each palace or attraction."

No photos as that will slow you down, no lingering in rooms between the main attractions as that will slow you down, etc. Hence, the interior was not as enjoyable as I would have liked. Having said this, despite a rainy day, the gardens, especially the fountains, are magnificent and you have as much time there as you like.

I concentrated on the Palace as I was on a tour - my son and his family toured the gardens a couple of days later and we compared notes. It would seem to me to be worth taking extra time and doing both! I do feel I missed out on the gardens. TripAdvisor has so many photos as well as there being umpteen books available that I would also recommend you save time and photograph only where you are including people or something you see that is particularly quirky. Unless you are a keen photographer you will probably be satisfied with the plethora of images of the Palace and Gardens which are on line. Another thing you could do to save a little time is to avoid the cafes at the end of the canal. They clearly don't care for repeat business and I'd say it's just as well as I'd never eat there again! 3rd rate food, surly staff and crazy prices. But do go! It is truly wonderful!"

The museum itself is gorgeous but the best, in my opinion, are the gardens, the fountains, and everything outside. It's fun to find the hidden fountains and get unexpectedly wet!"

As expected, the palace was incredibly large and stunning. The wealth of the former Russian Czar regimes were on show for all to see. We ventured through the extensive gardens and fountain areas to the lake, and were on site for the 11.00 am display at the main fountain area adjoining the palace.This attraction is hugely popular with many thousands of people visiting from cruise ships and the like. You need to put up with huge crowds, but it is a must see if you are visiting St Petersburg."

The palace is what you would expect of its era, sumptuous rooms, beautiful furniture, furnishings and all the decoration to match. On the downside there was a long queue to get into the palace (after acquiring tickets at the entrance) and the visit itself was rushed. First you go to a cloakroom to deposit coats, then a second to deposit bags, then you line up again to get shoe covers. The tour (we were with an experienced guide) was rushed - we were told by the guide that she had had complaint made by the Peterhof to her employer for talking too slowly on her previous visit. At the end of the tour we had again to queue up twice at the cloakrooms and, as there is no exit beyond the cloakrooms, double back and edge through crowds coming through the cloakrooms to exit. The gardens were very disappointing, There are a lot of fountains and gilded statutory near to the palace and other fountains throughout what was more managed light woodland than gardens, I expected gardens similar to the Hapsburg palaces or even French chateau but the gardens here are nothing like those."

The palace is stunning inside and out and although partially destroyed during the WW2 it has been faithfully restored and hard to see where unless pointed out to you. No photos allowed inside because of inconsiderate tourists from one particular country taking too many and holding other tours up. No problems outside in the grounds taking photos and there are plenty of photo opportunities from the palace to the many beautiful fountains and shaded walkways. Be aware that pickpockets operate here and lay traps for the unsuspecting tourists. I myself was nearly caught out, having spotted a Hundred dollar bill lying on the grass I picked it up in one fluid movement and moved on quickly only to discover it was a poor fake.

You want a ticket to go somewhere, and they will buy the ticket, then sell it to you for 10x more than if you just went and got it yourself. Also, they will tell you places are open ONLY when they have a tour guide available to take you, not the actual hours of museums. Do your own research. The fountain at Peterhof is one of the nicest, if not the nicest that I have ever seen in my life. Gold everywhere, and just HUGE! The grounds are really nice to walk around when the weather is good. The museum itself shows incredible grandness, like I witnessed at the Palace of Versailles in Paris. The museum is over the top on security though, to the point of making the experience annoying. Every single room has motion sensors that are going off constantly if somebody gets to close to a rope, etc. There were two kind of crazy old ladies that made it their mission to not let anybody stop in their room. They would approach you and say, \"Very valuable! Do not stop! Walk slowly, without stopping, and see very quickly.\" There was nobody behind my brother and I so we paused a second to look at items in the room, they would come up and say, \"No! Do not stop! Keep walking!\" I was like, \"We paid money to come across the world to here, nobody is being help up here, leave us alone.\" The rest of our trip, at any other places (and none of them had crazies like that working) we would joke whenever the other stopped walking. \"Don't stop! Keep walking! Very valuable.\" It is like the Spinal Tap movie, \"Don't even look at it! You might scratch it!\" Anyways, we took bus 404 from in front of Baltiskiy Metro Station to go there. Coming back, you can get on any bus and it takes you back to the metro. I think it was 70 rubles to go, but for some reason we paid double coming back. Not sure why..."

But how the over crowding (which seems linked with the horrors of officious gallery attendants) impacted on safety, let alone enjoyment. Once again, huge parties from cruise ships posed problems, some even trying to jump the line for entry to the house (hey guys, I'm a Brit and they didn't get away with it). They also saw fit to annexe the lavatory facilities and God help anyone who was dying to \"go\". There were insufficient facilities for the numbers using them.The absolute glory of Peterhof is the gardens and they are a photographer's paradise. Even my holiday snaps look good. However, there was some bizarre and downright dangerous behaviour from some visitors. Is it really necessary to climb IN the fountains for your damned selfie? Is it polite to manhandle other people out of the way so you can have your picture taken (for a fee) with some twerp in 18th century costume? Will people really think you time travelled, as well as visiting Russia? So do go, if you get the chance but bear in mind the down sides."

Peterhof is about an hours drive from central St. Petersburg. We thought the palace was impressive but there is not a lot that is original as most of it was blown up in WWII. The gardens were impressive, but they were super crowded. People were lined up to see the fountains turn on for more than an hour before they started. It was very packed. On the tour inside, we had to wear slip cover booties over shoes which were very slippery and made a few in our group fall. We're not quite sure why as most of the floors inside the palace were filthy and not yet restored. Maybe it was to protect us. Another issue for me that was not acceptable was that there was absolutely no photography allowed inside. The rooms were very warm inside (we did not find AC anywhere for that matter) and we were tired. Lastly, we\u2019re not sure why, but no one that worked there smiled or was cordial. There were docent's on every corner of every room. It did not seem like a happy place. We hope you like it better than we did."

The fountains are numerous and impressive (and of course gilded) and the terraced gardens are lovely - especially with the backdrop of the stunning palace itself. It's a great spot for a picnic lunch and I advise packing one to bring. Be aware that Peterhof is a long drive from St Petersburg. It is possible to do the trip by hydrofoil - which we did on our return trip - and this was fun. Recommended!"

Once your are at the palace, you must line up again to purchase tickets to visit the palace. It is very confusing and of course no one speaks English and no one is helpful including the police! They all point at different lines. We finally found the right line, and purchased our tickets. They were asking some folks for passports, but we were not asked for ours. Therefore, just in case bring your passports. The palace is very nice and well worth all the hassle. They make you wear slippers over your shoes to protect the floors, be careful as once you wear these the floor is slippery. The guided tours are only in Russian, therefore bring your guide book for references. We then asked if we could see the back gardens, we could see tourists walking around from the palace tour, we were told that it was free to visit that garden, but in order to get back to the pier, we would have to purchase another ticket to get back on the grounds, therefore the back garden is not free if you have to take the boat back. The whole thing is a scam to make you pay again. We therefore did not see the fountains on the back side of the palace, you would think that they would let you go out from the palace, since we purchased a palace ticket. The gardens and fountains are very beautiful and everything is clean and well manicured. They have some snacks available and a couple restaurants and clean bathrooms."

            "review": "Gardens, fountains, palaces...all separate paid entry, great on a sunny day. So, to be clear, this is a location with a variety of things to do, each with separate paid entry. Keep in mind that this region only gets something like 60+ days of sunshine every year, and walking through a huge garden may not be as enticing if you're doing it in constant rain...try to pick the sunniest day of your trip to go here. We used a rental car to come here (against the advice of what turned out to be outdated travel books) and it was easy. Google Maps took us right to an entrance (not the main one, which was actually super nice). We parked for free on the street and had zero issues.You pay to enter the gardens, which include sprawling grounds with a large variety of gravity fountains (like at Versailles, they run completely based on wider/narrower pipes, and have been functioning without power for hundreds of years with only refurbishment). The fountains were fun and beautiful. Be sure to see the trick fountains, where locals bring their children to play on sunny/warm days. There are many paths to follow, and it's easy to miss some of the fountains if you're not paying attention. I'd recommend saving a pic of the grounds from online before you go, to make it easier to navigate through. Beware, if you leave the gardens, they probably won't let you reenter for free, even if it's the same day...so don't accidentally walk out of any exits. There are opulent cascading fountains and beautiful terraced fountains in front of the Grand Palace. There are large fountains with sea gods and small fountains with mini sea-cherubs (they are like babies with split fish tails). We also saw a wonderful pyramid shaped fountain that was surrounded by channels of water that drained out and back into the river source. You see channels of water flowing throughout the property, cutting across fields of grass or other plants. It's pretty darn cool. Then, you have several separate palaces or buildings, each requiring paid entry. So, you can pick and choose what you might like to add on, depending on what you want to see and how much grief you want to deal with to buy tickets or see the attraction itself. All will require you put on shoe covers, and all prohibit photography.The Grand Palace is the place for opulence and over the top decor, and is the largest building on the property. See my review on that specific attraction to understand the hoops you'll have to go through to see this place, because oh, yes, there are many hoops. Be prepared to wait in lengthy lines, deal with crowds inside, probably not have an English speaking tour guide (you can self guide), and no air conditioning.Marly Palace is a more subdued two story building. It's smaller, but features all of the rooms you'd expect in any nice home. Kitchen, bedroom, office, etc. Quick to get a ticket for entry and fairly quick to see. A small but okay collection of art from various places outside of Russia (French, Dutch, Flemish, German). You can purchase a combined ticket to see Marly Palace and Peterhof Hermitage (see description below...this is NOT the Hermitage you'll see in St. Petersburg).The Peterhof Hermitage is a small two story building that served one purpose. It was a dining room for Peter the Great and his guests that was closer to the water's edge (the Gulf of Finland), so it was cooler during summer. It's oddly surrounded by a moat (for when you don't want gatecrashers?). The first floor is the kitchen and the second is the dining room. The really awesome part of this place is that they use a pulley system to raise and lower the dining room table and individual place settings. That way, they could send up the entire dinner without having a bunch of servers running around. When a diner finished their plate, they could pull a string to ring a bell and let them know to clear away their dish. They demonstrate this pulley system 3 times a day (I think, it may be 2), and fixed times. We missed that, unfortunately, because the time we read online was wrong. We thought it would be at 3pm, and it had happened at 2pm. This was, for us, the most entertaining of the three buildings. It was easy and fast to get into and showed us something we'd never seen before.Overall, we really enjoyed Peterhof and would recommend it to anyone. Oh,they also have a cafe (no air conditioning, but they have beer!) and a small food cart with seating around it. But, if you're a planner, you could bring a picnic lunch."

The only way to get there is by boat - and it's a dedicated service which only goes to this place and back. So we bought tickets and set off - it takes about 30 minutes. When we got there, there was a truly enormous queue which we couldn't work out what it was for. After asking around it turns out the boat ticket doesn't include the entrance to the grounds! So we had to queue up again - and the pace was glacial. Each person was taking about 2-3 minutes to be served, and there were around 100 people in front of us, across about 5 counters... it took an age to get through. After getting in we walked around the grounds a while but it started heavily raining so we headed for the palace itself. But there was yet another massive queue to get into that too! My wife went to ask what the system was and she was told that you have to queue up but you don't get in right then, they only let people in between certain hours - you get allocated a time slot. At that time it was about 1pm, but we were told people queuing now would only be getting in around 4pm - so we abandoned it all and went back to the wharf to go to the hotel. The final insult was then to find out the boat ticket was only one way and we had to queue AGAIN to buy the return ticket!Why on Earth they don't sell just one ticket when you get on the boat for the whole place is beyond me - and even more amazing they didn't sell return tickets (it's not like you can stay there or go from the place to anywhere else). I lovely place totally ruined by a pointless, frustrating and inefficient system."

The term 'White nights' can make you forget that St P is on the same latitude as the Shetland Islands i.e. the weather can be force to contend with. Our hydrofoil trip was cancelled because of the constant driving wind and rain (for five days straight). In fact, cruise ships had to be diverted. Even under raincoats and umbrellas, the gardens of this palace were enjoyable to walk around in, and we kept thinking how much better it would have been on a sunny day. The Palace is a marvel of reconstruction. The experience itself, however, is quite trying, as it is simply packed solid with bus loads of tour groups, struggling to check in coats (obligatory), retrieve coats, visit toilets, and then get moved on from room to glorious room in a tight queue formation until you are disgorged at the end. And there are many rooms to get through. One palace at St P is probably worth doing but on balance, taking into account the crowds, there are many other pleasures to enjoy."

Included was a hydrofoil ride to the Peterhof from one of the many docks on the Neva river. This is not bus seating, but leather swivel chairs in a 2x2 format with more than adequate room for standing or walking. If you do get a chance to ride in one, check out the nose area first as there are seats with fantastic views up front.The main attraction at the Peterhof is the grounds around the palace area. Almost fully restored from WWII damage, it is impressive. The grounds are perfectly manicured with breathtaking statuary \u2013 most having been buried and hidden by the staff prior to the German occupation and use of the Peterhof as a headquarters building. Now the statuary is restored to it\u2019s former position and the most impressive, around the fountain area, has been re-gilded. Based on our timetable, we were only able to see a small portion of the grounds. A full day would be required to see the whole thing in detail."

The most spectacular part of the estate, and the most familiar from photographs, was the formal French garden with its Grand Cascade and fountains, ingeniously powered by gravity, rather than by pumps. They were all on display, and the spray was refreshing. During the Nazi occupation, the classical statues, bronze with dazzling gilding, had been hidden successfully by the retreating palace staff \u2013 all except the central statue-font of Samson wrestling a lion, which had been too heavy. The Germans had cut up the original for the metal, so the one I saw was a replica, albeit an artful one. Here and there around the grounds were the \u201csurprise\u201d fountains, which spurted up to soak guests who stepped on a particular rock or reached across a table for a piece of fruit from a central bowl. These built-in practical jokes were fashionable in early 18th Century European courts. On this particular warm Sunday, children were jumping exuberantly from rock to rock, spraying each other. My favorite part was \u201cMon Plaisir,\u201d the relatively modest retreat where Peter the Great liked to live quietly with his wife when imperial obligations didn\u2019t demand that he occupy the Grand Palace here or his winter palace in St. Petersburg. Because he liked things Dutch, he modeled Mon Plaisir after Dutch merchants\u2019 homes, lined the kitchen and some other rooms in blue and white Delft tiles (some were also from a factory he established to produce Dutch-style tiles in Russia) and hung the walls with paintings of bucolic and nautical scenes by minor Dutch artists. With its terrace overlooking the Gulf of Finland and, on clear days, the city on the opposite shore, this must have been a restorative retreat from the pressures of court life."

We knew of individual times for entry. We were not allowed to purchase tickets to the palace on-line, however. Why? We had no idea. We took the hydrofoil and arrived at 11:30 am, to complete chaos. First, we had to pay park entry. One can purchase no other tickets at the entrance. But, the confusion and lack of information is staggering. We were provided no map, nor could we find one anywhere we asked. Once we purchased the park entry ticket we went straight to the palace to purchase the entry ticket for it. The line was two hours long and that was the only window of time until later in the day. So, we wandered the park only to find many other options of buildings to see, all requiring a high fee, especially the church. We inquired about how to purchase a combined ticket but no one speaks English anywhere. The best we could figure out is that there is no combined ticket. Everywhere we went we saw people trying to figure out what to do and not paying a separate entry fee for the other buildings because the fees are exorbitant. So, we entered none of these buildings and came back to get in line for purchasing tickets for the afternoon entry time. We discovered the on-line information to be incorrect and found a line for individuals that was allowed in with the groups. We chatted with a Russian in this line who complained that even he had not been able to figure it out. He had waited in the first line for an hour and a half and not been allowed to buy a ticket. It is inexcusable but we finally realized that only groups are welcome here. Entry for individuals is made as difficult as possible in order to discourage them. And, to top it all off, the \u201cfree\u201d upper gardens are not free at all. Once you have entered the lower gardens you cannot leave and return. But, the only way to see the upper gardens is to leave. So, no one who takes the water route can see them without paying two entry fees. Ridiculous! Yes, there are fountains and nice grounds, but they were not worth the trip. Neither was the palace. Once you\u2019re inside, it is overcrowded; you are squeezed through along with large guided groups so you can hardly get a chance to see anything, though the wholly re-created interiors are splendid. Even the tour groups looked bored, and were going so quickly through the palace, that they could not have enjoyed the harried experience either.Save your sanity and go to another palace."

As with all visits in St Petersburg, this was a very busy location with dozens of tour groups. Our visit was to the gardens only \u2013 more space to spread out and on a warm sunny day would have been very pleasant.But although it was sort-of interesting to see the exterior of the buildings (and the gardens were quite decent), it would have been a better use of our time to have skipped this event and spend more time at the other better locations."

            "review": "Magnificent Fountains and Beautiful Palace. My wife and I toured Peterhof Palace and Park in early May 2016. Peterhof Palace began construction in about 1710 when Peter the Great (Peter I, 1682-1725) outlined the location of a palace and a short canal through a park to the Gulf of Finland. In 1716, the park grounds were expanded and, after Peter I had visited Versailles in France, Peter decided to have water features to outdo those in France.There are essentially three main sections of Peterhof, (1) the front gardens, (2) the palace, and (3) the lower park grounds. The gardens located at the front of the Palace are extensive and more like formal English gardens with geometric layouts. trees and bushes trimmed to elaborate shapes, some ponds and fountains. It is a far more impressive front entrance to the Palace than that of the entrance to the Palace of Versailles. There are five ponds in the front garden with various fountains in the centers with statues of Apollo, Neptune (in the Neptune Fountain), cupid and 4 other marble statues (in the Oak Fountain), Venus Italica (in the Western Square fountain) and Apollino (in the Eastern Square fountain). The Great Peterhof Palace is ENORMOUS! The outside is tastefully painted a pale yellow with white trim. There is not the extensive and gaudy gold gilding that is in the Catherine Palace except that the domes above the chapel and the dome at the other end of the Palace are gold gilded. It sits high up on a hill overlooking a park full of fountains and a canal that runs a short distance to the Gulf of Finland. There are many, many rooms but photography is not permitted inside the Palace (I assume to make sure you buy the books at the souvenir shop). The books are actually quite good and contain lots of color photos. The Main Staircase is covered with much gilded gold carvings and gold statues. The Ballroom is a gorgeous room of 2,900 sq. feet covered with gold gilded carvings, gold gilded framed mirrors, and a large ceiling painting called Mount Parnassus (painted 1751). It has a beautiful inlaid patterned wooden floor. Although the overwhelming amount of gold in the room gives a gaudy feeling to the room, it is still a stunning and gorgeous room. Other rooms in the Palace are also lovely and they do not have that overwhelming gold and gaudy sense that Catherine's Palace has. There is a Blue Reception Room where clerks kept records of activities at the palace. The Throne Room is a lovely room which is mostly white with light green painted accents with red curtains and red carpeted steps by the red velvet throne chair. Above the throne is a large portrait of Catherine the Great (Catherine II) in a green suit and mounted on her white horse, Brilliant. This green suit is preserved in the special access room in the Hermitage Storage rooms, The White Dining room is beautifully done in white with white stucco work with light blue accents. The large dining table is set with Wedgwood china for 30 (?) people. There are also boudoir rooms, divan rooms, dressing rooms, game rooms, a blue drawing room, and a bedroom. The most interesting (an pleasantly restful) room is Peter the Great's study which is covered with wooden panels with decorative carvings and an inlaid patterned wooden floor. Not all of the rooms were available for touring but the sense is that this Palace is better suited for living than Catherine II's palace with all of its opulence and gilding. The most stunning part of Peterhof is its lower park with its numerous fountains, statues, canal, small buildings, flowers and walkways. The fountains are activated from 11 am to 5 pm because they are fed by gravity from ponds higher up on the hill. The Great Cascade flows down the hill from just behind the Palace and there is water everywhere spouting from statues, ground fountains, and ending in the Scoop Basin with the golden statue of Samson holding open the jaws of a gold lion with a huge spout shooting high up out of the mouth of the lion.The sculpture on the cascade is 250 gold gilded pieces, 30 of which are also fountains. On each side of the Scoop Basin are collonades with flower gardens in front of each. The park is extensive with many exciting fountains, cascades, gardens and other buildings. In my opinion, although not as large as Versailles (maybe), it is well designed, with interesting features through out. It is very peaceful even with the hordes of people everywhere. We did not get through all of the Lower Park as it was just too extensive and we simply didn't have the time. Peterhof is a place that should not be missed. It would be easy to spend an entire day at Peterhof."

We did make it to the dock of P and the weather was not good enough to even venture up to the fountains. Purchasing return tickets was a major challenge. So, I can't say anything about the P. And I appreciate you'd like to ride the hydrofoil. I suggest you skip the P and go instead to Catherine Palace. Your research will indicate that CP is a better place to visit than P."

After the tour of the palace we were told to enjoy the gardens and fountain display. There really wasn't enough time to do both. We had to rush our viewing ofthe gardens in order toe in position or the display. The fountains are not flowing all the time so you have to be in position to get a good view before the display starts. They have almost military style Russian music and the cascades build as the music builds. Very thrilling but immediately after we had to rush back to get on the tour bus. We had to ignore all the stalls which sold beautiful headdresses as we were told the coaches would leave on time even if we weren't on the bus! While walking through the gardens we did see a ferry stop on the jetty. This had come from St Petersburg and if we visit again in ink we will get our own visa and use the ferry.Overall a good tour as we saw a lot but I don't like being so rushed."

Luckily the gardens are large and people can spread out but still there are so many people trying to take \"selfies\" in front of every fountain that it became annoying. You could not get close enough to see the beauty of the craftsmanship of the artists' work. When you do get inside to tour the palace you are only allowed a short amount of time inside each room before the staff ushers you into the next room. I guess they are trying to make sure that the many thousands of tourists can get through the building before they close.My suggestion is that you don't visit during cruise ship season. The only problem with that is that the gardens may not be open or in bloom."

Every building in the palace grounds has a separate fee and you have to keep buying more tickets at each place, they also have different opening and closing times and days.

There are some weaker points - almost no one speaks English (or any foreign language, so it may be difficult to navigate around. As foreigner you pay more but you can jump the queues (but this is usually written in Russian) - this might be useful in summer particularly when you want to get to Grand Palace. If you come by boat you enter to Lower Park (for which you pay). Upper Park is free but you cannot get there without leaving compound and when you want to go back you must pay again.

To imagine that his daughter had to add to the estate because she felt it was not large enough to house their small family was eye opening. Bankrupting the family to do so was also enlightening. The palace is beautiful and the grounds immaculate. Be sure you witness the fountains going off with the music. Amazing feat as the fountain is all gravity driven. It will be very crowded so I recommend you be one of the first groups through. The female museum guards (only female, huh?) don't look very happy to be there and were not very friendly."

The grand palace is simply sumptuous as are the gardens and golden fountains. The lower gardens are a fabulous place to wander around. The only negative is that the entrance fee (700 roubles, May 2016) does not include anything other than the grounds. Each of the many attractions are charged separately. It would be very expensive to enter them all! I would recommend the Marly Cafe at the far right side of the gardens for food. We made the mistake of eating in the restaurant in the centre of the park. It was not good. Strangely the entrance fee did not include a map of Peterhof so I would recommend obtaining one before you go. Overall an excellent and memorable day out from SPB.

At a price of 700 rubles, in the pouring rain, we really did not want to enter the gardens but only wanted to visit the palace.However, this was not possible and we reluctantly paid as 700 rubles to enter the gardens and watch the Fountains was the rain fell around us.When we went to retain the tickets for the palace itself, we were again pushed from pillar to post before being told, eventually, that we were two hours to early and that we would have to wait until 2 PM before they would let tourists in, after the Russians had had their time to enter!We all found this quite insulting but were quite happy to go back to the original entry gate and grab a coffee and some lunch before returning. This was to be the third disappointment! The ticket allow you into the Gardens, is valid for one entry only get the coffee bar and WC is outside of the ticket barrier. This means that we were left with the choice of either getting our coffee, and a band in the Palace, or standing in the rain and waiting until 2 o'clock before we would eventually be able to purchase a ticket to enter the palace.We all decided that we had had enough for treatment and abandon our visit to the Palace altogether!All of us found this attitude quite insulting on three grounds.1- why is it necessary to pay your ticket to enter the garden when all you want to do is into the palace, without entering the garden!2- why is it a rule that the tourists are not allowed in at the same time as the Russians and are made to wait, in our case in the pouring rain, before being allowed to buy a ticket for entry to the Palace?3 \u2013 I also, and I simply cannot understand this one, are we not allowed to the coffee bar after we have entered the garden, simply to buy a coffee or to dry off before re-entering the gates to buy a ticket into the palace.In all, this has been our most disappointing attraction to visit and it is a shame because it has left a bitter taste of our trip to Russia!"

The grounds are in readable, we can only imagine what it would be in summer but we had it totally covered in snow that made it a little magical. About 500m away is the sea that is totally frozen and easy to walk out on. For an Aussie that was a real experience We had private tour that was worth it. It's 20miles from the city and you will pass the presidents home on the way Also worth noting that this is still used by the locals for recreation and national use for public events not just a museum. I liked that fact as it's still part of Russia today Anyone still deciding if you're going to come to Russia. We totally recommend it. The people are really nice, it's easy for English speaking people and the city's are some of the most beautiful in the world equal to Paris and Venice"

We took a boat from Saint Petersburg to Peterhof, an early boat to arrive in time for the fountains and opening. We took two tours, one of the Palace and one of the jewels, both impressive but my favorite part of Peterhof was the park, so family friendly and beautifully landscaped. For a relaxing day, I highly recommend spending an entire day here."

All the palaces and the great park show exceptional taste of their first master.Even though it was very cold this summer during our visit, we enjoyed the park, the seasight, the fountains. We would gladly return once again on our own without an excursion.By the way, there are no cafes or restaurants in the park, only small carts with overpriced pancakes, ice-cream and beverages. So I would recommend either to bring snacks with you or to have a proper meal in St. Petersburg."

The building itself is gorgeous, and it contains lots of art pieces ranging from Chinese ancient paintings, sculptures, Russian paintings to European art pieces. If you have time after visiting the interior of the palace, make sure also visit the upper garden and lower garden (admission fee required for lower garden). The golden sculptures, fountains, and seaside view in upper garden is a must see, and breathtaking. The lower garden is also pretty cool, each building is quite special with different design style, like the Aviaries is designed by French, while the Bathhouse is in Chinese/Japanese style. One reason I like this place so much is the fusion and integration of Eastern and Western arts, it is like visiting several museums in one day. The bad thing though, is the transportation. I took the minibus (I think is #424) and it was not the easiest transportation method I have had, especially if you do not know Russian. Make sure charge your phone, download the offline map so you know where to get off. I ended up walking around an hour to get to Peterhof because I got off in the wrong station. The museum close pretty early as well.Overall, I think it is an amazing place and a must-see place if you travel to St. Petersburg."

This is the best way to see the Palace is with a tour company as they tell you the history and stories behind the buildings. Our tour guide Julia was a small encyclopedia. As you walk towards the building they are painted an impressive yellow and white with the domes being gold. When you see gold it was real gold (or had been). When you walk up the main staircase you are awed by the extravagance. The stairs themselves are short so that when the women who used them could actually walk up them with their heavy dresses. There dresses weighed at least 40 pounds. When you reach the ballroom you need to look at the floor as well as the walls and ceilings. The artistry of the floors is so amazing as well. Every way you turn is just another ah ha moment. You can see why the peasant wanted to overthrow these guys as they had such well and the serfs were barely getting by. After you are finished with the inside opulence you need to walk outdoors to see the Grand Cascade. The cascade and fountains were developed with a gravity-fed water system. All the statues are gold. At 11:30am they turn on the cascade and water rushes down and the fountains turn on to music. Just beautiful. It is so crowded with people seeing this your are better to wait for the people to disperse somewhat to get your pictures or you will only get arms and heads. The cascade goes down a canal to the sea with some bridges across at various sections to walk across and take pictures back up at the Palace. The whole grounds is 100 hectares with approximately 30 buildings and pavilions decorated with 100 sculptures. Walk down one of the many walkways and you will see another great fountain pavilion or garden. Everything is worth a visit. We loved it all."

And the garden and main fountains indeed were everything as I had imagined. However, there is no combination tickets for sell for individual palaces on the main entrance, which means if you want to visit anything apart from the garden, you have to queue twice, once for the ticket, and then to queue for the allocated time slot your ticket allows you get in. And on the day of my visit, all the queues for buying tickets and entering were extremely long.At the end of my visit, I went to pier for the boat, and it was getting windy, I was informed that the company from which I bought return tickets, has cancelled the operation due to weather condition, yet, there is another company, still operated with obviously larger boat and more passengers. Although I got my refund, but I can't help wondering the real reason for cancelling is due to the weather, or due to lack of the passengers of the company i was using. So I took the bus back to St. Petersburg, it was easy enough, there is a mini bus services to the metro station, costed like 55 rubles."

We want to see the back gardens -- oh they are closed. But, that aside, the gardens and fountains are spectacular, and the tour of the castle was fascinating. Since everything has been rebuilt, the statuary gleams with almost too bright gold paint, but it is all so overwhelming and beautiful. One feels that though these rulers were competing with their contemporaries in Budapest, Vienna, Berlin and Paris for grandeur that these Russian palaces were perhaps more comfortable and family oriented. Perhaps because the ruler was often a Tsarina."

Th rooms were in the decor of any other palace of that time in Europe with precious furniture, wallpaper, curtains and paintings. As Peterhof was destroyed during WW II one has to marvel how well everything was restored soon after the war. The cascade fountains are switched on at certain times for visitors to enjoy. We then had a long walk through the gardens and looked at the outbuildings that Peter the Great had erected for various purposes and relaxation with more fountains and well kept flower boarders. It was ashamed that it rained for our second visit to Peterhof as well as on our first one."

The setting on the Gulf of Finland is glorious and, in perfect sunshine, the scores of fountains give the whole palace an amazing energy. This is all the more remarkable when you look at the large photographs in the grounds showing the level of damage during the three year Nazi occupation. The restoration is stunning. The grounds are the chief attraction but the palace has been designed to show off the best of Russian interior design over the years. This has to be in the top three 'must see' destinations in St Petersburg."

I have seen this on photos but in real life it is 100 times better.

(a rare occurrence in St Petersburg!) Although the tours are very strictly regulated and supervised (leading to very little freedom to look at the palace at a leisurely pace) they are well run. Stern middle aged Russian women on every door watch to ensure you do not touch or take photographs inside the palace and can seem a little over zealous at their task, but the result is a very informative and pleasant tour. The rooms are impeccably preserved and wonderfully maintained. You cannot take a bag that is larger than a small handbag so be prepared to check your bags at the reception. Booties also need to be worn inside and they will be provided for you to place over your shoes. Bathroom breaks are available at the start and finish of the house tour and its advisable to use them! It can be a long day!There is a restaurant for more relaxed dining near the entrance and light refreshments are available for purchase as you walk around the gardens. CASH POINTS/ATMs can be found near the main entrance too... worth having a little cash for drinks and a nibble as you wander the vast gardens!The gardens are simply stunning. If you want to wander through at a leisurely pace here you are able too. The information available is plentiful but not forced upon you. One could spend hours just meandering through the acres of land and happening upon historic houses laden with history. Well worth the price! I came on a cruise ship so paid for the tour as part of a larger excursion to the Hermitage also. It took barely 45 minutes to reach the Peterhof from the small cruise terminal in the centre of the city. TOP TIP: Make sure to watch the fountains start at 11am. Get yourself a good spot on the bandstand at about 10:30am for a panoramic view!"

Peterhof was founded By Peter The Great and it is one of the most beautiful places in Europe.Peterhof contains Great Palace, Great Cascade, Upper Garden, Lower Park, Colonists' Park, Alexandria Park, Konstantinovsky Palace, Palaces and Parks of Oranienbaum. My favorite places in Peterhof are Great Cascade and Lower Park. Especially I like Trick fountains in Lower Park. This 18th century fountains was founded by Peter The Great and they still are working and most amusement place in all park.The Great Palace and park complex occupies an area of 1000 hectares. The Great Cascade contains 60 fountains and 250 statues. This very beautiful, sparkling golden complex is breathtaking. There are fountains, cascades, water pools, gardens, statues, flowers in the Lower Park. The best way to reach Peterhof is by Meteor cater by Neva river. They go regularly and it takes just 30 minutes from Saint-Petersburg to Peterhof by Meteor (Because the bad traffic on the roads it can take many hours by car or coach). Round tickets for Meteor costed for us 1200 rubles for adult and entrance ticket to Lower garden was 500 rubles for an adult. Peterhof is great place to visit for everyone."

The most incredible are the fountains (there are so many of them): Grand Cascade, Samson Fountain, Chess Mountain Cascade, Roman Fountains, Adam and Eve Fountains - just to name a few! Peterhof is a MUST-SEE place to visit!"

We actually gave the palace a miss after seeing several in St Petersburg already but just visited to see the lower gardens and fountains - and were not disappointed.We caught the bus (a mini-van/bus) from Avtovo Metro Station - very easy, there are several on the side of the road with Peterhof or \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0444 written on the side - and cost 40RUB per person one way (takes about 15/20 mins). The van drops you at the entrance to the upper gardens (which are free) and then you walk through them to get a ticket to the lower gardens, where the fountains are. The lower gardens are huge and you can spend minimum an hour wandering around. We went late in the day and were going to catch the boat back to St Petersburg however at that time of day, the wait for the next boat with a seat on it was almost 2 hours. So we walked all the way back to the road and caught the bus back, plenty of them on the road heading back to Avtovo Metro (and they are 10 times cheaper).So just a tip regarding the boat: there are a couple of different boat operators, not all of them take credit cards, so you'll need cash, and be prepared to wait if there are a lot of people around!But even if you just catch the bus there and back, it's well worth it - and you'll save some more money for beers/vodka later :-)"

Being around 45min away from the city by boat, the island is beautiful and probably one of the most beautiful garden palaces around Europe!If you are going to visit the palace inside...For non Russian speakers I'd just like to give you all a heads up, that if you go by yourself (As in not with a tour) to the main palace, you will have to stick with a group since you're not really allowed to stroll around by your own. That being said, most of the visitors are locals, most of the people in your group will be locals, which means that the guide who leads groups will be explaining EVERYTHING in Russian. The whole tour is around 60-90min if I remember correctly and once again you're not really allowed to leave the group so it will be quite \"less interesting\" if you are keen to know about the stories behind. So, my suggestions is either you are going to not understand what's happening around you and simply enjoy the beautiful palace with a group of Russians, or you'd better book a English speaking tour to enjoy the whole experience."

However this is a must if you do not want to be stuck in a big crowd and it will allow you to see a lot more in a lot less time, allowing you to see more of the other wonders of St.Petersburg.Many call this place the \"Russian Versailles\". In fact if you already visited Versailles you will find that the comparison might be good about the gardens, but the Perterhof Palace cannot really be compared with the Versailles Palace. Peterhof is quite small in comparison. Yes it is still a pretty big place, but nothing to compare to Versailles.The gardens are really beautiful and the stories related to the different alleys are interesting. (Ask about the tricky fountains!) And it is fun to see that the main fountains are still turn on manually (around 11h) just in front of the Palace.The Palace is interesting but you can see most of it within an hour.If you never saw Versailles I definitely recommend Peterhof. But if you did see Versailles I would still recommend to see Peterhof, but do not have to many expectation. Go for the history, not the Palace."

The interior of the palace is also impressive, of course, but it is hard to match the display outside. Although what the visitor sees is a reconstruction of the 18th century structures and grounds, destroyed by the Germans who occupied them in World War II, the beauty of the place is truly astounding.We toured with TJ Travel while on a cruise, which made for easy admission to the palace and a great English language guided tour."

The fact that a large part of the tubing is the original pipeline is amazing, indicating the huge engineering effort that was put into this place. The beauty cannot be described in words. you have to be there to understand. going back to the city via hydrofoil is a very nice experience as well."

We had to wear disposable booties over our footwear as we entered the palace and were repeatedly reminded that no photography is allowed within the palace. With all this preparation, the anticipation was high. We were not disappointed! Absolutely sumptuously restored rooms in all their magnificent glory amazed us. We understood the need for the booties that protect the carefully designed parquet floors. Before we headed out to the gardens, we made a stop in the Gift Shop that has a very wide selection of souvenirs and the best Amber jewellery collection that I had seen thus far. The prices were reasonable. The Gardens were beautiful with something for everyone - sculptures, numerous fountains, roses and other flowers, trees and manicured hedges. Take the walk to the residence facing the Gulf of Finland and soak in the coastline view. Before leaving, rub your hand on the feet of the statue there to be blessed with health and wealth! The feet of this sculpture are shining from the thousands of hands that have rubbed against it. There are small cafes in the gardens but make sure you have rubles! An ice cream in hand would have perfected our enjoyment of the gardens but we had to be disappointed since they refused Visa or euros or US Dollars. Peterhof gets my vote for the most spectacular attraction in St Petersburg. Must not miss this and definitely worth the 22 mile drive to it."

It was definitely beyond \"let them eat cake.\" I am really grateful that they had a great exhibit in the upper gardens showing how the working class felt about the palace and toured the palacial rooms, post-revolution.It was also touching to see displays that showed so much of the palace bombed out and how much work they have done to restore it to its original splendour.While many people pay lots of extra money to take the hydrofoil over, I really enjoyed maneuvering the Metro and the maroushka van.

The approach from the sea, which was how Peter The Great intended his visitors to arrive, is the visual equivalent of \"shock & awe\". The view up from the sea & its connecting canal, through the bridges & flanking fountains is superb. My other half commented that once the fountains get going (11am each day) the overall effect is more spectacular than Versailles. The grounds are full of buildings, walkways, bowers, fountains. The house itself is very impressive, both inside & out. When you see the black & white photos of the state of the place at the end of WW2, it is a massive testament to the work of the restorers.

The palace and the grand cascade are the centerpiece of the palace; a magnificent confection of gold, fountains and gardens. The grand cascade is truly a sight to behold, with all of its fountains driven only by gravity. The Samson fountain is considered a masterpiece as well as symbolically important to Russia. The huge lower gardens are interspersed with trick fountains designed to douse the monarchy's guests (and amuse him). Don't miss the Monplaisir palace, which Peter built for himself (he wasn't the gilded type). Take a day to walk around the palace because it's a relaxing experience to be surrounded by so much green and beauty. Besides, you came a long way to see it.

So as not to risk missing fountains being turned on due to the hydrofoil not operating and having to catch the bus, we went straight to the bus stop.Bus took a bit less than 1 hr and we joined the masses at the ticket window. Once in the grounds we saw the massive ticket queues to get tickets to the palace and decided against it. We had already visited Versailles on a previous visit and didn't want to go through that crowd-pressing experience this time. So we just visited the gardens instead.We really enjoyed the gardens. Our enjoyment was a bit limited by the fact that it was a cold and pretty windy day. Nonetheless, while not in the class of Versailles, these gardens were very beautiful.While walking around the gardens we noticed people who were coming from the hydrofoil. So we decided to return that way. Guess what? The travel gods were not on our side that day, and the boat was now closed due to weather.Still, we noticed an old church near the bus stop and went in to have a look. We climbed up to the tower. A nice experience to end the visit and compensate for the hydrofoil disappointment.Tip: Don't rely on the hydrofoil - especially if you are keen to see the fountains begin (worth it). I guess, do as we did and use the bus and hope to return by hydrofoil."

We visited on Peterhof on a beautiful June day that most of the palaces at Peterhof were closed, but my friend (an American expat who's lived in St Petesburg for 7 years) said that the gardens are the best part. Since we were seeing a number of other Russian museums on our trip, we didn't feel like we were missing anything. And since the weather was great for a picnic, we brought lunch with us and ate on the beach of the Gulf of Finland. A head's up: The folks who run Peterhof don't really like it when you sit on the grass or in the open where most of the tourist are coming and going, but they ignored us and others sitting and eating on the beach just off the main path. Also, it was a bit chillier than in St Petersburg, especially at the end of the canal, where the water pours into the Gulf. We were glad we brought layers and jackets!That said, I highly recommend making Peterhof a day-trip, or at least half a day. Once you've been impressed by the Summer Palace and awed by the Grand Cascade, the gardens encourage a child-like wonder. They are best appreciated by wandering around to make little discoveries of beauty (Pyramid Fountain, the aviaries, Monplaisir Palace, etc.) and fun (Checkerboard Hill, \"trick fountains,\"etc.). My friend, my husband and I were all thoroughly exhausted at the end of the day, but it was so worth it!"

We went by ourselves and found it difficult to get tickets to the park and the palace as everything is in Russian, and the lady selling tickets didn't speak English. So we had to buy tickets inside to the palace. The system could be improved so much for tourists. The hydrofoil ride to the palace is good to do...just make sure you take cash because they don't take credit card"

Inside the palace, it was jammed with too many people. It was tedious to work our way through the stifling hot rooms. If they'd opened the windows it might have been bearable. The Russians are not very hospitable and make you feel like they're breathing down your neck. They don't smile and they nearly attack when someone steps out of line. No photos are allowed inside this palace. I couldn't wait to get out. I recommend going on a weekday when it's not so crowded."

If you are touring on your own and the weather is pretty, I would try to take a picnic. Lots of grounds and places for that! Also, there is at least one restaurant on the grounds. We arrived at Peterhof by bus and left by foil boat, which was just a short walk from the palace. I would choose the boat just for shorter travel. Don't miss this beautiful place!"

There were so many huge rooms filled with amazing artwork, furniture, tapestries, personal items, etc., that you find it hard to take it all in. Many room ceilings had such great artwork painted on them that they reminded me of the Vatican and Sistine Chapel. Of course, there was gold everywhere. Gold in the mirrors, in the paint, along the walls, in the furnishings and several rooms were almost 99% gold everything!Outdoor gardens -- front and rear of palace -- were amazing. Fountains, flowers, trees, everywhere. The garden in rear of the palace has a canal that leads down to the sea. The garden is filled with beautiful gold statues, cottages and fountains. At a set time every morning, music begins to play and the fountains come to life and do lovely \"dance\" to the music. You need to be in garden area at least 15 minutes before the water show begins if you want a good spot to get pics. Beware, though, wind blows the water around and people to close got pretty wet as did their cameras.Luckily, hubby and I went with a tour group, so we actually got early entrance to the palace and did not have to stand in line for tickets. Tour company provided the tickets and has agreement with the palace for their groups to enter the palace before it opens to general public."

It appeared it would take 2 hours to get to the ticket office and then a further wait in a queue to actually enter the palace. We gave up and enjoyed the very e the dive fountains and gardens. Did buy tickets and tour through the humble (by royal standards) villa of Monplaisir, Peter the Great's favourite retreat. Cosy with its wood-panelled walls and smaller rooms. Windy when we arrived. By the time we want to leave it's gale force and the hydrofoils and boats have been cancelled. Taxi back to city will cost about $40 or can also get a bus or metro. I am sure Peterhof lives up to the hype. If you choose to go, I recommend joining a tour group or you will waste the day queuing.

The photos of the ruins of Peterhof (after Nazi occupation and desecration) would make anyone so awestruck that such a grand place could be rebuilt in the 20th century. The Russians cherish their heritage to put so much $ into rebuilding this amazing place. The fountains are an amazing piece of engineering with the water being fed in from springs that are 14 miles away, channeled by canals and aqueducts. Fountains go on at 11 AM for a few hours. The statues are covered in gold leaf and shine brilliantly in the sun.  We made a special trek to visit the Peter & Paul Cathedral, about 3 blocks outside of the palace grounds. A service was underway-- the chanting was angelic."

Why would anyone think they could light up a cigarette in the doorway of a national treasure is beyond me . Anyway if you go to St Petersburg visit Peterhof .

If going by hydrofoil and returning by car (or vice versa), not being rushed, taking plenty of photos and taking in the parklands and main palace, plus having a light snack, need to allow 5 hours. Boat trip is under 30 minutes with car journey 1-1.5 hours and 2.5-3 hours for inside and through gardens. If you chose to visit all the museums and palaces on site, would add another hour+. We had our own guide, tour group sizes over 10 people appeared to have difficulty getting every one to hear what was being said. Audio guides are also available in multiple languages and would be useful as signage in each room (Russian & English) is not detailed. Must leave bags and coats at checkin, no lockers, but secure and efficient process. No photos allowed inside but plenty of books and postcards on offer in the gift shop. Only one set of stairs to negotiate in and out. We had no trouble with crowds on a Thursday in May. My tip is arrive in time to be outside for when fountains commence at 11am with an accompanying symphony broadcast through the park. Then do your walk through the main palace. From 11am fountains run continuously until close."

In park you can go without lines, tickets are sold on entrance. Park is really amazing, a lot of beautiful views are opened there. I was afraid about big palace, because you should stay in two huge lines, before for tickets and then for entrance and time of work cash and the museum is limited, so a few people couldn't visit it. I don't understand this terrible service, why they can't sell one tickets for all places for wishing and one tickets for park for instance. Also you should take off your clothes in one place and backpacks in other and after visiting museum you should go through crowed for your things and then come back on the exit, it's crazy. Tickets for foreign people cost more expansive than for citizenship of Russia, but tour only in Russian language, there isn't audio guide in English or other languages. We spent 3 hours on staying in the lines, it's terrible. People without tour can't visit this palace normal.

There are three cascades - the Chess Cascade, the Golden Mountain and the most famous the Grand Cascade with Samsons fountain. This is truly magnificent, as the statues lining the cascade and the numerous fountains are all covered in gold. Peterhof is a MUST see on your visit to St. Petersburg and it certainly is possible to see this and Catherines Palace in the same day even though they are a distance apart."

There are actors in period costumes to take pictures with and vendors selling souvenirs throughout the grounds. You can also but tasty treats. The view of the Gulf of Finland is magnificent. There are several fountains throughout the grounds. Some that the kiddos can get wet from if desired. The museum was quite warm during my visit.

The upper garden, with an area of 15 hectares, was laid out under Peter I. Peter used the garden to grow vegetables. Later in the second half of the XVIII century, the upper garden did undergo a substantial modification into a modern looking regular park with statues and fountains, like \"Oaken\", \"Neptune\", Fountains Square ponds. Near the main entrance of the upper garden is the \"Mezheumny\" or \"Uncertainty\" with a ferocious dragon in the center surrounded by four spouting dolphins. But of course the main magic artwork is the lower park with its numerous fountains. Every year when the fountains rekindle, is a big day of celebration. The central axis of the park forms the Grand Cascade and the Sea Canal with the lustrous \u00abSamson tearing the lion's mouth\u00bb fountain. It is believed that the figure of Samson appeared in connection with the Poltava victory of Russian troops over the Swedes. Equidistant from the sea channel visitors will discover fountain \"Adam\" and \"Eve\" cascades \"Chess Mountain\" and \"Gold Mountain\" Monplaisir Palace and Hermitage Pavilion. In the western part of the park, visitors will find the Marly Palace. I would recommend at least plan to spend one day on the visit of Peterhof, so you can explore everything in a relaxed feeling."

Slowly walking in the forest, appreciating each item and decor in each museum. Please also be reminded to visit the place on Saturday because all museums opens on Saturday but not every weekday. (some opens everyday, some every Saturday and Friday, some every Saturday and Sunday...)"

It was such a pleasant day I shall remember it always! The grounds of the palace were just perfect and Albina's knowledge of the grounds and her pleasant and efficient demeanor allowed us to see everything there and return to the city in time for our afternoon tour. Our city tour was impressive as we saw all the sights included in the tour and Albina took me to some that were not listed and this made our tour that much more memorable. Albina is very efficient and quite personable. Her willingness to share her insights on the history of her city as well as give a local's view of current events made my trip just perfect. Thank you Albina!"

We arrived by boat after we visited the Hermitage Museum. It was a nice stroll up from the boat dock. The fountains were lovely. The interiors were quite elaborate and reeked of the Romanovs. It was built in the early 1700's and was a landmark of Russian artistic culture. Superlatives don't do it justice. You can close your eyes and imagine what it must have been like 200 - 300 years ago."

Located near the Gulf of Finland, this is a much smaller Palace compared with the Tsarskoye Sel\u00f3 , and so the rooms inside it, where you can not take pictures of any of theme, but very nice decorations in the rooms they let you see. , but what is really amazing in this Palace are its gorgeous fountains that run down the beautiful stairs... You just get surprised by the mecanism they pump the water with! There is also a large park around it, with a special place for kids, where they love getting soaked with little water fountains, so, if you travel with children to this magnificent place and in summer time, make sure to bring a bathingsuit or extra clothes . Very enjoyable park!"

In fact maybe we liked it more as there was no crowd. The sheer opulence is truly one of a kind in this world. ( and this is after being overwhelmed by the Hapsburg Palace in Austria )."

There we went on a tour of the palace of Peterhof. The palace was wonderful with a glint of gold everywhere. The gardens were pristine and beautiful following the paths to river which flow out to sea. Then there was the magical fountains operated by a gravity fed system along side golden statues on different levels with water cascading down to the river with more fountIns either side. A real spectacular not to be missed."

It's amazing to have seen it transform from a 1970 school visit when fountains didn't work and the gardens didn't exist to 1994 when money had turned the splendid cascades back on... to now. The lake is serene and beautiful with its surrounding pleasure palaces and restored boathouses that I didn't know existed. The view across the Gulf of Helsinki is exquisite and the trick fountains entertain all.10:00 am the glorious fountains turned on to musical fanfare. We enjoyed the interior but for glamorous rooms, Catherine Palace has the edge for me. What made the visit was a lovely sunny day for September 11th, 2014. The upper gardens were amazing with the sun just perfect at 9:30am. I'll try to add photos."
