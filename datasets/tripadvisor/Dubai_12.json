The ambience and views are lovely, but you have no choice when they blatantly overcharge you for drinks not served Beware & be forewarned. Pay as you go or risk being charged for drinks not served with no ability to contradict a thing. Any of the Pier 7 spots work more professionally than this spot!"

Been here twice first sometime ago in the bar we asked the barman if he had fresh orange, yes, when it came it wasn't fresh I pointed it out that he said he did he just arrogantly said don't have fresh orange, we didn't want what he poured out and he aggressively snatched the drink and poured it down the sink, I said keep the other drink as well an we left. many months later I wanted a Sunday type British roast dinner which you can get in the restaurant on Saturday, I phoned at 12.30pm asked for a table for one at 6pm I thought go early before it got busy as there was only me, I was just about to leave shortly after 5 pm the young lady said sorry we are fully booked so you can't have the table, I said you weren't fully booked when I call hours earlier, she said ill put you on the waiting list, after laughing I said don't bother I won't ever come there again, I know a restaurant needs to make money but to do that well you can keep it, plenty of others.

The boat was NOT a Dhow. The food was very nice, buffet style and the entertainment was over speakers. However the view was what we went for, great view along the marina and a good view of the Burj Al Arab before turning back to head back. I would go on this trip again, the Dhows look too small and if you don't have air conditioning please prepare to sweat and be uncomfortable in 75% humidity. Check this before you book."

When its construction will be complete, it will house over 120,000 people in the residential towers and villas. It is an artificial canal city and a heavenly abode for the families living there. People can experience the presence of marine wildlife entering the lake because of its proximity to the sea."

We were recommended to take the lemon tea as drinks which was also a good choice. We were quickly served and the food was okay, if anything we felt over fed! I chose a salmon pizza for a main course which wasn't great. My fault I was expecting cooked salmon not fresh and thickly sliced pieces. Friendly restaurant and nice for dining with friends.

This place was recommended for the sports bar so we decided to set of, watch a bit of sport while we had a bite to eat.The chairs were far too low or far too high to eat comfortably so we ended up in the restaurant part where the atmosphere was a bit dull.The food was ok but the steak that my husband had was a bit tough and the waiter didn't seem that bothered when we told him.Not a place I would rush back to even though the upstairs seemed to be buzzing. The view from the restaurant was limited-being right on the water you would have thought a nice view out would have been the main draw but windows were tinted with poor visibility."

His attention, friendliness and service ethos was exceptional, I would recruit him as my front of house straight away. The brunch was incredibly great value with sumptuous food and alcohol that did not cease. The chef Mark came out, made a fuss of our vegan and delivered a super vegan lasagne, with fresh vegetables and humous to start finished by a fruit platter that was perfect. Exceptional all round."

The yacht was an experience on its own. So worth the trip. the cabin crew were amazing and gave us the safety tips and then proceeded to guide us out of the marina. Its definitely worth spending money on. The beautiful buildings along the waterway just add to the romances and decadence of Dubai. Once we were out at sea they anchored and the brave few took a dip in the luke warm water. The food laid out was delicious and catered to everyones taste.Very relaxing and beautiful"

Service was prompt and friendly, and given that a rage of cocktails were included in the set price, we thought we would have a few.The food was great. A good selection of starters, sea food, salad, whole Salmon, as well as Roast Beef, vegetables and more desserts than anyone needs!We would happily recommend this venue, and will be going back ourselves."

I don't understand what makes it so hard to serve the customer and to deliver at least some service standard. One day it will improve, I simply believe in it.

As two foodies who eat out often, there were several things on the menu which weren't clear, for example 'chicken Bon Bon' with no explanation or description. The menu was also very limited and really expensive and I wouldn't have chosen it if I didn't have the entertainer (voucher app). The food when it came out was great and the service was amazing.Then we were offered the dessert menu.. See attached photo. It reads as three drinks, one dessert and one cheese board. We honestly thought there was a typo and we were given the after dinner drinks menu! The descriptions are really confusing and averages around 75dhs, which is a lot for a dessert, especially when you've got no idea what you're getting! Our waiter was super helpful and described everything, he also understood how poor the menu was as describing, which made us feel better! All in all the setting, food and staff (and there was a great deal on Prosecco at 50dhs a bottle!!) are brilliant, but the menu needs totally rewriting, which I would even volunteer to rewrite, being a journalist and writer myself! I would definitely come back, but the thing I'll be telling my friends about it the amazing Prosecco deal here as opposed to the 'great menu' , which is a real shame."

There is a choice of 4 starters, 4 mains and 4 desserts, nothing of which I would normally order. 2 of the main dishes are fish, one pork, one duck. I settled for the pork belly, which was inedible. It came with 2 green beans (TWO) and one piece of potato (ONE). The pork itself was fatty and it was impossible to chew, I had to put it into a napkin and leave the rest.Asked for the desert menu, the menu only said \"Chocolate\", \"Acqua\", \"Tea and Coffee\" and \"Cheese\". No explanation at all other than these funky names. Called the waiter and asked to explain what the cook James meant with such a lavish coloured fantasy of names and was told that Chocolate was \"a kind of a mousse\" and Acqua was \"like Gin and Tonic\". Perplexed I decided to play it safe and go for the Chocolate. It turned out to be JUST chocolate. One chopped up bit of milk choc, a couple of strips of white choc and a spoonful of very bitter gooseberry ice-cream. Again, I had to leave it. For our dining pleasure, we were hit with a bill of AED890 (well, we had 4 glasses of red) plus the bother of going home to get something to eat. I will never go back to Marina Yacht Club and would advise against it."

Dubai is an interesting city to visit as it is full of opulence and surprisingly stunning places set against a background that steps straight out of a movie set. Sitting on the terrace of the Dubai Marina Yacht Club sharing a couple of drinks with friends completely ticks all these boxes. This very large and spacious venue overlooks the marina with luxury yachts moored within it whilst the dinner cruise vessels sail up and down the waterway outside. The towers overlooking the marina rise up and light up the skyline which is a very impressive sight at night. A really fantastic setting and for anyone visiting should expect to be dazzled by this place. Tuesday night is Ladies night so I believe that the drinks are cheaper but like anywhere in Dubai, it can be expensive. A food buffet is also available but the atmosphere is very informal.

The views of the marina are lovely at night and the brunch had a great atmosphere. The food choices are more limited than the massive hotel brunches, but we found more than enough to suit us and the quality was excellent. I was particularly impressed with the sweets which often look great but just taste of sugar, every dessert we tried was divine, compliments to the chef! Wine was lovely and the cocktails were great, the brunch at 350dhs was good value. Service was outstanding and our waiter kept bringing drinks he thought we'd like. After we'd finished eating we had a final glass of wine at the lounge end of the terrace which was also enjoyable. A very relaxed and enjoyable evening. Mostly youngish adults, but there were some families."

Had to ask for everything at least 4 times, it actually became quite amusing seeing everyone in the restaurant trying to wave down the service team for assistance. The manager was sooooo out of his depth. Tip - rather than disappoint do a breakfast buffet or don't accommodate additional tables when you are already struggling to cope - all in all the biggest waste if money in my 5 years in Dubai! - I gave the manager the chance on numerous occasions to rectify .... Hopeless!"

My second visit was on a Tuesday night for ladies night following the recommendation of my friend and it was as good as he had told me. We got there early and managed to avail of a few happy hour drinks before the crowds arrived. It started to get busy from about 9pm onwards and the atmosphere was really good with a nice crowd of decent people. Mainly an expat crowd with all sorts of nationalities and ages. There was some barbecue food available too although we didn't have any. I will definitely return here on my next visit to Dubai!"

Amazing view on the city, nice food and cocktails, nice crowd, nice staff. It is all still there apart from staff. I had few incidents before but the last one was too much and I decided that will not go there any more. I came with the group of friends and one of them was buying the 1st round of drinks - I requested Mojito and got is , everything was fine. 2nd round was on me and one the friends asked to buy, if they have, Caiperinha. When I approached the bar on the terrace I was told that they do not make cocktails and sent me to the bar inside. Inside bar was not very busy, few staff was just standing behind the bar, however took them a while to pay attention at me. When I requested for cocktails I was said in a very rude way: We do not do cocktails-mocktails here\" I said: \"Just sometime back I got Mojito from this bar and now you are telling me that you do not do it\" He was refusing to believe me and got so extremely upset that someone prepared a cocktail for a customer. Called someone who was also not very polite and when I told the 2nd person that before I already bought a Mojito from this bar he asked from whom? I said: I do not remember..from you (I meant the bar). He pointed at himself - From me.. you bought it from me? At this point I stared to get angry and said that no matter from whom... I want a Mojito (forget about caiperinhi - it seemed like these people never heard about it) - So they called a 3rd guy who started to mix Mojitos for me. My last disappointment of that evening was when I saw that instead of tonic the guy added 7up. I left shortly after this and do not have any wish to come back. It is not a cheap place and customers deserve some respect."

I liked it so much that I'll stay here during one of my upcoming Dubai visits. There are various hotels surrounding Dubai Marina and I can only imagine how it looks from floor 40. Should be epic."

We took the metro to the Dubai Marina stop and then took the tram (3 AED) for a view of the marina area prior to alighting at the Marina Mall stop.We walked through the Mall to get to the Marina promenade. We found a bench and watched the hop on - hop off water shuttle, families walking along the promenade, and people enjoying the rented quad bikes and other people-powered activities.There are lots of restaurants along the waterfront. We opted for the budget option which was the food court on the top level of the Marina Mall. There is outdoor seating with a great view of the water and skyscrapers - if you can find an available table.On the way back to the metro, we walked to the Metro and skipped the tram."

Had a waitress who didn't understand my drink order & served me a big bottle of water that I didn't want. Argued that it is already opened, I had to take it! Sometimes, I feel the people in hospitality & customer service are lacking in understanding of English.

The salads were minimal in choice.4. The only choices of \"package\" is with cocktails or soft drinks. So what if you don't want either softs or cocktails and prefer wine. So we paid for soft drinks which we were not offered and did not want as we required wine.The staff were attentive although the chefs were not generous with their portions, I had to ask for more on each visit to the BBQ.

We took the Xclusive boats cruise, and the skyline as your yacht moves farther and farther is a sight to behold. The peace you experience as your boat moves farther away into the Dubai Marina, with a star studded sky above, a sky-scrapper studded skyline in front of you and refreshingly cool sea breeze grazing your face is something you will have to experience yourself! And the dining experience amidst such a beautiful setting is the cherry on the cake :) A must-do activity if you are in Dubai.I am not sure if the creek dinner cruise will be as good... but the Dubai Marina cruise, that begins from the Dubai Marina Yacht club rocks! Oh 1 tip though - a lesson we learnt the hard way - if you are taking a metro to go here, dont get down at the 'DAMAC/ dubai marina' station as its quite far from here. Instead get down as the next station 'Jumeirah lake towers' and the Dubai Marina Yacht club will be less than 200 mtrs away, easily reachable on foot."

My virgin mojito was absolutely to die for! We enjoyed the time we spent there, then on the way out, we realised there was another bar on the other side of the staircase, which was heaving! Mind you, we still would probably have sat outside - this was our first experience of Dubai following a night flight and a few hours sleep in our hotel, so we didn't want to just sit inside a busy bar.

We wanted to go for a drink there and found out there is happy hour between 6-8. We turned up at 6pm on Saturday. The place was very quiet. It dawned on us that the weekend in Dubai is Friday and Saturday and assumed that was why it was so quiet. Great news for us as we got seats outside over looking the yachts. It's a fantastic view, well worth a visit. Very relaxing place to be. We stayed for a few hours. The service was slow and difficult to get their attention to order more drinks. We ended up having bar snacks and they were fine, nothing special. The restrooms were immaculate...I do judge a bar/ restaurant by how clean these are."

But as it turned out it was just what we wanted. We had the bangers and mash and there was not a crumb left on any of our plates. The service was good and the price wasn't too bad for Dubai. We love visiting here but remember to make a reservation."

We were surprised by the poor service though. We had to continually go and ask a server to come and take an order because they didn't check on us at all.Not a massive issue but we were also surprised not to be offered a choice of spirit brands. Unusual for Dubai."

We sat on the balcony upstairs with a superb view of all the money sat in their spaces in awe, not feeling jealous at all! :) The drinks were pricey as expected but it's not everyday that you have that scenery so we just enjoyed ourselves. We would certainly go back on our next trip and would dine there as the foos look fab!"
