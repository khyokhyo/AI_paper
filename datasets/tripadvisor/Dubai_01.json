            "review": "No principles of Sikhism. Whilst on my honeymoon, myself and my wife decided to take time out and visit this gurdwara. It is such a beautiful gurdwara inside and out and we understand why so many people want to visit this place of worship.Unfortunately soon as we walked in a security guard came running up and told me I was dressed inappropriately as my knee length shorts were not long enough and would have to wear a pair of trousers which he provided; given I was in a place of worship I didn't want to argue the fact that Singhs wear long shorts with their Bana (religious clothing) but hey I was here to pray and not argue so I accepted the trousers and made my way upstairs.We sat in the darbar hall and there was just Kirtan being played over the PA system. We sat there for a short while meditating and doing our own personal prayers. Once we got up we seen a few boards outside the darbar hall with information on therefore we started reading these and the more and more we read it seemed like this gurdwara was being treated like a tourist attraction rather than a place of worship, it seemed as if the committee members were more concerned about impressing public figures rather than practicing the core values of Sikhism.As we waited for the taxi driver to finish eating langar we noticed a large school bus arrive with a handful of children. They took a few pictures against a poster and then the children, their teachers and the gurdwara staff (security guard and committee members) formed a line from the school bus which was outside the front door, up the front steps and to a room next to the front doors. They were passing parcels which were hand wrapped with wrapping paper and looked like gifts. Only problem is the school kids and teachers were passing these gifts with care to each other, however once it reached the security guard inside the front door and out of view of the children and teachers they were being tossed to the next committee members who was throwing them onto the floor in a room.As I looked on with utter shock and frustration they continued with this practice for some time. I decided to do the right thing and approach the security guard and asked who are these gifts from, to which he replied from the school and their kids. I then expressed my concerns that these school kids have spent time and effort hand wrapping these gifts and they are just being tossed with no regard into a room, the security guard replied that I need not worry as they will need to open up everything to see what's inside. They laughed off my concerns and continued therefore i decided to film their actions as proof (sadly it doesn't allow me to upload videos on TripAdvisor). Later I discovered there was food inside the boxes which really made my stomach turn, this was known to everyone and yet they were throwing these on the floor. This food would then be distributed to other people, the members of this gurdwara really have no principles of Sikhism and again proved they are only doing this for the public eye.If that wasn't enough, as I looked above where I was sat there was a poster about their trip advisor rating, again validating my views. I am really disappointed with what I witnessed on my visit, only positive thing during this whole experience was the taxi driver who seemed like a genuine kind hearted person. I really hope the committee members embed the principles of Sikhism as if a non-Sikh witnessed what I did, it would leave a very sour taste in their mouth about Sikhi and would paint us all with the same brush.This is a very beautiful gurdwara inside and out, I just hope the people who run it also have a beautiful heart and treat this as a place of worship rather than for their own gain. My rating is based on what I witnessed on my visit from members of the gurdwara rather than the building itself."

The Gurunanak Darbar Gurudwara is of relatively recent origin, which was constructed to address the requirement of the Sikh community of Dubai for a larger place of worhip than the existing one in Bur Dubai. This gurudwara is a short taxi or bus ride from the Ibn Battuta Mall and metro station.The gurudwara has a large prayer hall, with ardaas (devotional music) taking place regularly. One needs to cover one's head prior to entering. The congregation area downstairs, where langar was served, was extremely clean. The food too was tasty and filling. Do combine it with a visit to the aforementioned mall."

I'm Sikh, and I have visited many Gudwaras (Sikh Temples).This is a beautiful purpose built temple, however the outside does not have the traditional domed roof or the \"Nishaan Sahib\" (flag pole bearing the Sikh Flag), i'm assuming this is in line with local regulations... nevertheless it is still a fully functioning temple and serves as the pulsating heart of the Sikh and wider community.I have never seen such a well planned temple, right down to the seating for the ones who cannot sit on the floor, to the bespoke carpets and the circular ceiling.Friday is the weekend and the temple tends to be packed.*GETTING THERE AND BACK: you can take a taxi, or from the Ibn Battuta Metro station, the temple volunteers run a free minibus shuttle service to the temple and back on FRIDAYS ( this is very helpful, they mostly speak Punjabi, however you can always find an English speaker)"

It's actually really nice and although it is placed a little away from public transport, taxis can take your there.My first attempt to visit was not successful as we really could not locate, so we went back to Dubai and the mission was to visit this temple. The best thing to do is either get the metro to IBN Buttatta mall and then ask a taxi driver to take you or a taxi from your hotel. I'd recommend the metro route as a lot to f drivers still do not kno about the template.The other main problem is there are not any cabs near by so it's best to ask the driver to wait for you, I have heard that on Fridays the temple is busier than usual and cabs are more frequent but transportation is also provided.You really couldn't walk here from IB but having said that regardless of the missions I did to visit, I'd definitely go again. Oh, and for those of you who haven't been to a Sikh temple, there is always langur provided' a blessed meal and i''d highly recommend having this.

There are limited option for temples and gurudwara in Dubai. You can visit this one if you have faith and spare time. However this place is inside from road and whole area is some lonely with various religion places including churches. So you have to wait for taxi or come out on main road."

It opends at 4.30 am and is open till 9.30pm daily without closure during the day. When you enter there is a small hall where you can keep your footwear and right next to it there are wash basins to wash your hands. On the right is the hall where langar is served all day- Langar is food that is offered to all worshipers free of charge. This food is considered as God's offering to us. On the first floor is the prayer room which is huge and has separate sitting areas for men, women and families. The usual practice one follows when visiting is first you remove your shoes, wash your hands, cover your head with a safa or scarf and then head to the first floor to offer prayers. On exiting the prayer room you are offered prasad/ halwa after which you come down to the ground floor for langar. It is an extremely peaceful place and one gets peace of mind when visiting this pious place."

Either note the local taxi company phone number to order a taxi, Uber one or walk down the road and take a left for the nearest train station which is called Energy and around a 15 min walk.- Cant help in the kitchens etc which is one of the things I like about Sikh Temples so that was a little disappointing but the food was delicious and the people are lovely and very generous.- We were told off a little bit for sitting at the tables and chairs and told to sit on the floor despite being with my inlaws who are in their 60's... Not sure how old you have tolook to qualify for the seating which was empty..- Was quiet when we arrived at 11am and busy at lunch so keep in mind.

There is a friendly atmosphere within the congregation (of all faiths) and lungar is served for those who visit.Friday is the main day of worship and you'll find 10,000 worshipers enter the temple and have lungar before they leave. If you are using the metro to visit the Gurudwara on a Friday, I recommend you get off at station 'Energy', outside the station the Gurudwara staff offer free transportation to and from the Gurdwara until 9pm. Any other day I recommend you get off at station IBN Batutta and get a taxi from outside the station. Definitely recommend you visit."

It took 15-20 minutes to get there, and we were warned before hand to keep hold of our taxi as there are no taxi's in the area. And we're glad we did.....as not sure where or how we would have got back! Lovely prayer hall inside, seen it on TV previously, a must visit for the Sikh community. Top tip: Ask your cab driver to wait!!"

You walk through the doors and the volunteers welcome is the start of the excellent visit. You do not have to be a Sikh to visit, all are welcome. Upon entering remove shoes and cover head (provided for all). Walk upstairs to the main temple hall, sit, relax and take in the peaceful energy of the service. We were in a rush so could not stay for communal langar (free meal) served to all that visit. They have a website which you can see the times the temple is open. Suggest you arrange for taxi to wait for you or arrange transport prior to pick you up. As you will need to walk to main road to flag a taxi. Not to easy in evening when your with young children and it's hot outside :-). As I said, this is a gem of a place and a definitely must for all to visit when in Dubai."

Langar for all who are not familiar with the word is what is served as food as god blessings for people who visit the temple and sit for it. It's not a compulsion however to sit for it. Langar is served on the ground floor and the darbaar in on the first floor. The darbaar sitting area was huge and fully carpeted. It was very well maintained and neat and clean. The colours used are very soothing and apt for the meditative experience. A very good experience to start the day off."

As a sikh family on holiday in Dubai we made a visit as we were saying close by. The directions on their web site were good but could be improved as our taxi driver still got losr when close by. I would not describe this as a general tourist attraction unless you of a religious persuasion. The Gurdwara was was very welcoming, with spotting that we were obvious visitors and pointing us in the right direction. We stayed for a couple of couple of hours and really enjoyed the langar. There is nothings else close by, although there was the jebel ali mall which we did not visit."

If you're going by metro get off at Ibn Batutta, not energy even though it's a bit nearer, because you then need to get a taxi. It's too far to walk when it's very hot and you can get a taxi from Ibn Batutta metro station. On the way back we were lucky to leave at the same time a minibus was leaving the gurdwara so they gave us a free ride to the metro :) My partner is Arab but people kept thinking he was Indian and speaking to him in Punjabi....it was quite funny, he didn't understand a thing. We didn't have time to stay & eat there, but would have if we had the time. And hopefully been able to speak to more people there. This is a little far out from the centre of Dubai so if you're a tourist I'd recommended visiting Ibn Batutta Mall at the same time."

Exactly what Sikh's do in a Sikh Temple is exactly what other people do when they visit their respective religious institutions, mosques or churches or synagogues etc. However, one thing which is unique about Sikh Temples is that there is always a communal meal available to anyone at appropriate meal times at a Sikh Temple. This communal meal is called \"Langer\" and is taken while seated on the floor. Everybody sits together as an equal, and shares the same food. There is no distinction of any class or status. The food is all prepared by volunteers from the community, and anyone can participate. Food items are also donated by the community, in whatever quantity you please. There is absolutely no compulsion, but only that no alcohol and meat is to be brought in. The whole operation of preparing the food, serving, and cleaning etc is all carried by volunteers with no compulsion."

The land for this Gurdwara was donated by the local Sheikh of Dubai but it was not that easy. Local sikhs made v good efforts to translate the Guru Granth Sahib ji to him. After that he was convinced that Sikhism is for all not just sikh community and also they made him understood that it talks about only ONE Supreme GOD.This place was opened in Jan,2012. Nearest Metro : Energy Metro station (2kms walk to Gurdwara )It is located in Jebel Ali, near highway which connects Dubai to Abu Dhabi.While driving on Shekih Zayed Road, take Exit 25/Interchange No.6, R/A right, at Dead end left, First right behind Jebel Ali Hospital, First right again, straight on the left is the Gurudwara.FREE KITCHEN for all visitors as usual in all Gurdwaras globally."

If we cannot open our minds to be accepting of other peoples' faiths, we do not leave a world of hope or a future for our children.When I become the ruler of the world, this will be my first decree: that our children learn something of other people's faiths. With love and respect. They can start here, at the Sikh gurudwara (translates to 'the door of the Guru,' meaning the Creator).This Sikh temple is usually on my list for visitors to Dubai. It is worthwhile to show our guests the enormous area in Jebel Ali that has been granted by the Rulers to people of different faiths, so that they can practise their faiths in peace.The Sikhs are people of the Book, they believe in One God, and do not practise idolatry. Each person that visits the Sikh temple is equal - man and woman - and is welcome to join in prayer, in partaking of the food at the Community kitchen, the langar, or even in serving the community. The food is simple, vegetarian fare. Most of the people serving the food, or cleaning up are volunteers.What do you need to do as a visitor? cover your head with a scarf or a large, clean handkerchief. There are fresh scarves available at all levels, in baskets. There is a neat, assigned place for footwear, for which you will get a token in return - no payment involved.The Guru Granth Sahib is the holy book of the Sikhs and they bow to the book, or more importantly, to the Word carried in the book. Spend a few moments in reflection or prayer. You can ask one of the officials to say a prayer for you or answer any questions about the faith. They will be happy to oblige.There is no mandatory payment but the decent thing would be to place a small amount as an offertory that would cover the expense of the meal that you partake of. The entire kitchen works only on donations, and the doors are open to all peoples."

This is the third Sikh Temple I have visited, after Amritsar and Delhi, and while it is not as spectacular as those sites ti is very much worth a visit. As I have found elsewhere, the Sikhs are very welcoming, with greetings, with offers of food and a willingness to share their place of worship. Unlike Delhi and Amritsar there is no vast \"tank\" of water, just a small stretch out front. But inside you are guided upstairs to a large airy hall of workship, with an ornate altar at one end and thick carpets throughoutWhile I was there, three musicians were singing and playing harmonium and drums, and unlike Delhi, their amplifiation was perfect and the music incredibly hypnotic and engaging. I sat on the carpet for almost an hour soaking in the spirituality. I really enjoyed my visit.On a more practical level, the temple is a bit south of the towers of Dubai. I was staying close to the airport up north and did not want to pay for the taxi to go that far, nor did I trust I could get a taxi back from the temple. So I decided to go by the Metro, Google Maps showing about a twenty minute walk from the Energy Metro station and I know I walk faster than Google Maps suggests.The Dubai Metro is very easy to navigate, with signs and announcements in both Arabic and English. It is a long ride south to \"Energy\" but the Metro is clean and air conditioned and much of the ride is above ground and there are plenty of interesting towers to admire.But the arrival at \"Energy\" was something of a shock. The station name derives, I guess, from the refineries west of the train line. The temple is to the east, but the Google Maps route starts you on a paved road with no sidewalk (just the shoulder) and then guides you onto a dirt road that had me trudging through the sand. Mainly though, the pathway was completely deserted -- no people, no cars, no buildings, no nothing. I thought about turning back but the ability to see there was no one anywhere near made it seem safe, so I trudged. Most of the way to the temple the only other thing moving besides me was a truck that kept going back and forth spraying water on a section of the dirt road, turning it to mud. There may have been a reason for that but none I could discern.I was unsure about my return trip. Should I walk back through the open desert plain to \"Energy\" or try a tiwice-as-long walk, though a more built up area to \"Ibn Battura\" -- the next Metro stop north back to town. As I contemplated, a taxi pulled up and I had him drive to \"Energy\". If you are following Google Maps and you don't turn right ton the dirt road but continue to the next right you will have a longer walk but it is all paved.A car is good way to get there; there is plenty of parking. Walking from Energy to the temple took maybe ten minutes; if I had not been alone I probably would not have minded it. The visit, completely worthwhile.One more thing, Trip Advisor always asks if there is food available for purchase. The answer is no, because there is food available, but it is free."

The Ragees (Singers) had melodious voice. the praise for the LORd was sung from the heart.We had 'Lunger' at night. The food was well prepared, considering that there were hundreds eating. The service by the volunteers was excellent.We donated money for the 'Lunger'.It was a very satisfying experience"

As covering your head in a Sikh Gurdwara is mandatory, there are containers with suitable head scarves for both men and women and lockers to keep your footwear in. The place is much bigger inside than you initially think. It is spotlessly clean and neat with comfortable carpeting across the room for seating the faithful. While religious scriptures are read the faithful sit and listen. A feeling of calmness and peace pervades the place as the gathered faithful sit and listen. All visitors visiting at meal times can have a vegetarian meal cooked completely in-house in the Gurdwara's own kitchen. Do make it a point to visit this Gurdwara when you are in the new Dubai area. You will be pleased you didn't miss the chance."

Visited this Gurdwara on a Saturaday evening 13/9, was so impressed with structure of building, the kirtan darbar session, the Palki sahib, the aura, devotion n love of the sangat. Every evening the gurdwara even sends their buses to pick sangat who work in nearby areas - and the dedication n devotion is really touching. Recommend on your visit to stay till the end of program to see how much of love & respect is given to Guru Granth Sahib after kirtan sohila to Sach Khand. If u go by taxi, hold the taxi as it's a little out of the way but about 20mts fm city."

We visited the Gurdwara several times during our stay, on different days and at different times of the day.It's about a 5-10 minute drive from the Battutta Mall. Each time the taxi driver knew it's location and charged 10 AEDs. On a Friday and Saturday, there were plenty of taxis available there to bring us back or you can get the security guard to call one. Alternatively, turned right along the road, left and left again, where the hospital is (Lifeline hospital, formally, Jebel Ali hospital) and then flag one down on the main road. even as a woman alone, I was OK with this.It's very well organised, with people directing you to where shoes can be left, wash basins and the Langar Hall. There are head scarves available to cover your heads.Worshippers sit on the steps leading to the prayer hall, outside and in rows in the hall.There is a serene atmosphere to the Gurdwara, which leaves you feeling grateful to be a part of. Our children commented on it before we did. The architecture is amazing. The dome, obviously, especially when lit up is simply beautiful. It's worth walking around the building to see it from different angles. It looks polished almost from outside.Lovely, friendly people who will welcome you in and break bread with you."

One is struck by the immaculate design, when set against the desert surroundings and the deep blue sky! The grounds are immaculate. One does not need to be a follower of Sikhism to appreciate the beauty and tranquility of this lovely building. In fact, whether you have faith or not, you cannot fail to be moved by its splendour. All visitors are required to cover their heads and modest attire is expected. The management committee take great pride in what they have achieved and are more than happy to provide a guided tour if you so wish.Take a taxi to Jebel Ali and tell the driver that the Gurdwara is near the Hospital. The peace and quiet is in nice contrast to the fast pace of Dubai. This really is a must do!"

Let me explain it is not too far out best thing take Dubai metro to IBN Buttata Mall, walk to taxi rank and ask taxi driver you want to go to gurdwara near the churches, most of them know, passed the Jebeh Ali Primary school literally 5 mins in taxi paying no more than 10 DHR. The building itself is surrounded by all other places of worship, our Gurdwara stands out for its architecture, since you arrive in it is that welcome feeling you have in any gurdwara. The office were very hospitable and gave all info about the building, they will phone for a taxi for you to return to the mall or your return. We also just missed a wedding."
