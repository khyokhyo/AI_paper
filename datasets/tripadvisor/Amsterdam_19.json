The tour is very informative on the history of how it all started and how beer is made. They still have everything there and there are guides showing you how it is made. There is also great 3D showing everything including you being the malt that goes in and is turned into beer. At one stage you go through all the sports that Heineken sponsors and You can take pictures and participate in scoring a goal etc. all in all a great experience."

The queue went around the building, so while in the queue I purchased tickets online, added them to my passbook and went to the front of the queue and we walked straight in! I don't want to give too much away, but there was plenty of history and information about Heineken, a chance to see the brewing process and of course sampling, and then the bar which was a fantastic experience. I'd go back during my next visit to Amsterdam even though I've already been!"

The museum is really interesting and you get a small beer half way through then you get given a large beer at the end. You can get your own bottle printed with a message but they messed up the bottle after waiting for ages so would advise not doing this unless you have time to kill."

Luckily for me I just walked in and received my handband with 2 tokens attached to it for my 2 free beers at the end.I did not take the audio tour but did not feel lost. There were a couple short films as you enter on the history of Heineken and the family and then a live presentation on the ingredients that goes into the beer. The presenter was fun and it was interactive. No beer is actually brewed here anymore but you can see the big copper tanks that used to hold the beer and taste what beer tastes like before the fermentation is done....it wasnt too nice. Lol.Heineken horses were also there and there is a crew member with the horses who fields questions if you have any.Then we move to the 4D \"ride\" they have called \"brew you\" where you get to be a beer and see the brewing process from the inside. This was fun ride but the line was long as it was a Sunday evening. ..After that there are some interactive games that you can play and even ps4 with fifa since heineken is big on champions league. The games were fun!The last stop is the bar area where u can redeem for your 2 free beers in a semi club scene with music and ofc lots of people drinking beer!Would definitely recommend this as fun thing to do for any adult. You can also have your name printed on a bottle of Heineken for about \u20ac8 (can't remember the amt exactly ).You dont have to be a heineken fan to enjoy this experience! !"

After 2008 the management made a discovery (!) and decided the turn the place to a tourist-milking, dull center. You go in, pay 16 EUR, get a chance to drink 2 beers, see all these old commercials and boring stuff which only praise the brand rather than the beer itself (why would I want a beer bottle that my name printed on). If you want to visit a real brewery try real breweries and small beer cafes."

Much of the tour is self guided as you read & hear the history of the company, which is interesting. The ride/movie experience is unique and fun. The young man in the bar who explained the finished product was good and entertaining. Samples were given at this point (I got an extra sample since I correctly answered one of his questions about beer bubbles). The rest of the tour was interactive, which some people had fun with, me, not so much. At the top floor, we turned in our tokens for beers (2), then as you exit, there's a very nice gift shop. For the price of the tickets, 16Euros each, I guess I expected more, but it was still a fun way to spend the morning. I would've hated to have gone to Amsterdam and missed this."

I done this tour simply to please my friend and to say I had done it and man I'm glad I did. I found the whole experience interesting and wasn't bored liked I expected with each room and section proving interesting as the last section. Things such as the simulator type experience was fun and a little surprise with the rest of the interactive sections that followed also being a pleasant surprise from the photo interactions to the Table football. Along with the fun interactive parts the last parts of the tour were great especially the drinking the beer part and as non beer drinker I'm surprised how much I actually enjoyed Heineken with the beer being tasted at the \"how to drink a beer\" section and the last part with the club effect with two free pints of Heineken being given out. The beer tasted pretty good and I think Its safe to say I may have been converted to a Heineken drinker. Along with the beer tasting great and the experience being great from start to finish I have to mention the staff... the majority of the staff are like extremely beautiful which is always a bonus. Especially the guy with the blonde swept back hair he was like some sort of supermodel. While they are all beautiful they also are all friendly and very helpful along with being very knowledgable on Heineken. I would 100% recommend this experience for anyone visiting Amsterdam."

The experience guides you through the origins of Heineken, the ingredients, brewing process with a 4D short show and its sponsorships with sport etc and finishes with a couple of free samples. And if that wasn't enough there is also a gift shop with plenty of goodies."

There was very little that actually showed the building off, as half the tour consisted of lots and lots of Heineken advertising. We were expecting this, but it should have been augmented by more interesting elements of the brewing process and the history of the building itself. The rooftop bar was a nice end to the experience, but it was poorly organised, and we only got three 200ml beers out of the whole experience. Overall, I was not unhappy we went, but I was expecting something better. There are many other tours and experiences out there that are cheaper and more interesting."

You get three tasting which is appreciated but overall it feels like they could have done more with the space - I'd have liked more explanation about the brewing and the history. There is some detail on printed boards but it feels a bit sparse. The various rooms have more interactive options, like the game to pull the perfect pint. Worth going but don't expect too much detail. "

Several times you get queued like herded cattle for the next stage. It all felt like trying too hard to make the mundane business of beer production seem interesting and exciting. It failed. I recommend you spend the 18E admission on buying some of their beer, I think you will be much happier. I know I would have been."

Unlike other breweries that offer a nice selection of real brews, the Heineken tour is gimmicky which is likely a ploy to distract you from the fact you'll be sampling a college party beer. Fine, I get it Heineken, you're unique, can I have a beer now? In the tasting room the bar man poured a beer and then so kindly explained to us why women don't generally like beer. Excuse me? This ought to be good, I thought. Apparently us females can't appreciate a good beer because we sip on it with our pinkies up (the bar man even demonstrated our error for us!). Oh my god, I thought to myself, he's right! I've been drinking beer like a British lady drinking tea my whole life and THAT is why Heineken tastes like p*** water to me. So after informing us ladies that we can't appreciate a good beer because we drink it wrong, he told us to inspect the beer's light yellow color. He called golden, I called it pee. Then the bar man told us to drink up \"like a man\". Boy am I glad I finally visited Heineken so I can at last appreciate drinking beer the right way: like a man."

The historical part of the visit and also the technical part are not enough complete.The positive point is the end of the tour which is composed by different type of attraction like the possibility to take fake picture in certain part of the bulding and other stuff like that. In overall, it was a pleasant experience due to the fact that the last part of the show is clearly well prepared. However, if you want to learn about how beer is produced I advise you to look for a smaller company."

He started talking to me like was no one else there and I have to admit he was really nice to me. I just can't remember his name, unfortunately. I live on Uk for a few years and I have say that I always drink Guinness (a lot more heavier and black), but this experience make me try Heineken and I'll for sure start drinking it know. We had a bracelet in the beginning with two \"coins\" that you can change for two drinks in the end, don't have to be beer. They have soft drinks too. I specially loved the shirts from football, as I'm a Portuguese it make me feel so proud seeing 3 shirts in 4 from Portuguese man. All the experience it's worth it and you can make your own bottle in the end (you just can't fly with her if you only have hand luggage).

The concept is pretty nice with some cool attractions during the tour. In cause of the bad weather the place was totally crowded and there were waiting times up to 30 minutes without any information what will happen next. If you buy your tickets in advance at a shop of city sightseeing, you do not have to stand in line and can use the fast lane for entering the place."

They take you through the process of making the beer and you get to taste it at its first stage, give it a try, it's only a couple of sips and you will get some proper lager later in the tour to wash the taste away!We were taught how to taste beer properly! Take a decent gulp of beer \"through\" the frothy head, not a sip which will contain more head than actual beer! Who knew? And I thought it was ladylike to sip your beer! Apparently not!There are a couple of green screens where you can sing karaoke while cycling through the streets of Amsterdam, always good to capture on film to delight your family and friends!You finally end up in the bar, where the buttons on your wristband can be exchanged for beer, and now you know how to drink beer properly!There are loads of photo opportunities and the experience is very well laid out. The staff are very entertaining and knowledgeable. Prost!"

Still there was long queue and we had to wait nearly 20-30 mins queue before we had a chance to get inside Heineken experience. This was a good 4D experience and if you have kids they would love it. There are nice games around that you could spend some time on and yes you get free bears(best part..atleast I got it with my ticket).

There were interactive sections where you could 'play' rugby, play FIFA on the Playstation, take photos, do karaoke etc. You obviously get to learn how Heineken is made and the history of brewing too.

This building is no longer the active brewery, so they have turned it into a mega marketing Heineken self paced walk. My two highlights were the 4D movie, which was creative, and seeing the horses. The actual info about brewing beer is severely lacking in comparison to other beer tours I have done. The tour is very commercialized, I'm pretty shocked that it's rated so highly on tripadvisor. I settled on 2/5 based on this: we were there on a very rainy day. In terms of away to get out of the rain, I'd give it 3/5. In terms of my other beer based experiences around the world, this is hands down the worst. 1/5. Take it for what it's worth."

The story of the way the Heineken family have built up the business over the years and how the founder's values were observed are very interesting. During the experience you see an interactive video of the brewing process including a 'ride' using motion platform whereby you are the product in its various stages of production passing through the machinery. You also get the chance to try pouring a perfect glass of beer and to taste the product. Recommended."

He knew a lot of stuff about Heineken and it was all very interesting. First we got a tour around the old brewery, then we went to a private bar for the beer tasting (five beers + refill). We also got very good cheese picked specially for the beer we were tasting.We skipped all the queue throughout our visit and got two beers in the end on the rooftop as everyone else. It was really crammed with people, and Stefan told us it is normally even busier in the weekends. So, really happy for treating ourselves with the VIP tour and I would really recommend people choosing that one."

I've been to a couple of other less well known brewery tours that have lasted 45 minutes max and I was expecting much the same at Heineken... How very wrong I was! For \u20ac25 we went for the brewery tour, boat ride and Lookout tower entry. The tour of Heineken, which you do at your own pace unless you have arranged a guided tour, took about 1.5 hours and it was AMAZING. I don't really drink lager but the whole experience in the brewery was very informative, from the creators of the lager to the horses that are used and the amount of sponsorship that they carry out around the world. The staff were very friendly and attentive and provided very informed talks on their section. The normal tour includes a free sample of Heineken after the sensory experience of being the beer, a hilarious attraction as part of the tour, but our entrance fee also included 2 more halves of Heineken and a wrist band. I think a lot of people rate this attraction as a good place to go because they like lager, but I would like to recommend it to non lager drinkers as it is a very informative tour. After the tour of the brewery we left on the Heineken canal tour. This took us from Heineken to the LookOut which is based near central station. Queue more Heineken (\u20ac2.50 per bottle) on route. You can then choose to end the tour at the LookOut or return back to the Heineken Brewery and see more of the canals. As we had paid for entry to the LookOut we got off the boat. Excellent way to spend 2-3 hours in any weather."

Visitors walk around an old (apparently inactive) brewery site, and are exposed to different videos and presentations on the history of Heineken and brewing, an old brewery site, an area with horses and delivery cart, and lots of interactive \"fun\"activities. The tour ends with a tasting plus two small beers in their rooftop bar with a nice view of central Amsterdam. I wanted to like it, but it came off as too touristy for my liking."

Upon arrival you get a headset so that the guide can give you a more detailed narration during the walk through. Afterwards you go to a private old-timey bar to sample beers and hear more stories about the beer and the company (all while eating various cheeses). Total time was just about 2.5 hours.This was a fun experience, our host Joost (I think that's how you spell his name) was excellent as was the tour, beer, and experience. We were able to try a new concept beer (Heineken H41) that isn't wide spread yet which was also good.Would recommend doing this attraction once and going for the VIP tour, it's fun."

People were robbed during my tour and in the end, I was accused of robbing a camera just because I had a backpack with me. The security guard said that the security footage showed a guy like me, taking a camera away from another tourist... It was really an awkward situation and therefore I didn't like the experience."

The tour is self guided and because of this you end up in queues and end up missing out sections because people just end up crowding round things and you just can't see. You can only walk round the brewery in one direction and when you get to the brewery ride you end up standing in a queue for ages just for a 5 minute simulation ride, which you can't skip so you have to endure. You stand in a room where the floor moves, water is sprayed at you and the room becomes really hot while you watch a video about how beer is bottled.. You then walk out into the tasting room where a bar attendant gives you a small glass of Heineken and then talks you through a script of how you're meant to drink it. There are then around 2 or 3 floors full of interactive games which are fun, but if you're not into this then you're basically skipping everything. We couldn't find the bar for our 2 free taster Heineken's and the staff were not helpful at all so we just left. The whole experience is clearly just a tourist trap. I'm not into beer at all and would happily skip this, my boyfriend who is into beer would also have happily skipped this also. We feel like we completely wasted an entire afternoon."

Through the experience there are a number of interactive experiences, such as pulling the perfect pint, bottling your own beer, tasting the not so tasty hops, and games such as kicking a rugby ball and a scrum game. Unfortunately these 2 games were not working when we visited.There is a lot of history of the advertisement of Heineken through the tour. Ranging from posters to the different bottles throughout the year. There is a talk in the middle of the experience where a guide takes you through tasting a glass of Heineken. A free glass. I don;t like lager or beer but after she told us how to drink it, it tasted 'slightly' better. The other 2 drinks that you receive you are free to drink at the end of the tour on the rooftop bar. Additional tokens are also on sale for \u20ac2.50 which is cheaper than anywhere else in Amsterdam. They also sell BBQ burgers."

Apparently they use four ingredients to brew the heineken bear. These are oats, hops, yeast and water. The yeast is special and is the yeast which was cultured by the founder of the brewery. We then saw a movie and finally went to the top floor of the building to sample the bear. Needless to say that Heineken beer tastes great. The place was very lively and we could also buy hamburgers. I highly recommend touring this venue if you are in Amsterdam."

There's a clear direction you have to take, so any interesting parts (which is few and far between on this tour) ends up packed with people. We went monday & it was a beautiful warm day in Amsterdam... which translates to a hot, sticky day when you're stuck in a small room with 50 other people. It's more of warehouse with a bunch of Heineken memorabilia than a brewery tour. Then there's parts of the tour that are compulsory, like the simulation ride. So you end up in a massive queue. We were huddled into groups like cattle to be put into these simulators which were completely ridiculous. Basically, the floor moves a bit whilst you watch a video of beer being bottled. Then you're straight out into the tasting room where a girl was frantically trying to pour everyone a sample, run through her tasting script, & get you out of the room before the simulator stopped & the next herd of people came in. The best bit about the whole tour was the roof top bar, where you get your 2 beers... which were taster sized. But, you pay for a Heineken experience, and an experience was exactly what we got."

After that there are several interactive exhibits where you can learn to pour beer and customize a bottle of beer. There were also sports exhibits. These you can skip to get to the roof deck where you are served your next two beers. The outside deck has great views and little stand-up tables.

We had booked our tickets online because reviews said the queues were really long if you didn't. The day we went on a Sat afternoon about 2.30pm and there was a queue for paying in on the door and prepaid tickets. The prepaid tickets queue did move quicker but neither queue was very big.It is a self guided tour that you walk around but the app is good and worthwhile downloading for some extra information. There is wifi at the experience but it is a bit slow, I would recommend downloading it before you get there.The brew you ride is just a little bit of fun and you learn about the process. After that there is a tasting room where they teach you how to drink beer properly and you get a small taster to practice with. Then it is on to some interactive exhibits about Heineken's link to sport. There are photo booths where you can take your picture and they turn it into a Heineken picture. The good thing about this is it's free and you can email the photo to yourself, there is also an option to print it out for \u20ac1.The final stop is the bar where you can get 2 free pints (of Heineken or Pepsi). There is a rooftop area but you are not able to take drinks there and we were unfortunately too late to enjoy this (it closes at 5). I would definitely recommend visiting here for a fun couple of hours."

It is indeed quite a cool place, lots of games and ads however it does not feel like a brewery anymore (they don't do any brewing here anymore). In the end you get a couple of beers and a chance go hang out at their bar...So, if you're into Heineken, love advertising and games it's worth it.

Following this was your first tasting experience where you were provided with a half pint of fresh draught heinekenl There was then specific areas where you are able to take green screen photos, play fifa and some rugby games, next you were able to personalise and buy your own bottle of heineken (which was around 15euros) and finally it ended with your second half pint where you were able to sit and relax in a sort of 'fanzone' before leaving the museum.It was a great experience, I feel like there possibly could been a lot more to the tour but fantastic none the less!"

Then how the stuff is made, some science, some interactive gadgetry and overall a very interesting few hours. We also bottled our own beer and had a custom bottle printed up! A must for Heineken and non-Heineken drinkers alupa!"

First I'll say, in my opinion, this experience isn't really a lot of fun for children under 14The theme is all about the history of the company, it's successes and the different ways that they sponsor events where you can enjoy their beer. They also promote responsible drinking which they should.Yes, they provide juice for kids while you get beer and there are a lot of interactive activities and professional game memorabilia that my child enjoyed, it's still an adult focused (which is appropriate) tour.So for a family of young kids, I wouldn't recommend it. For an older family it could be a good time, for an an adult group it's a great time.There's a good restaurant at the end of the tour and the live band we had was terrific. Overall the experience is very good, it's not short nor rushed or lacking. You can tell they spent some time thinking about how to present themselves and making it interesting and fun.A heads up- Try not to go on a weekend or at lunch time."

You continue the tour by visiting the old brewery halls, with big bronze kettles and all what belongs to a brewery, at this place you can also taste how an unfiltered Heineken tastes before the hops are added. Following is a visit to the horse stables, which contains Shire horses, and you might even be lucky to see them pulling the Heineken charts around the streets of Amsterdam. After the visit to the stalls, you will enter a small movie theater, giving you some sort of virtual reality feeling of being brewed like a beer. After personally being \u201cbrewed\u201d, you will learn how to professionally taste a quality beer and the points you should focus on. The Heineken Experience finishes with many activities connected to the activities they sponsor, including the Olympic Holland Heineken House, Rugby World Championships, Football (soccer) clubs and the like.

Some were informative and others were purely for fun. We were able to see the horses in their stables, having just returned from one of their twice daily promotional walks. We were taught how to pour beer correctly and also how to drink it properly. There was a total of three beers included in the entrance fee -one for the learning and two for enjoyment.

This place had been recommended and as a group of four, travelling to Amsterdam on a day trip, we decided this would be a good place to start! I'd booked our tickets online, so we walked straight in and didn't have to queue and were given our wrist bands with two tokens for two beers.The tour starts with me historical background about the heineken family and how the franchise all began, before we moved on to the ingredients and how the beer is actually produced. Throughout the tour, there were plenty of opportunities to get involved with photos, videos and games which were amusing and entertaining. I found the process of the beer making really interesting (much more than I thought I would) and I think this was down to how well executed the place was.The beer tasting stop was great and made us take pause to examine our small beer, after our 4D experience, rather than just down it! Then it was chance to use our tokens and enjoy two heinekens (or one if you wanted to put it yourself.)We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Only gripe, would be we would have rather exchange one of our tokens either at the start or the middle of the tour, rather than both at the end."

At the end you get 2 free beers that you can enjoy in a beautiful rooftop terrace. Enjoy!!"

The staff were very welcoming and the exhibits they had on were informative and engaging. The tasting was particularly welcome, and put at the right moment (we were quite thirsty at that time!).  All in all, without giving away the features, everything regarding Heineken origins and branding was explained. The other side to the experience was the actual brewing process, which in my opinion could have been better illustrated by exhibits similar to that of the Heineken history exhibit.  The beer at the end of the tour was very appreciated. Thanks to the whole team at Heineken. Proost from the UK!"

The building is just great, Brick factory feel on the outside yet very modern when you walk in. To avoid queuing outside, purchase your ticket online and just pick it up at the second door. The experience starts off with the history of Heineken, what it stands for and so on. Further on you get to see how the beer is made, the ingredients, the machines. The place is techy and visual so it creates a very interactive run-through which makes it more enjoyable. Towards the end, you can take pictures and play some games but the very best part is the two complimentary beers you get with the ticket, and that s not all; you get to enjoy those beers on the roof! amazing terrace with a wonderful view accompanied by an awesome beer. Before you finally exit, you get to visit the store where you can purchase plenty of souvenirs, but in my opinion, the best one was the personalised beer bottle with your name on it."

The experience itself was amazing, learnt so much about all aspects of the brand, from Heineken himself to how to brew the perfect Heineken beer, and there is also a stables in which I personally loved as they were beautiful! There is a section where you can print onto your own bottle, and section for football lovers, the evolvement on the design and even a virtual part which was better than I expected! The tour also included a beer tasting section which tells you how to drink Heineken the right way! The tour ended by taking you up to the rooftop bars where you can use your 2 wristband tokens to collect your Heineken beers, my brother and mum didn't want them however there was a coke option for them which they could receive with their tokens aswell! We started on the outside bar which over looked the city which was beautiful before heading into the inside bar which was lovely and played good music! At the end of the tour you end in the gift shop which sell everything and anything with the obvious Heineken name printed. Overall an excellent experience and brilliant price for what is involved, would definitely recommend this to everyone!"

Once we found the other line, we were able to jump the queue, that was quite long and walk right in. The experience is more like a museum, talking about the founders, then how the beer is made, they show you the horse stables, then they brew you, serve you beer and then share with you the sporting events they've sponsored. I was bored of reading all the PowerPoint presentations and was really hoping to end up in an actual factory and see beer being brewed, but that's not the case. I really felt we were being indoctrinated with Heineken marketing. We were given one free beer sample as part of the tour and on the conclusion of the tour we could have gone to the patio to have two more beers (included when you purchase online from their website ahead of time). The gift shop had some cool novel items."

Definitely recommended to go there in the weekend, we had a live band playing there at the end as well.

As we made our way through, our guide brought us to areas to skip the crowd and areas not open to the public (Like seeing the horses up close!).The best part of the tour was our private beer tasting with paired cheeses. It was nice to sit back and relax and try beers we haven't ever tried before. After the tasting, we went to the rooftop patio (closed to the public) and enjoyed the beautiful city views, with of course, more beer! Definitely a lovely experience and would highly recommend to a group, friends, or couples."

It starts with the history of the brewery and it's brand. Taking a walk through the old brewery and a visit to the cart horses, you walk into the most amazing interactive displays you could imagine. You get to know what it feels like to be a bottle of beer, pour the perfect pint, do some green screen karaoke, play on the ps4 and buy bottles of beer with your name etched on them and much more. All this is followed by a trip to the rooftop bar to enjoy 2 free drinks and an amazing view of the city. While we were in the bar, the most amazing live band started playing so we stayed on for some extra drinks while they played. Soft drinks are also available for non drinkers and children which makes it a great day for all ages. I'd happily pay it a return visit."

Whilst this meant we skipped the line outside it didn't mean we avoided the large queues inside.It was interesting to find out about the history of the family behind Heineken, but there were bottlenecks in certain places especially on the stairs and subsequent queues to the 4D attraction. In essence, it was a self guided tour with staff at certain points so you could ask questions.In the end we decided to skip the 4D attraction & took the lift to the rooftop. This where you can redeem your two tokens - obtained when you enter - for a couple of beers. If the weather is nice you'll be able to have your drink on the rooftop overseeing Amsterdam. This is by far the most enjoyable part of the experience.Overall, I would recommend that you skip the tour itself & find something else to do with your time in this most cosmopolitan of cities."

Seeing a trip combined with the brewery tour and savings to be made we gave it a go.The screen above the cashier showed Brewery experience, 2 beers, canal trip and lookout tower, 25 euros each.The brewery experience started with a little history and then a explanation that beer is made from 4 ingredients. If one drinks beer one should know what it is made of. After that the tour degenerated into a Heineken advert.It finished with a trip to the top of the building where there were some decent views over the city. We were also allowed 2 small glasses of Heineken.Then to the boat tour where the Heineken boat was replaced by a standard canal cruiser. There was a little notice on our table stating that earphones would be provided and could be plugged in to one of many languages. No earphone and no commentary.The trip started with the guide saying we would be travelling for 30 mins and then getting off to go up the lookout tower.Sure enough, after 25 mins the guide said that the end of the trip was approaching and we had to get off, show our tickets and we could go up the tower.To get back there was a free ferry to Central Station from where we could make our own way back to the starting point on the other side of the city.Most other canal cruises are circular and last between one and one and a quarter hours.So we got off and joined the queue for the tower. Approaching the front of the queue we could see each person being offered to have their photo taken for free.We declined and took the express lift to the viewing platform. The lift had good animations and the viewing platform was impressive. Then down the lift where surprise, surprise, the prints of the free photos were now on sale.So then, a free ferry ride (free to everyone) and then work out how to get to our starting point.I am amazed Heineken, taking into account their ethical stance, allow their name to be used in such a manner."

Myself and 2 friends enjoyed most of the tour of the brewery and what felt at the end like being in an advertisement for the beer until...we were in the bar! Go figure! First the tour ends in the gift shop so we had to ask how to get to the lounge...the entrance seemed hidden. We made it up to a beautiful lookout of Amsterdam and ordered our complimentary pints. The bartender served all 3 of us both at the same time. We thought that was weird until it made sense that they wanted everybody out in 15 minutes. Needless to say, we did not enjoy our beer or the scenery because the security was hurrying us and everyone out at 8pm! The staff at Heineken seemed apologetic but the security staff couldn't care less...their shift was obviously over! I work in hospitality and I've seen it all, but this rudeness of the security takes the cake! I'd understand if we were being boisterous or causing some sort of scene, but this wasn't the case. To top everything off the security guards took the elevator down to the main floor with us and a group of other visitors and patronized us by baiting us with \"What's wrong ladies?\" Sensing our displeasure with the treatment we received. At that point, no one in my group wanted to have words with the guards...we were in an elevator with other guests! But he wouldnt take our silence and kept badgering us to tell him \"what was wrong.\" I am obviously more apt to write this review now instead of arguing with him. To sum up... this is a review of the Heineken Experience but more so of the security company with whom they have a contract. Heineken, I would advise either a) Do not admit guests at 7pm or near the time when security finishes their shift and/or b) do some customer service training with all staff including security. We looked forward to this excursion while visiting Amsterdam and for the price we did not expect nor enjoy the ridicule and embarassment we received."

You wait in a long line for what they describe as simulation where you become a beer bottle. I had no idea what they meant. In the end it was definitely worth it!! It reminded me of the honey I shrunk the kids ride in Disney world - but shorter! There are fun photo booths and other simulations later on that would be great for friends/couples. You end on the roof. There's a lot of indoor space, but the outdoor space would be ideal on a nice day. It was worth the trip!"

Then you get to do some pretty cool things like take photos and a video singing karaoke (won't give it all away either) and I REALLY liked the 'email it to yourself ' option on the photos because not everyone can afford or wants a physical momento of the museum.

The staff are friendly, polite and funny-the whole atmosphere is relaxed and easy going. You get 2 glasses of beer included in the price and also a taster glass as you go around. The sky bar is brilliant with great views over Amsterdam. There is also the option for a boat trip too to see another Heineken building but we didn't do this for time constraints. Definitely in the top 5 things to do in Amsterdam if you are there."

Super busy, and not going on that really gave us that \"wow\" factor. There are some interactive things to do towards end of tour and the patio upstairs was great at the end of with a couple small beers included in the ticket price. Overall would not highly recommended unless you have a bit of time on your hands and don't know a lot about good beer and the process of making it. If your a beer tour virgin and like Heineken, you might be okay to have a bit of fun."

Queue was outside the door when I arrived, but was delt with quickly and efficiently. There was no 'up-selling' when I ordered my basic ticket.Very little in the way of the actual brewing of the beer- the tour wouldn't last that long if it was, but more about the actual company, and what they do.Inside you can spend a lot more Euros if you wish. You can print a label on a bottle, have your picture taken with a false city-scape behind you, or bizarrely peddle a bicycle. Football memorabilia and Rugby Union get a section- and rugby is explained to those from countries where it's not so well known.I felt a little herded around the place (despite it not being a guided tour), as all anyone really wanted was the two freebies at the top. Sky Bar is popular and sells more than just Heineken, including soft drinks.There is (or was at time of visit), a barbecue (veg burgers witnessed but done on the same barbecue), at \u20ac7.50 it's fairly pricy, buy your ticket at the bar, and present it to the barbecue-istas (is that a word?). Lifts to and from the bar, one lift one direction, so expect a queue to leave.All in all, not bad, but not great either. "

To be fair, it is basically a giant advertisement for Heineken and to go in expecting anything else would be silly but compared to the Guinness tour in Dublin for example, it just felt a bit lacklustre and could have been better. It did come with a couple of beers and it was a pretty extensive tour so I while I wouldn't say it's not worth it, it certainly isn't essential."

But as you carry on there seems to be more and more things to do which I personally think ends up being extremely worth the 16 euros paid. I won't ruin it for you but I'd definately recommend!"

You learn loads about how Heineken is made, the history of the family and the brand without there being too much overwhelming information. The tasting at the end is great to experience and you get to head up to the rooftop bar for free drinks at the end. The outdoor bar patio section gives a great view across the local area. At no point are you rushed through to make room for the next group... You could easily spend the afternoon in the bar area enjoying the experience. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable."

You have the opportunity to print your own labels on Heineken bottles of beer at a minimal price, they do onsite engraving of glasses and other souvenirs. It is second only to the Guinness brewery in Dublin. No other brewery in Europe comes close to these two.When in Amsterdam, make a point of going it's well worth it and if you like beer you will love it! Oh and you get a taster and two drinks free when you buy your tickets!"

The first part of the tour was fine but at some point it became very commercial and felt like they were just putting things in the tour that were just not necessary. Like all the sports that Heineken is a part of, try kicking a football, a room with lots of colored lights and mirrors...if you had started drinking before the tour, all of these various things would be fun, I guess. Just seemed way to promotional and less informational. The tasting room was crowded but, the room was nice with the various pictures of places around the world, and the beer was great. Having been through the Guiness factory prior to Heineken, I felt this was just not as informative or done as well as Guiness. If you are on the younger side and are going to do the tour with a bunch of friends, I see how this could be a fun experience."

A long the way you get to taste beer before it's finished and compare it to how it tastes when it's done. Short queues, excellent staff, okay prices and it was overall a nice experience. I reccommend buying the ticket with Heineken canal boat after the museum, if the weather is nice. Beverages are sold on board and you get to see a lot! You also get a little gift towards the end."

The entrance price included a wrist band with 2 tokens for beers at the end of the tour. There was also a small beer each to look at, smell and drink as part of the tour. We had the first drink in the bar we arrived at first, and then went up to the rooftop bar. If we went back again we would go straight to the rooftop bar and have both drinks up there. There is also a nice gift shop where you can get glasses etched with your name etc. The tour is self led for the most part so can take as little or as long as you like. We did almost everything and had the beers at the end. We spent about 3 hours there in total, but you could probably get round in an hour / an hour and a half if you were short on time."

We had purchased our tickets from the \"tours and tickets\" shop which you can find on any street, this enabled us to skip the queues which were pretty long for 2pm. I found the Heineken Experience really informative. The first part is more like a museum which has many informative historical facts on how Heineken was first brewed and how it has remained in the family business. I found all the photos of the Heineken family very interesting, as well as the authentic interiors, gold medals and the differential bottles of Heineken throughout the years. Within the experience there is an interactive part where you can \"play\" rugby by swinging your legs in the air and scoring, there is also another interactive part where you are made to fill like you are in a Heineken bottle - be warned, you do get a bit wet. Best part of the experience was of course the free beer, and to be honest it was rather nice beer. During the experience you get 1 free beer while the bar man gives you some history about Heineken. If you have paid for a ticket which entitles you to 2 free beers you will get these at the end of the tour and I suggest drinking these on the roof top, especially on a nice sunny day, you can grab a tan as well as getting a great view of the city. Don't forget to visit the shop at the end. Great experience overall, I highly recommend."

I would really recommend going to the Heineken Experience if you are going to Amsterdam, even if you aren't that interested in beer."

The instructional displays in the beer kegs were very clever, and the Heineken \"ride\" was fun. And, of course, there's free beer.

Our tour guide was very entertaining and knowledgeable, and first brought us through the existing exhibits with some extended commentary. Topics were interesting but it was unfortunately rather hard to hear him with all the competing noise from exhibit audio and big crowds of visitors. Too many tourists in July! The private tasting was much better. Our small group sampled four different kinds of beer which Heineken brews or licenses, with good discussion about how each style varies. Fresh Heineken beer at the brewery and on tap in Amsterdam is quite delicious and extremely refreshing. I wish I could get this in the USA, but it does not import well and tends to taste very different. Good to experience the original at last."

I was pleasantly surprised to see how forward thinking the original owner was in looking after his employees. There was a video game room with three consoles set up for Xbox Fifa play. A DJ stand and a lot of photo ops. It all culminated with two glasses of Heineken Beer in the tasting room at the end. There was also a quick demonstration on how to pour and drink your beer. The tour ends in the gift shop with a wide selection of souvenirs."

Lots of movies and nice courses to learn about Heineken's way of working and secret ingredients.Then, it's time for interactive playing. You can make lots of funny pictures and movies that you can receive on your personal email. Nice and smart to keep a nice souvenir for free.Lastly, time for tasting. You have a first small glass with a speech to explain you how you should drink Heineken. With the tour, you'll also get two additional glasses (half pints). I recommend to go on the rooftop bar (also included with the tour), where you can also get your free drinks, with a very nice view and atmosphere.Fun experience, worth the price."

Only down side was that we were offered a free canal trip associated with this visit but unfortunately for us I had booked and paid for a different canal trip which followed on from this visit so was unable to accept the free one....Doh"

Having visitet quite a frew breweries around the world already, being Dutch myself and hearing pretty much everybody say the Heineken Experience is a typical tourist trap, my expectations were set low when deciding to visit this anyway.I was blown away.The way they've set up this tour is unbelievably cool and I have never seen anything even remotely near before at any brewerey anywhere in the world.The tour starts as most typical brewery tours will start, some history, some photos, some stories being told. But this is just a tiny fragment of the tour and there's even an escape path to avoid this standard stuff if you're not interested in the history.What really made it personal was that at several places there were real human being enthusiastically telling about how the beer was brewed and how things work. And they really knew their stuff. You were allowed to smell, taste, ask questions, make jokes, take pictures, all was welcomed by the amazingly friendly staff.The way of projecting movies inside the huge copper chambers is also very original. To taste \"beer\" before the sugars are transformed to alcohol is also a very original experience. The story about the horses surprised me. I had never heard of this before.The movie on how beer was made was awesomely pleasantly made. Really fun to watch and experience. Far more fun than listening to a standard story being told by someone how they brew beer.The \"how to drink a Heineken\" was very original and fun. Awesome how they presented this. And having been a beer drinker for quite some years already, it surprised me and I learned something right there.The part that comes after the beer tasting is just superly creative. Simply brilliant. Interaction all along. Fun, games, photos, creativity, really really beautifully done.You even get a chance to tap your own beer at the end. How much fun is that?Even though I'm not much of a fan of Heineken beer, I certainly enjoyed this tour and I can definitely, without any single slightest doubt, recommend visiting this place, whether you're a tourist from abroad or tourist within The Netherlands.Small tip, if you buy your tickets online, you don't have to wait in line. Entrance fee is 18 euro per person. No difference between buying then when arriving there or online at the Heineken Experience website. There's no set time, you can just arrive whenever you want. There are other websites however which offer discounts on the tickets. Just Bing for Heineken Experience ticket discount and you'll find them. I got my tickets for 14,40 euro per adult. Not a huge difference, but still, why not. Received via e-mail within a minute after purchasing online and directly valid to be used at the Heineken Experience by having them scan the barcode from the e-mail displayed on your phone. Modern day technology at work!Last tip. visit after 6 PM. It will be a LOT less crowded by then which makes the whole experience way more fun. There's no joy of standing in line for every attraction. We didn't have to wait a minute anywhere."

I bought the tour + canal cruise ticket (\u20ac25). All of it was fantastic. The tour was interactive with fun things to do along the way, as well as have a couple beers at the end. The cruise was nice too. You could also buy more Heineken on the cruise. It dropped us off at the Lookout (across from Centraal). You could have waited for the next cruise to take you back or you could find your own way, which is what I did. Worth it!"

This is the best piece of advertising you will ever be a part of.

Not that that's a bad thing (Heineken is great). By establishing a personal connection while simultaneously intertwining it with Dutch pride and culture, it's hook/line/sinker by the time you arrive for your free beers at the end. As much admiration as it gives me for the people behind the curtain, it wasn't worth the money and time I spent on it. Far too many other things to do in Amsterdam, all of which are better."

It focuses a lot on the sports and music to fill a few floors with photo booths and other gimmicks. The wristband and coin idea is good but it's a let down when it's only a half pint for one. Would recommend going to the sixth floor to have a taste of it if it's a nice day out. Unfortunately I was expecting more about the beer and how it has developed instead of what it sponsored. Still worth a visit."

I visited this place in April and thought it was such a good experience that we decided to return with the whole family when we visited Amsterdam again in July.We have done quite a few different brewery tours around the world and this one is very different to the others in a positive sense.The self guided tour starts with a lot of the typical brewery history and beer making stuff, supplemented with staff at key locations who give more interactive information. This is followed by a tour through the horse stables, where you can see the actual horses that travel throughout Amsterdam each day.The tour then changes pace dramatically and becomes more modern and interactive. The short simulator ride is harmless and keeps you engaged short time it takes.You then travel through a series of rooms with interactive displays with karaoke, video recording, footie kicking, rugby scrumming, foosball, etc, which is really great for the kids and their Mum and kept them very engaged.Finally the beer tasting (for the adults) and the souvenir shop, which has lots of variety. The kids get free Pepsi if they want it.The Heineken experience is centrally located and only a few hundred metres from the museum precinct and Vondelpark, and can be reached by tram or bus.I would highly recommend this experience."

It is very interactive, all the displays are in English and there is good humour in the videos and from the staff themselves. I would recommend buying the fast track tickets from one of the ticket shops in the city centre as there was a long queue for those without tickets but we were able to walk straight in. I would recommend this tour."

From the video clips depicting the brewing process instead of seeing a live demonstration, to the gimmicky \"brew you ride.\" It was a bit of a letdown compares to other brewery/distillery tours. If you enjoy extremely busy tourist destinations without much substance then this is more your thing. That being said, Heineken does taste much better on draught than in bottle."

Every aspect was well timed and spaced so that it did not get to crowded in any one place. WELL DONE. Also the beer was great. You end up getting 3-4. .3L beers as part of the tour and tons of fun interactive rooms to experience at the end as well. I actually did a combo ticket that also included a canal ride and tower ticket. Together not a bad price, ($28 at the door. I believe I have seen other prices quoted elsewhere) I wouldn't suggest doing JUST the canal tour or JUST the tower, but it was lovely when tacked on to the Heineken tour."

The Experience is well laid out and allows you to really get a good understanding of how the Heineken brand came to be. There are lots of stairs up and down, but nothing you can't handle. There are several interactive booths to take pictures and do things, and many displays of old bottles, and logos. and be sure to check out the label illusion on the floor as you pass from room to room....its pretty cool. Don't miss the interactive ride where you become the beer!!!If you are beer drinker, you will be given some wrist bands that allow you to get a few glasses of beer. The first one in the tasting room is not large, and is just a sample. Once you pass through that room, there is an actual lounge area where you can get a much large glass of beer. I did not see anyone checking, so you may be able to get more if you like. Once you pass through the building, you exit through the gift shop, which is large and on two floors. There are some very pretty girls that work at the registers and they were very friendly and helpfulIf you are with a group of friends, looking for a night out, or are a fan of the Heineken brand, this is a must see. I will most definitely go back...."

It is an exceptionally well put together exhibition of the history of the Heineken family right through to the beer making process. There is so much to see along the way and you become totally immersed in the surroundings. Some of the displays are quite brilliant so do yourself a favour and go along to see for yourself.There are staff explaining the processes as you move through the museum and you get to sample the beer along the way as well as at the very end. The staff at the various displays are very knowledgeable and the bar staff are very friendly also.Would consider it a must see for any beer lover and for travellers in general. Also recommend you purchase your ticket in advance at most ticket outlets around the city as it can save you a couple of Euros and avoid unnecessary delays gaining entry."

The simulation with the long wait was extremely funny and it was stunning to see how little plant equipment evolved from 1913 to the 1950'ies. The wait was made fun by the great photographer who was using Polariods and great personal charm to make people forget the half hour wait for no reason other than the not so optimal ticker counter. I do expect most people like the tasting, commercial and games part much better but I skipped that quickly; I prefer to choose the alcohol that floods my body during down time ;-).

You can send the files to your email for free. One of the movies is on a moving platform so you feel like you are moving through the scenes as you see how beer is made from beginning to end.At the end, you can trade in the buttons on your wristband to two drinks (beer or soda) or you can use them to get a beer pouring certificate.

But we thought we would be able to see beer being brewed for real here. Yet, it's interesting for beer lovers who get to sample beer, know more about it and at the end of it get two glasses beer to drink in a pub like atmosphere. Lots of photo ops too. But if you're on a short trip to Amsterdam, wanting to do other stuff, you can skip this."

The Heineken Experience is located in the old Heineken brewing building that now hosts not only group tours but also individuals can tour on their own. Our group of 5 (ages 36-23) sprung for the Heineken Experience and I am very happy we did because I don't typically drink beer therefore am not very interested. Our tour guide was a wealth of information covering the history of the building, the family that owns it and the brewing process of Heineken. We were given samples of the beer in varies brewing stages. The building is large with lots of walking, stairs and elevators. We were able to skip the lines for a personalized Heineken glass, interactive movie and a private beer/cheese tasting with our tour guide. Then we were brought to the roof of the building for an amazing outdoor view of the Amsterdam skyline. Our tour ended with a interactive games following a party-type atmosphere to use our free beer tokens. Of course the 2 story Heineken gift shop before you leave. This place can get quite crowded and I would recommend wearing comfortable shoes but I thought this place was fun. As soon as I got back home I purchased a case of Heineken."

No need to print them just scanned our phones on entry. You can take as long as you want as it's a self guided tour we spent about two hours here. The initial part is the history of the company which was interesting. There are lots of interactive activities throughout the tour such as how to pour the perfect pint, try your hand at being a DJ, video yourself riding a bike through Amsterdam while singing tulips from Amsterdam on the karaoke! The 4D experience of beer being bottled was good. The sports area was fun too. You can put your name on a bottle of Heineken and collect it at the end. At the end of the tour you have two tokens on your entry wristband which you can use in the bar. One token for either a glass of Heineken or H41 or use both tokens for a large extra cold Heineken.

We purchased tickets as a combination with ice bar on board the hop on hop off bus, would definitely recommend this option as it works out cheaper plus you avoid a potentially lengthy que to purchase a ticket on arrival! Overall a great tour, exploring the history of Heineken, the brewing process, a visual experience going through the brewing process and finally tasting, which was personally my favourite! We got 2 drink tokens with our ticket, which have us the option of 2 small heinekens at the end or one large xtra cold Heineken. Definitely worth the visit!"

You can go at your own pace which I really like; I've been to a bunch of breweries and it's frustrating when I get the same spiel about production over and over. You can make it last an hour or make it last 15 minutes, whatever you like. I think it was worth it for the experience alone. Make sure to spend needless money on customizing a beer bottle at the end - I got one for my dad for Father's Day and he loved it!"

You begin the tour with a brief section on Heineken's history which took place on the very spot on which you stand. Next there is a demonstration on how Heineken is made and you are able to walk around the old copper stills. The old brewery is beautiful and the information in this room is displayed in a clever and interesting manner.The tour also includes a guided beer tasting and many other interactive exhibits. The whole experience is 1-2 hours and well worth it. Even more so because the tour ends with two beers included in the price of admission! We were lucky enough that the weather had cleared up a bit by this time and we were able to have our beers on the rooftop patio with a view of the city! Soft drinks are available for those who don't want beer.The staff all had excellent customer service and provided great presentations and guidance throughout. Highly recommend!"

Most of the exhibits are centered around marketing or branding. The interactive exhibits seemed like a blast for people who came in small to medium sized groups, and that is what I would recommend doing if you come to the Heineken Experience. The two small beers you get at the end of the exhibit are definitely not worth the price of admission, so make sure you have fun along the way!"

A couple of suggestion is that the signage of where to go not the best. If you need elevators they are hard to find. In addition for the beer at end there are two lines one very slow as you pull your own draft with one working tap the. Other is very fast with poured beer One has to find out the hard way. The other comment during tour they tell you of a new beer they have. Introduced but when you get to try they have run out. Amazing"

If you book with them you can even get a deal for 16 euros.At first I was bit bewildered by the crowds but it ran very smoothly. Things have changed over the 34 years. The tour is more interactive with high-tech displays and shows. All the staff was very helpful and the souvenirs are special and personalized. Great brand awareness campaign for the Heineken company.Rather go week days than over weekends. Remember the doors close at 17h00 so they stop selling tickets 2 hour before.

We're pleased we did as it was quiet when we went in. It got busier throughout our visit. We learnt about the process of maki g lager in an interesting and informative way. It was a really interactive visit, from being able to grind the grain to pouring your own drink from the pump (and receiving a certificate for doing so). If you do this then you forfeit a drink, only one drink instead of two. The horses hadn't arrived after their exercise. The young man who was supervising this area sensed my disappointment at not being able to see them. So he said he would come and find us later on, when the horses had arrived. He did so and took us via the back route, to see the two horses. He was great and so helpful. We had two bottles of lager specially printed for our son in law, which were ready for us to collect from the shop at the end. As we were leaving we were asked if we'd like to take the Heineken boat back to The Hermitage Museum. A lovely touch. It was free of charge too. Drinks were available to buy onboard. I would thoroughly recommend this visit, even if you're not a massive beer fan! Just interesting to see the process from start to finish."

After the show, visitors convene at an area where Heineken staff teaches you how to see, smell and drink beer. Quite an eye-opener for a non-beer lover like me. At the end of the tour, you can trade your two tokens that come with the entrance wristband for: 1) a beer-pouring experience (and the glass of beer you poured); 2) two glasses of normal Heineken; or 3) a larger glass of Heineken Extra Cold. The drinking happens at the \"bar\" so this would be a good place to come with friends instead of alone."

It's self guided, the history of the company was interesting and I enjoyed looking at the brewing equipment and the horses but after that it turns into multi-media stuff and interactive games. Not quite what I was expecting and I was left somewhat underwhelmed by the whole place. That said our 12 year old loved it but any chance to do anything vaguely involving computers and he's happy. Staff were good, very friendly but I also was so disappointed with the bar area at the end where you get your 2 free drinks - loud, no windows, a very sticky floor and seating for about 6 people - not my idea of fun at all.I wouldn't recommend this, I think there are far better things to see and do in Amsterdam."

Of course I like beer and any time you have a chance to do one of these it's fun.Was concerned with a small line up to get in to purchase tickets and also seen several buses outside. Everything moved along well with this self guided tour. You didn't feel rushed. Enough areas within the building to keep you interested.The price was reasonable at $18 Euros. You get a free 1/2 pint of beer near the end of the tour and then two 1/2 pints at the end.If you go, word of advice, don't drink the H 41 beer. Hated the taste. But that's only my taste, you might like it.Worth the time to visit this place."

However, multimedia experiences and tasting makes this a very unique place. We planned on just \"stopping by\" to say we did it, and ended up spending 2 hours exploring and having fun. There are photo booths, a quirky karaoke video you can lip sync to and send to yourself or others by email, several lounges, a horse stable, foosball table, and interactive rugby games just to name a few. You get 2 tokens on your admission wristband that you can use to taste 2 Heinekens (classic or lager H41) or you can use both for a larger glass of ice cold Heineken. Highly recommend this for any beer lover!"

The stops along the tour had informative, enthusiastic guides giving you the beer making process and making it seem a lot more exciting than it is but still good information. Most of it, as you can imagine is marketing telling you how great Heineken is as a brand and a beer. There were a few fun interactive areas. You get 2 buttons you can use on 2 beers or to pour your own 1 beer. If you love Heineken, go for it. If you like Heineken, grab a draft nearby and look up the info online."

Easy to get to via the tram system or a 20 minute walk from Dam square the Heineken Experience is value for money and an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. When you pay you will receive a wrist band that has two tokens on which you will need later. The tour is a walking tour that covers the history of the brand, how the Heineken is brewed, bottled and marketed. Part of the tour is a simulator where you are the beer being bottled, there is a tasting area where you are given half a pint sampler and shown how to drink it, the bar tender will ask a couple of questions and the first person to correctly answer wins another drink! From there you go into an area that covers Heineken sponsorship with many different interactive experiences. At the end of the tour you can use your tokens in one of two choices either using two tokens to pour your own drink or you can exchange one token per half pint poured by the staff. From there you exit via the gift shop which has everything you could want branded with the Heineken logo, there is also the opportunity to have your name engraved on a Heineken glass which was very popular."

The \"simulator\" was interesting but not very good. The history of the Heineken family was a highlight as well as the dray horses. The last part of the experience involves a few beers in good company. Don't be fooled but the amount of beer you get is not what you may think. Two quarter litre glasses are included in the admission as well as a small taster. It's great for the younger visitors as its bright and has lots of flashing lights but perhaps not really related to beer as such. Overall a good experience for the price."

Even if you go there with children or those who don't drink beers, everyone must enjoy because soft drinks are also available and there are many playing areas inside. Good place to go with friends, family and even alone:)"

The whole thing is terribly set up, not engaging and I have to wonder what they themselves think about it. Filled with hokey videos, a bland history section that is so cramped that even if you had interest in looking at the exhibits, you wouldn't be able to do so due to the line pushing you forward and finally a loooong wait (some of which is inside the horse stable room, smelling of, well, horse stuff) for an interactive ride which, while maybe a bit cute, was not worth the time spent in a boring corridor getting there. In the end, after all your troubles, you receive 2 small beers. We did receive an \"invite\" to the rooftop bar which has a nice view, but steer clear of this tourist trap. You're better off throwing your 16 Euro in the canal."

Surely this must have been the rubbish that was collected at the end of the brewing process. I love my beers but only drunk half a glass of this liquid excrement.When we left the tasting room there were plenty of glasses with plenty of content in left behind.We felt betrayed and ripped off. For my son it was supposed to be the highlight of his trip to Europe but he felt exactly the same.There is absolutely nothing to see accept for some old copper scrap metal pots, who were taken out of service about 50 years ago, and adds, lots of adds.Avoid this place by all means!

The first part of the tour is the most interesting as it takes you through the brewing process and gives information on the ingredients and what they bring to the party. But once you have gone through the main brewing hall it starts to get a bit commercial and irrelevant. There is the \"interactive\" brew ride where you get bumped around and made wet on a virtual brewing tour. You then get a small taster of beer with a description of what the foam does etc. After this there is little else about beer making. There is one hall where the bottling takes place but this is simply a mock up of the filling lines and an opportunity to personalize a label for a few Euros. After that there is nothing about beer at all and the rest of the tour is centered on adverts, old bottles, a small rugby hall relating to the Heineken cup and a football area. The final area is a standard bar layout where you get your two beers or, if you want to serve it yourself and get a certificate, one beer. So in all there is about 30 - 40 mins of information on the beer itself and then it is pretty much commercial. I probably wouldn't go again in all honesty but if you haven't been and you are at a loose end give it a go."

As a marketer, it was interesting to see how they have changed their marketing over time and how the brand has evolved. If you're not into beer (or Heineken), I'd say find another of the many places in Amsterdam to spend some time. And, if you're in for a bit of fluff and a bit of a good time, it's pretty fun."

It tells U history of Heineken, how they brew it. I mainly enjoyed wonderful simulator activities, photos n video spots. The trip covers 2 beers apart from testing beer. Instead of 2 free beers, I chose to do few minute beer pouring course for which I received certificate too :) along with the beer I poured :) :) We enjoyed drinking beer in their lounge which had great music n visual effect. Tip for tourist : Instead of buying ticket directly, combo tickets will save your money. Search on internet for various discounts and offers."

You learn about its history and how its beer is made through many interactive exhibits, like a 4D ride. The part about the brewery's history is actually quite small; most of the experience is dedicated to flashing advertisements, videos, and activities catered towards a younger crowd. There was a very club-like feel at the end. With the basic admission comes two tokens which you can either spend on two beers at the bar, or a chance to pour your own draught of Heineken. You get a certificate and a tube to put it in, which is quite nice. If you like beer, this is a nice place to spend a few hours as long as you don't mind being constantly advertised at."

The guy doing the spiel on the horses knows about the rough facts about the Heineken horses on site but nothing about horses. The facility does not cater to the older (again the 72 yo dad) visitor as there is no where to rest or sit in the early parts of the tour and there are many stairs throughout (which you can avoid with the help of the staff but takes notifying them on arrival i believe). Anyhow, overall we all enjoyed our tour however there are some tweaks they could do to make it more universally enjoyable."

Then there's a tasting and a quiz about the history, but it really just tastes like regular old Heineken. Then you can get some Heineken and drink it in a very hip bar in the building. The souveneirs are pretty cool too. I don't know how much it costs because the group I am with paid for it, but personally I think there are better cultural experiences to be had in Amsterdam.

The tour was very informative and is done in English. The only disappointment was that at the end of the tour, you have an opportunity to taste 2 beers. There also was the opportunity to lean to pour a beer from the tap. The disappointment was there was no visible indication that it would cost you both tokens to drink a single beer. The highlight, however, was the active photos and sports capability as part of the experience."

But then...then the fun begins. There is a 5 D show where you can \"get bottled\", there is a room where you can make your own bottle, beer, places to make plenty of photos, pub, champions league hall. It cannot be explained, it can only be experienced. But once you do, the only beer you will ever want to have again is only Heineken. Tip: buy your ticket online.

The beginning is an audio tour of how the beer was created. You eventually make your way to the brewing process and even get to create your own customized label for a beer bottle that you can buy for about 7\u20ac. There are horse stalls too. You get to stand behind the bar and learn how to pour draft beer as well as numerous other games and things to see. Loved it and would highly recommended to anyone, even singles like myself!"

You get to see articles from its history, they have a horse stable in the brewery, theres a place to take silly photos, theres also a theatre room where you can sit and watch funny heineken commercials. Halfway through the tour you get a beer and at the end of the tour you get two beers and if you don't like beer ( which I don't know why you wouldn't) they do have pop at the bar if you'd prefer that.I would also recommend taking the boat to their gift shop, its included in what you pay for your ticket to get in. They take you through the canals in Amsterdam and tell you a little bit about the city. Plus you can buy and drink more beer on the boat! It was an awesome experience. I would do it again and I would recommend anyone to do it."

Well you're in the wrong place because no alcohol has ever been created in this large warehouse. If the Heineken experience is a trip around a brewery then my house is where Anne Frank hid herself for 3 years (I.e it's not true).My three friends and I went for a trip around the Heineken Experience on a Saturday afternoon and were left wondering why it was rated so highly on TripAdvisor. This trip is not a trip around a brewery but more of a theme park. We were convinced that it must get better but every corner we turned resulted in more queueing. I suppose what made the queueing unique was that the staff insisted on saying hello to us every 3 minutes. We know you're having a great time and Heineken is the greatest beer ever made but quite frankly I didn't pay \u20ac16 to talk to you. I would argue that 70% of the tour was inaccessible unless you prepared to queue for a minimum of 15 minutes. Even trying to claim my \"free beer\" (that I had paid for) took 15 minutes and even then half of it was froth. We found the rooftop bar particularly amusing. Having queued to grab a beer, the staff suddenly announced that there is a rooftop bar upstairs in a way that suggested that it might be somewhere that humans might wish to hang out. After queueing to get into the lift (a scene reminiscent of Hillsborough), we arrived to find a room with a large window and 7 chairs. Having claimed my second free half-pint of froth, we were left sat on floor, dreading a second use of the lift.We left the Heineken Experience very disappointed having queued through an hour long advert. The whole layout was designed to get people in and out as soon as possible. Between the queueing and the section of the tour where one member of the staff encouraged us to all listen to our beers, the one beacon of light was the decent value for money, hence the two stars.*I may have been slightly biased as I needed a poo throughout the factory and there were no toilets."

We'd both been before but never made it to the Heineken Experience.After settling into our hotel, we made the 30-40 minute walk to the Heineken experience. If you're staying nearby the Damrak in the city centre, the walk is quite long but the weather was good and we were in Europe so walk!When we arrived, we had tickets to skip the queue although there's wasn't much of a queue in any case. We were arriving around 2.30/3.00pm.Upon entry, you can scan your e-ticket or use your printed ticket, all fairly standard and easy. Then you begin the experience.There are a selection of videos to watch and old artefacts from when Heineken originated. Combined with this there are some areas where you are walked through the brewing process by Heineken employees and invited to taste different glasses of the liquid throughout its brewing cycle. All of this was really interesting.And then you finish off with the more modern stuff like the various sponsorships - Champions League, rugby events, music events - and some drinks at the bar. You can get a normal 250ml of Heineken free or two 250ml glasses of the Extra Cold Heineken. And you're invited to stay around, playing some of the games and relaxing in the drinking area. And before exiting, of course, there is the merchandise store.It was all interesting stuff but I think what kind of ruined it for me was the volume of other groups of people who were there. Just as you got to something you were reading or playing with, there was either someone walking right in front of you, bumping into you, talking and shouting loudly and standing right behind you waiting for you to finish.Definitely come - it's one of those things you have to do in Amsterdam - just choose your time wisely!"

In my opinion it is not one of the essential things to be seen in Amsterdam, that is why I recommend it only if you have spare time during your visit to the city. Specially I would recommend to go with friends and in the afternoon/evening. The entrance ticket to the museum is a bit expensive (16Euro), but it includes 3 beers inside the museum bar. In my opinion the perfect plan is to go to the museum in the evening, have a look around the museum, finish in the museum bar and then link it with a dinner in some restaurant of Amsterdam and continue the bars tour.This museum is an old Heineken factory. It is an interactive museum in which you not only see, but also you are part of it. They basically explain to you the origins of the company and Heineken family, the procedure for making beer and the particularities about the Heineken recipe for beer."

Plenty of beer tasting, an interactive area following the tour, an opportunity to pour your own beer and try their ice cold beer. Following all of that you can also hop on their canal tour whilst drinking their beer (beer is at an additional price on the canal boat). Absolutely loved it, particularly after getting a free souvenir glass at the end of the tour. The price may seem steep at first but for what you get, especially when canal tours can be pricey in Amsterdam, this attraction is well worth it."

We saw a 4d short film which was pretty funny...The best part of the tour however was the private part of the tour where we got to see the roof top, where the staff have their functions, and finally the unique old school private bar where we got to taste 5 beers and accompanying cheeses and we were presented with our personalised gifts...We finished off in the final rooms with everyone else visiting that day and enjoyed our final 2 tokens to redeem for Heineken beers...By the time we left both me and my boyfriends were tipsy and had a new found appreciation for everything linked to Heineken....Would go again I enjoyed it so much...Definitely recommend..."

You can even 'brew your own' and put a message on the bottle. There are a few fun games on the way - rugby and soccer as Heineken sponsor teams in both. You also get to pour a virtual beer from a tap and are shown the right way to drink a beer for full flavour (good for a novice like me). Highly recommended!"

There are allot of information in rooms about the brewery and you get to see the old shiny brass distilleries and there is a sections where they keep the Heineken horses. There are also photo booths that you can email to yourself with a Heineken background, which I really liked. There is a movie you get to watch in which you are the beer being made and packaged while holding onto a bar and the floor under you moves. In the tasting room you are taught how to drink the beer and possibly win another glass of beer if you answer a question correctly which I happily did!

I went on a Saturday afternoon and there were queues for everything, which made the history and brewery part quite tiring. After the en masse beer tasting, you enter the interactive part which can be entertaining if you are with friends. I really liked the bar at the top of the building which has a terrace with a nice view of the city.Don't do this only for the free beer; in that case it is cheaper to go to a bar.Taking the queues aside, the experience is entertaining but I wouldn't consider it a must."

It's very crowded and you are stuck waiting behind people to move through the exhibits. To me there was barely any focus on the history and beer making process and too much focus on silly games and simulations. The main attraction, I suppose, is a motion simulator ride that explains how the beer is made. It was cool but we had to wait over 30 minutes to get through it. And there was absolutely nothing to do in the line. Then the \"ride\" itself was barely 5 minutes and showed us in a movie things that other breweries show you in person. The bar at the end was cool but really crowded. So yeah overall did not feel like it was worth 16 Euros or two hours of my time. Maybe I'll check out the Amstel brewery next time!"

I was able to try 2 beers before I even got to the tasting room, which my husband drank for me. The first beer that was offered during the tour was an appetizer to get you excited. An employee will ask you questions about what you learned about the beer so far on the tour. If you answer correctly, you get an extra beer!During the tour you have the opportunity to customize your own Heineken beer bottle, which was neat. We customized 2 different bottles for \u20ac10. At the end of the tour, I recommend going up to the top floor to enjoy your beer. It has a lounge/club feel along with a spectacular view of the city. This is a great photo opportunity. "

Before my mates and I arrived in Amsterdam we thought we should go large and book the VIP tour, it was the best decision. We arrived on time and were made to wait a few minutes before we were seen to by our guide Micha, the guy on the advert! He was a top bloke and made sure he introduced himself to everyone in out group. The group consisted of ten people ranging from USA, Brazil, Austria and my lot from the UK. We were taken around the brewery and everything was explained perfectly and even the staff just walking past were quick to welcome us and ask us how our tour was going. Along the way we were given samples of the great beer that is Heineken and were taken to the top of the building where we could see the whole of Amsterdam, beautiful. At that point it must have been about an hour/hour fifteen and I thought, yes this was worth it until Micha said now lets taste some other beers. We were taken into what looked like an old pub setting and we sat down and had sampled different cheeses and a fair few different beers, we were hammered by the end of it. We had such a good laugh with our guide and he made the experience worthwhile explaining the tastes etc, he even went out of his way to get another beer for us to try! My mates and I aswell as the rest of our group thoroughly enjoyed it and to top it off we received a personalised bottle of the good stuff aswell as a paperweight in shape of the brewery building , talk about being spoilt!!! Also my mates told our guide it was my birthday and he gave me an extra gift in the shape of a Heineken mug. The value for money was truly unreal!! Furthermore after the tasting there was a bit at the end with all the marketing that Heineken do in the media and all that advertising and sponsorship jazz which was good to get involved in and free photos to email to ourselves. After that there was more beer for us to indulge in so by the time we were done we were wobbling to say the least. Now that is what I call a proper brewery tour. If you are into your beers then this is a must thing to do in Amsterdam!"

There is so much more to it than just walking round learning about beer (which I'm not a fan of!)There are little staff talks as you go round and all the staff are great; friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable.When you get to the end there are fun silly activities to do (we had such a good time!), such as photobooths, uv room, karaoke bikes, football room with various things to do in and even having a go at pouring the perfect pint! The photo booth and karaoke(which videos you sitting on a bike riding round various parts of amsterdam on the screen behind you) you can send both a copy of the picture and video to your email free of charge which is fab! There's also a chance for you to buy a personalised bottle of Heineken with your own text on.The drinks tokens you get entitle you 2 drinks at the bar at the end- I'm not a massive fan but ended up drinking 2 beers (they were actually nicer than usual) however they aren't full pints. You can either pay a token each for just over 250ml of just normal cold heinken or 2 tokens for extra cold Heineken (which are slightly bigger at around 375ml?).Probably would go back if we had the chance, worth every penny!

The Heineken horses are stalled and you can see them as you're passing from one part of the tour to the next. You get beer about midway through the experience (included in your admission). The last part of the tour is games and selfie photo spots. You can spend as much or as little time as you want in this area. Some games you can win discounts for the Heineken store. When you exit the tour, you might be given a voucher for a free boat ride through the canals to the Heineken store. It's a fun little ride through the canal, and you can cash in a voucher for a free beer glass at the store (the boat ride and the glass are included in your admission price).

There was room after room of selfie stations, a karaoke area, photo booths (they email you the pictures for free), games, and 3 rooms with enough strobe lights and monitors to rival any nightclub. There was a DJ, a bar...truly awesome. All of the employees seemed to really be having a good time. Best of all, we got three beers out of the deal. Given we only paid 15euro for the ticket, I would say the beers alone certainly made it worth it. The fact that it was awesome was icing on the cake. There was one person in our tour group that had kids. Fortunately, they were not too bothersome but I will admit, I am just of the school of thought that children do not belong in breweries, wineries, etc. i would definitely consider this a nice afternoon activity while you are in Amsterdam (if you are not with children of course).

We did and saved ourselves a long queue outside we literally walked straight in.Really enjoyed the tour and the interactive bit- that was a surprise and to round it all off you get to drink the final product.I also enjoyed customising a bottle which made a great gift.Not one for the kids I imagine they'd find it boring but one couple thought it would be a good idea to drag their poor child along (minus the taste test of course!)You can't really go to Amsterdam and not do the Heineken experience - partaking in the many bars doesn't count"

We didn't really have much expectation of what a 'brewery museum' was about but we were pleasantly surprised. What we liked was you could take your time to go around, it wasn't a guided tour etc. The part where you pretend to be a bottle on a conveyor belt was a little tongue in cheek, but just go with it as free beer awaits afterwards. It ends with more drinks in the bar and lots of interactive games and things to do. I think you can prebook tickets online, but it was around 17 EURs each I think when purchased at the ticket office. We didn't have any hassle or queues at the ticket office but when we came out there was a long queue around the block. We would definitely go again!"

But Heineken have really made the effort to make it as interesting, interactive and engaging as possible, and it has worked. The whole experience has been really well designed and thought out. As well as your two free drinks, you also get a third mini drink when you are taught how to taste and appreciate the beer. If the nightclub-esque, noisy, disco-lit bar at the end is too much for you, ask them if the rooftop bar is open.You can still redeem your free drinks tokens up there, but it is altogether calmer, much less busy and you can step outside onto a rooftop terrace and sit admiring the views."

It's clearly a popular attraction and it has good access and entrance to attraction was well organised given the large number of visitors. The first part of the experience is about the founders of Heineken followed by a visit to the brewing room. Without giving everything away you eventually end up in a series ofrooms that really just promote the brand. I expect these are OK on a quiet day but impossible when busy and we found this section uncomfortable and hot. You get 3 small glasses of beer during the visit. Good for a rainy day"

Me and my partner really enjoyed it. You're given a small quarter point to drink which they show you the correct way to drink. Then you continue the tour and depending on who you've booked with as I'm not sure what online deals are like but with us we got two free drinks.

Defininately worth the 18 euro it cost. Although there was a small misunderstanding with one of the staff working there, he later apologized and compensated me and my grandfather with a free glass of beer, which I thought was nice of him. Funny, professional and committed staff. Thank you again for that!However, there was one problem, which actually became quite a big problem for us since I was there with my 84 year old grandfather, and there was a lot of stairs to walk up and down in, which obviously isn't anything they can do anything about, but there's a complete lack of chairs and sofas to sit on through the whole tour, which probably went on for about an hour. The last room, which is the Heineken bar, probably held about 100 people at least, but still there was only THREE tables where 4 people could sit (which means a total of 12 places to sit). Luckily we found a nice couple who offered a seat for my grandfather, but if we wouldn't have found a place to sit we would have left right away just to find somewhere for my grandfather to sit down, and therefore miss out on the free beers that was included in the price. There was nothing wrong with the tour, the museum or the staff. It was a good mix of history of the brewery together with good information about how the Heineken beer is made. However, I would not recommend the tour if you're going with someone that's a bit older or easily get problems with their feet or legs. Even I felt a bit tired after all the steps up and down the brewery and the constant standing at all the stations, so I can only imagine what my grandfather felt. As an example, you should offer seats for people in the room where they get to taste the beer, and also in the pub at the end of the tour. This should be done not only to make it more handicap friendly, but also because in my opinion the only way to enjoy a good beer is sitting down! Maybe you should consider informing people about this before they pay for the tour (maybe you did this somewhere, but neither me or my grandfather saw any kind of warning), because if there wouldn't have been anywhere to sit at the end we would have left just because of that reason, and then it wouldn't be worth the 18 euro fee. All in all a nice experience, and I guess the most common visitor is a person my age where all of this wouldn't have been a problem at all, but don't forget the older beer enthusiasts who'd like to Experience Heineken too!"

If I had never done a brewery tour I'd probably give it a 3. This is a staged demonstration, not an actual brewery site where bottling occurs. It includes a silly movie you are required to view and the horses are not accessible, neither do they offer performances of any kind. The price is high even though you get two beers that you must line up for each time. If there were an onsite restaurant or food pairing options the experience would be improved. If it was located on a real brewery site it would be more authentic. I purchased my ticket in advance which is wise as the line up is long. Even then, they herd you through the tour and you often are left waiting. I'd recommend skipping it in favour of a smaller, micro-brew shop that offers the real deal."

There are a few fun things to get involved in, including karoeoke on a bike (in dutch!) - a couple of the girls even poured their own pints! Definitely worth it even if you don't drink beer, would definitely recommend as something to do whilst visiting Dam!"

It was busy and we had to wait about 45 minutes in line to get in.I realize it's busy during the Easter week, but the tour just wasn't worth our time or money. While it is interesting to learn about the history of the family and brewery, the interactive experience they are promoting was my least favorite thing I did in Amsterdam. The \"making you into a beer\" experience was a waste of time. There are only 3 rooms to experience it and all that did was to hold up the progress of moving through the tour and provided yet another \"waiting in line\" experience. AS everyone knows, the end of the tour is the best part, the beer tasting. We chose the rooftop for our tasting. You walk into this big room and there is a huge bar in the middle. Easter week is probably on of the busiest times there and you would think that after waiting in line after line to get through the \"Experience\", they might be able to set up more than one tap to serve the beer. I enjoyed my two small beers although the complete \"Experience\" left me extremely thirsty and exhausted.I am disappointed and sorry I spent this money and wasted my time."

If you really want to see it buy your ticket online. You don't have to wait the line. I can assure you that the experience is not good. It is all about how Heineken is the perfect beer. The best part is the film, it is like 5D, but you have to wait here for a line. At the end you can have two beers, but the place where they give is very noisy and not comfortable."

Bought these tickets for my boyfriends birthday online prior to the day which was great as we didn't have to que and walked straight in! It first starts off as a typical museum with information on the history and how they make the beers etc, but after this, becomes so interactive! You get to taste some of the Ingredients mixed together which is a bit strange haha, get to see the horses and then the 4d interactive video where we go through the brewing process is so fun!! We then had a talk about the beer itself where we got to try our first glass. There was so much to do here, personalising our bottle was fun too! At the end you then had a choice of a large beer or 2 small ones and could look around the gift shop too! The ques were very confusing and very busy in the gift shop and we were waiting for about 20 mins so I'd bare that in mind. Overall both enjoyed the experience and would go again!"

It's sort of funny I guess. I went around noon on a Friday and it was packed. If you're going to go, definitely pre-purchase your ticket at any of those ticket shops that are everywhere in Amsterdam. This gets you straight in the door and saves you two euros from buying it at the brewery. (16 instead of 18 euros). The entry price also includes a tasting and then two beers at the end.

Even with tickets there was a 45 min queue which we managed to avoid due to one member in our party not being too well. The staff were very considerate and allowed us to jump the queue, otherwise we wouldn't have waited and would have forfeited our tickets!The Heinekin experience is an example of superb marketing. Getting the general public to pay to learn about their product. Its marketing gone mad really but it was pretty interesting although some parts of the exhibition were certainly making a bit of a mountain of a molehill and padding the experience out a bit!.A good wet weather venue for sure and the views from the top of the building from the roof top bar were worth it. You get 2 free Heinekins and even though I' m not a beer drinker - I did enjoy it!"

The first 10-15 minutes of walking is quite crowded and rushed, involves stairs and gives a little history about Heineken. Then onto the brewing process of the beer, which smells like a farm, due to the horses. This is followed by an interactive ride 'Brew You Ride', which was quite fun with a 5 minute wait. The tour was very much focused on the marketing side of Heineken rather than the brewing, with interactive games, lots of info on sport and media, photobooths etc. There is also a tasting room where you receive a very small glass of Heineken (the two pints included in the price come at the end). The bar at the end of the experience where you receive your 2 beers is very crowded and not very well organised. I would say it is for a younger crowd as it is very loud and there is limited seating, however, I enjoyed this part of the Heineken Experience. Upon leaving, you enter the gift shop, surprise! However, we did get an engraved glass & tin for only \u20ac8 as a great keepsake. I would recommend going whilst in Amsterdam, if you have some time on your hands and I recommend pre-booking tickets in order to avoid queues (we paid \u20ac13.50 each)!"

It took us about an hour to walk through and another thirty minutes to enjoy the beer samples. The experience is educational and interactive with an emphasis on fun the entire way through. The samples were more than we were able to drink, but everyone seemed to be enjoying the lounge atmosphere. I felt like I was at a private corporate party. All of the staff was very welcoming and entertaining.A bit surprise came as we were leaving and invited to take a free canal shuttle across town to the Heineken brand store. We had already done some shopping at the gift shop, but the canal shuttle was enjoyable (and free), plus it got us close to our hotel. We were even given a free glass at the brand store.Is this a must-do compared to other attractions in Amsterdam? Probably not. However, it was a very enjoyable way to spend a few hours and definitely worth the admission price. If you're a fan of Heineken, this is a worthy addition to your itinerary.Like my review?

Lots of Green!) Firstly, the building is wonderful, the history of how the company grew and the brewing part of the tour is excellent BUT, it then goes a little south........Enter the modern era of Heineken. History moves aside for green lit rooms, sponsorship and probably the worst experience of the day which was the 'We are going to brew you' experience. Thankfully, this was cushioned by three 25cl glasses of delicious Heineken (included in price of admission). I wanted to love this tour and I did for the first half but if like me, your interested purely in the entrepreneurial story of Mr Heineken, you may find yourself mildly disappointed."

Thirdly, there is an interactive part where you can get involved in some pics/selfies and enjoy information about some of the sponsorship activities of Heineken (including a good area about Football and Rugby). Fourthly, the beer section...and chance to try. In this section there is a talk about how to taste the beer (including a free glass of beer) then onto a bar area where you get two beers per person. Should also mention, lastly, the shop!The activities took us about 90minutes and was a fun and enjoyable experience.TIP: You can buy tickets for this from the open top bus companies and some shops - this usually means a cheaper ticket and not having to Queue at the venue for tickets."

Unfortunately, like there used to be in the UK, these are not true brewery tours, ie, not around a working Brewery but as advertised 'Museum' experiences.Anyway, sorry Carlsberg, but Heineken is closer to the actual experience than yours, brewing equipment is there to be seen with video shows inside, a stop where a member of staff gave a talk on the ingredients required for brewing. There then followed a 3D show in small groups standing on interactive platforms which took you through the brewing process, where you are shaken, rained upon, bubbles floating round, the works. Following on from this was a tasting together with a question and answer session.From here past the dray horses which still go out daily but mainly for commercial and advertising tours. Unlike Carlsberg you could not walk through the stables, but a very pleasant female member of staff spike to you about her charges, something she obviously was very proud of.To finish off the tour, it has to be a tasting , you receive an armband which allows you two drinks, nice way to round it off."

There is a virtual simulator, which brews you, so you feel like you have gone through all the process that the ingredients go through. After this you walk into a bar area with two trademark red star bars. Here you enjoy Heineken the right way. With explained beer tasting. Carry on through the tour, you see lots of what Heineken has sponsored with interactional games to do with rugby and football. You also can sit in an area which seems like a Heineken night club.

After that, a taste test and then on to more interactive and marketing type things done by Heineken.

After the expected walk through rooms with some big copper casks which did have novelty views and videos playing the history and process of brewing, we were then taken through into live demonstration rooms where presenters explained more about brewing and the Heineken legacy with enthusiasm and motivating passion. We sampled the beer and were then guided through a series of Heineken related and sponsored event replications from rugby and football to tandem cycling through Amsterdam where you could take pictures on their provided cameras and instantly email to friends and family! Finally the tour ended with a couple of included drinks of Heineken in a bar styled room with scrolling city landscapes and views, which when to include in the price makes the whole tour really great value! We had a great time and would definitely recommend it to anyone over 18 visiting Amsterdam! Under 18s I don't think would enjoy it unless they have an interest in the science or brewing of the Heineken history."

We were looking forward to visiting this place whilst in Amsterdam.We didn't pre book tickets as we we combining with museum trips so didn't know when we would get there.We only queued for 5 mins max for tickets and were then straight in.Make sure you get the vouchers that give you a few euros discount that seem to be everywhere!This is a self guided tour with lots of historical pictures and paraphernalia. The most impressive bit was that it is housed in the original Heineken brewery, and that it has always been a family run business. I do love a successful brand that has stayed in the family.They seem to have done great work looking after their staff too by the details found on the walls.Really interesting insight into how the brand evolved.You get to to try the beer about half way round. It is a very small beer and you are told why they pour with such a big head.,I am still not convinced by this but each to their own.There is an interactive experience where you are 'Brewed'. I found that a bit random to be honest!The walk round was really fascinating, and it is a great old building. Then we came to the gimmicky bit that I really wasn't a fan of. Lots of play stations with the Fifa game on it, a rugby kicking simulator, making your own label which is then extortionately priced to purchase and so on. I suppose they are hammering home the brand, but it really didn't interest us.We got to the end for our 2 free beers. Again, these were small! You either get 2 250ml regular heinekens or 1 350ml extra cold. Not quite what I thought you would get being British!We opted for the extra cold, and it was alright.The exit was through the gift shop, which basically had the Heineken logo on everything you could want.A very interesting visit and I would recommend it just to learn about the heritage."

The only thing I didn't like was towards the end the tour it turned into a Heineken marketing orgy with endless areas for you to take selfies and post them online.I found the Guinness experience in Dublin far better with a great amount of historical information which the Heineken experience lacked."

You can even \"ride your beer\" :-) and customise printed bottles etc. It was truly a unique experience and much more fun than other similar brewery-tours Ive been on.

Certain parts were also manned such as the horse section and a little story is told. There are also little trials as you go along and not forgetting an option for Sone fun photos - which get emailed over for free and they only charge 1 euro to get them printed out there. Perfect end to the tour you get some tasters if the beer - which is Lovley especially after finding out exactly how it is made. Excellent shop then selling merchandise with very reasonable prices. Makes perfect personalised gifts with the very good value engraving that is offered. I will Defo come back to this in the future \ufe0f\ufe0fExcellent morning out."

At the start you go through some galleries about the family and the history of the beer and then a member of staff explains the ingredients and brewing process. You can personalise your own bottle too which is a cool thing to do. We waited for ages to go on the ride which is a simulator that takes you on the journey of the beer with some effects and it was quite fun. There are also areas where you can take photos in booths and videos and email them to yourself. There are two bars, in the first you get a small glass of beer for free and in the second you can use your two tokens for either two small beers or one extra cold larger beer. In the bars there were no seats and the floor was so sticky. The shop at the end has a very wide variety of merchandise. I would say it is pretty good value for money and a must do for all beer lovers...and even those who aren't the biggest fans!"

This was much more of a piece of 'experiential marketing' than I'd anticipated - a bit of museum piece up front about the history, then a bit of looking at the old equipment, but from there on it was very much about the brand, it's advertising and marketing etc. Cool to find out how it's made and have a couple of nice cold beers at the end, but I wouldn't prioritise it over some of the other major attractions this great city has to offer."

When we went, some of the site tour magazines had discounts off entrance fee plus you do get two free drinks!When you first go in the museum, it is labels and posters and pictures telling a story. It does go on a bit. In fact it goes on to a point where you think, 'have I really paid to see this'! However you suddenly come to a room with brewing vats and the whole thing becomes far more interactive. The second part of the tour was far more enjoyable to us than the first part. I'm still not convinced it was worth the entrance fee we paid however, having said that, I'm glad we visited it,"

After paying the ridiculous fee to get in me and my fianc\u00e9e spent our time hearing about how great Heineken beer is and how important their brewing process etc is. We had a whole talk on the importance of beer being fizzy and frothy etc. We were funnelled through corridors of commercial nonsense and over to a bar at the end for our much anticipated 2 free drinks.The queue was huge and I was shoved two beers by the lady at the bar. When I went to sit down I realised they had given me a dead one, with no froth or fizz. No problem I thought and took it back only to be told by the bartender that i couldn't have a replacement because it was my fault and I must have stood there for too long with it. She then turned her back and served somebody else. I don't think I've ever been treated in such an arrogant way when buying a beer, let alone when in a brewery.I wrote an email complaint to Heineken to give them an opportunity to respond and they didn't bother. Says it all really. Total waste of money and a shambles. Avoid avoid avoid like the plague."

I did the Heineken Experience tour when I visited Amsterdam on a one day trip with friends and I loved every minute of it, though I don't even like beer. The tour is very popular with a long queue to enter so I'll advice to purchase your ticket online prior to going so that you can skip the ticket queue and just go right in. The whole staff are amazing and active - they are very good at keeping the tour exciting especially for someone who did not care about doing the tour in the first place. If you are visiting Amsterdam, please make this one of your places to visit. You will thank me later...oh and the gift shop is just the icing on the cake."

Please know that there are two lines to get in; pre bought tickets are to the left and everyone else to the right. Once the tour is over you go to the tasting room. The line for the tasting room was crazy long. By luck we happened to take the elevator up to the 6th floor rooftop bar. Now THAT was cool!

Not my cup of tea but it seemed that most males liked the end, where you could have a drink and hang out in the bar/lounge area. It cost 18 euros a person....I don't know you would think they would pay you to see the history and promote there own beer. We got it as a package deal cruise the canal and Heineken experience. :/.

It was very quick for the whole experience (we were out in under an hour and we didn't rush) and felt like the people who worked there had no enthusiasm when talking about the beer. This may be because I am comparing it to the Guiness storehouse in Dublin which in my opinion is a lot better, more interesting and interactive. Also no where to sit at the end when you receive your drink (you either can have two small beers or one large beer, however the large is still less than the two small ones).

Got to learn some new things about beer making, history of Heinekken (they seem to be great employers).The highlight for me was the 'Brew You' experience where u stand on a platform that wiggles n jiggles and let's you experience the brew process. There is a simulation area that lets you try pouring beers and tell you how you fair, lots of photo oppurtunities and the 2 glasses of beer at the end are chill and fresh. Surely Worth a visit."

You are given a wristband and you can swap the buttons on your wristband for either 2 drinks or 1 extra cold drink (Recommend the latter!).

You watch some videos, see the old factory, see some horses, learn Heineken history, learn how to toast with your beer, go int some sort of bottling simulator which was totally lame (and the wait for that was ridiculously long) and at the end you get your beer. The of course you are dumped out into the retail store. Perhaps if I was a college aged kid or in my 20's this would make more sense. I would rather go to a pub and find some great local beer to sample."

Maybe it was that reason, it was actually our biggest surprise hit of our trip.Going as fans of beer in general, rather than an advocate of the Heineken brand, we went along almost with the thought of 'well, we might as well visit while we're here'. The tour starts with the standard story of how lager is produced, but it's done in an interesting way. Then you turn a corner and find yourself in a stables looking at the real shire horses of the brewery - a nice twist and nod to their heritage.You then go through a cool little 4d experience, which is quite humorous, and you come out in a tasting room. We had previously been given a green branded wristband with 2 tokens for samples at the end of the tour - however we weren't asked for these here- leaving you thinking you've beaten the system. The smiley server gave a bit more history, and tested the group on a couple of beer related questions - rewarded with more free beer of course! Not knowing if the tour was about to end, you still have several more modern and high-tech room to visit with lots of interaction, engagement, and a chance to take some green screen photos and email them to yourself for free.Eventually, you end up in the 'real' free sample bar which has a really cool vibe with loud upbeat music, and lively friendly staff.In fact- a special mention here, all the staff we encountered from start to finish, without exception, came across happy, friendly, helpful, and as if they genuinely wanted to be there. I work in a high volume tourist attraction myself and know how hard this can be to attain - it really made the difference.Would recommend for all visitors to the city. If you have a spare couple of hours on your trip, try to make time for this."

We booked a package that included a canal cruise, which began and ended right in front of the Heineken Experience. For convenience, that was wonderful.The first half of the tour is spent learning about how the beer is brewed. There's various employee stations along the way where they explain the process, and you're given nibbles and sips of the ingredients throughout the different stages. After this, there's a small \"ride simulator\" where a goofy guy in a video explains how the beer is packaged. The platform bounces around and you get sprayed with a little bit of water, which is kind of fun. Then you have a taste of the beer at the final employee station.After this, the tour is pretty much over. The rest of the Experience is product placement and games, and seeing all of the movies and sports that Heineken sponsors. There's a bar at the very end of the \"tour\" where you can get two beers (or one really cold one), and this area is full of college-aged kids. It's set up like a club, with dark lighting and bar music. It's fun, but we only stayed for about 20 minutes. It's not a make-it-or-break-it part of the tour.Like the rest of Amsterdam, the place is packed from Thursday through Sunday. Absolutely purchase a ticket ahead of time - the line to buy a ticket stretched for what seemed like forever. If you buy your tickets in advance, you skip this craziness.It's worth a visit, but don't expect it to be a super educational visit. It's called the Heineken Experience, not the Heineken Museum, for a reason."

You can do this in any of the excursion shops dotted around the city.The whole walk round takes about an hour and as it was very busy there was a lot of walking a few steps and having to keep stopping. It was very interesting, you learn about how Heineken is made and also the history of the company. When entering you get bands which have 2 token attached and these can be traded in at the end in the bar for Heineken..

However, soon after, there are tastings, pouring lessons, tons of fun picture opportunities, black lights, clubbing vibes, and a bar at the end. We got customised bottles."

We were so surprised and we had so much fun during the tour! It was like a friday night where you go to a bar or party.But it was also like a saturday afternoon where you visit a really cool museum. This is definitely a must visit place !!! No.1 on the list"

Although we're not necessarily huge Heineken fans, I have to say the tour is quite well done.Very informative but the technology and the experience that they've built made it engaging and interesting.The digital interactivity at the end of the tour was actually humorous, cool and impressive. It may seem silly but the bicycle ride was pretty funny. The bartenders that were hosting the tasting was obnoxious - but then again, so were the tourists that kept talking during his presentation. I actually recommend stopping by if you're in the mood for something fun."

We got the number 24 tram out there and it dropped us right at the door. The start of the tour I found quite boring as it was very like a museum of old stuff then as it progressed it got better and better. lots to see and do in there, pulling pints, playing playstation, taking pictures with fun backgrounds, a stimulator which was quite cool. we got two free drinks each and the tour lasted nearly three hours. Theres quite a cool Heineken shop there too which is reasonably priced. I would highly recommend but please pre book before hand"

There's a \"4D\" ride which got us laughing. We even learnt how to drink beer properly - who'd have thought.Considering you get 3 small beers in the price the whole thing probably cost about a fiver. If you don't think that's value for money you've obviously got more Yorkshire blood in you than I have.Tip - they do a hand engraved glass for 8 euro's all in with a metal gift tin.

I like beer, but I prefer gin, but I didn't enjoy this place any less! It was a really good day out. As you walk through you learn about the history of Heineken and how it's all brewed which was pretty interesting. Then all the fun bits!! There's a 4D video thing which was funny and then lots of interactive rooms where you can learn to pour the perfect pint, be the DJ, star in a video and take some photos with random backdrops and learn how to drink a beer the right way! You are given a wrist band with 2 tokens that you exchange for 2 pints of Heineken at the end in the bar or 2 tokens to pour the \"perfect pint\" and get a certificate haha. Arrive early to avoid huge queues! When we got out the queue went all the way down the street!"

You are left to wonder at your own leisure which is nice, but there are also opportunities to learn about the beer making process (quick tip: during the quiz when you are given your sampler, get the questions right and you win more beer!). There are two bars at the end, make sure you specifically seek out the rooftop bar, it's much more roomy and makes for great views! Overall, a great few hours well spent!"

The tour lasted longer than i expected and was more interactive, with lots of taste tests! which however good wasn't for me as i can't drink gluten however i knew this when i went to the experience. There is also a big shop at the end of the tour where you can get personalised glasses and bottles ect! Defiantly worth the money, however would maybe go a little later on in the day so you could carry on the night after all the free beer!"

I was kinda expecting that thru the years Heineken would have other flavors added to the original beer. Coors has, even Coca Cola has different drinks in their museum in Atlanta, GA.

Arriving at 10am on Saturday morning meant we had the place virtually to ourselves - I'd definitely recommend this time if you don't mind a pre-lunch pint! The tour itself was fun, engaging and interesting. The facility is super modern and features interactive photo booths, sports challenges, a 3D cinema ride and a karaoke experience. For \u20ac6 we ordered a personalised Heineken bottle at one of the \"interactive\" stations, for pick up at the end of the tour. Your ticket includes a visit to the tasting room and tokens for two full-sized beers at the bar. It ALSO includes a 30 minute canal boat cruise, which you should not miss!! Pick up a ticket as you leave the brewery and redeem it at the canal dock across the road. You'd pay at least \u20ac10 for a boat cruise alone so it's fantastic value! The boat drops you at the Heineken store in the centre of town. Save some pennies for this part, as there are a ton of cool (well priced!) souvenirs on offer. To top it all off.. our boat captain handed us a voucher for a free personalised Heineken glass with our name engraved on it, to be engraved at the store! All in all we spent over two hours on the tour, and were incredibly impressed by all the \"extras\" that came along with the \u20ac16 ticket. The ONLY thing that stopped me awarding this tour 5 stars were the poor horses kept at the brewery. Yes, they are gorgeous and very impressive to look at.. but they serve no purpose other than to be gawked at by tourists and generally looked VERY unhappy in their tiny stalls. The horses really didn't add anything to the tour and I'd love for the management to rethink keeping them cooped up here."

Also located in a pretty fun part of Amsterdam with lots to do."

After this you go into a series of interactive displays where you can see heinken's involvement in sports and in Dutch culture. Finally you get to a bar where you can get 2 beers (the first you get between exhibits) and learn to pour from the tab. There is also a Heineken boat that takes you to the store for free- we went on it and it was, we considered, our little canal tour on the trip. Was very fun and different."

Among other things, he wanted to visit the Heineken Experience. I wasn't too enthusiastic about going but went along after a lovely cruise along the canals, on a Lovers Cruise boat.We took a tram from the harbour near our hotel and within 10-15 minutes we were at the Heineken Experience. We had previously bought our tickets (recommended) so there was no need to queue.When we were shown to the start of the experience and we were a little disappointed thinking we would have to read all about it. But as the time went on we were enthralled by the presentations. There was an amazing Powerpoint type presentation of where it all began, giving us great detail in a light hearted way. Then we were put into a room and asked to hold the bar in front of us. On the large screen in front of us was a guy who told us we were going to be made into Heineken. He started to explain and demonstrate how it was made and we were in sprinkled water, it made us rock about and all sorts of things, just like a ride at Disneyland. It was such fun.We were then walked through where somebody demonstrated with hops and the other ingredients that go into it. We were walked through the old hops containers and saw the horses that used to pull the barrels. Then came the good part, we were taken into a bar and given a small glass of the beer. We were told how to drink it properly and told we could move to the other bar area and get our free drinks, which were part of the entrance fee. After our free drinks we then moved on into a type of amusement room. It was filled with video, photo and virtual games. It was a really fun end to the experience. There was, of course, a shop which had everything you could possibly think of to buy with a Heineken logo. We had a bottle engraved with our names and the date which was boxed for us to take home. They were kind enough to let us know we could not take it through passport/security, which we presumed anyway, but apparently people had had their bottles removed in the past.We were invited to visit the bar on the roof. We went up there and it was amazing. The views from the roof were fantastic but it was pouring with rain so we sat inside instead in a very comfortable and full of atmosphere bar. The music blasting was really good, lot of old school and we bought more tokens and quite happily sat there for another hour. I would highly recommend this tour,Foxyfox10"

They've worked hard to earn it!I thought we'd see a working current factory but it's only the original showing the old vats, etc. There's a cool stand on interactive ride with effects, and lots of funny interactive photo booths and videos as well as the museum, tasting bar, pour your own pint and a huge shop. And don't forget to go up in the lift to the cool rooftop bar, with DJ and a great view over the city!!"

We didn\u2019t need to wait long at the bar and if you fancy pulling a pint yourself you can.

The copper container area was fun, the horses were fun. The interactive \"ride\" was fun, but strange. The first tasting was nice. 10 years ago, you only got a small pint glass in the entire visit. The big screens with commercials after the first tasting was exciting. The interactive areas were awesome, but we just didn't have enough time to hang out, in fact we barely had time to drink our free pint at the end. One downer was they no longer give away small pint glasses. I was told we could visit another store closer to downtown for the free glass. We did visit, but my husband forgot the vouchers and they were closed. Oh well. Overall, it was a great time at the Heineken Experience! We needed about 2-3 hours overall and we just didn't have that time."

The self guided tour is fantastic, they have worked hard to convey the history of the family and the beer, with speakers and hands on exhibits as you go round, as well as modern elements too.

You then go on to learn about the different ingredients in Heineken and get to play a simulation game that teaches you how to pour a pint. At the end you are given a small glass of Heineken and told how to taste it, and finally you go through to the bar and can have either two small glasses or one large glass of Heineken.

It starts with the longest queue in the world, an extremely over priced entry then met by another queue as you enter into the \"experience\" itself. After this queue is a very pathetic attempt at a museum walk through with little to no actual history on Heineken. Instead, you find the tourists who are the ones holding up the queue, taking selfies with any object they see. Following this is a brief walk (still queuing) through a fake brewery with a testing of hops or barley or something (I can't remember, it was all very dull). Keeping up with the queue, you then walk past the horse shed which had filled the \"brewery\" with the sweet scent of horse excrement and hay so you now know what that awful smell was that started 10 minutes before. One big flight of stairs, and you have reached the queue of a life time, with nothing to do while you wait for a terrible 4D \"experience\" of the process of becoming a beer (oh, except more tourist taking vain selfies with Heineken advertisements). After MUCH waiting, you then enter the tasting room (finally, BEER! The reason you came) and then on to the actual bar, although they won't make it easy for you! Follow along floors and floors of thinly veiled subliminal advertising in the form of heinous Heineken games, photo booths and other tourist traps, before reaching the actual club type bar which is as classy as your hometown's night club on student night. -20/10. Do not do this! You could Google Heineken Beer, watch a video of a beer brewing and buy some better quality beer to enjoy at home which would end up being cheaper and more valuable than this whole \"experience\"!"

They do a decent job describing the history of the Heineken family, and practically zero effort on how beer is brewed. After 15 minutes of that there is a a whole lot of demonstrating the power of the Heineken brand. Its a fun little tour for youngsters or people just looking to enjoy a bit of hooky advertising gimmickry. I won't say it is a waste of time, but more of a fun wacky beer related attraction. Not really all that interesting to someone who is a real beer geek. Oh, and there is a decent tasting event in the tour, to which you only try one beer and its the same one everyone has already tried, but teaches you how to assess a beer from a judging standpoint. It would have been nice to do it with a flight of beers in a range of styles produced by Heineken."

You will walk round and learn who invented the 'famous brew' and how it is produced today. There are some interactive activities too. When all this is over, be prepared to stand in a long queue to watch this 4d video of some guy going through the beer brewing process. If you haven't died from boredom at this point, you can finally sample the Heineken with a bartender guiding you on the professional way to do it - basically wine sampling. Whilst you wait for your group to finish, you can sit in this large room with loud music and trippy visuals. I actually found this to be the most enjoyable part of the experience. You can collect your free two pints at the end if you want to at a bar. Whilst I'm not a massive beer drinker, I kind of had higher expectations for this attraction. A lot of the information on the displays can be looked up on Wikipedia or Googled in a matter of seconds. I think most of the people there (in our group at least) were feeling the same and just wanted to get to the end. Nonetheless, it's worth doing if your bored and have nothing better to do. "

There were games to play inside aswel as hearing how Heineken is made and about its advertising it was worth going to. You get tokens for 2 free drinks at the end both are not pints they are only small glasses. There is also an interactive game where one can try pour the perfect pint and you can also attempt to actually pull a pint at the end yourself or have one pulled for you. Much like going to the Guinness storehouse in Dublin visiting Heineken is worth going to in Amsterdam."

Well to be fair it is billed as an 'attraction' not a museum, and I didn't expect much culture other than 'beer drinking', but even prepared with my low expectations we were VERY disappointed. The queue outside is only the tip of the iceberg, and you can minimise this by buying your ticket from a nearby 'ticket & tours' shop then join the pre-bought queue. However, once inside there are more queues...One crew member diverted us away from the 'History' section because it was too busy, so we missed that section altogether only to join another 45 minute queue for the 'Be a bottle of beer' 4D ride. There is nothing to do whilst in this queue and the in-house wifi is patchy so hard to alleviate the tedium. The 4D ride would probably be mildly amusing if there was no queue to do it but after a 45 min wait we were left with feeling a disappointing, Well, is that it?? On we go to the rest of the 'Experience', which again would probably be mildly amusing for a lads stag weekend but was so heaving with people most ppl were simply making for the bar and exit. If you plan to visit and see a long queue outside you would be well advised to spend your money on a pint of Heineken in a nearby Bar, watch a few beer adverts on YouTube, and use the extra time to enjoy the many other attractions Amsterdam has to offer. You won't have missed much here."

The queues are ridiculous and the Heineken Experience makes absolutely no attempt to cap numbers at a reasonable level.Once inside, you will learn nothing about the beer brewing process or Heineken as a brand. There are totally irrelevant 'filler' sections of the tour, including: the Heineken horses; a sad 'ride'; and all manner of light-filled displays. The Heineken Experience also makes it as difficult as possible to redeem your coins for drinks--which you may then drink in the most stale, uninviting surroundings afterwards.To summarise: you pay Euro18 to experience a Heineken marketing experience, followed by a few beers in awful surroundings. If you want to experience Dutch culture, go to a local brown cafe and spend your money on some interesting Dutch beers there. While you drink, read the Heineken Wikipedia page. You will be better off!"

There is staff to explain you a few facts about brewing and beer drinking, but they just render their emotionless monologues at high speed to get as many people through as possible. At the end you can have your 2x25cl of the brew and enjoy them in a windowless room reminiscent of a shabby night club with sticky floors. This is definitely the worst brewery experience I have ever had. Many breweries do tours on the side to explain customers their love of brewing and demonstrate their human side, tradition and expertise, but not this one. This is a money making and advertisement exercise in its own right, highly impersonal and commercialised."

The first part is quite slow, giving you a a brief history of the Heineken family and we thought it was going to be pretty boring throughout but it got better really quickly when we entered the main brewing quarters. There was lots of opportunities to try the different stages of the beer making process, with interactive activities stationed throughout where you can take pictures / videos and email them to yourself free of charge - we thought it was particularly good that they didn't even try to sell them to you but instead allowed you to email them straight away. The staff are wonderful and clearly love their jobs, they gave the place a lovely atmosphere. There are plenty of opportunities to win free beers in the first 'how to drink beer' talk, with you getting one and if you answer his questions then he will give you an extra one so you definitely get your value for money. You get given a wristband at the beginning with two 'tokens' on which you can either use at the bar or at a station where you can be taught how to pour the perfect pint of Heineken. I used both of mine at the latter due to not really liking the beer that much, where you get given a certificate to show that you can pour the perfect pint. The place is well done up, modern and enjoyable for all different ages. Would definitely recommend! Also, throughout the city there are lots of deals where you can get a few euros off the price. We booked online and paid \u00a316 beforehand though."

We pre booked online before we got there so we didn't have to wait in a que even then it was only about 3 groups long if that. The attraction is not just walking around and looking at old artifacts it's very interactive as well. There are. Plenty of different rooms and each explain the different steps it takes to make the beer and all the different things that they do. There is also lots of tasting. I quite like owning things you would have in a bar so the gift shop is brill for all your needs. Just when we thought it was all over we then was given a free canal tour around the city and taken to the Heineken store on the other side of the city which was even better than we expected. all the staff where very friendly and helpful and also they moved around a lot so you saw the same friendly faces where ever you went. It's a must see event and would recommend to everyone "

One of the best things I did while in Amsterdam. Highly recommended."

After going on tours of different distilleries I thought that this one lacked actual information about how Heineken was made, it did cover some history about the company but not much current information about how the beer is made so it wasn't very interesting. Overall the tour was abit of a laugh but I wouldn't recommend it to friends. The pints in the bar at the end were good though."

It's pretty much what you would expect out of a brewery tour with a few added extras which are fun to play with.Can't say too much about it without giving it away but if you are a Heineken lover like me then you will enjoy it.I will give one part away though as its kind of a tip. At one part of the tour there is a tasting area where they talk about the beer and then ask questions about what to look for in a beer. Now this is the part where you can earn yourself a few extra drinks for getting questions right.Answers are as follows- clarity (how clear the beer is)- head (stops the beer rusting)- bubbles (how bubbly the beer is)I think that's it, however I was slightly tipsy by this point so yea good luck and I hopefully you can get a few extra drinks along the way."

The next part of the experience was the interactive area which was exactly that, totally interactive, karaoke, Xbox, rugby games, something for everyone.

No brewing is done here but the self guided tour takes you around the old site including the stables for the brewery Shires. The interactive display is excellent and the information given about the history of the family is well balanced. You can also down load the tour onto your phone which is in English. The displays are in English so you do not need an audio guide if you are able to speak English otherwise there is a charge. You can also get discounted tickets through City Sight seeing Amsterdam if you book a few attractions at once. You get three drinks whilst there and can send pictures and a video to an email for free. There are various opportunities for pictures as you are allowed a camera inside. However no back packs allowed in the tour but you can leave in a cloak room but note that the brewery take no responsibility for items. Make sure any valuables are taken with you. Leave at least 2 hours for this tour as there is so much to look at. Recommend this as a must visit whilst in Amsterdam."

Perhaps I had other expectations, but the whole tour was a huge disappointment to me and my partner. First of all because you do not learn anything and you do not get to really know anything about the history of Heineken and the production method. Second, because the tour is nothing more than an amusement park really idiot, with karaoke, selfie areas and screens of crappy Heineken 3d and stuff as if we were in a great commercial. The whole thing is very confusing, teens who cackles continuously and if you are over 25 you have the feeling of being out of place. You do not learn anything, and you come out with a big headache (and not because of the beer). There's a free 40cl beer at the end of the tour and that's it. 18 euro? Are you kidding me? Go and spend it better in a pub if you want."

Drinking a beer there is so much more tastier than anywhere else in the world it really is, when they give you the taste of the barley itself, you have a new appreciation for the beer. Don't be like everyone else, Do the pouring of beer , you get 3 tries You may not need them, All round still very much fun! I suggest you go do it, plus food is just over the bridge were you can sit drink more and eat and smoke. Good for all the family good for you and affordable, I will suggest you get the boat ride too! as it is right next door to the H. Experience, And you can get it cheaper if ordering both ! :)"

I live only 20 minutes from Golden where Coors has a free tour that includes beer so that is hard to beat. I went to the Heineken Experience with my mother who really liked it. For me, it was touring a bad club. You only talk about the beer for the first part of the tour (the bar experience is fun) and then then rest is just a show. I did like seeing the horses and being in the old brewery itself, but the rest was silly. Another pro is that you can take a free river boat tour at the end which we enjoyed. The boat ends at a Heineken store on the other side of town and they don't tell you where to go really. It was confusing but the boat ride was nice. If you like learning about beer, keep your 16 euros and go to a pub with a knowledgeable bar keep"

All this took us 4 hours. Rob our guide was very knowledgeable speaking excellent English and entertained us greatly.

I would recommend buying the tickets in advance online, since it is cheaper and you can go straight to the entrance. There was not a wait when we went, but I've seen long lines out the door. Expect to spend one hour to 90 minutes. The exhibits were interesting. However, the \"brew you\" part of the tour was a bit cheesy and we had to wait the longest. I wish there was a way to skip this part. Ticket price at the time of this review was 18 Euros, which includes the beer tasting. A bit too much advertising for Heineken beer in my opinion, but understand why they did this. At the end, it's all about marketing their beer."

We was abit sceptical about buying them there but trust me it makes life a lot easier.We got to the factory and the queue was going all the way down the road. but because we previously got our tickets we walked right to the front! We went in and started our tour. the tour is good and very interesting with little parts where a member of the Heineken team will be dotted around the factory explaining something or getting you engaged doing something. You get taught how to drink a beer 'Properly' and if you get the awnsers right to the questions you get extra beers! At the end you get 2 free beers of 'fresh' Heineken and if its a Saturday you get to drink them on the rooftop bar which is really cool! If its not Saturday theres a nice little bar downstairs where you can properly get hands on pouring your own pints! Ive been there twice and if someone asked me if I wanted to go again i'de do it!

They give you a tasting during the tour and also 2 glasses at the end. The beer was so refreshing and so good. Definitely a must do when you're in Amsterdam, especially if you enjoy beer!"

As soon as we walked in you could tell you were going to have some fun, beer tasting or not. As you walk from room to room you are caught up in the history and the \"coolness\" of Heineken. You get to see how the bottles have changed, see some cool art installations, and see the famous Heineken horses. Being present for feeding time in the stable was a real treat. We were just standing there and then all the sudden the horse got really excited and started dancing around their stalls. Turns out the mad that feeds them was coming around the corner with lunch. By the end the tasting was the least stimulation part of the tour because we enjoyed the brand more than the beer. The Heineken Experience is hip, informational, and an all-around good time for almost any age."

On arrival I was surprised to see such a long queue waiting to go in, so was relieved to realise as we had already pre purchased our tickets we were able to go straight to the front and walk in. As you enter you are given a wrist band which entitles you to two small drinks (or one larger one) at the end of the experience. As you walk through you learn about the founder, the brewing process and have a simulator type experience ending with a small beer tasting, before moving on to a more interactive area. In this area you can type your own label to be put on a bottle (to be picked up in the shop at the end), take part in a Karaoke video cycling experience, practice pouring a beer and try out a number of other interactive experiences. At the end you join a noisy and busy drinking area where you can exchange the tokens on your wristband for your free drinks (don't rest your elbows on any of the surfaces as most are wet with beer!) and finally you exit via the shop where there are a number of Heineken souvenirs to tempt you into spending more of your money. We found we spent approx two hours there, so if you like beer it is worth a visit (however be warned there are no alternative drink options for non beer drinkers!)"

The trip starts with the history of the Heineken family and heineken's early days told in an upbeat informative way - followed by a tour of the vats and machinery used in brewing plus tasting the wort and onto the bottling, the stables, leading up to a tasting session including why Heineken has bubbles! There then follows a Heineken experience re rugby, football with interactive exhibits along with an art section where you can draw with your arms and even practice pulling a glass of Heineken. There was an opportunity to do this for real- but only one pump was open which was a shame (Guinness) do this bit much better. This then leads onto the 2 free glasses - we asked about the upstairs bar and were escorted to the bar at the top of the building which had a 360 degree view of the city which was great.The only difficulty I found with the exhibits was the sheer number of steps you had to climb!"

We got our tickets from our concierge and saved a few Euros it was about 15 Euro.We visited on a week day so it was really quiet we practically had the place to ourselves it was great. The tour was so interesting they vary it between someone talking, demonstrations, videos and beer, so I was hooked from the start. I love at the end there's some football interaction bits where you can make videos and take silly pictures which you can email to yourself for free!! Before you leave you get a free pint or two then you can visit the gift store. We Absolutely loved it and even made our very own beer bottle.I'd definitely go again"

However as the tour went on we were able to pass the slow people we were stuck behind and go at our own speed. It became much more enjoyable as you could part take in some activities. How ever there was a horse stables and staff were letting people in to interact with the horses however because we were not family of the crew members we were denied this opportunity. It then proceeded to more rooms with activities including making a customised bottle. It then finished with a ice cold pint. Glad I visited."

Initially thought it would just be a walk-through museum style experience but it was much more than that.Besides showcasing the company's long history, we were introduced to beer making as well as the different ingredients that makes the distinctive taste that beer has. There is a \"ride\" where for a few minutes we were taken on a tour on how beer was made. There are also many interactive booths that allow you to take pictures with the Champion Leagues trophy, with football players or a video of you cycling down the streets of Amsterdam and email to yourself. Next go on to bottle your own beer and create your personalised bottle for $6.50 euros. We were then ushered to a bar counter where we were taught how to drink beer the correct way. At the end of the tour is where we get to collect our 2 glasses of beer to wrap up the whole experience. The store is a must go as well where you can buy different beer paraphernalia as well as engrave your name and create your own beer glass for a fee of $8 euros. Overall it was a fantastic and enjoyable experience. I notice that there was quite a few negative reviews so I guess it is really up to the expectations that you bring into the Heineken Experience."

Visited the Heineken Experience on Friday afternoon and it wasn't very pleasant at all, 15 minutes queueing to buy tickets and the tour itself wasn't anything special. Beer on offer was awful and very disappointing. Staff weren't much better either didn't feel like an experience felt like get in and get out thanks for your money. Heineken should really take some time to look at the Guinness Storehouse here in Dublin far superior and very well laid out unlike Heineken. I wouldn't recommend to friends and the price of stuff in the gift shop was astronomical. To sum it up find a decent bar in Amsterdam and get a pint in there."

We did the Guinness tour and the Jameson tour in Dublin recently, which we enjoyed. This place, however, was like a Disney ride, very little history, no personal guides, it was all done by video, and the average age of the customers was about 20. The important bit of the visit for them was getting a selfie of themselves lifting the Champions League cup, or kicking a penalty in a rugby international, again the wonder of video. Maybe I should have read the reviews on Trip Advisor... If you're over 30, probably best to avoid."

There is an admission fee. As you enter, you see the historical background of Heineken beer in displays, artifacts and old pictures. You see the massive old copper brew kettles, you see the Heineken horses in the stable, for pulling parade beer wagons. Later you get to go on a fun \u201cride\u201d, where they take small groups into one of several \u201cride\u201d rooms, that has a moving floor, and various fun and creative special effects, (mist spray, hot & cold effects, movement, various beer smells sprayed into room, etc.), and you go on a \u201cride\u201d, as if you were some beer being brewed, from start to finish \u2013 it is a fun way to \u201cExperience\u201d the beer brewing process. Later, you get to sample and taste beer, with guidance from brewery staff, much like a wine tasting session. More exhibits and fun things to do, and then you end up in the tasting room, where your adult green rubber wristband entitles you to two full size glasses of beer. For two coupons, you can try their super cold iced beer, which was very tasty, and had ice all over the beer tap. The Hop-Off busses have a stop nearby.

So much to see and do - you can learn about the brewing process, play Rugby themed games, create your own videos etc. Plenty of good photo opportunities. There is a chance to sample some Heineken midway during the tour and at the end. Please note that the free drinks are quite small and not even half a pint. At the end of the tour, if you do not wish to purchase Heineken with your drink tokens, soft drinks are available instead. I nearly missed visiting here as Google Maps/TripAdvisor led me to believe that it was open until 19:30 or even 21:00 and the Heineken website wasn't working. The last entry is actually 17:30! It is close to the museums (Van Gogh, Rijksmuseum) so worth doing on the same day if you can squeeze it in!"

The explanations of how the Heineken beer is made aren't that informative in my opinion - thay should give more \"scientific\" information about the processes.Even though, the activities available afterwards are quite amusing, especially for groups of friends and perhaps families with children.You also get some glasses to try out the beer yourself.Don't know if it's totally worth the price of a ticket, but it is a nice experience so I would recommend a 2-4 hours visit.Pretty close to the city center.Anyway, if you choose to visit it - make sure you buy the tickets in advance (even few minutes before your visit in some shop or stand at the market), because the lines are pretty long and annoying if you don't."

It had everything from seeing how the beer process works to and interactive 4-D theatre experience where you are the beer going through the process. After the tasting, I recommend using your two beer tokens for the extra cold 35ml beer instead of 2 25ml regular draft beers. The floor in the room where you get your beer (separate from the tasting you do earlier in the tour) is super sticky, noisy and crowded, so it really makes you want to get out of there."

Her stupid pose was mailed to my account haha. There is a lesson in how to drink the beer, which is one free glass, and if you answer the barmans question before anyone else you get a bonus glass. At the end, you get another two glasses, so 4 in total if you're sharp. Good mix of traditional and interactive stuff, and a sneak peak at the shire horses. All in all good fun.

We got lucky with the guy who was doing the beer pouring certificates 'for free' as the guy who took over after him started charging people their drinks tokens to do it! You get a small 15cl near the start of the tour, then either 2 25cl ones or a 33cl ice cold beer at the end, plus any extra from tokens you earned from some of the interactive stuff (plus an extra 25cl one you pour yourself if you get lucky and arent charged your tokens for it!)Something worth doing if you have spare time in amsterdam but wouldn't be urging myself to go back."

You are able to see all of the old label, bottle and glass designs! being taken through the tour you get to seethe ingredients that make the beer (obviously not the secret ingredients!) you get to trip hops, they taste pretty strange but i personally liked them! you also get to try beer when not everything is in it which is strange but enjoyable! you also get to see the type of horses they used to transport things. there is also some games and entertaining devices upstairs,a DJ game, how pour a pint game different works of art,there was a football section when i was there but don't go on my word that things will be there when you go as HEINIKEN does change the attractions in their museum but that is good as you can keep going back and things will have changed! You also go on a mini ride, you go into a room which has stairs and platforms with bars you hold on to. and a massive screen in front of you a man speaks to you and you get the experience of what it feels like to \"be a HEINIKEN bottle!\" this is VERY fun there is lots of little things that happen in this but i do not want to spoil it I recommend you should go and try it yourself!At he end when you are all laughed out and want to relax there is a bar where you can trade in your tokens for drinks or you can give in your tokens where you can get a lesson on how to pour the perfect pint and get a certificate at the end saying you a certified pint pourer. It does matter if it take you the once or several times like it did for me!There is also a lot of extras in this, more free drinks, toasting together as a big group you can get a bottle with your name on it etc. The gift shops is very good! a bit pricy but it has some really lovely things in it, you can get some amazing souvenirs to bring home! and at the end on your way out you get a free gift! i got a half pint glass the last time and it was very lovely you also get to keep your wristband you receive on entry!The staff are all VERY friendly, easy to talk to and will answer any questions you have for them! there is also no need to book ahead as you can easily get tickets at the attractionI would recommend any one to got this and if you have been before go again! all the attractions change and it is always fun."

The area was horribly crowded, far too small for the number of visitors, no room to move and hideously loud music thumping away over the crowd noise. Totally ruined the experience. Downed my two small beers too quickly to enjoy them and left.The souvenir shop as the end was very disappointing, overpriced, many things unpriced and the couple of things I might have bought were out of stock.If I had paid the full price for the 'experience' I would have been very unhappy, but I got a cheap ticket as part of a tour package so overall a reasonable couple of hours.

The Heineken Experience was so much more than just a visit to brewery and learning history of Heineken and beer brewing process. More than one option to make fun photos and video you may share directly from Heineken or send to your e-mail. Surprise gift at the exit from museum and free canal boat tour was a nice compliment from the house and well appreciated. Also this is brewery kids too have some attractions to try out and have fun. Boys who love football will certainly enjoy sport part at Heineken Experience. Realy enjoyed this one!"

We decided to visit the Heineken museum and thought it was really a lot of fun. It was like going on a school field trip but adult style, you get two free beers as part of the tour and a free Heineken glass at the end. The copper boil kettles make it all worth the trip, especially if you are a home brewer. This place should be on every home brewers bucket list."

It is a very impressive building from the exterior and interior. Very interactive and interesting to learn about the heineken story - the origins up until the present day. The tour takes you through everything like a story. There are many fun interactive things to take part in including the brewing process, being able to try the beer before the hops are added. There is also a 'brew you' interactive ride- similar to a simulator experience where you are essentially \"brewed\" like a beer. This was fun! You can also design your own beer glass, get a free beer and learn how to drink it properly, playstation, experience rugby associations and many more! We had lots of fun using the interactive photo booth, made a interactive video and designed our own glass. Unfortunately we did not buy this as we were not allowed it in our hand luggage! At the end you get the choice of 2 small beers or one large ice cold beer! This was yummy and included in the ticket price, and were able to enjoy it in a cool surrounding! The shop was excellent with lots of souvenir gifts to choose from! We really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anyone visiting Amsterdam! A good experience :)"

Once u pass this section u come across the interactive section where it shows the sports that they have sponsored through the years sports memorabilia and you even have a chance to join in a scrum or kick the winning conversion or maybes you want to sit in the dug out of a football match or take a pic with the UEFA cup. You also get to taste a beer in a miniature pint glass before heading to the bar where you get two free drinks. Would highly recommend."

You start out going through exhibits learning about the history of Heineken. Then you go through a room that looks like a typical brewery with all the big vats and learn about how the beer is made. You get to smell the hops and taste the barley they use. You also taste the liquid once the barley is cooked up. They have some of the Heineken horses there in stables for you to see. I loved the Brew ride. It was like an attraction at Universal Studios. You stand up in a group and watch a movie that takes you through the brew process. But while you're watching the move you get jolted, sprayed with water and blown with air. It's pretty cool. You get to taste samples of the beer while a bartender teaches you about the color, bubbles and how to drink it. There is a part where you can order a bottle of the beer and you personalize the label. Then there are a few floors made up of rooms to do all kinds of activities...play video games, foosball, photos, and much much more. Then it all ends at the bar where everyone must just hang out because it was crowded. At the beginning of the tour you are given bracelet to get a couple of beers.

The evening before line out door and down the street. It started a bit slow but then we got to the part in a room where a group of you become a beer. Difficult to explain but lots of fun. There were many more interactive parts. How to do a virtual perfect pour was one of them. At the end lots of things in the gift shop to purchase.I recommend getting your tickets at a vendor just down the road. It will help you avoid the ticket line in front of the place."

The start has the Heineken history, afterwards you go into the brewery with the large copper containers. On the day we went there was a choir which made the experience surreal! We got to have some hands on experience then went on the 4d experience. Again this made it fun! We were then given a half pint and discussed the flavours. There were interactive, very up to date technology stationed around the tour. We got to pour our own pint or you can just go to the bar and take your two pints. The best activity we did in Amsterdam and I'll recommend it to friends and family! Fantastic!"

When we entered inside we did not find anything special. Actually they say you just how they produce the beer,with which ingredients.And the secret of what makes Heineken beer so great guess what...it is secret. The two main reasons for the 1 star review is both the bad smell of the horses and that we had to wait plus 30' inside the building to experience the production of a beer,including our selves. That was not good at all. Waiting in the stairs and with a bad smell of horses,this is terrible combination!To sum up, 18 euro for this does not worth.

The only downside to my experience (and upside to my boyfriend's) was that every free drink - and there were many - my boyfriend got to have. This experience does have everything, from a ride where you are a simulated beer, to an exposition of Heineken's advertising and PR campaigns, to discovering how to pour the perfect pint. With many interactive games and different elements - it was a great time. Would definitely go again!"

Only took a couple of hours and my husband was very impressed with the whole museum and loved the history of how this brewery started so long ago.

I am not the biggest beer fan but it was still very enjoyable. You are able to see how the beer is made for the first half of the experience and get to taste the beer before it is fully made ( do not recommend tastes awful). It is finished with a tasting session that lasts about 5 minutes where you are able to enjoy your beer afterwards. The activities that follow are the best part of the experience. There\u2019s fifa available to play, photo booths, foosball, Wii rugby games etc. which you can play for as long as you like. At the end you can have either two free beers or one extra cold one (is the same temperature as the others) in the bar area. Overall a very good trip to go on and very good value for money!!"

You get a lot of beer samples (enough that we were noticeably tipsy by the end), you get to see certain areas that others don't, and you (along with the other VIPs) get led around by a tour guide. However, most of the areas are completely accessible to the non-VIPs, and because you're with a guided group, you may not get to spend as much time in them as you would otherwise. The tour ends with a beer- and cheese-tasting in a small room with a nice, old-timey saloon vibe. This part was fantastic and makes me lean toward suggesting the VIP experience, despite the sizable price difference. Overall, this was a great time, and a highlight of our time in Amsterdam. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't think our tour guide was very good and the VIP passes are quite expensive."

This was all full of great attractions and interactive facts. Take the tour that can last one hour or three...you get to move at your own pace. We had a blast."

Can play fifa, get 'brewed and bottled', pour your own pint of heineken and then get 2 free ones at the end of the tour round! We got a combi ticket with the ice bar which made the attraction cheaper so this is good to do. As you're leaving have a look about for someone giving shuttle boat tickets - it's a free canal ride to the heineken brand store where you can get a free mini glass! Definitely worth a visit in Amsterdam!"

The interactive areas were really fun and it was cool that you could take a photo in a special booth and then email it to yourself as a memory of the day. Definitely worth a visit if you have a few hours free in Amsterdam. Also really easy to get to by tram (I am usually rubbish at public transport!!)"

I was amazed to see horses in their stables at one part of the museum and spoke to a young man who explained that the horses are part of the history but are kept for promotion purposes. Beautiful animals that are treated to a holiday in Scotland every year! We both enjoyed being a glass bottle and taken on a simulation ride. There are a whole lot of interactive experiences to take part in. Lastly a trip to the bar for 2 complimentary beers or Pepsi which is set up like a trendy bar. No visit is complete without a look round the souvenir shop which was well stocked with Heineken merchandise. We were glad it was raining........"

Great and informative tour with some fun interactive elements.Having been on many brewery tours before I had an idea of what to expect but hat being said the Heineken Experience is one of my favourites.Upon arrival your entry fee gets you a wristband with little buttons which pop off and act as drinks tokens in the bar area.The tour starts through the foundation and history before going onto the brewing process. Staff were giving out taster samples of Wort...a mixture used in making beer and which one of the worst things I've had in my mouth was a nice touch while going through the brewing process.I never realised that Heineken still had horses and as you pass through the stables a staff member talks about the role the horses had across the city delivering beer. Who knew they gave their horses 6 weeks holiday a year...There's an nice touch with Brew You ride where you are put into the brewing process to experience it first hand before moving through into the development of the Heineken brand.There's a beer tasting room which leads on to a small cinema type room showing the Heineken adverts over the years, interactive elements where you can try kicking a rugby ball between the goals, try your hand being part of a scrum, table football, ps4 fifa games, a challenge to try and pour the perfect pint etc. So lots to keep interest as you move round.No brewery tour would be complete without samples and the end of the experience takes you to the bar where for 1 token you can get 25cl Heineken for for 2 tokens you can get 35cl Heineken extra cold.Would recommend a visit if spending time in Amsterdam."

They don't even brew there anywhere, but they've turned the original brew house into a giant museum / tasting center.The beginning part of the museum was very interesting, as it told the history of the Heineken family. The 2nd part of the exhibit they could have done without. There were a lot of hands on games, exhibits, etc. My husband was there 8 years ago and none of those games / exhibits were there then, so they are fairly new. They were interesting, but we breezed right through them since we just viewed them as a huge time suck (you literally could spend almost an entire day there if you played with everything). With your wristband that you receive at entry, you have an option to 'purchase' 1 or 2 beers with your tokens (depending on the size you want - the cost different token amounts) OR you could pour your own beer and receive a certificate for 2 tokens. We chose to pour our own; which was a lot of fun!We enjoyed the history, the beer pouring and of course the beer! :) You could get through the history / beer tasting in 1 - 2 hours, but plan on a half a day otherwise."

Glad we did that because once we arrived the line for the heineken experience was wrapped down the block. But we just walked in since we had our tickets already. Yeah!! Some reviews said it was not worth the money. I would say this if you are from out of town such as us and you or your spouse loves beer then to me its worth it. Though I didn't drink any beer I enjoyed myself. By the way I have toured the Budweiser Plant and several other beer plants all over so to me this one fell in line with the others."

What a great decision, probably the most fun you can have in all of Amsterdam. We laughed and laughed and had so much fun with all the things there are to do. It's just not beer (although you get 3 glasses free with admission). The virtual bike ride for two is so much fun, we are still laughing about me falling off the bike. Silly and so much fun! Do NOT miss this experience!"

I went to this tour mostly to know how it is, because living in The Netherlands and not having how to give an opinion to visitors it's started bothering me. At the end, it's an attraction of the city that many people are willing to go.My expectation was low. Actually it was better than what I expect, since there is possibility to learn about the history of the Heineken company and how they make their beer, as well as visit the first plant with the old equipments that they use to produce their beer in Amsterdam. It's possible to see the different bottles they had along the years as well as different labels. A film tells the history of the founders and the company until today and and they have also kinds of puppets to illustrated their history. One of the first attractions is a booth to take these pictures where you suppose to make strange faces. What they call the experience is not really special, since you go to a small room, in a small group and follow a film as if you were going to be inside the production of the beer and you fell some freshness during the production.There is possibility to try the beer in the middle of the tour and at the end, where you are (as always), getting out via a shop with all types of merchandise. Employees were friendly , making the tour agreeable.I went with one of my daughters and we actually had fun there."

The Heineken Experience did not go into how Heineken as a company got started or about the history of the company itself, and was much more about how beer is made. Being well-versed in the process I was hoping for more history about the company itself (kind of like what Carlsberg has done with their experience), and less about the making of the beer... That being said, the VERY cheesy video and interactive floor to explain how beer is made was hilarious and we all loved it. There are a lot of very interactive parts of the experience, as well as a video-showcase of Heineken in the media throughout the years. The staff were great throughout the experience as well.All-in-all it was well worth the money and definitely worth doing, but don't expect much about how Heineken was started."

The entry price was 18 euros but every leaflet that we got had some sort of discount on it, the best one we found was on a map which got us 3 euro off each. It was a self guided 'tour' basically. You got 3 areas of talking really. you got 1 small drink in an area where they tell you about the drink and if youre quick they ask questions and get them right you get another drink so be quick. then at the end you can have 2 small drinks or 1 bigger drink or you can skip that and do a 'pour your own drink' session. there were lots of interactive areas as well which were fun. the only criticism we had was there wasn't actually a lot to do with making the beer itself but lots more of the advertisement and collaborations that the company have done. which was all very interesting but perhaps not what many people would expect. we decided to 'bottle our own beer' and you get to print your name or phrase on it and collect it at the end for 6/50 which was a nice take away. overall we really enjoyed it nd it took a good few hours when you dont rush around."

The second half of the experience is without a doubt better. There is the 4D beer experience, where you learn what it feels like to be bottled, learning how to drink a beer and then some interactive sections. There are sporting sections for their rugby and football sponsorships, an opportunity to pour your own pint and then finally cash in your tokens for your free beer.

In terms of information and stuff to do it was very poor. There was a badly constructed simulation, very little information, and short presentations by quite rude and unpleasant staff. After enjoying a free drink, the rest of the 'experience' consisted of fairly empty rooms, which looked like a club in which there were a few games - most of which didn't work.

The first part was more about the history of Heineken and who founded it and when it was founded. Then you go on to discover how it is made, how they used to make it and how times have changed. Then you get to taste Heineken and learn how to drink it properly. There are loads of interactive things to do and it's just a great museum you never want to end! There is a great bar at the end where you can get a free drink and buy more if you wanted to! Safe to say I was slightly tipsy by the end . We went on the free boat trip at the end which was fabulous and the staff were enthusiastic and great with customers! We took a break at the souvenir shop and headed back. Where one of the female staff were talking to us about what it's like to live in Amsterdam. Since it is so different to where we live in England.

However, if you have enough time in the city or the weather is not that kind, then definitely check it out. It's not the best beer you can taste in NL, but good marketing makes it all interesting. You can get a Heineken bottle with your name on it, which also makes a nice gift instead of the good old city magnets."

Fortunately it's also a lot of fun.Admission includes a tour of the complex- no longer a functioning brewery, but made to look like one. There are plenty of interactive exhibits including a beer tasting, which includes one of three free Heinekens you are treated to along the way. You are free to spend as long as you'd like inside, which could easily take a couple of hours. A rooftop burger bar is a nice option if you're looking for a quick bite to eat.Perhaps just as solid as the tour is the canal boat ride that takes you to the brand's store in the center of the city- this is included in your admission and is not only a relaxing way to get back to the main part of the city but also eliminates the need to buy a ticket from another operator for a ride through Amsterdam's waterways. Once back at the store, you are under no obligation to leave the area- just collect your free Heineken glass and be on your way.Very highly recommended."

And one gets 2 free glasses of beer at the end of the tour. As well one can get a FREE canal tour on their Heineken boat! I believe it can pick you up at their Central station (not to be confused with the big bus.train station) And it takes you to the factory, and can take you back as well. On the way back, they give you a coupon for a FREE small Heineken glass at their merchandise store. I did find the store somewhat lacking in cool merchandise, they could do a lot better!

We were taken to a rooftop bar and brought our first beer, while we waited for the rest of the tour. As we had only 3 people in our group, it was a truly exclusive experience. We got to skip ahead of the main tour groups, were taken to a private room to taste various beers and cheeses, taken on a canal tour, given a personalized bottle and glass and felt important throughout the whole tour. Daan really made the difference in creating a highly personalized, VIP experience and I would definitely go back again."

There are quite a large number of metal stairs to climb, some quite steep - so may not suit anybody less able bodied.There is a Disney style virtual ride which is quite well done.All commentaries both recorded and form staff are in English.You get to 'sample' one beer with a lesson in how to taste it, and 2 'buttons'; that get you 2 small glasses of beer at the tour-end bar or up on the roof top bar.The latter does have good views over Amsterdam, where should you with you can also buy a burger or extra beer tokens.If its raining outside then this may be worth a visit, however I found far too many displays of certificates & medals, doesn't hold the interest.

Once you pay you receive a free souvenir rubber bracelet that has two buttons on it that are for 2 free beers at the end of the tour. The tour starts off with a video into the history of Heineken which is very informative. You glance past a lot of old heineken memorabilia. The tour takes you through 4 or 5 different rooms, ranging from the old brewery that has the old copper stills, to a room where you can play a dj in a room with black lights. You are able to see they boil malt and try different types if hops. At the end of the tour you are able to practice you beer pouring skills as you enjoy free beer.

We had a great time and drank quite a bit of beer. Would definitely do it again when in Amsterdam!!!"

The Heineken Experience is a self-guided tour through the history of Heineken and all about how the beer is brewed, through to the modern day where it immerses you in the experience of the Heineken brand.The Heineken Experience does attract a lot of young tourists, and yes it is trying to sell you the Heineken brand throughout. But it's not just a gimmick - it's a fun experience, with plenty of information and interaction. For example, the horses that traditionally pulled the carts with the barrels, and the 4D 'ride' where you imagine being a beer bottle was good, light-hearted fun.Another good thing is that they are pleasingly generous with the beer! I think officially you should get 3 glasses of beer (which is plenty, and more than I might have expected anyway!) but I got handed an extra one by the staff too. So it felt generous and good value for the cost of the ticket.My main criticism would be that the only beer you can drink is standard Heineken. The Heineken company do make a few other, less known, varieties, but they were quite distinctly absent. That's in contrast to the Carlsberg brewery in Copenhagen, for example, where I definitely tried 3-4 different drinks out of a range.I do recommend buying your ticket online. I went during August, when even at an off-peak time there was a small queue to get in, but my online ticket meant I could skip it. So worth doing."

Expensive to get in and not all that interesting nor fun really bar a few bits which were ok. 3 'free' schooner sized beers which tasted watered down to me and not poured well, just poured quick. The bar where you drank 2 of them was very dark and busy therefore nowhere to sit.All seemed a bit of a gimmick to help promote their drink, brand and make a bit of money in the process. A Cadbury World for grown ups if you like.I have since been to 2 other breweries (Purity, Two Towers) which are much smaller but their tours were much more informative, interesting and had more great drink during and at the end. Basically what I expected of a brewery tour.There are better things to do in Amsterdam so if you're visiting spend your precious time/money elsewhere."

It is also accesable with boat on Canal cruise on Heineken Experience station.We went there on Friday. There was no so much people. But we have bought our tickets via Internet, specially to avoid crowed, and the entry was 2 euros cheaper.First you walk through a sort of museum. Everything is supported by media (you can also use an app for your smart phone). After a short walk through the history, there is a man showing how the bear is made and after that you can also try the sweet mixture of bear. After that is a nice film, as you are in th middle of bear, with 4D effects, which we find is very fun. After that comes the bear teasting, and lots of fun stuff, including the picture making, football playing, so a lot of new tehnics involved,We found this experince very fun, but you can see that bear is no longer produced in this building. So it is just like any other tourist attraction."

Followed by a guide to brewing with tasters en route and bottling. A funny interactive journey is then concluded with a 'how to drink' lesson. 2 drinks are included after this with loads of interactive games and amusement and Heineken sponsorship games. Can't stress how good this was. Book at an excursions shop for 2\u20ac discount."

You get a chance to learn some fun beer history and do silly things like take your picture with the Heineken Champions League Cup (digital version)! You also get TWO pints included in the price plus an additional tiny \"pint\" for tasting purposes. It's a great visit and lots to do. It's centrally located and worth the visit."

We queued for 30 mins to buy tickets here on a Saturday afternoon which wasn't so bad, but you can buy tickets in advance at booths all over Amsterdam to save time.

The burger and the roof bar were great, the tour itself is mildly interesting but mostly made up of Heineken adverts!"

Although we were sold on the fact that you get 2 free beers (hoping they were pints). The history of the museum and the brand was interesting and they did an ok job at keeping us entertained throughout. We learnt how beer is made and took some pretty funny photos.However, when we got to the free beer part, the terrace that they told us was open when we arrived closed early for the day so we were left enjoying our very expensive free beer in a dark, sticky and uninspiring bar in the basement. Which after our drinks conveniently lead us to the gift shop where you could buy overpriced Heineken things and get your name engraved in a glass or a bottle (if you're into that kind of thing). All in all it was an interesting trip but over priced for what you got. I'd recommend you visit, but try and get discounts online or through a tour operator. Took us 1.5 hrs."

A well organised interesting and informative tour, with a few beers along the way :-). I would recommend getting tickets before going at one of the many ticket outlets round Amsterdam or at the Heineken brand store by Rembrandtplein. You save 2 euros, and avoid what can be large queues. The tour comes with a free canal boat trip to the brand store. It is short but worth doing as well, especially if you are only here for the weekend and don't have time for a full canal tour. You can pick up the boat tickets at the exit of the tour. You also get a free beer glass at the brand store at the end of the boat ride."

There are discounted entry vouchers all over the place for here, like \u20ac1 off entry or something similar of you are really watching your budget. I highly recommend taking the rooftop burger option for \u20ac24. It was one of the best burgers I'd eaten for some time and for the small price extra, including another drink, it was well worth the money.The tour is fun for both beer and non beer lovers with things to entertain you as you go around. As with most top tourist attractions, encountering coach tours would make this unpleasant as you try to take everything in. Download the free tour app (free wifi) and listen to parts rather than have to read and it also asks you a quiz question in some sections.You get a small glass of beer half way round to demonstrate the correct way of drinking beer and then you exchange tokens at the end for more. You can either have 2 standard pints or 1 pint of extra cold (I'm a sucker for a cold one).As mentioned the burger was great and they had live entertainment up there who were really good.The shop has all things you could possibly want but might be worth waiting...(keep reading)Take the free boat transfer to their branded store, beer available to buy onboard, think it was \u20ac2.50 a bottle, and listen to techno remixes of the Beatles. There's a game you can play in the shop where you can receive discount vouchers of up to 20% and its free to play. You also get your free gift of 2 small Heineken glasses though I was disappointed that they were the small ones and not the modern Heineken logo. Would have loved a pint glass. If you pick up a boat leaflet for the experience shop and spend over a viewing amount you can get more glasses for free. Shop also has Amstel & Desperados merch. Fitting room available. Worth bearing in mind the shop is smaller than the experience one so less choice."

Much more fun if you go as part of a group because they have a number of activities that would be best if done with your buds. You could spend a lot of time here if your with someone that has a shared interest. The guides were very friendly and the gift shop had a lot of reasonably priced souvenirs and is strategically placed on the way out after you have had a few tastings.."

In the heart of the city, near to the museums, it offers an in depth look in to the history of a great company, with clear and concise commentary ... and a couple of drinks included in the price.Tickets for the Experience are available in advance from Tickets and Tours, or on the door, for between 16 and 18 euros.It is a great way to spend a couple of hours, and maybe pick up a souvenier if you wish, although there is no hard sell for this."

A great few hours spent here with a few cold Heinekens or juice for the kids to finish with. A real surprise and a must for all - even younger families."

Oh and we were very impressed by how caring they have been about their employees, the community and the environment. The staff there is awesome. Super friendly people, all of them great and a lot of fun. Joke around with them all you want. When you buy your ticket you are given a bracelet for 2 free beers. So we got one each... plud a third! I was joking with the guy at the till and he gave us an extra bracelet. During the visit you will stop by a place where they will give you a beer sample in a smaller glass and teach you about it. Then at the end you get to the bar with a cool bar feel to it and loud music, and that's where you use your bracelets to claim you free beers. So we claimed all of them, and I had to do most of the drinking. And get this... I went back to the bar to claim my last 2 beers and the guy at the bar gave me 3!! I thought I had died and gone to heaven. This is a MUST if you go to Amsterdam."

There is however one room of interest which contains the large coppers and mash tun which as a brewer was interesting. After that there was a half hour que for a 6 minute film that was at best cringworthy. 18\u20ac is the most I've ever spent on a brewery tour and this is by far the worst one I've ever been on. It has the least tasters, the longest ques and the most advertising as well as nothing actually being brewed on site.The staff members I spoke to also know very little about beer as when I asked what percentage alpha acids are in the hops that a staff member was handing round they asked what alpha acids were.

We arrived at 12.30pm and went straight in - no need to queue as we had our tickets. We were given a wristband with two tokens on it which are swapped for beer later.There are many displays about he history of Heineken and although production isn't carried out anymore, you can still see the equipment that was used before and also see the basic ingredients used. There are horses that are well looked after, they have a history of advertising the company.There is a small ride, where you are the beer being brewed! Very fun! Afterwards you are invited to enjoy your first Heineken. This is free and no tokens are exchanged here. There is a chill out lounge to enjoy your beer and then you go through the rest of the tour experiencing advertising, Heineken's place in rugby and football. There are also lots of activities of games, taking photos and videos and you are able to email them to yourself. You can also create your own label for your bottle of beer which you collect in the gift shop.There is also a virtual pouring game to see if you really can pour a beer! However, this was completely different to the real thing towards the end of the tour! The real masterclass costs the two tokens you are given and you get the chance to pour the perfect Heineken and drink it! You also get a certificate. If you don't want to do this, you can exchange your tokens in the bar next door and get two beers there.The gift shop has lots of lovely memorabilia and throughout the tour we saw directions to another Heineken gift shop where you can claim a free glass. We enquired about this and were shown details of the shuttle boat that is included in the ticket price. We went for this option and saw plenty of sights on the way.We got to the shop and had the chance to play an old Dutch game to get discount in the shop. I got 15% off to spend! We got our glasses and that was the end of the experience!My review may seem long, but we enjoyed every minute - even me and I am not a beer drinker, but I had 2 glasses! We spend 4 and a half hours here, so it's not quick visit, there is a lot to see and do - well worth the money!"

Everyone received a \"shot glass\" size beer and was taught how to properly drink it. Later, two additional small glasses of beer were given for drinking. Had a choice of two small beers or one beer that you pour yourself \"with supervision\" and receive a certificate saying you are certified to pour beer. Keep in mind that the last admittion is at 7pm, so it's better to go early and buy the tickets at the tourist office to avoid the long line."

The experience itself is good value for a tour which takes around two hours end to end. If you pay the normal price of eighteen euros you get two small beers at the end of the tour. You get some good sights from the top of the building. There are parts of the tour that feel rushed and that could have had better led participation, for example when you're int eh main distillery they could have benefited from someone explaining the stages of distillation. The end product is fantastic and well worth it, the brand is strong and this is represented extremely well by the marketing department towards the end of the tour."

They have a 4-D experience where you learn how the brewing process takes place and feel the motion and ingredients as they get poured into the concoction. You also get the chance to play games and pour the best beer. Then you go through the usual brew tour samplings which were delicious as always.The difference between this tour than other brew tours was it was actually fun. There was learning, but there were also games and interactions involved. Very cool experience. I would definitely go back. The only downside is it is not directly in the city, so you will have to take some sort of transportation to get there."

With the iAMSTERDAM card, our entrance fee was EUR 13.50 each (25% off from normal entrance fee of EUR18).It includes either 2 regular draft Heineken or a bigger glass of EXTRA COLD Heineken.As we passed by the day before witnessing the longgg queue, we made sure to turn up at 11-ish am and when we arrived at 11:15h, there were already a small queue of about 20 people, we waited for about 10-15 mins.We were offered the option for a special price for a burger and fries for about EUR9 at the end of the tour when we got our tickets.There is a complimentary coat check in area beside the ticket counter.The whole HE (Heineken Experience) began with Heritage, their history etc...Then 'Quality from the start' where they show you the ingredients that goes in to making Heineken, the secret yeast that gives the unique Heineken taste remains a secret.We moved to the 'Brew room' and see the equipments used to the 'Stables' and then the 'Brew you ride' where they \"brew\" us :pNext was the 'Tasting bar', they gave us a small glass of Heineken for taste and they explained why it's important to skim the foam once you pour the Heineken into the glass.We went on to a section where you can learn to pour draft beer and you would get a certificate, you enter your name in a machine and it gets printed automatically, I did not know that you had to use the two small tokens on your wristband (entrance token) for this whole section as I was saving it for the EXTRA COLD beer so I told her I don't want to drink the beer but if she could give me the cool printed 'certified pourer' paper anyway? She just said no and told me I don't have to drink the beer but I have to give her the 2 tokens. PPFFTTT. I did not like this at all, this is the only bad experience I had during my whole trip in Amsterdam. I told her that in that case, forget it, she proceeded to throw away the paper cert with my name.Next on the agenda was the 'Bottle your own' section where you can customize Heinekens with your name, or anything you want printed on the Heineken bottle for about EUR10..I can't recall the exact cost.We went on to the 'Music' and 'Champions league' section where there were different rooms where you can take silly pictures/play games or just chill.Last part of the HE was the World Bar where I exchanged the 2 tokens on my wristband for one EXTRA COLD Heineken :)Last last part of course is the Heineken gift store.I just realized today that I was charged for 25 x Bottle Cooler Green Star instead of 5, this amounts to EUR 99. It's my mistake that I did not check before leaving as we got too distracted with everything! But still from the cashier's end, to overcharge a customer by 20?? That's a bit much. I rang them at the number provided on the receipt and by the third person that they've passed me to, a certain Mr. Akira Seriese took note of my complain and asked for my email and sent me an email directly and I provided a copy of my receipt and told them to check their cashier security camera footage to verify this nonsense and reimburse me. He replied swiftly after saying that he will \"discuss this and get back\" to me \"asap\".Noteworthy: We realized that we left our brolly in one of the rooms but can't recall what, the security working on that day of our HE tour (29th July 2015) at about 13:50h, he very kindly helped us and brought us back to the previous sections that we've been through to find our brolly, it was pouring when the tour ended and though we did not get our brolly back, the helpful and kind security man's action really made us feel so well taken care of.Shame we did not get his name, He is a gem in this company!"

I'm not a big beer drinker at all and I still had a great time at the Heineken Experience. The trip around the brewery is very informative and provides endless interactive aspects for visitors to get involved with. Simulators, beer tasting and plentiful activities for you go get involved with makes this a great day out for a good value for money. The fact you leave slightly tipsy is a bonus haha. The gift shop is very affordable. Im the not the type to buy from the gift shop but ended up buying a few cool customised bits from here and it was cheap. After you finish the experience they offer a free boat service which takes you close back to the centre. This is definitely the sort of place that will impress you if you aren't expecting much.

Even if you don't like beer I'm sure you will have a great time here!Do be remember that a lot of the people here will be drunk, so don't be surprised when people are falling over all over the place!We got a package ticket to allow us to do a canal tour and the heineken experience.

It's hard for me to give Heineken Experience justice, as it probably has a different target group than me and my 30+ girlfriends, but I will still try to be objective :)First of all, it feels weird to give 2 hours of your time and pay 16 eur only to allow a company to advertise their product to you - as it is exactly what this place is: a huge, glowing advertisement. On the one hand it seems obvious, after all it's the HEINEKEN, not \"just-your-ordinary-across-the-street-brewery\" Experience, but it still feels weird when you are being convinced step-by-step that Heineken is actually the only sensible choice of beer in the world. And you pay good money for it. By the way, I am still not quite convinced anyway :)The place is organized in a fabulous way though and there is tons of fun things to do. I am sure a group of young guys going there before a stag night would be delighted: there's beer, some more beer, a bit of history, but not enough to get one bored, video games, another glass of beer, music, sports, some interactive games that we didn't fully get (not enough beer maybe?), and - to top it up - yes! You're right! Some more beer!I was slightly disappointed with how little attention was give to the very process of brewing. This part of exhibition could be better; all the elements are there, but lacking proper explanation or description.Quite disappointing, as all the old equipment is there waiting to be shown in full glory. I also didn't like the fact that horses are kept on display in the stables section: even though there is some distance between them and the visitors, I am not sure that the animals appreciate the noise made by swarms of tourists... Another annoying feature is that the Heineken Experience is obviously not satisfied with the already steep admission fee, but presents additional opportunities to get tourist money; I think that making a customized Heineken bottle or getting a short draft beer pouring lesson are nice features, but they should either be free of charge, or located in or around the store, instead of the place itself. I felt that if I paid for the ticket, all the attractions inside should be already covered by the fee.On a good side, Heineken Experience is well-organized and fun. Basically all aspects of Heineken business are covered, from beer production, packaging, advertising, to sponsoring of music and sport events that the brand is investing in. The place feels more like an adult playground than a museum and all in all I didn't regret visiting. It is also worth to mention the fantastic staff who were not only helpful and attentive, but also fun and friendly.All in all, not exactly my cup of tea, but not a complete waste of time either. But then again, I am a 30+ woman :)"

We had to queue for 35 minutes just to get in, the reason being that there was only one person selling tickets with three empty tills next to her. 18 euro entry. The beginning of the experience are information plaques on tiny gloomy walls in tiny rooms. We had to wait outside in the corridor before being able to enter these rooms as they were so crowded. However, I wonder if this is deliberate to make the following exciting activities even more interesting! We were very briefly explained the process of the beer making but I felt it was too brief and u informative. However, following the museum part was a stimulation activity -my favourite part of the experience. You are shown the experience of a bottle of beer from being created to being drank. Good fun! Immediately following this was a beer tasting directed by an energetic chap. You are given a glass of beer on entry and the guide taught us more about the beer and how best to enjoy it. FYI he also fires off quick questions for which correct answers are awarded by a beer. (The easiest question was at the end; 'what's my name' also rewarded in beer!) who also enjoyable. At this point I thought we had reached the end of the experience but instead followed on tons of different interactive activities. This has to be by far the most interactive place of interest I have ever visited. Great time, spent at least two hours in there and I had 4 glasses of beer for free, all in all a great time."

I purchased my ticket ahead of time(you can do this all over Amsterdam, you won't have to wait in line and I believe I got mine for $17) I've been to other beer museums and compared to my other experience this was much more of a playground than the others. It was very interactive. Had a ride, a ton of games, photo-booths, places to make music videos, an area with a DJ. It was just a lot of fun. I really liked that you would get your own personalized Heineken bottle, I thought that was a nice gift to get for the beer lovers in my family. I could have probably spent a total of 3 hours here, but I was in a rush so I only spent about a hour. In the end, more than worth the $17!"

We got it at a combined and reduced cost with another attraction. I am glad that we did not pay full price. It is not an active brewery but an overhyped homage to a poor product and it's advertising, with some lip service to the history of the brewery and beer making. Personally, I found it tawdry - the 2 drinks are for half pints only. There were some funky aspects and liked some of the older adverts and labelling, but on the whole I just found it to be one huge advertising campaign! Only go if you love the product. If not, do not waste your time or your money!"

This tour begins with some interesting information, but around halfway through the visit, it appears that the Heineken people struggled to figure out a way to justify the price of the entrance ticket. Once visitors pass the horse stables, the remainder of the tour is clearly meant to appeal to the younger teen and college crowd; it is jammed with electronic \"tricks,\" that don't have any obvious connection to the history of the company, or even to the current day marketing of it. By the time visitors arrive at the rooms where the free beers are offered, it feels as though you've entered a frat party; the floors are so sticky, you actually peel your feet off of them, the tables are covered in sticky residual beer spills, the music is much louder and difficult to speak over, and many of the crowd are behaving in a typical frat party manner. The bathrooms, at least on the day we visited, were also filthy.My advice....rather than visit the museum, save your money, buy a six-pack of Heineken, and read about the history of the Heineken company while sitting in the comfort of your own home!"

The tour itself is self-guided with a few points where staff is set to tell you a bit more in depth about the brewing process and the culture of Heineken - these parts are by far and away the best part of the tour. The \"guides\" were all very knowledgable and personable, they do a great job of telling you about the history and about the beer without sounding rehearsed or worn out. If I could've just done those parts of the tour I would've been just as happy as doing the other parts where you walk around as if it is a museum. The tour was extremely crowded when I was there, so I would HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend you buy your tickets at one of the many tourist offices on your way to the brewery. Not only is it a few euros cheaper, it also lets you skip the line that snakes around the building. At the end you get two beers, along with one other beer that a guide will teach you how to properly drink while on the tour. So overall, for 16 or 18 euros it's definitely worth a visit, just don't expect to have your socks knocked off."

You have the right to order a bottle of Heineken beer with their name and surname as well as a lot of souvenirs, T-shirts, hats, bags ... great experience and a great idea!"

This is a very well preserved Brewery and offers a very interesting history about Heineken. You can walk through the Brewery and see the equipment used for making the beer, you then go on to the tasting area, where you can sample the beer for yourself. You then walk through the stables, seeing all horses and old fashioned carts used to transport the barrels of beer. There is also a very fun interactive area near the end of the experience which is fun for all ages, not just children!You are best to go early as it does get busy. We were there for about 2 hours, which is enough time to have a leisurely walk round the experience. You might think \u20ac18 per adult is quite expensive, but at the end of the experience, we felt it was worth it. You get two drinks and a glass included with your ticket. A snack box is also given when there are four of you in a group. This is perfect for when you are sampling the beer while watching all the Heineken TV adverts."

The first three quarters of the tour are excellent, you get to see the original features of the brewery and learn about the ingredients and get to taste the beer. You also get a 4D ride which takes you through the whole journey of brew to bar - prepare to get wet! There are lots of photos and old bottles etc. it's interesting to see how the branding and bottles have changed throughout the years. There is even a stable of still working horses although these are now only used for promotional work. You also get to design your own personalised label (extra 6.50 euros). The last quarter of the tour was a bit gimmicky with DJs, computer games, Heineken sponsorship and the like, most of which you cannot get near because of the amount of people there. You do get to practice your pulling technique though which is good fun. The experience is rounded off with a trip to the bar where you can either get two 35ml Heinekens or 1 large 50ml extra cold Heineken. When you consider how much you would pay for these a couple of streets away in the centre of Amsterdam, the tour is good value for money and a pretty good experience."

My best advice for anyone planning to visit the Heineken Experience is to purchase your tickets online prior to arriving. This will save you \u20ac2 per person and help you jump ahead of the long line of people and straight into the experience.Unfortunately, this 'jump ahead' only helps you slightly as once you're inside you will be herded like cattle with the rest of the folks who have already entered. Since there are so many people allowed inside at one time, it is difficult to hear the information that is being piped in through loudspeakers about the history and view all of the artifacts against the walls. Once you've gotten through the historical part of the experience you hit a bottleneck (no pun intended) when you enter into a virtual reality experience and then become completely encapsulated in one giant Heineken advertisement for the rest of your journey ending in a giant souvenir shop - just like at Disney. The good news is you're given beer during this time - one small glass at the star bar and then after moving into a different area you are welcome to either two regular glasses or one extra cold glass of very crisp Heineken -- the highlight of the experience.The concept is cool, but with poor execution. It would be beneficial to allow less people in at once, perhaps selling tickets per time slot."

The snack was very welcome as it was a cold and windy day outside and the bitterballen was nice and warm.The tickets for the Heineken experience is quite expensive, but you do get 2,5 beers throughout the experience which make it more worthwhile. When purchasing your ticket, you get a little bracelet with some tokens which you later use for the \"purchase of beers\".The museum part explains how Heineken started and became popular. It was fascinating to see how different people managed the company during their time. After this you move to where they show you how the beer is made, what the different ingredients are, etc. At one point you go out of the one building, and walk upstairs to upper floor. We were quite surprised to find a horse stable between the buildings. Once upstairs you go to a special Heineken experience. On the day we were there the queues were long, but we didn't wait for longer than 20 minutes to enter the special experience venue. It was a nice experience - similar to those 4D moving movie theatres. After that you can design your own beer bottle, take some pictures of yourself in different settings (for free). Then you get to a room where you get your first 0.5 beers where some ladies explain how to drink a beer, etc.There are also rooms with games, video clips, etc. Eventually you end up at the bar area where you can have your 2 free beers or soda if you don't want to drink beer. There is a souvenir shop when you finish. One of your tokens entitle you to a free gift as well, which is a free Heineken beer glass.Overall, we enjoyed the experience. Although a bit pricey, for a one-off experience we thought it was worth it. The staff was super friendly and helpful throughout."

It had the generic explanation of the beer making process, it had lots of past advertising, then there were some strange things like a DJ booth set up that people could play with, and a camera that took a photo of the user to email to themselves to prove they'd been there. If you're lucky, it's possible to get more than the usual allocation of free beer at the end of the tour, but I found you need to be female and cute, and the bartender must be male.I also noticed a severe lack of staff apart from the bartender at the end. I've definitely had better brewery tours."

The Heineken MUSIC HALL is in a different area of Amsterdam and not physically close to the Heineken Experience at all!!!) OK, on with my review of THE HEINEKEN MUSIC HALL, (Arena Boulevard 590, 1101 DS Amsterdam Zuid-Oost, Netherlands+31 900 6874242) We stayed in old Amsterdam and took the metro from the train station directly to the Bijlmer Arena stop. It was an easy trip, much less expensive and time consuming than taking a cab. We came from the US to see Jackson Browne, so were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality; the acoustics were excellent. The Dutch crowd was SO quiet, it was really lovely to be able to actually appreciate the more quiet moments of the show. The seats were roomy but not each attached separately to the floor - they were attached to one another, so there was a lot of \"bounce\" with anyone beside you moving in their seats while enjoying the music. This was our only distraction tho, and not so horrible that I wouldn't go back. No food was offered there, not even snacks, so it was lucky we ate first. There was not much choice in restaurants so eat before you go or take what you get!! It's right next to the big Ajax Arena, so I'm sure there's more open when there is a soccer match in town, but it was like a ghost town on the Monday night we went. There is a little mall close by, but that closed at six and I'm not sure what was offered inside. I think the metro runs until midnight most nights (but check the schedule to be sure, don't trust me...)"

            "review": "Nice Tour - Best Part is the Canal Boat Ride. I've been to a few brewery tours, so in comparison the Heineken Experience was just OK and nothing spectacular. The main reason I didn't think it was great, is because they make it to be a huge commercial and advertising for Heineken and how it's the greatest beer in the world and you shouldn't drink anything else. I'm not particularly a Heineken fan so maybe that was a cause for not enjoying the tour as much as others but you get 2 beers plus a small tasting for the price of your ticket. The champions league display was cool to see but there isn't much information or details on how the beer is brewed or the history of heineken that you would expect. I didn't even know Heineken owned Amstel until I got to the store and saw an Amstel t-shirt and I asked someone, which I think is info that should be part of the tour but it isn't. After the tour ends they give you a voucher to pick up your free souvenir glass, however the pickup location is at their brand store which isn't that close, but they provide a canal boat ride to the store right from the heineken experience which made the tour worth the cost. Since I didn't have a canal ride planned as I only had 2 days in Amsterdam, this free tour/ride as part of the heineken experience was definitely the highlight and an unexpected bonus of the tour. Note, that they Only take you to the store on a one-way trip, so you need to figure out a way back or to your next location on your own and I just ended up taking a Tram. Overall a decent tour, it would be a great tour if you like Heineken, I just wish they talked less about how great their beer was and were a little more humble and gave more facts about the history and brewing process. The canal boat ride was the best part of the tour even though it's pretty much unrelated to anything Heineken except that you can drink one on the boat. If you have a few hours available then this tour is worth it, but if you are on a time crunch I would skip this experience."

We ended up skipping most of it as it was quite uncomfortable. There was a huge queue to get the beers that are included so we gave our tokens to others and just bailed.

Its well advertised like the disappointing Amsterdam dungeons and although it isn't quite as bad, it still doesn't jump out at you. But if your gunna take the 17 Euro plunge, you will likely enjoy drinking beer, learning about its contents and the brewing. Just be warned that the ride is not what you might expect and you don't actually receive that much beer, you get half a litre max. Side note: I saw people with children at this experience, and in my opinion I don't believe a Brewery tour is really suitable for children.If you are thinking about taking the kids, you might want to relook your parenting."

Worst in this respect: A 20 minutes queue with no explanation what to wait for. (Showed up that it was to get into a small cinema \u2013 well the film about beer making was ok funny.)Free wi-fi was advertised all over, but the network was so overloaded, that I never got online during my one hour visit.The problem with Heineken Experience is, that you 16-18 Euros to most of all see Heineken promotion: Their advertisements during times, a lot of sponsorships (football etc.) and a very self-glorification telling about their (family-)history.Not much is explained about beer making. It seems as if this facility is extremely afraid of boring people. The (only) highlight for me: to see the old (but not working) brewing building and equipment.This is waste of time and money \u2013 maybe unless you are 20-30 and want a small party (which is almost taking place at the final place with too many people, load music and sticky floor.)

We were glad to do this as when we arrived there was a long queue to get in which we were able to bypass (though it's not actually marked very clearly where those with advanced queue jump tickets go to get in so you literally have to push the queue at first to see where to go). The experience itself is much like any franchise factory tour, a bit of history, a few artefacts, hands on exhibits and even a 4d 'ride' which guides you through the brewing process. In all it took about an hour and a half of our time and at the end we could sample the beer (our wrist bands offered two complimentary drinks plus a free gift of a small glass). For me, who doesn't like beer, it was still a worthwhile interesting experience. I still wasn't necessarily won round to drinking beer but I appreciated the process and have it a good try! My only criticism was that the queue for the 4d ride was very long and the staff seemed a bit disorganised. The queue looked huge but it actually moved fairly quickly (people went into the ride in big groups per turn so it stopped and started) but I witnessed a lot of people walking away from the queue because they thought the wait would be too long. A simple explanation of the queue system and approximate wait times would mean visitors will know what to expect and will not miss this highlight by thinking the queue would take forever. In addition, I also loved seeing the beautiful horses however the stables staff were just stood around chatting to each other away from visitors so I didn't really learn much from this area despite thinking it would have been good to get closer to the horses and know a bit more. The stables were also at a distance so not really anything to interact with beyond taking a photo. It would have been nice to get closer and to find out more about how the horses worked with the brewery over the years and why they are still being kept in the building especially as it will likely cost a lot to keep them there.I would definitely recommend this if you are spending a weekend in Amsterdam!"

But its sort of like a magazine full of ads- not much content! Not really worth the price. You get one beer then must pay for the rest at the end of tour....Amsterdam is full of amazing tasting beer and Heineken isn't one of them. Their gift shop is ridiculously expensive. Why pay that much for something with their logos on?? We should actually be paid to wear their merchandise...not vice versa!"

Like the Sam Adams Brewery in Boston, this is \"where we USED TO brew beer a long time ago\". They have added some really fun activities, but the real disappointment was in the overall message: \"Heineken is perfect. There's no need to drink anything else -- ever.\" There is only one kind of beer available at the Heineken Experience -- regular old Heineken. We were told that it is the perfect beer. When we were given a sample to try, a lady in the group was humorously criticized for drinking it the wrong was. Then we were told the \"right way\" to drink \"the perfect beer\". In this age of craft brewing and beer variety, I found all of this to be off-putting. If there were anyplace on earth I expected to taste another kind of Heineken, or even an experimental Heineken, this was it. No such luck. If you want to spend a couple fun hours inside, this is a good choice. If you want t try some good beer, I suggest Brouwerij 't IJ"

This is done up like a self guided tour and has more of a museum type feel. Along the way you will see the beer process (something you expect), but then they also toss in some things along the way like a \"ride\" that you stand, watching a movie while the ground bounces you. They have a beer tasting along the way that you are told what to look for in a beer. At the end of the tour, you have two buttons on a bracelet which are good for two beers. At the end, on the day we were there, we had an extra white button that was for a free Heineken beer glass. All in all it was a fun experience. It may seem a bit pricey for a brewery tour, but it really does have more to see than the usual brewery tour. If you love Heineken, this is the place to be."

Frankly it's a bit of a disgrace that they make you pay such a high premium to walk through what is what I can only describe as an interactive Heineken ad only to be handed a beer at the end when you could happily do so at a bar for a third of the price.

This includes the chance for some funny pictures, becoming certified in the perfect pour of a draft Heineken, custom Heineken bottles, the importance of hops, and HOW TO PROPERLY DRINK A HEINEKEN. The last part admittedly made me enjoy the beer more than ever before, go figure.

It was announced that if it was anyone's birthday that they should put their hands up and collect a free delf tankard which was filled up with Heineken and when empty to put it on head to have it refilled - very nice touch."

Leaning about the ingredients, seeing the distillation process and of course the indoor stables (really strange but cool) The staff were so friendly and spoke not only Dutch and English but many other languages! Many hidden surprises that really made the experience fun. And free beer made my boyfriends day! Fab over all experience even if not over the age of 18. Would highly recommend"

The tour is very interactive and lots of fun; the highlights for us were practicing pouring the perfect pint, the photo opportunities in the large cardboard cut outs and the PS4 games. There is also a \u2018bottle yourself\u2019 simulation, photobooths, horse stables, recording karaoke, photo opportunity with the winners trophy and emailed to yourself afterwards, and sampling raw barley etc etc. During the tour you get a half pint and 2 tokens for further drinks at the end (these can be half pints or cokes etc). You also have opportunity to get extra half pints if you shout out and answer the questions correctly in the tasting room. We enjoyed the canal tour afterwards in the Heineken boat, which had green tinted windows so you felt like you were traveling inside a beer bottle. You could buy Heineken on the boat, but we did not, having drank more than enough on the tour. I believe the boat runs on afternoons only, and takes approx 30 minutes to take you to the Heineken shop in the City Centre (or else this is a 15 minute walk). Apparently you get a free beer glass if you visit the shop after the tour, but we didn\u2019t as ran out of time as it took a long while to dock the canal boat.You can book tickets online for 16 Euros each, which is cheaper than on the door, but if you don't want to commit yourselves to a schedule (like us) you can buy your tickets for 16 Euros each from the ticket shop on Museumplein \u2013 with the food stalls etc, next door to the Van Gogh Museum (5 minutes walk away)."

But it really doesn't start until you see the short video, then they teach you how to drink the \"less than a month old beer that is at icing temperatures\" which is fantastic. Then more modern Heineken advertisements along the way and bam!! You end up at a nice Heineken green bar that's waiting for you to chug some beer. Like I said, we had friends that flew in from Hawaii and the staff even at the bar was kind enough to give us extra beer!! Free of charge!!! We felt the aloha!!

Heineken is of course a dutch beer and a very well known brand, at the beginning of the experience, you are given a bracelet which has small tokens to take off which entitles you to 2 free beers (at certain points of the tour) and a free souvenir glass at the end of the tour. The first part of the tour takes you through Heineken history and how the brand became what it is today (it is also the location is the original brewery where all the magic started). You then go through the stages of brewing and how beer is made (you get a free beer at this point but no alternative if youre not a beer drinker). You then get to see their horses (assuming they arent out to pasture for their annual vay-cay), these are used purely for promotional purposes and make a few rooms of the experience smell of horse poo (not nice at all). Next is the 'brew you ride' which takes you through the experience of brewing beer, this is by far the best part of the overall experience, although it only lasts maybe 4 mins at most, expect to be shaken, heated, cooled, and slightly wet! Now comes the more modern side of the experience, there is a dj booth for pics, several interactive rooms for singing and playing around really (dont take it seriously, its not meant to be, enjoy yourself, have fun and most importantly, laugh, a lot!). You get your second free beer at this point (or if you dont drink a coke/fanta but be warned it will taste of Heineken!) and then the option to pick up your ouvenir glass on the way out. There are plenty of leaflets and vouchers available to get atleast 1euro off throughout Amsterdam and if you book via the website, then you can get 2 euros off! This is a fun attraction for those who arent looking for something serious or are planning on taking it seriously."

Laser lights, computer games, big screen TVs.The first room with the old copper vats and beautiful led light windows was the only worthwhile part. The rest was a few pictures on the wall, and gimmicky games. Very disappointed we didn't experience anything about actually brewing the beer - other than watching a movie. Well we can get that on u tube for free.Half way through this side show were real horses in a stable - very odd. No explanation of why they were there other than a sign that horses have always been important to Heineken. They seemed to be put there as a token of something real and tangible that's lacking in the rest of the place.So to end it, we were looking forward to our 2 'free' BIG glasses of Heineken. We were told several times about these BIG glasses at the end, so we naturally assumed they were pints. The truth is, you get 1 pint of extra cold, or 2 glasses of regular.Most hotels in Amsterdam give out discount cards for 1\u20ac off the entry price and 2 beers. They are worthless - you'll get the discount by just asking, and the 2 drinks are free anyway - you don't get another 2 free drinks with the coupon.And to get this free beer that you've waited an hour for and put up with all the circus stuff for? A very long slow queue at a noisy dark bar with flashing lights and sticky floor to get your 2 small glasses. There are no chairs, just a nightclub dingy atmosphere, everyone standing around shouting at each other to be heard over the music. It was horrible. We bolted our beers down and got out of there.There were no staff to answer any questions about the history on Heineken or how it's made. The staff that are there don't have time, as they do their bit and then move you on to the next show as there is another group right behind you. Coming from Australia where we drink Heineken all the time, this tour was supposed to be a highlight of our Europe trip. It has almost put us off ever buying it again!"

Me and my wife enjoyed this attraction on our visit to Amsterdam, the old brewery, especially brewhall has been well preserved and even the wife found this interesting, the stables she really enjoyed how they look after the horses. There is a 4D show which was fun if not a little cheesy at times but fun all the same. Then there was the taste testing and the free beers what more can I say about that apart from not enough!. The only problem here was I thought I would get my wife's share but it turned out she liked Heineken too uh!A good experience and well worth a visit. The only downside really was that it was very crowded and a tour guide would have improved the experience although the staff there were very helpful and friendly. Go enjoy hic!"

The building itself has a nice 1850s industrial type architecture and visiting the old brewery wasn't too bad. The bad parts were mainly when we were waiting in line to see the \"best part of the day\" according to the staff there, after which we would get our first beer. That part was an underwhelming \"4D\" show followed by a guy who would give us a small glass of beer and toast to heineken then \"drink it like a man\". We were then herded to a small noisy bar with a sticky floor to get 2 beers included with the entrance which we drank quickly and left rather quickly."

Posters, wall info, exhibits, actual brewery equipment, multi media rooms. As well as really enjoyable explanations from some top crew members. Roxi has top effort marks! It's all just ace. You can't help learning about it as you go along and it really is fascinating. A lot of things to interact with. Including the 'Brew You' ride which is extremely well executed! Free samples and then two free drinks at the end with every entrance fee. Really is a great place to experience! Also pick up a free glass from the brand store about 12 mins walk away. (Take coasters/wristbands). You can tell Heineken are a top notch, people orientated brand! "

Visited today late morning, booked through Tickets & tours using saving \u20ac2 each vouchers from within the leaflet (you need 1 leaflet per person) we picked up from the GVB ticket office opposite Central Station which contains several discount vouchers on the inside of the back two pages. Very informative, well thought out experience, self-tour apart from a few interactive elements early on you get a free beer tasting lesson, extra free beers if you can answer some simple questions plus there are some great used of technology to make the whole visit much more than your usual brewery trip. This included two or three free Apps in multi-lingual options plus a section where you are able to be super-imposed on a video of a band singing Tulips From Amsterdam either near a Windmill or on a canal boat, worth making yourself look silly as you can then email the video to friends, our daughters found it hilarious back home. At the end you then get 2x 25cl glasses of beer per person in a nice bar area plus great gift shop. On your way out the door you also get offered a free 30mins Heineken boat shuttle that takes you right to the Heineken brand store in town where for the pleasure of being taken there you get a free Heineken glass. Overall very good experience and we though great value. Would personally not take kids under say 15. Great for couples, family groups or friends. Thanks Heineken, a very pleasant 3hours and you could show a few others a thing or two about brand management !We would recommend."

We wandered through the exhibits on the founding of the company, which seemed to be a bit high handed in extoling the virtues of the founders (all three were geniuses with compassion for their employees and awarded medals of honor from various kingdoms according to the exhibits...which are not biased, I'm sure). Then on to see the old brewery, learn about the ingredients, see the old stables, enjoy the interactive \"brew me\" experience (something you have to see to understand), and finally go on to the tasting room where you are taught how to taste the beer. From there you can participate in various activities that you pay extra for, like having your name printed on a bottle, or just move onto the bar. I was disappointed in the bar, I have to say. There was not nearly enough seating and at that point I just wanted to sit down and relax and enjoy my \"included\" two drinks. Being pregnant, that was Pepsi and water for me, but hey, a drink is still nice. Instead, we gulped down our drinks so we could leave and find another place to sit. My husband learned how to pour beer and I got a cute video of him pouring like a real bartender that we enjoy.At the end of the tour we took the free shuttle across the city on a canal boat to the signature store to collect our \"included\" Heineken glass. This is the part of the tour that really upset me. As I was climbing the (steep) steps to get off the boat, the driver shoved me hard, and pointed to the tip basket. He did not seem to speak English and seemed to be indicating his displeasure that I hadn't added anything to the basket. My husband (walking ahead of me) had, but I guess that didn't register to him. He almost pushed me off the steps, something that I was afraid of for virtually my entire trip to Amsterdam as I navigated all those steep staircases while pregnant. I was shocked that anyone would consider shoving a pregnant woman off the stairs to be acceptable in the name of tips. We love our tips in America and even here that would be ghastly. I didn't tell my husband until we were a few blocks away because I knew he would be livid. All in, I won't reduce my rating of the overall experience based on one inappropriate person, but I hope someone somewhere reads these things and provides appropriate action to make sure this doesn't happen again. For those that plan to visit, I hope this doesn't stop you. There are likely to be many diligent boat drivers out there, just mind yourself when you go to exit just in case."

There was the opportunity to have a bottle of Heineken personalised at a reasonable price. A word of warning here though. If you have only taken hand luggage on your trip to Amsterdam you will need to check the luggage in as hold luggage as the bottle is in excess of 100 ml and will not be allowed through security. Alternatively you can drink the contents and put it in your hand luggage. There is also the opportunity to have your bottle or glass engraves.

It was was a fun afternoon, there were no long queues and it was reasonably priced. For the entrance fee, you get a tour and 2 free beers in the bar at the end. I would recommend purchasing an IAmsterdam card before you go to Amsterdam. This allowed us a 25% discount on the entrance fee for the Heineken experience (as well as unlimited use of public transport and free admission to other attractions). For a fun afternoon, learning a little history and enjoying many a beer, I would definitely recommend going here!"

We both like a pint now and again so we went for it, we were super surprised that there was no que!! Once you start the tour it does seem a little crowded, but people start to disperse at there own time onto other things. There was a gentleman explaining the ingredients of Heineken he was very good with the audience. Then there was a ride which was a little bit of cheesy fun! Next you got a free taster and the staff where so kind and humble. On the way out we found a little lounge with Heineken promotions but it was nice to rest our feet after a bit. After we thought we was finished, there was loads of fun activities for adults. Then you get your own little Heineken experience if you want to write a name on a bottle for \u20ac6.50. Then you receive your free two tiny pints! If your just going for the free beer, I don't recommend. But the bar has a nice vibe with music and you cam pour your own if you like. There is an opportunity to take a boat to the Heineken Brand shop for free, where you claim a free prize."

Also - not to forget the free drinks (the amount depends on the type of beer you would like to drink). There is a giftshop at the end of the experience for all those wishing to purchase branded goods, and what some do not know about is the very informative boat ride through the city to the brandstore. This is a massive added feat of the entry to the museum, as the boat trip provided is better than some of the boat trips that go from Damrak (from my past experience).A great experience and well worth the fee - a must experience in Amsterdam for those of a legal drinking age."

The trek to get the free gift was something we didn't do but we spent roughly 2-3 hours there on a rainy day! We purchased the IAmsterdam card and received a discount on our entry. It started to rain when we arrived at the brewery and they handed out ponchos! I thought this was a pretty cool thing for them to do. The line can get super long so I suggest heading out really early or just be prepared to wait.Overall, it was a great time!

First buy you tickets at any of the ticket places, seriously anywhere, they are chalet and you beat the lines. Also download the app but do it in wifi. Once you have downloaded you think it's fine but then you open it and have to select your language which it then downloads. But it give you a commentary of the things you are walking through in the first half of the tour which is nice. You learn about the history of the company of the beer, and get some two free beers. Then the tour turns high tech with lots of opportunity to do since random things, like make a t shirt or make a music video, pull an imaginary beer. The high tech stuff didn't really grab me but I enjoyed the traditional brewery tour part."

I specially liked the room in which they \" Brew you\". one of its kind. i can say, best way to explain the brewing process by making you experience being brewed.

As a veteran of multiple brewery tours (Sam Adams, Mansion Leffe, both Carlsberg factories) I feel I am well placed to comment on such things.Positives;First thing is first - the beer. I can honestly say there is a lot of hit air regarding the Heineken in Amsterdam being the best there is which is totally unfounded. I think it says more about 'other substances' consumed by such individuals aside from beer. The beer in this Museam is without a doubt the best Heineken I have ever tasted.There were some nice touches in the tour especially in regards to the technology aspect. Great light show through Heineken bottles, pictures as if you were lifting the Champions League, video clips as you look through the brewing containers.The tour can be done at your own pace with regular toilets and places to sit. Free cloackroom for coats and bags etc.There are also a lot of innovative tourist features which are definitely designed to take tourists money but are undeniably cool. Getting your own name printed on a full bottle of beer, Heineken glass, pour your own pint etc.The actual tour is good and informative, best section for me was regarding drinking the pint as it explained the purpose of having a good head on a beer.The tour also comes with a 'free' canal boat ride at the end which does admittedly take you to the second shop bit also close to the main streets. Heineken on the boat is 2.50 Euro for a 330ml bottle which is good value.Negatives;I paid 20 euros for the trip (direct through the Heineken website), which only included a couple of small drinks, there was no option to buy any more drinks either.From a value perspective this is on the extortionate side, particularly when compared to something like the Sam Adams experience which was free.To rub salt in the wound there were many vouchers offering the same tour for 16 euros with a free gift. The only real advantage of booking through the official website is that you can skip the ticket queue.The drinks system works by way of tokens, you get 2 of these which can either be used to buy a full pint of beer or to pour you own beer (with certificate) which is only half a pint ish. You do get one half pint for free but at 20 euros with no way to buy more drinks is very poor.Overall;I would recommend going just be mindful of what you will get for your money. The canal boat tour really adds to the value.Top tips;Shop around to get the best deal on entry tickets.In the second shop I played a game which earned me a percentage off a single purchase. Unfortunately my most expensive purchase (leather Heineken wallet) was made in the first shop so I was a bit gutted as they also had it in the 2nd shop.Plan your trip whilst the experience is near the Hard Rock Cafe the canal boat will drop you quite far away (although does offer a round trip). Best to go to HRC first and kill 2 birds with one stone.There are a couple of bars near by which are useful for killing time whilst waiting for the boat."

In the end we never got to the museums but did go to use our ticket for this as I'd already payed for it. I was glad I did, having paid only 16 euros online... For that you get a small tasting size beer, then at the end of the tour you can choose two small normal beers or one larger ice cold beer each, so as a couple we had the small ones then one big one for my husband. You also get a decent 30 min canal ride to the brand store, where you also get a free glass (at the moment it's a champions league glass) and for 1.50 euros they will etch your name on it. This part was where I thought it made it value for money.The beginning of the tour was quite dull. Initially there was a pretty cool virtual barman who told you the history of Heineken but it meant we already knew everything the following non-interactive rooms were telling us so we pretty much walked through these glancing on either side. There was a section where you could take those photos where you stick your head through a scene.The rest of the tour was pretty good, a 4d style screening where you are treated like beer getting bottled, with a moving floor and water and bubbles blown at you, (lasts about 8 min?). You can also play PS4 games, make a karaoke video, pull your own beer, be a DJ, and there are a couple of cool rooms to sit and soak up the atmosphere.One thing that was a problem was it was a one way entrance. My husband smokes and drinking beer in the bar at the end made him want a cigarette, but even though he had a wristband he couldnt go the few steps through the shop, smoke, and come back in, he would have had to walk right through the whole tour again to get back to me, so this could be something to be thought about."

However, it turned out to be one of our favourite things from the whole weekend! Lots to do and very entertaining. Starts with a walk through of how company started, the family history, etc. Saw the huge copper vats used for brewing. Missed the horses as stables were being refurbished. The ride through the brewing process was fun! There's a James Bond part, pull the perfect pint, Champions league, make a pop video, personalise your own bottle, there's loads!!Then of course you get your free taster and a lesson in how to taste it properly. Followed by another 2 free drinks in the lounge bar at the end. Fab!!"

To be fair, we were visiting Easter weekend and perhaps it's not always like this---but it's basically a brewery tour and if you've seen one, you've seen them all---there's some fun stuff at the end of the tour after your first tasting---but the rest was worthless. When we visited, we stood in line to get in--then you started the tour of the historic area, which was informative, but as there's no real line, people wander in and out and you can tour at your own pace. The trouble starts after the horse barn and before the \"Brew You\" experience---where we stood for over an hour with nothing to see and nothing to do.... I would say for the $15 it was about $10 too much. Don't pre-purchase a ticket--although it gets you in ahead of the others if there's a line---just go to the place and if there's no line and you've never seen a brewery, then go in---but for your $15 you can buy a lot more Heineken and you won't have to stand in line for over an hour waiting to drink it."

The history of the brand is interesting and it was good to see where the beer would have been made in days gone past. My favourite parts of the tour were as follows:1. The beer tasting experience - listen carefully to the bar tender's chat as he gives out extra beer if you can answer his questions correctly. 2. Bottle yourself - the simulation is great fun. If you are in the front 2 rows, you may get wet!!3. Draught your own - exchange 2 tokens for a beer pouring lesson with a drink at the end or go straight to the bar and have 2 drinks poured for you. 4. The interactive zone where you can record some Dutch karaoke, take photos against a green screen or record a message to send home.

It goes on for five minutes, it is quite ok but it does look like a giant Heineken commercial... Then the rest of the museum is actually a huge commercial!!You get to have a degustation (yeah, degustating Heineken, what a joke), you can't even enjoy it at ease, since they almost chase you from the room. Or you can finish it in a room with a giant commercial displayed on many screens.There is a \"bottle your own\" part which costs 6\u20ac, a music part which is remotely useless as well as the sport part.In the end, you get the choice between two 25cl regular beers, or a 35cl \"extra cold\" beer which is a cold as the regular.A truly disappointing museum, I am not a fan of the Heineken beer (there are way better beers in the Netherlands) but I at least expected something more fun and big than this.Don't waste your time there."

The exhibition is good to learn about the brewing process and history of the brand. There's lots of activities, displays and some hands-on stuff. Also there are displays with which you can take photographs, and machines to send e-cards with your picture, which are pretty cool. I enjoyed the tasting session, and two free drinks. After the tour, I was offered a free boat trip to the Heineken shop, where I also received a free gift (beer glass). Awesome!"

Visiting the Heineken Experience was genuinely great fun for a group of friends all in their 20s, however I can totally understand why some of the other reviews are less than complimentary. The experience itself is less about learning of the history and beer making process, as this part all felt quite rushed at the very beginning of the tour. After that, there were many rooms full of money spinners like 'take a picture of you with some bikes' or 'create your own personalised beer bottle' all of which were an additional cost. The room at the end was like a mini nightclub and it was nice to look at the pictures and chat to other people while we enjoyed our beers!I would recommend that anyone staying in Amsterdam pays a visit here. It's great fun, even if it's not what we expected."

This boat is not well advertised and can easily be missed if you do not know about it as it is after the walking tour of the brewery. We had to ask someone how to do get onto the boat - glad we did as it was a lovely shuttle boat trip down the infamous Amsterdam canals.The experience itself was also great. Very hands-on with lots to do and see even if you aren't a massive beer lover.Would recommend this experience but make sure you get the little boat too!"

There is a lot about the history of a company which was quite interesting, the staff have a lot of knowledge, but all of that is about 4 rooms, then you can see the copper tanks where the brewing process was taking place and ...that's pretty much it. After that you'll queue for a little while to see a video where you are being brewed which is really cool and you going down to the bar where you can collect your 2 pints of heineken and of course buy a souvenir.

Situated a few meters away from Museumplein, Heineken Experience is a fun visit with a very reasonable entrance fee of 18 euros (You can actually get a cheaper price if you have discount brochures). The price includes two beer tokens which can also be used to participate in a beer game, as well as a free gift souvenir. It is worth pointing out that the first few areas of the tour are not that engaging, especially due to the fact that they are too small for large groups of people. However, the tour gradually improves after the interactive screening of the brewing process, and culminates with a surprise twenty minute boat trip in the canals. I would suggest visiting the place in the morning around 10-11am as the place is less crowded and hence relatively quieter than in the afternoons."

It was not only appropriate but they enjoyed the experience as well! We bought the tickets for my husband & I at a restaurant near the Amsterdam sign for \u20ac16 to save the \u20ac2 because if you buy at the Heineken Experience they are \u20ac18 per adults. We did however have to get the kids tickets there. We arrived at 11 am and there were NO lines and only a small group of people inside the area. It was \u20ac44,50 for 4 of us (2 adults, 1 child, and 1 free child). Kids under 12 are free. You get a wristband that has to 'buttons' on it that you remove for 2 free drinks. For the adults you can get 2 beers, or if your like me and don't drink beer you can get 2 sodas. The kids get sodas as well. If you like beer you also get a small glass of beer in the tasting room so a total of 2.5 beers and if you answer a question right they will give you another beer. The experience has lots of photos, descriptions, and videos throughout. The horses are gone from the stables for renovations until April 30th. There is a 4D ride as well as several interactive games. You even get to sample barley (I never knew it tasted good raw) and hops. We were here an hour because there wasn't a whole lot of people there so we were able to see and do the stuff without waits. When we went back by at 6:30 pm there was a line out the door. After your done with the experience you will get a voucher for free gift from the Heineken Store. You can either take a free boat ride or walk the 15 mins. The boat ride is a 30 min ride through the canals, but only runs from 1 pm to 7 pm. It wasn't running when we finish just after noon so we came back later at 6:30 and found we'd have to wait until 7 pm so we just walked to the store. At the store you get a free mini beer glass, 1 per person. Overall we thought it was a neat experience and wasn't overpriced for what we got and it was something that we were able to do as a family, even for those of us who are not beer drinkers. Try to plan it when it's not crowded, like around opening, so that you can have easy access to everything."

They kind of herd you like cattle up a narrow spiral staircase and small claustrophobic rooms that people will cram into you that is not pleasant at all. Finally it does let you into larger spaces but then you will jam up again at the \"ride\". The ride was a surprise and fun and the free beers were tasty but at times the tour had a disco kind of feel if you like that sort of thing.

It was fun but I expected a little more description and insight into the company itself. There is very little explanation on the production, expansion, and distribution of the beer and brewery over the years.The tour ends with a bar where you can turn in chips to get two 25cl pours and then you shuffle into a gift shop with some interesting items. You'll be disappointed if you are expecting a real brewery tour - this is nothing like the craft breweries in the US. If you have several days in the city, it's worth an hour of your time to check it off your list, just manage your expectations."

One would think the concept of a popular tour attraction, in a extremely popular town, would leave room for this tour to expand to accommodate the high volume of visitors regardless of holiday weekends or not; sadly it is not so. the tour continued with well placed and interesting wall viewings, but the 'Penguins shuffle' of a pace of the tour left much to be desired considering the tourist congestion ended abruptly and began again spontaneously. A 45 minute wait for a 10 minute \"interactive\" video feature followed by leisurely activities clear through to the tourist shop to include two spots for beer tastings was good for most tourists but for me being as I said earlier crammed like a sardine left me drenched in beer instead of consuming it because of tourists bumping into me angling for a spot to stand, not sit, and guzzle their allotted rations. all in all that was the biggest 2.5 hour waste of my vacation I will never get back and NOT worth the 16\u20ac I paid to be dumped alcohol on.

You get free drinks at both of these.Buy your tickets at TOURS&TICKETS (the red shops) as they only charge 16\u20ac or it's 18\u20ac at the actual factory.Also, if you buy your Ice Bar tickets at the same time, it's a lot cheaper :)."

Lots of interesting facts about the history and family background. Beautifully preserved main area with all the original features. Little snippets of audio and visual, and the idea of being in the making was fun. Of course at the end to sample the Heineken in a great area where you can pour your own was a real treat. Lovely atmosphere and no rush."

My family has a Holland pass, and we decided to not use our gold pass, which gets you in for free. We got discounted entry though, so it ended up being like 14.40 euro each. There is a lot to do here; there is the museum part, which details the history of Heineken family and creating the brand. There is a lot of interactive stuff to do here! We ground barley to make the beer, and stirred the barley mixed with water. There is a tasting room where they give you little samples of beer to try; I got two, because I answered a question properly about beer! There are plenty of places to take pictures and email them to yourself for free; my sister and I did that a lot! There is also a \"ride\", which is kind of like virtual reality, which we really liked! With admission, you get two free large Heinekens, as well as a free gift (a drinking glass).

For the price you don't get much beer (less than a pint and half) but you do get the chance to 'experience being a bottle of heineken' which was quite novel and you also get a free boat ride at the end to the Heineken brand store, where you don't actually have to buy anything so it's effectively a free lift into town. Expensive at full price and not a 'must see' if you're only in Amsterdam for the day, but if you're here for longer and have an iamsterdam card or similar discount, this is overall an enjoyable break from the more formal museums."

It was busy but not as busy as the museums. There are a nice series of videos and displays telling you the history of the brand and how they make it. Toward the end you get a tasting which I found quite informative. Did you know you should always sip from beneath the head? If you don't, the beer will be bitter. The smell of REALLY FRESH Heineken is unforgettable. At the end you also get 2 free beers for good measure."

The start was pretty interesting, about how the business was started and the brand etc but after that I was bored to tears. There was hardly any infomation that explained where you were etc, we tasted a sample of two ingredients (think it was water and barley) which was revolting and lingered a long time! You were rushed through a lot of it and not given your free beers until the end, being able to walk through the actual exhibition with it might have been a better experience. Just stick their logo over anything and everything to drag it out... Overall I wouldn't say it was worth waiting in the huge line or paying full price - we booked online for two euros less per person and got straight in, otherwise I would have been even more annoyed! The boat trip to the Brand Store is included, get your tickets on the way out of the shop, and was handy as we were going to that area next. However, you couldn't see very much as the windows are tinted green and covered in stickers so not a replacement for a canal boat cruise but definitely the best part of the experience."

The guy at the ingredients counter was rude & showed no interest in what he was trying to explain & standing 40minute's for the \" Heineken Ride\" was tiresome especially for children & older visitor's.

After that theres the \"bar\" area, where you can retrieve the 2 beers included in your ticket price. If you want you can serve your own beer in a bigger glass and have a picture as a \"certified beer pourer\" (but that will get you your two tokens and only one beer).

You don't have a guided tour you literally walk around looking at advertisement . There is this stupid ride midway boring. One thing that a found was the exit .

The Heineken Experience was excellent. The guy on the desk was very friendly asking where we were from and encouraging us to take photos so we could tell everyone back home how good the tour was, so here goes.....You start off with the early information about how Heineken started. There are lots of things to read on the wall and then you stand in a room which is set up as a bar and the video is as if the barman is behind the bar talking to you. From there you move to an area where a guy tells you about the main ingredients of Heineken. Next you move to the actually brewing area where there are videos to watch, ingredients to stir, and other interactive displays. Next you move to the 'Brew You' ride - clever! Then you move to an area where you are given your first sample. Next there is lots more interactive stuff with reference to football & rugby sponsorship and other advertising features. Finally you move to a bar area where you can enjoy your last two samples. They did say that you can collect your free glass in their gift store close to Rembantsplein but when we arrived back in reception we were able to collect ours there.A very good 'Heineken Experience' and definitely recommended!"

The first part of the experience was dedicated to learning about the history of the company and how it has changed and grown thorough the years. After that you get to explore the brewing process and even get to see the Heineken horses. I really enjoyed how interactive the whole experience was, Heineken have really thought about how to keep their guests entertained, I especially loved the simulator experience. Finally you get to learn about how to pour the perfect pint of Heineken,and after this you can explore the history of Heineken marketing and a little about their involvement with the Champions League... And finally you get to enjoy a drink on the house in their fabulous bar, a great way to spend a couple of hours!! The tour isn't expensive and includes wristbands, drinks and a free gift, a must do!"

It looked as a theme park to me.You start from the beginning of meeting Mr. Gerard Heineken, then with the ingredients and brewing process. Along you see old commercials, bottles, labels. Then you have a 4D experience in making a beer. After that you can make your own bottle (with your name on the label, extra paying), you have beer tasting with lessons how to smell and drink the beer. At the Champions League corner you can play football, live and on the game console. At the end you pour the beer on the machine and get a certificate and a glass as a gift."

I thought if a beer drinker came to Boston and didn't visit Sam Adams it would be silly, so I'd better go. It's not a bad tour, but it isn't special, and it's very expensive. As is the case with any brewery, you don't learn anything you can't online, and because it's so commercialized--unlike, say, the Sam Adams brewery in a residential neighborhood of little Jamaica Plain--it doesn't have the feel of a family run business. It just feels like a factory for the global-market beer producer that Heineken is."

We visited the Heineken experience after realising we had more time in the city than anticipated, and although the exhibits and information were interesting it was a bit disappointing. It seemed like most of the money I paid went towards numerous glasses of Heineken and was based on the assumption that anyone visiting the exhibition must be a heavy drinker, and like populating their homes with Heineken paraphernalia. The layout was particularly poor with not a single piece of information allowing more than two people to view it at a time, and the need for people to be released in groups following certain exhibits made this even worse. Having said that, during the main part of the tour staff were on hand to help and offer the odd factoid. One of the better parts of the tour was the simulation where you were given the chance to feel like a bottle of beer being made, and the opportunity to have your own message put on a bottle for a reasonable \u20ac6. We jumped at the chance to commemorate our trip, however having paid for our bottle we were then told upon collection that it was not suitable for flying home with us, meaning we would now have to post it to ourselves. Had we known this upon purchase, odds are we wouldn't have bothered. In fact the whole experience deteriorated towards the end of the tour with the attitude of the staff becoming rude and slow. We were made to feel like a number, in a very over crowded and poorly organised bar being rushed as we drank the drinks practically forced upon us."

Would not recommend going when your really high."

I wouldn't say it's a museum or estate brewery, it is the old brewery turned into an attraction.We bought our tickets online, saved a penny or two and skipped the line up (which was long) and headed off. We started off with great little bracelets including 2 tokens for drinks and one for our free gift with purchase (which ended up being a cute Heineken glass, collected at the end of the attraction). The staff were great and helpful in pointing us in the right direction. It was a little busy to queue through but we felt it was worth the wait. There was some neat information and picture chances, the attractions also gave an overall look at the brewing process, the Heineken history and the Heineken family. We tasted the beer with the tasting master, smelt the hops used, ground some barley, tasted the wart used and went through an interactive gallery for different ads/events Heineken sponsors. At the end you could opt to have 2 free beer or use two tokens to learn how to pour expertly and drink 1 beer! I had fun doing the later. There was a bar at the end where we met some neat people, and drank lots of beer! Tip: definitely for the young at heart! We had lots to drink and did a lot of random interactive games! Be prepared to have fun, and booze! Tip: children can be included in the fun, they have pop for those non drinkers. Tip: another tour booked online that saved money, bring your smart phone with the code and you're set. Tip: eat before you go, hit this after lunch, not to avoid the crowds, but to prepare you for the drinking ahead! Also bikes are a great way to get around, but not when you are too drunk, drink responsibly."

Past the first parts of the tour - history of the brewery and brewing process - it's all flashy, tacky and borderline-arrogant self-promotion. Having to *wait* in line to get into the \"Brew You\" ride without being able to avoid it - the \"skip this ride\" lane is only visible once you're almost done waiting - is ridiculous and insulting considering the \"interest\" of the ride (which you only realize afterwards). The tasting lesson was a nice, refreshing pause in the middle of a long, boring succession of clubbing, video-gaming and social networking activities.It's not necessarily a bad attraction but it wasn't for me. Parents should leave their teens at the Heineken Experience while they themselves go to the similar attraction House of Bols, about the history and making of Genever, which is a lot more about the product rather than the brand."

But I cannot say I took away anything more interesting than that. You got to see the storage units, bottle your own beer (for 6 euro), and then play a bunch of somewhat bizarre video games in huge rooms lit up by green lights. It was so busy that there was a line to go into every single room, followed by every single attraction or game you passed. At the end, they gave you either 2 free beers, or one free \"ice cold beer\". Glad I saw it, but I would only recommend it for the beer-(very) enthusiast in your life."

By the time you get your first beer, you really want to drink Heineken. By the time you end up at the sampling bar to drink more beer, you want to be associated with Heineken. The bar exits, appropriately, into the gift shop. And by gosh, you want to buy anything with Heineken's name! This is marketing at its best, but it works, and it's fun. Loosen up and enjoy the ride."

Europe is still running off of the fumes of its once glorious beer days. This tour was like walking into a 1980's amusement park filled with antiquated \"virtual experiences\" and cheesy commercials. If you've never visit a brewery it might be a learning experience but if you've been to even Sam Adams or Coors this tour pailes in comparison. Long story short I felt like I paid 35\u20ac to watch old commercials and drink a half pint of beer."

You also can interact with quite a few things, like putting out your own beer, videogames... in the end you'll have tried 2 to 3 glasses of beer included in the admission fee, and you also get given a free gift, which is a cute retro small beer tulip (you can buy more at the shop if you wanna make a set) . You also get a free canal boat ride so they tAke you to their other souveni4 shop near mas amstel im not mistaken. Well free boat ride is Great! There is a guide which will show you around (the cheapest boat ride we've seen was worth 8.50 starting at central station) and you can learn more bout Amsterdam. Tip, check your Windows when choosing your seat and try to get a clear window rather than the green ones, or at least make sure it opens. Ours was green and locked so no pictures, unfortunately, but most people on the ride had better luck than us. It was worthy in the anyway."

Firstly, don't be fooled by the historical appearance of the building. This is not actually a brewery but a building that has been reformed to be a large advertising centre for Heineken. You may think you will learn and witness how beer is made, but the majority of the self guided tour is all advertising and propaganda for the brand. In fact, one of the ways they try and 'educate' you of the process is the Ride. You line up to enter a room, where you stand on a platform to be assaulted with sprays of water and heating lamps in an attempt to simulate the experience of 'becoming a beer,' which may have worked if I was not older than 4.In regards to the interactive activities, a lot of them were various forms of advertising or ways to extort further money from idiots. I'm not sure how this \"attraction\" got so many positive reviews, inclusive of the praise regarding the opportunity to pour your own beer. It's a simulated game, with poor electronic feedback and the computer froze on us during our attempt to interact with it. The free beers were small pints, and given how cheap Heineken is in Amsterdam it doesn't justify the cost or the time wasted. As for the free gift, well it would be too easy if they would allow you to pick up the gift on site. Instead they make you go to another location which wasn't local. Even at the beginning of the self-guided tour, they admit that Heineken's success was due to advertising. Don't be a fool and give these scam artists more money."

I went along with my boyfriend as he was interested in checking it out. The first few videos explaining a little of the history were very cheesy and kind of laughable. It was cool to see the old label designs and different bottles through the years. You could also see the old brewing equipment and heard a little about the ingredients and how the beer is made. Then we got to the simulation where they 'turn you into a Heineken' which was completely ridiculous. You stood on a stepped platform watching the process of beer on a screen while being jolted around and sprayed with with water like you were on a fairground ride. Next came the beer tasting where you got half a pint to taste free of charge. The rest of the tour was largely advertising...videos of commercials and different events that were sponsored by Heineken. In one of the bars you could trade one of the two drink chips you were given upon entry to pour your own beer and receive a certificate to say you did so. Then in the bar opposite you could also trade your chips in for one or two beers or Pepsi if you preferred. There are several interactive spots where you can pay to make t-shirts with your picture or star in a music video as well as being able to buy a personalised bottle. Overall it was an okay visit. Perhaps not worth the money if you are not a fan but a bit of fun if you are."

The tour itself is very well done and very interactive but I left feeling rather unsatisfied and slightly ripped off.It was too crowded, the tickets are quite expensive and the gift of a tiny Heineken glass at the end was average and I was so disappointed that the \"customize your own Heineken glass\" feature was out of order, especially as this was half the reason I went. (I promised my dad I would get a glass customized for him)"

This will allow you to skip to front of the crowd waiting outside. However, that's the last line we skipped. As soon as we got in there was a crowd in every room - so much so that we couldn't even read the signs on the walls or see the demonstrations. Then you get funneled up a broken escalator to get your first \"experience.\" We stood in line for at least 35 minutes to stand in the hokey \"brew you\" experience where the floor shakes and they spray water in the room. After you get through this, the tour opens up a bit and you get your first mini beer and can walk through a more interactive area. However, the first half waiting around in crowded conditions sort of killed the mood for the rest of the experience. You do get a decent amount of beer for the ticket price, but the brewery needs to do a better job of controlling the number of people flowing into the facility. Finally, my walking was limited to a recent injury and there are a lot of stairs. The elevators are not marked well or located along the natural path of the exhibits. It took an hour and forty minutes to get through with the crowds, but I would skip it the next time."

You also get a free gift (a glass), however I would definitely suggest getting the free Heineken boat instead of picking up your free gift after the experience.To get the Heineken boat you need to get a free ticket after the experience. Then you board the boat just outside the building. On board they serve bottles of Heineken and soft drinks for \u20ac2.50 each and if you buy 4 you get a free snack pack.The trip last around 20 minutes and includes a mini tour of the canals you pass through. Then a short walk from where you dock is a Heineken brand shop with more merchandise and games to win a discount."

Very interactive and interesting. I honestly don't understand the negative reviews here. You get 3 free beers and a free gift, there is a 'beer brewing ride' (you really do feel a little like what it might be like to be a bottle of beer!!!) and you can also learn to pull your own pint 'the Heineken way'. There are so many interactive stops along the tour, including photo stops where you can email yourself your pictures for free.

I've been drinking Heineken for a long time and for many years, it was my favorite beer (I prefer more Belgium Ales now...) so it was a must that when I visited Amsterdam I stop here! The staff is great, the facility is awesome, you get to tour it and learn a few unique things about Heineken beer. They have a couple of interactive games you can do while there (like make a music video) and you'll get an opportunity to drink a couple free beers! If you like beer in general, you have to stop here when visiting Amsterdam!"

There are 2 (and a half) free beers with each ticket, but my boyfriend and I gave away 2 beers, so that goes to show how much of a beer person we both were. However, this was a surprisingly fun and in a strange way, educational, experience for us. There was the standard history of Heineken, but they also had staff explaining to us exactly how beer was made. There was a mini 4D simulator ride thingy, which was super cool. And then before you took your first small glass of beer, the staff explained to us certain cool things about beer I never knew. There were also under non-beer-but-Heineken-related interactive stuff like taking your own MVs, pictures, etc etc. Commercialised stuff, but fun. Most of the people there were young adults, probably just there for the free beer, but if you have time to spare, this could be one cool place to visit in Amsterdam. We bought the tickets at 16 Euros each from the tourist office (it's apparently 18 Euros at the main venue). Bought some bottled beers with my friends' names for souvenirs, and all in all, it was quite fun."

The newly renovated \"experience\" is just that.... an experience. This is not your grandfathers \"brewery tour\". This is an extremely well done showplace of lights, sounds, smells, holograms, and special effects. This brewery was opened in 1867 and ran operations until the late 1980's's when a new brewery was built and opened outside of Amsterdam. This location opened in 1991 as a museum. Then in 2008, it opened what is now known as the Heineken Experience. You will start out on the main floor and make your way up... up... up and then work your way back down. The tour begins with a history lesson and you get to see the chambers that once held the hops for the infamous Pilsner style Dutch beer. Next, a hologram actor will begin to tell you the tale of Heineken. Walk up some curly stairs and you will see awards, medals, advertisements, glassware and the original deed and charter to the brewery. Then, you will get a nice 10 minute hands on lesson in how beer is made. You will also get to see the original vats and equipment in the brewing room (Hint: taste the wort that the brewer has available; this is beer before it is fermented). After this you will get to see the Clydesdale horses and carriages which still deliver Heineken in some parts of the city. Then, it is off to a short but fun \"beer ride\" where you are the bottle. Then a tasting and then off to exhibits on the Heineken Brand! Some may find this to be shameless branding... but, it is so well done that you won't know the difference. Next you will have your tasting of 2 pints of Heineken in the snazzy bar. You will get a bracelet with 3 tokens attached at the entry point; Two for 2 pints and One for 1 souvenir at their gift shop. I took the Heineken boat afterward (for free) to their store location to get my free mini-pint glass. The tour itself was very informative and well done. All in all this was a great tour and I highly recommend this if you find yourself in Amsterdam (this is located in the southern part of the city center/canal ring). It may pair well with a trip to Vondelpark afterwards for a picnic."

You also get a token for a free gift (which you can claim at the entrance, ours is small branded glass). They now also have a free canal ride to their bigger brand store.There are multiple chances you can send yourself a souvenir picture. You can also place PS3 Football."

I guess as any mayor brand this place is trying to capitalize on their brand and set this up for you to take a nice walk through their history but there is not much else to learn, the self photo and video booths are complicated to use and be sure to put your info correctly (which I did) because neither of us in the group got either the video or the photos or the video we took, that were available for free."

We went on a quiet Wednesday afternoon and didn't have problems with queues or staff as others have had. The first part talks about the family-owned company and then you walk through a smelly large room with lots of empty vats, see the horses from afar and get to the simulator where you pretend to be a bottle of beer! After that you get to taste the Heineken! There are a lot of interactive activities and a bar / club area (very noisy) where you can get two more free drinks and then its into the shop.Included in the price are three smallish drinks, a free gift but best of all a canal cruise of around 25 minutes to Heineken's store in the City Centre. We travelled at 6pm so it was dark and got some excellent night-time photos of the City! In the store you play a game to get discount off any purchases as well as collecting your free gift.Overall though we did enjoy the Experience but make sure you go on the canal cruise to get your money's worth!"

We had a lot of fun learning about the making of Heineken and, whilst the building itself is not a functioning brewery anymore, it is a very hands-on experience.

After this we paseds through the on-site shop to get to the exit where a man was standing off to the side discreetly handing out tickets for the free for the shuttle boat to the brand store(close to the city centre). The shuttle boat was brilliant with a detailed tour of the city( for free) and a chance to put our feet up after a few hours in the factory. On arrival at the brand store we collected our free gift(a collectors edition Heineken glass). Overall this experience was brilliant and cheap in comparison to what we both got out of it."

You learn about the history of Heineken and how it is brewed. There is a taster provided as well as two free drinks or you can pull your own beer and receive a certificate for it ( you receive a bracelet at the start of the experience and there are little clips on it. Two clips will get you a beer and the certificate or you can get two drinks). There are a bunch of interactive exhibits were you can be a dj, enjoy a football game, watch some Heineken ads, or play around with UV lights and cameras. It's \u20ac16 and you skip the line if you get your ticket from a ticket store in the city or \u20ac18 if you buy it there. You can also get a free Heineken glass as part of the experience at the brand store near Rembrandtsplein. It was a great experience and I spent well over 4 hours doing it but it all depends on how involved you get in the interactive exhibits."

A free gift was also on offer at the end (in my case a small Heineken beer glass.)Pros- it was fun and interactive- it was well set out- it included a free beer tasting- the entry ticket included two beers and a gift- there were great photo and video opportunities- a fast entry pass is provided with the Holland Pass- children were permitted, but only with an adult. They (obviously) can't have a drink.- kids will love it too because of the ride and interactive displaysCons- sometimes there would be hold ups as you moved from section to section- bar section gets crowded. It was not easy to find table space.- you might walk out a little inebriated. Not sure if that is a con.Well worth the visit."

It is not just about the beer it also about the Heineken brand and their marketing which is world famous. You do get to sample some beer half way through the tour and you get 2 glasses to drink at your leisure at the end of the tour. TIP: during the initial tasting the tour guide will ask you questions about beer \u2013 if you answer them correctly you get another tasting (I got one for answering hops). I didn\u2019t learn too much about the beer making process as I am already a brewer, but the experience was outstanding. We saw the Heineken horses, a sporting venue where you could play games and my favorite was a theatre where you could watch uncut commercials from around the world at your own pace. This truly is an experience not just a brewery \u2013 massive gift shop at the end as well. I have been through the Guinness tour in Dublin and I think this is more interactive. Don\u2019t miss it."

The gift shop at the end of the tour, I must say, improved greatly!!! Please allow yourself a good hour and a half to two hours for the tour. They have a fast-food restaurant at the top, which should be amazing, since the view is great from there! As a tip I would say: buy your tickets online, they are cheaper. Enjoy!"

Bit disappointed with a couple of things; the shire horses are in the yard but you are blocked by a glass wall which is a shame as I think being able to pet them would be nice, I guess there may be safety issues?! And also as part of the admission fee you are entitled to a souvenir glass...you have to go what felt like halfway across the city to claim it in another gift store!

There is a bit if line shuffling, as other reviewers have suggested, but such is the case with most popular attractions of this type. It really is an \"experience\". We bought our tickets at the Tours & Tickets office which gave us a worthwhile discount and a free key ring each. The experience includes videos, a cute little simulation ride and a look at the beer making equipment as well as a guided tasting. Afterwards you can enjoy 2 free beers - or learn to pour your own, in a funky little pub setting. You may also redeem a token on your wristband for a free gift - a Heineken souvenir glass - at the brand store which is a 15 minute walk from the brewery or you can take the complimentary boat shuttle. Allow 2 hours for the experience."

They also have a stables with horses but due to the volume of people you don't get to seem them very well , which is understandable . You have an opportunity to sit on a bike and have a fun photo taken , you go into a large room with large screen tv's and the Celling is made up of thousands of green beer bottles , and a large wall of bottles also floor to Celling - time for a few more beers , this is where you had in your tokens of the armband , after that you can go into the Gift shop , which is well stocked but expensive , you can give in a token to collect a miniature Heineken beer glass ... Across the road is the canal boat in which you go on a short trip around part of the city which lasts 25 minutes , this is included in the price of your tour , the whole experience should not be missed and is well worth the price \u20ac18"

Playstations with FIFA loaded on because Heineken once sponsored the World Cup, a 007 room because Heineken once sponsored Bond and a room where you can watch all the Heineken adverts on a constant loop. That's as well as the 'get your family's photo on a t-shirt' room and the 'star in a music video' room. They definitely ran out of things to justify the 16 Euros each! Don't even get me started on the '4D' rooms where they pretend you're being brewed. Go, if its raining and you've done Amsterdam's real attractions. The price is irrelevant really because of the free Heineken at the end! If you want something a bit more authentically Amsterdam though, the mile-long open air market about 3 minutes away from the Heineken Experience is ace. And free."

The bar we came in to was smelling worse than a bar at 3:00, just with a much more sticky floor. Here we learned how to enjoy a Heineken, I would need a much longer class than that to make this happen.After 30 minutes of more cues and lines watching more expo stand material we got to the second bar, where we were suppose to get two beers each. By this time we were so tired from walking in a slow line for 2 hours, also the line to the bar was crazy long. The bar was smelly, to hot, music was way to loud, and the floor was sticky. We decided to pass on the beer, and get the h... out of there. The only thing Heineken makes that is worse than the beer is this attraction.

Even if you read every blip of information and watch the short videos, the tour still seems extremely short for the amount of money spent. Before you get you small beers you have the option of a \"brewing simulation\". This was kind of lame and delays you getting your beer. Just as a heads up, they spray water numerous times on you. So if you do not want to get shot with water, do not go on this \"ride\". You spend more time trying to leave the brewery than you do actually learning about it. During this time they bombard you with Heineken commercials and extra items you can purchase. Such as putting your name on a bottle, taking a picture on a bike, etc."

So the tour is 17 Euros per person and it more than pays for itself based on the beer you receive and the souvenir glass you get. The tour kicks off with a walk throughout history of Heineken. It is very cool to understand the evolution and how true Heineken has remained true to its roots and beginnings. You are then taken to a room where a guide discusses how the beer is made and what makes it unique. You're then taste the base ingredients of the beer (fairly yucky) and see facilities similar to where the beer is stored. Then you go through a ride where you become the beer (cute touch) and finally arrive to the tasting. My big takeaway was how to correctly drink a beer and let me tell you, it makes a difference! I thought the tastings were going to be chinsy but that was not the case at all - they were very generous. Plus you can earn more beers by answering questions correct - very fun! We had a great time, drank great beer, and walked away with a new found appreciation for Heineken. Definitely worth doing."

Whilst taking you through the tradition of brewing, the history of the brand, Heineken has also added very modern entertainment ideas to the experience. Like you can click pictures or create a video of yourself and email it your friends. There is a DJ console game, PS3 stands and AVs of theirs commercials. Ofcourse they had beer tasting. Overall, we did have a good time."

I have been on several brewery tours (mostly microbrews) so it was cool to finally go to one of the big multinational breweries.The museum was interesting and had a lot of interactive exhibits along with museum style wall placards to read. I learned a lot about how beer was made and I was pleasantly surprised to learn about the great work culture that Heineken seems to promote.After visiting the museum and brewing sections of museum, they have the interactive zone that allows you to take a picture in front of a green screen to put on a shirt. My girlfriend and I did this and were happy with the quality of the picture and the shirt. There is also an interactive ride where you, the audience, are put through the brewing process. It's about a 5 minute video that you watch while standing up on a platform that vibrates with the corresponding actions on the screen. The conclusion of the tour is everybody's favorite I suspect. You get two tokens for Heineken beer. You can choose from two smaller glasses of Heineken beer or a slightly larger glass of a beer from a frosted glass. Even though you get less of a volume of beer for choosing the frosted glass variety, an ice cold beer really does hit the spot. Cheers and enjoy your trip here. Thanks Heineken for making it a great experience!"

You can take videos and photos and of course you get to try the beer ;) One on the way round and then 2 at the end of the tour where there is also a DJ so you can stay as long as you want! **look out for people who do not drink and are not using the tokens on their wristbands if you are lucky you can nab yourself an extra couple pints :-)** The staff are very friendly with great English & I would definitely recommend going here one of the most fun parts of our trip! - Book tickets through the tours/guides shops much cheaper - pick up leaflets as they have discounts in them :-)"

We spent more than 4 hours inside this old Brewery, which is now renovated and converted to Heineken Museum. Here they take us through the history of Heineken, introduce to us the science of Beer making, old brewing equipment\u2019s, also give us the opportunity to taste raw materials of beer. There is an excellent 4D ride of beer manufacturing, and at the end they will give us free vouchers to get beers. The vouchers are small buttons in a Heineken wrist band, three buttons /visitor. Two buttons can be used for getting beer from the counter and the third button is for a free Heineken beer glass, which has to be collected from their outlet approximately 2 Kilometers from this Museum. The staff at outlet informed that only less than 30% of visitors take the trouble to search and find the outlet and claim the Beer glass."

However,the building once was their brewery and some of the equipment is left. Lots of hype for Heineken, some silly games and mildly annoying \"ride\" but let's face it, the reason most people go is for the tasting room. So figure, 15 euro for 2 heinekens and gift glass. Its probably cheaper to drink at a bar."

The queue took me a little by surprise, since I was there on a weekday evening, but it moved fast enough. I was also a bit bummed that my battery was running low even as I got there but there is a socket in the entrance-way corridor so I charged up enough to embark on the experience and make use of the free wi-fi - which was the best thing about the entire evening.Within the first ten minutes I was clear in my mind that every company should do something like this. The tour is non-guided, which makes it less boring and allows you to speed up when you get to the bits you couldn't care about or to dilly dally over the ones that interest you.There comes a point where things are too awesome - like the video game section and the photography and video areas - but eventually you get to the part where there are a few free beers.If you're into beer quite much, string along a couple of non-drinking pals and take their coupons so you down more than the two free glasses that come with your 18 Euro ticket ;-)Just remember that immediately after the free beer you have to go through a souvenir shop that is somewhat more convincing in those circumstances..."

            "review": "An experience we won't forget in a hurry.. We visited the Heineken Experience on our Valentines trip to Amsterdam. We actually wanted to go to the Rembrandt gallery, but got talked into purchasing a bulk ticket deal from a seemingly sweet but deceiving old man at the tourist information office. The deal was free tickets to the Rembrandt gallery and the \"Bodyworks exhibition\", which was equally as disturbing but that's a whole other story. The catch was you had to go to the Heineken experience to pick up the tickets for the gallery. So off we went. Arriving at the Heineken experience we discovered to our dismay a half an hour long queue which we suffered in the cold, thoughts of the Rembrandt tickets forcing us to stay in line. Eventually arriving at the ticket office at 5:05pm, we were informed the \"deal\" of the Rembrandt gallery finished at 5:00pm. Thank you Mr sweet but devious ticket man for informing us about that. So we thought \"Well we're here now, may aswell do this. At least there is free beer.\". After queuing for another 10 minutes among sweaty shuffling tourists passing by small amounts of information about the founders of Heineken and a few black and white pictures of beer paraphernalia, we arrived in the first area of this shameless, interactive, and pricey Heineken advert.The strong woft of what smelled like dirty farm animals was very pungent in this large hall filled with old beer drums. We were already pretty cynical and giggly by this poin, and couldn't see any beer so we decided to quickly walk through the section, where we discovered the source of the manure like smell.Even though the factory was disused for many years (if I recall correctly), that didn't stop the hosts of Heineken keeping 7 or 8 horses in little boxes, for tourists to gawk at, while perfuming half the \"experience\" with the sweet smell of country air. Apparently they were used for the beer at one point, although I bet the original horses didn't spend their entire time in solitary confinement like these poor things did.Next up, more queueing for us. For around 30 minutes we were promised by the staff we got to watch a movie about (surprise, surprise) Heineken! They were constantly assuring us we'd been there in 5-10 minutes. But like Steve McQueen in The Great Escape, we spotted a blind spot! We did a runner from our guards and managed to slip past the film into the next section.Beer! Finally some alcohol to numb our minds of this torture. We squeezed into a bar where a member of staff was talking about Heineken. I raised the glass to my lips, ready to taste the sweet nectar of this product that had been rammed in our faces for the last hour when we were told we musn't drink it until the talk was over. We abandoned the beer and left to the next section; a maze of different rooms about Heineken. It would have been easier to find your way out of Donald Trumps hair if you were a head louse. Eventually, after passing Heineken logo number 32,984, we arrived in what must be described as the climax of our experience..We found ourselves in a Heineken hell hole in the form of a grotty night club. This is where we discovered our wristbands had detachable buttons we could exchange for Heineken. So after waiting at the bar and exchanging our buttons for 2 very small, and very tasteless beers each, we headed to the dancefloor. This was captained by some wannabe DJ who was jumping up and down as he skillfully stopped one chart song and played another.So we decided to leave this place, as well as our beers (which by this point we had vowed never to drink again). We came into a gift shop that sold Heineken and Heineken accessories. We quickly exited the building almost crying with happiness and sadness that this violation of our intelligence had just happened, and never looked back.So in summary, if you would like to spend a few hours of your life in a building that smells like horse crap and looks like one big Heineken advert, and get to pay a ridiculous amount of money for the privilege, you will REALLY enjoy this experience. If not, stay well away, as getting high as a kite then throwing yourself in one of the freezing cold canals would probably be a more enjoyable way to spend your time."

As most others have mentioned, the Heineken experience is kind of like paying to be brainwashed only with tiny glasses of free beer. It wasn't too busy on a late September afternoon, but I'd still recommend getting your tickets in advance online. We visited just after the Rijksmuseum and so had had enough with history and legged it round to the bar, where you can exchange two tokens for two halves (?) of Heineken. You also get a tiny glass after going through the 'bottling experience', where you're told how to properly drink a pint. The final bar area was nicely done out, but let down by music that was too loud, a distinct lack of seating and a floor that was reluctant to let go of your feet. It's a good place to go if you want to say you've visited a museum, but would rather have spent the time drinking."

The museum itself...the first part is about how the beer is made, the different stages, the history of the company and the family that own it. The remainder is mostly interactive fluff, maybe slightly enjoyable at the beginning, but after a few I just wanted my free pint!! You can queue forever to pour your own pint or if you don't particularly care who pours your drink move on and go to the bar where they are just lined up and waiting for you! Maybe if you're an avid beer drinker you would have an interest in this experience, I really like gin - but I don't give one hoot about the process of making it :) I wouldn't bother with this to be honest."

It was a little crowded so if I went again I would recommend going early in the morning when they first open. The staff would worked here were very helpful and knowledgable about Heineken and it's history. It was a very interactive place, kept my attention the whole time. You also get 2 drinks and a free gift at the end. I also would recommend taking the Heineken River Boat Cruise offered at the end of your tour. It was a lovely way to end the tour, they leave from the Heineken Experience and you travel up the Amstel. Would def go again and would recommend to others to go when visiting Amsterdam."

The best bit is your free gift is all the way on the other side of town even though there is a gift shop right there? Unbelievable. Not worth the money so only go if you've got a few hours to kill."

I would recommend eating before going this side of the city though as we found it difficult to find somewhere to have early lunch and ended up eating in a mediocre restaurant located to the rear of the brewery.We had a great day and there are lots of different activities and things to see throughout the experience. We got some lovely photos as well and thoroughly enjoyed the fresh lager (and I'm not usually a lager drinker).Once we had finished the experience we were given a token for a free gift from the gift shop (which is fairly out of the way) and were disappointed to find that we could only get a small bottle opener. I actually kept my token as I thought it was nicer on my wristband than the bottle opener!Walking back to the city from the brewery was a pretty walk.I would recommend if you are staying in the city for 3 or more days as there are lots of other lovely things to do and see in Amsterdam."

I'd gone alone and still enjoyed it. It will be great if you go with a group of friends. They give you a band which entitles you to two glasses of beer and a free gift which can be redeemed at the brand store. You get to know all about the tradition and craft of brewing and also about the Heineken history. The Brew Me ride was fun. There is a stable walk where you can see the stables of the Shire horses which still deliver beer in the city.Instead of taking your two glasses of beer, you have an option of pouring your own draft and get a certificate for it and the glass of beer that you poured. The certificate was a perfect souvenir to take back. You need to return the empty glass though. I bought the ticket from my hotel, so I paid \u20ac 16. The regular rate is \u20ac18. Go in the afternoon or around 4pm. It took me about 2hrs to do the whole thing, including enjoying my glass of beer and watching the different advisement that they play in a kind of lounge. All in all a good experience if you have the extra time in Amsterdam after all that museum trips."

You learn about Heineken and Dutch beer (The Netherlands [Holland] is the 2nd largest beer exporting country in the world). The tour is done in a very light-hearted manner, and you get exposed to a lot of different aspects of Heineken, from the secret yeast, to the commitment to quality, to the support of science, and a glimpse into the generations of family dedicated to brewing beer.The folks you meet along the way know their subjects, whether it is brewing beer, pouring beer, or drinking beer. They can explain it and answer any questions (in any of several languages). They all also seem to be having fun doing it.At the end, you get a souvenir glass, but not there! You need to go to the souvenir shop a few kilometers away to get it, so... you get a short canal tour on the Heineken canal boat to the shop where you can stay, or take the boat back.There are so many things that are must see in Amsterdam that choosing is not easy, and few of us have the time to stay long enough to see them all. If you like beer (I do) than this is not one that you will regret taking the time to do.For contrast, it is also fun to visit a very small local brewery T'ij, located next to a windmill a couple of kilometers East of Centraal.Heineken is a Pilsner style Lager and T'ij (pronounced te eye) is mostly small-batch Belgian style ales. They are very different and they are both fun."

There is also quite a lot to do with Football given they sponsor the UEFA Champions League.You do get various samples along the way as well as your 2 free drinks at the end and your free gift, which, as anticipated was a small, bit nice Heineken glass which you can have engraved for a few euros if you choose."

I think you need under 18 to enjoy this even though alcohol is involved.You spend about 10 mins+ in a personal TV module looking at historical TV ads! (Wow, great, I got to watch adverts)... Very poor tour of the brewery itself with a pastiche of a stables where old horses are kept. Stinks like a pet shop with added manure.Queues, queues and more queues for everything. Your given a token when you go in for a \"free\" (yeah right) beer at the end. If you're prepared to queue even further, you may eventually get served after a multitude of adolescents.Almost entertaining thunderbirds type marionation representation of the current CEO and the way he met his wife. Expensive waste of time. Too many other good attractions in Amsterdam to waste time on this one.The main irritation is that you don't actually get to see the brewery, just the old bits which are no longer operational.You've been warned."

Came with wife on Sunday afternoon during eurotripWe got tickets from the tour and tickets tourist offices around town at a discounted rate of \u20ac13 ( think normally it's \u20ac16 or \u20ac18). The Heineken experience museum was a pretty fun adventure. The ticket you buy grants you the rights to tour the factory, get 2 drinks (or one ice cold drink), and a free gift ( a Heineken glass cup).  It's mostly a walking tour, where you get to walk through rooms of how Heineken started, how it expended, and how it became a global beer distributed/producer. Throughout the exhibits, there are a bunch of site seeing exhibits and a bunch of interactive ones as well ( where you get to play through interactive full body games, virtually dj, and ride on a Heineken ride). You also get a free drink after riding the Heineken ride. After walking and playing through a series of rooms and sections in the factory, they have a bar area that let's you learn how to pour and exchange your two green beer tokens for drinks. Afterwards you enter the gift shop and back to the front entrance (where you can exchange your third white token for a free gift - being the glass cup)They also had a free canal boat shuttle running every hour that ferries you to their branded store in another part of Amsterdam. All in all, for the discounted amount of \u20ac13, the whole experience was pleasant and fun."

However, I am so glad my friends and I decided to take the time to visit this place. As a business student and a fan of the global brand I found the tour through the brewery and the history of Heineken very interesting. The drinks you get included in the tour were very cold and fresh too which only added to the experience. There was also free boat trip waiting for us when we came out which then took us to the Heineken shop. This place is definitely worth a visit!"

Before my boyfriend and I arrived in Amsterdam we were told that the we should avoid the Heineken Experience as it was overpriced, etc. However that person couldn't have been so wrong! We pre-booked our tickets before we arrived in the city and I'm so glad we did! We went around afternoon time and didn't have to wait in a queue at all. The full experience was really interesting as you walked around and discovered how the beer is brewed, then you get a free 1/4 pint to taste and they actually teach you how to drink the beer which was funny. You also get given a silicone wristband that has two token you can use for free beers at the end of the tour, it is only 1/4 pints though so don't expect loads! It is meant to be 1 token for a beer or 2 tokens to pour your own beer and get a certificate for doing so, although when my boyfriend and I poured the beers the man doing it was hardly taking any tokens and was letting people keep them for the bar in the other room and even at the bar they would give you like 2 beers and only take one token, so really you got a lot for your money (if you were pleasant enough to the staff of course, they don't like rude people)!I would definitely recommend this experience to ANYONE who visits the city it is so interesting and a good laugh!"

The Heineken Experience is no longer the brewery we visited back in 1983, but a museum celebration of the brand, history, brewing process, culture and advertising, similar to, but not quite as grand as Dublin's Guinness Storehouse. You are schooled into a proper drinking, and you can spend your 2 beer tokens to pour your own with a certificate or on 2 small beers or one large extra cold. If you hang out in the pouring classroom you might be able to score a couple of extra free beers as other people's pouring \"mistakes\" are offered to anyone around. After the tasting lesson take time to linger in the advertising lounge with sound surround as the commercials are like mini movies and surprisingly entertaining. We went for the extra Euros for the hamburger on the rooftop, which was well worth it - a loaded burger, small group, another beer, and great views. We should have planned ahead to time for the shuttle canal boat to the brand store for our free glasses. Missed it by a few minutes and walked. Even with the simplified map, we had to stop and ask for directions. The Experience is open late so you may wish to see something else earlier in the day. All in all, the experience seemed a bit pricey, but the Dutch have a saying that if you can jump over the horse, you can jump over its tail, so go for the burger, too."

Then we got to pour our own Heineken which was again lots of fun and we even received a certificate!We still had two tokens left for more drinks, and they that's the whole purpose of visiting the Heineken Experience right?

The factory is very large and really feels like an actual factory, smells a lot like beer ingredients and even has stables full of horses which apparently are a big part of the brand's history. The part where you go in the little interactive amphetheater with the vibrating stands and the special effects is just great. Also there is a very nice cinema room where you can chill and watch heineken commercials on loop. Then ofcourse the bar where you can drink quite a lot of heineken with your ticket! What a great way to spend a day in Amsterdam."

            "review": "Not Cheap, But An Enjoyable and Interesting Experience. The entry fee was 18EUR in August 2014 when my brother and I visited the Heineken Experience, which includes a token for a free gift and 2 tokens redeemable at the end of the experience for a couple of beers or a novelty \"Brewer's Licence\" event and certificate.The experience itself is a self guided linear tour, with videos and various displays documenting Heineken's establishment as a leading beer producer and going into some depth about the brewing process. The displays and multimedia are all of a high quality and it was certainly an interesting tour - I especially liked the huge copper containers used for storing grain and brewing, which had been incorporated into the building.After having a look at the working horses, which used to pull wagons loaded with kegs of beer to local drinking establishments but these days seem to be used for promotional purposes only, we reached an area where we had to queue for 10 or 15 minutes - it wasn't at all explained, so we didn't really know what was going to happen and definitely could have used some additional signage! As a British person, queuing with people from all over the world is always an eye opener though, so at least that kept my brother and I entertained in the meantime.Once we got to the end of the queue, it turned out we were going to \"Be the Beer\", standing on some kind of hydraulic platform and then subjected to a \"4D\" show, where we were guided through the beer making process from brewing to bottling, whilst bubbles were pumped into the room, water was sprayed about (mostly onto the poor chap on the row in front of us!) and heat lamps cooked us a bit. Certainly not what we were expecting, but probably more enjoyable and amusing for it.After that, we got to drink a small beer (no tokens required!) and were told about how it should be poured and drank, as well as being offered the opportunity to ask the helpful staff members any questions.Following that, a raft of Heineken advertising gimmicks and strange optional multimedia activities were thrown at us as we descended the building again at our own leisure. Whilst some of the things on show were quite cool (one room had massive glass bottle ceiling, with some of the more amusing Heineken adverts on huge screens and plenty of seats to stretch tired legs!), others were a bit more tacky (posing with the world cup superimposed on a screen for photo opportunities) - but to each their own. It did feel a little like the brand was being shoved down our throats, but I guess that's part and parcel with a branded experience like this.Finally, we got to the point where the drinking tokens could be redeemed for either 2x25cl Heinekens, 1x35cl Heineken Extra Cold or 1x25cl Heineken and a quick tutorial on how to pour properly with a \"Brewer's Licence\" certificate. We obviously opted for the 2x25cl beer option to get our money's worth!The only thing left after that was to be spat out into the obligatory branded gift store, which we quickly escaped from before making our exit from the building and heading back towards our hostel.The free gift offered could only be redeemed at another Heineken store a 15 minute walk away, there was also a boat ride that would take you there, but it wasn't clear that this was included in the cost of the ticket so we ended up walking... but gave up when we couldn't spot it anywhere. Given that the free gift is just a Heineken branded key lanyard, it wasn't the end of the world.I'd certainly recommend giving the Heineken Experience a go, the staff were friendly and helpful at all times and most of the displays were very informative and quite interesting. Some of what was on offer felt a little pointless and the free gift should have been available on site in my opinion. The ticket also felt a little pricey for what it got you - but hey, that's just how tourist attractions go!"

When we went the queue to get in and buy ticket was not so long, then going through the first part of the tour where you hear the history of the company and see some bits of the brew house is okay. But then you have to queue for ages to go into some silly interactive movie thing which is basically for 2 year olds. Then 5 minutes of beer tasting (one beer), which is okay. Then you get to go and get your free two beers which again okay but the bar area was really dirty and the floor and tables really sticky from old spilt beer, really bad. Do not waste your hard earned cash here, just go to a bar instead and rnjoy the city. Carlsberg tour in Copenhagen is way better. Every other beer tour we've done is better, way better."

Huge tanks show how the beer is made through the stages right through to how it is delivered to the customers. You get to try a couple of small beers and the guides tell you how it is brewed and why there is always a huge head on the beer which I never knew about. You can have your pictures taken on bicycles on a green back screen, play FIFA football, table football, be a Dj, learn to pour a beer and then finally receive your two free drinks at the end in the night club!!!

As soon as you walk in you can easily purchase tickets. Which was 18 euro each for adults and free for children under 18. With that price, the adults got a bracelet with little tabs for 2 free beers and a free souvenir which was a cute little Heineken beer glass. The kids got a bracelet with 2 tabs for 2 free sodas or water. There is also a counter to leave your coats, bags, strollers etc. free of charge which is nice! There are several floors to the walk thru, keeping in mind this is the location of the original Heineken Brewery. The whole exhibit is very interactive with videos and different memorabilia displayed throughout. They have the horses there with the Heineken delivery carriages to see. Although they are no longer used they still keep them as a tribute to their tradition. There is a neat little ride type video adventure where they show you how they make the beer with you being the beer, it was fun! There is also an area where you can record your own Heineken music videos and pics and email them yourself and everyone else! That was really funny!!There is also a dance room where you can be a DJ or play a interactive game.  There is the brewery room to see in person the process of making the beer and also taste the hops, barley etc. Its all so interactive and educational! You get to see a beer making assembly machine where you can actually pay 6 euro for you own personalized Heineken Beer Bottle. We did because we thought it was a unique, cheap souvenir. You also get to taste a Heineken beer in a tasting area where they actually give you a lesson on the beer and how to properly drink it for best taste. At the end you are in the fun bar area to get your free beers and sodas. There is also a gift shop as well. Our kids ages: 1, 4, & 11 had so much fun! I also have to say how kid friendly this place is and how amazing the staff is that works here. They were so great to try to include the kids and make it fun for them!"

However, the creativity perhaps goes too far at times as some display boards giving more detailed information about the brewing process would have helped. The second part of the experience is rather random yet also fun. The virtual 'ride' through the brewery was very novel, and other displays were interesting, yet I also had a feeling that the experience was basically a large queue for the 'free' drinks at the end.

It only was an advertisement for Heineken that you end up paying many euros to get loaded with many different forms of advertisements for Heineken. I have been to the Guiness Brewery in Ireland and Jack Daniels in Lynchburg. They were working facilities and interesting. Heineken was just an expensive tour from one ad to another. Then they gave you a glass of beer at the end of the walk through. A major disappointment."

I might be a suspect since I work in advertising and love beer (even though I wasn't a Heineker drinker before that), but I must tell you it's a very interesting break in a touring day in Amsterdam. The first part of the visit is an interactive walk-through a Heineken \"factory\" (even though beer isn't produced there anymore, the actual factory is a few km away), where you'll see the history of the Heineken family and how they created the business, as you walk through rooms decorated as pubs, factories and labs. You even get to proof beer and learn a thing or two about how you should drink it, serve it and enjoy it. The second part is a whole immersive experience in all Heineken marketing campaigns and brand assets, all connected to the internet, videos and social networks, and there you can be a part of all Heineken has ever made about soccer, the tv campaigns (the candidate, the visit, the party), and so on. Really interesting. Then there's a bar where you'll get some beer and a big shop with all things Heineken."

It is not guided and certainly isn't a tour. The only human interaction is being told how to drink Heineken beer before being directed into another room that just shows you their recent TV advertisements.There is very little about making beer in the tour and even less to do with a working brewery. Throughout the tour you are constantly reminded about how great Heineken is and how it is the \"best beer in the world\". I suspect Heineken have something to hide as their was almost no detail on how this bland mass-produced beer is really manufactured and I can only assume that this is accepted within Holland through loyalty towards a Dutch brand and as a large employer to the Netherlands.Save your 18 Euros."

Purchased wristband tickets for \u20ac18 (two drink tokens and a free gift) We got to learn a lot about the history of Heineken, how their company came to be, and the brewing process of their beer. I enjoyed seeing their original brewery facility and all the beautiful copper stills and the stables. Halfway though the tour we learned how to properly taste a beer and why the head on top of the beer is so important. Then got to play around in a interactive area where we took a free via email Heineken Experience photo. At the end of the tour we were given two options: two token for a large \"extra cold\" beer or two tokens for cold slightly smaller glasses. I forget the exact ounce sizes per glass but I know you get more beer for the two smaller ones. For our free gift you have to go to their flagship store which is a walk 15 min (or wait for their shuttle boat...runs once an hour if u can catch it) I thought it would be faster for us to walk, wrong choice...I had a hard time navigating because there are Heineken signs at every pub which made it a bit difficult to find and it took me twice as long as it should have. Once there we were greeted by friendly staff and given our complimentary Heineken glass. Overall I think it's a good value and would recommend to a friend."

You get to know the history of the Heineken Beer and how it was started by the family of the same name and how the recipe is kept a secret even upto now. You will see the brewing process from begining to the end and it was great fun combined with interaction and you can even try your hand in pouring the beer properly. If you passed the test you even get a certificate. There are two glasses of beer at the end of the tour added to the one you get during halfway of the tour. It is great fun and crowded just like a normal pub in England but quite relaxing with live entertainment to amuse you whilst having the drink. There is a souvenir of a beer glass and you get a free canal ride to the other side of the city where the souvenir shop is. So it was a free round trip of a boat ride which was a bonus and well worth the money.Tip:: If you have a Amsterdam Card you get a discount on the entrance fee."

The first part of the tour is one big commercial for Heineken, extolling the virtues of the Heineken family. Then there is a section on the beer making process which isn't all that exciting. Next a virtual reality \"lite\" experience ride where you stand in a small auditorium and they show a film where you are the beer being brewed, all the while the ground beneath you shakes a little to simulate different parts of the brewing or bottling process and you get sprayed with a little water. The last part were all types of interactive stations which, if you were under 25, would be fun (simulated beer pouring, making a music video, etc.). There are much more interesting things to do in Amsterdam."

You start out with a short introduction then you can get your pictures taken at their photo wall with wall props for effect.

That was truly the place to visit when going to so and so' Unfortunately on every occasion you come out dazed and confused from all the history, the technical information, all the really 'cool' ways they advertised over the years, lots of stuff about who they sponsor, but at the end of the day, to me it just shows what suckers we are.Heineken has cornered the lager market for decades and through hard sale brainwashing and advertising that makes alcohol look witty, handsome and cool, when it is just a lager like every other lager in the world.This museum is testimony to the way they have flooded the market for years, I have also been to such like 'museums' in other parts of the world, and they are exactly the same, just a different brand name.There is a whole lot more to the beautiful city of Amsterdam than just the red light district, the 'coffee' shops, the sex shops, stag nights, Heineken brewery, sex museum, sleaziness etc, unfortunately very few people go beyond these things. Please do, you will have a truly great experience in probably the greatest city on earth!Talk to the locals, they all speak English, they'll tell you where to go, and it won't be where you think, and you'll have a great time, trust me.

You can pick up discount vouchers on maps etc whilst your out and about which knocks about a euro off the price per person. We paid 16 euro per person . You get 2 free beers whilst your going round which is good although it's less than half a pint. It was interesting and the brewing kettles were huge and worth seeing it was also good to see how thing have change through time. Your also supposed to get a free gift but it's a fifteen minute walk away from the museum and it's just a free small beer tasting glass so we didn't bother. The gift shop was brilliant at the end. It's definitely worth a look around"

The end is obviously a highlight with a wristband token you get a couple of small glasses of beer to enjoy - watch out for people passing straight through you can ask for their token and get another free round..Unfortunately the rest if the tour is a way of trying to make extra money from you by selling T-shirts, personalised beer bottles etc and trying to make sure you never forget the brand! Everywhere it's an advert, TV adverts on screens, comfy recliner chairs to sit and watch the adverts, a big screen cinema style room - to watch their ads, even when you get a beer at the end your surround by advert screens. It's a shame I feel a nun ranked experience would be better rather than trying to force it on to you but other than that a good experience."

The multimedia narration of their history, experiencing their beer making process, the interactive displays and screens, merchandise store make this a fun experience even without factoring in the beer tasting and beer drinking (2 pints) at the end. I recommend trading in the two free glasses of beer to get to properly pouring the perfect glass of Heineken which yields a nice little certificate. You are really only trading in one of the glasses because you get to drink the glass you just poured as part of this process. Watching the continuous loop of Heineken ads from all over in one of the rooms after the tasting is very entertaining."

Heineken in Amsterdam is completely different than any Heineken you'd find in the U.S. The beers you get after the tour are some of the freshest in the city, which is almost worth the price of admission. The museum is nicely done. It's big and some parts cater more to sports fans, kids, etc. I loved all of the photo booths where you can have the photo emailed to yourself. My husband and I also enjoyed the \"perfect pour\" challenge (I won, for the record). And the tasting bar is nicely done with a DJ, lights, etc. Just a fun time.I think the best part is the boat from the museum to the brand store.

Friends went later in the day and the lines were out the door. The tour is 18 Euro, which is steep. You do get to sample the beer for \"free\" and there are some fun exhibits. You would be much better off just going to one of the hundreds of local establishments. They serve Heineken pretty much everywhere! The tour includes a \"free\" commemorative glass, but good luck trying to find the museum shop on the other side of town. it took us about an hour of wandering around before we happened to stumble across it. They give you a map, but it is very hard to follow. The glasses are cute, but for 18E we could have bought a case of beer and a set of glasses! There are better ways to spend your time and money in amsterdam."

I've already been to the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin, Ireland and the Coors Brewery tour in Golden, Colorado, so I wasn't too keen on attending yet another brewery tour. But my bf hadn't ever been on one, so we decided to check out the Heineken Experience together.Getting e-tickets online in advance saved us a couple of euros, so that was nice. When we arrived and showed the guy our printed tickets, he gave us one of those rubber wristbands with 3 little discs attached to it. Two of the discs were good for a free beer tasting during the tour, and the 3rd one was for a free gift... but the gift shop was somewhere far away not on the premises, so we didn't bother getting it.I'm glad I've been on other factory tours prior to this one, because I think the exhibits here weren't as nice. They tried to build in a lot of interactive elements with cranks to turn and buttons to push... but there were so many mechanical failures that like half the stuff wasn't working properly. Thank goodness I've already smelled hops before and have had a general education on how beer is brewed. :PWhat I did like though, was the beer tasting lesson in the middle of the tour. We each got a small glass to look at for bubbles underneath the surface (indicates freshness), and we learned that the best way to get the full flavor is to take big swigs... not itty bitty sips. My bf was so impressed that he kept talking about the proper way to drink a beer to all his friends for the next 3 months. :OThere was also a little kiosk for you to film a video message and send it via email, so my mother became the proud recipient of a cheesy video from me saying \"Hi, mom!!\" in a squeaky voice. LOL.I also hopped on to a fake DJ booth display and pretended to be a DJ. No idea how convincing I looked, but it was fun to mess around a bit. Photo op!!The area where we got the free beer at the end was set up like a cool bar, with tables and a live DJ spinning tunes. So awesome and hip! Their marketing gurus really did a good job in making them look super cool. You could try to tap your own beer, but since I'm already a Guinness Storehouse certified \"perfect pint pourer\" ;), I didn't bother to wait in line and instead went to the area where it was already pulled for you. You could get two regular beers, or exchange both tokens for one extra-cold, slightly larger glass of Heine. I got the 2 regulars, while my bf got the extra-cold. I tried a bit of his beer--and although you could notice the difference in temperature--mine was just fine, too. Besides, 2 is better than 1, eh? I'm not normally a beer-drinker, but I must say that the beer was refreshing and delicious! So all-in-all, it was a fun afternoon with a happy ending. :)"

Everybody was walking through in single file and then we came to a queue. We had no idea what we were queueing for but were told we had to wait 30 minutes. They take you into a little room and you go through the bottleing process. After this you are taken to a bar where you get a free half pint and are told about how to drink it. That's where the beer part ends.The rest is all about football really. I understand it's called \"experience\" but I thought it was a beer experience. There was football tables and playstations and then lots of parts where you can customize a t-shirt or beer bottle (just looking for more of your money). You then get to the bar where you hand over a wristband and get 2 free half pints. The bar was packed.To get your free souvenir you have to go to the brand store. They offer a free boat shuffle to the store. We were in a hurry so personally didn't do this we walked instead. The store was quiet and of course after all that beer you're no doubt going to need a toilet! There was a toilet in the store but it was closed. Not worth the money. Like someone else said, just google the facts and buy a pint in a bar. There was also a free cloakroom service which was great as we had hand luggage. Probably best for a stag party or boys holiday."

It is just brilliant how Heineken has created an experience with the brand for the public at large (drinkers and non drinkers).Right from the history to the process of beer brewing, to advertising and marketing, experience zones around music, film and sport, there is something for everybody. You need a good 1.5 to 2 hrs to go through the complete experience. And it's definitely worth the time. My favourites were the Music and DJing experience, The James Bond movie game and most of all getting myself certified by Heineken as an official pourer (they even give you a certificate for that).

If you don't have time to do it on line. Look inside souvenir shops near the Heineken Old Brewery because some of them sell tickets to make you save 2 Euros. It is 18 Euros at the door. It is opened every from 11 am. We were there at 11:15 am and I was surprised to see how many people were already doing the tour this early.The tour was very long and you get to see and do so many different things. (see many old Heineken posters, the old Brewery tanks, the \"being\" the beer experience, you can also bottle your own personalized Heineken, the first tasting, some games, play with a machine to see if you are a good beer pourer, you also get the chance to pour your first own beer as a bartender, before you walk outside there is another bar so you can get your second free beer and a huge souvenir shop).Very important! When walking outside of the Heineken Experience, there is someone at the door that will be asking you if you want to do a boat tour on board the Heineken Boat. Say yes! It is included in the price of the Heineken Experience Ticket. A small boat tour that takes you to the Heineken shop. That is where you'll get your free souvenir Heineken glass. The whole tour is in English!All of this for 18 Euros. If you want, you can have a lot of fun doing this brewery tour. A 18 Euros well spent! I'm glad we did it! It starts pretty well that day!!!

After the historical part, you get to the brew-making process. Compared to other breweries, I felt this was fairly weak. There are meant to be some hands-on stations set up with employees doing demonstrations for people, but the employees were not involved at all \u2013 definitely not doing their jobs, so that made that part of the tour weaker than it could be. After learning about the brew-making process, you go through a series of rooms where you can make a bunch of personalized Heineken products. They are all darkly lit with loud music \u2013 it feels a little bit like a night club. Finally, at the end, you get two beers at the bar, which is also dark with loud music.

We got our tickets from an excursion shop just outside of the main shopping area near the Red Light District and got it in advance which qualified us for a discount price of 16 euros. I was initially sure about wanting to do this however as the rest of the group was I went along. When you arrive you start with a tour of how it all started, with voice overs in English and things written on the wall in English and Dutch, you then move onto looking at the actual machines of how the whole brewing process takes place. It\u2019s brilliant as you get to take pictures in an apron and can actually mix the yeast process. You then go into a 4D room and it takes you on a small experience of how the whole process happens again, but this time it\u2019s more practical and so more interesting. You then get to taste the beer and taught how to drink it best. The tour then takes you to another practical section where you get to make your own slogan by posing in front of a screen and also make a small video for a beer commercial. These are all additional should you wish to purchase it, however they give you the option to take your own photos and email the video to your email address. Alternatively you can have them printed on a glass or t-shirt at an additional cost. You also get the opportunity to brew your own beer and if you pass the test you receive a certificate and also get two small beers as a compliment included in the price. Once the inside tour is finished you can go on a free complimentary boat ride in the canel where you get dropped off near the merchandise shop to pick up your free gift which is a small beer glass. All this for 16 euros is absolutely phenomenal, it\u2019s a good laugh, get free drinks and really good experience. Definitely worth every cent. "

What was once an intimate, guided tour has been replaced by large crowds, very long lines (on the tour itself) and very little interaction with the guides. It is more of a self guided tour than anything else. They let WAY too many people inside, and on the limited occasions someone tried to explain things to us, someone in the crowd was always talking so loud it was very hard to hear.

The activities along the way were fun, and we were able to email the videos and pictures to have for future enjoyment.

You will also see how it is made (but this you can also do at a tour at a micro-brewery). Besides that you will come in some nicely decorated and interactive rooms which challenge your senses.

If you go in there happy, relaxed and with the idea to have fun for an hour or two; then the time will fly, you will see some nice things and in the end you will stand outside, happy and be amazed that the time flew by.Extra: if you like this: also check out the Bols-experience (the maker of the liquors like Curacao, dutch-Gin (Jenever) and the famous-in-the-US: Bols Vodka); also fun!"

We were rushed through the museum since we went 2 hours before closing and the boat trip was booked 30 minutes before it was meant to leave. The free gift isn't at the gift shop attached to the museum, but a \"15 minute\" walk (which ended up being 30 minutes for us). The museum itself was great for photo spots (just don't get stuck behind a large tour group). The free beer was nice but 2 small glasses of beer doesn't equate to 16 euros :( If you have lots of time in Amsterdam or are a die hard Heineken fan, the Heineken Experience could be for you. Otherwise, there are much better local pubs where you can people watch and enjoy a refreshing beer."

Mostly it was just a heineken advertising stint. You walk through the brewery quickly and then spend the next hour in sensationalist, flashy rooms with heineken logos everywhere. An example of this is walking through a room where playstation consoles are set up so you can play fifa. Nothing to do with beer brewing at all. I expected a bit of this but it was ridiculous here. That being said, there was a neat ride simulater where you followed along the process of beer brewing but thats the only interesting part really."

Well, hurring up a little bit ment that we constantly had to run from one room to the next one, with a cute blond girl constantly coming after us and telling us to go faster. And faster. And then even faster. In most of the rooms we couldn't even read all the informaton, as we were being constantly kicked out. And the included beers are just way to small to call them a beers.

Really way overpriced. 18 Euros...= approx. 24.00 US!Basically the whole thing cost us 8 bucks /beer :(It is pretty much set up as an \"experience\" vs a brewery tour, which was super disappointing for us. Mostly for young males/females under the age of 30, would really enjoy this. Lots of fun computer games and such, but very little info about the beer. We waited in huge lines for the Heineken Experience, was stuffed into \"holding pens\" like cattle, and head to butt on stairways and escalator .....and you just walk about on your own. It was nice to take your own time at each station. The highlight for us was seeing the draft horses, wagons, and stalls. At the end you are \"rewarded\" with some Heinie and some very, very overpriced souvenirs, if you have any money left. The tasting rooms WAS EVEN MORE CROWDED on both sides and was set up like a club. Fun, but too many people to enjoy. The live DJ was playing some pretty good music.recommendations: I wouldn't go. With all the time we wasted in lines, pushing to get beers, ect, it would have been better spent in the local small town pubs, which frequent through out Amsterdam. Don't waste your time, there is so much more to see in Amsterdam than this!"

OK, I exaggerate a little, you get 150ml about half way around and two glasses at the end (though as we went as a group in the evening the bar and shop were closed by the time the tour ended). If you are familiar with the idea that beer is made from four ingredients, then you're not going to learn much. If you have a TV, play station and camera, then you're covered for most of the other exhibits (re runs of adverts, sponsored events and walls made out of bottles). All in all, a bit underwhelming. In probably comparing it to distillery tours I've done where the guides are knowledgeable and the products interesting and worthy of discussion, and this was just a pretty cool old building with some old equipment and silly exhibits where (spoiler alert) they reveal there is no art - just the same scientific chemical brew the world over.

My only recommendation is that you purchase your ticket online or at your hotel. It's likely a few euros less and you get to skip the long lines outside. Once inside, if you have a smart phone, you can connect to their wifi and download the Heineken Experience app. This prevents you from spending an additional 2 euros on a headset. All entrants receive a wrist band which allows you to get two free beers and a free gift (a nice-sized Heineken glass). Note that the free gift is NOT from the experience itself; it must be collected from the Heineken store on Rembrandt Square. The history of the beer is very interesting, you get to go on a simulated ride where you 'become the beer' and actually get hands on experience mixing brew and smelling hops/barley. You also get to sample the beer (a full glass) towards the end of the tour. Once you complete the tour, you go to this party scene where there is loud music and bars were you can use your wristband to get 2 more free beers. As the Experience a bit out of the way of the city centre, there is a shuttle Heineken boat that takes the Experience guests to Rembrandt Square (by way of canal) every hour for free! The canal tour lasts about 15-20 minutes and is beautiful. Beer is served on the canal ride (at a cost)."

We weren't alone in feeling that way, as another couple found the music overpowering. There is also the offer of a free glass but you have to take a boat trip to their shop some distance away or make your own way there to get it. It felt like they were trying to keep you within their control with the offer of having fun on the boat to get your free gift. That wasn't mentioned when we bought the tickets to go there, so we felt that was a bit of a con just for a free glass."

We decided to visit on a whim as we were booking a canal tour and were offered the canal tour for 12 euro cheaper overall if we booked another tour/museum etc So we thought as we had some time spare why not? So we decided on the heineken tour for a laugh. We paid around 16 euros each (pretty expensive but what the hell we're on holiday) We got inside and were given some wristbands for some free beer and gift (the gift being a bottle opener a 10minute walk away we didnt do it)So we walked around standard museum to start with and when we got to the end we thought it was over ? We felt ripped off but then realised there is more to this place. There is several places you can interact with computers and other items including taking your picture in different areas. All pretty basic but still a bit of fun! Then you are shown how to taste a beer again just a bit of fun. There is an interactive ride into how heineken is made and then shortly after there are several areas to wander around before you get to the bar. Now here you can have some beer if you have the wristband or if you like you can pour your own beer and get a certificate! I went for the latter just as it seemed it could be a bit of fun and a memorable moment.Overall i enjoyed my tour and would recomend it to anyone going to amsterdam!"

The self guided tour is easy to navigate and crammed with excellent displays, tasting, and activities.Overall, the price was more than reasonable, the staff were exceptional and the visit was more than worth it.

It is now a display center with nothing functioning except the high tech displays. Long lines to enter can be avoided by purchasing tickets on line or through your hotel before you go. We are in our 70's now and in the minority. This experience is geared for young people with loud noise, videos everywhere and has no functioning processes that concern beer making on the premise. It was interesting to see and compare the differences from my initial visit. It, in spite of my observations, a very popular place for the youngsters. Have fun and drive carefully."

This is is when I thought 'oh this will be the same old story you get in these sorts of places'.There was a museum feel to the place with some information sheets, artefacts and pictures establishing the history of the company.You could explore every part of the process and even got to see the stables and real horses that would have pulled the beer when off to trade in the carts.The walk around then got split up into meeting staff of the experience who shared knowledge about the beer. We got to touch, taste and try different elements of the beer at different points of the tour and it became a much more hands on experience. There was even a simulator ride which was really clever!I chose to use my 2 tokens on a 'pour your own' experience which is very memorable and great fun. Otherwise, you can spend your tokens on 2 Heineken drinks and sit in the bar listening to a live female singer. Completely up to you!Overall, a really fun couple of hours and I'm amazed how much I've learnt about beer!"

It's a little more informational now then it was in the past. You have quite a few photo ops and video ops. Don't miss these because they are free! You can record your videos on your cameras and even email them to yourself and others for free. You get a little lesson on tasting and a taste. Skip the round room that shows commercials, nothing happens here. Don't bother pouring your own beer but go straight to the regular bar and collect your beers. One of the cool things in the gift shop is the chance to engrave any glass product in their shop for for an extra \u20ac3. The last thing is the free canal cruise to the center of town to get your souvenir glass. It's a nice tour of the canals included in the price. Don't walk. If you like Heineken don't miss this!"

A little boring, I don't really care about the founder, or how significant the \"A yeast\" is. really the beer isn't all that good anyway. It's the Budweiser of the Netherlands.Then it went bad quickly. It turns into a Disney style experience. Wait in line to be herded into a \"motion ride\" that was pretty lame. A guy shows you how to properly pour and drink a beer, OK I liked that part. Sit in an oval room and watch their TV commercials, really why would anyone sit through that? Then into a series of money generating stations. Have your name printed on a bottle for \u20ac6, take a picture or video in front of a green screen, for \u20ac8, each. All in a nightclub style atmosphere. Not for me.All this leads up to your 2 free beers. Seems they make it intentionally difficult to collect the free beer. Everyone lines up in front of a bar. At the bar an employee had each person come behind the bar and pour their own beer, teaching the correct technique. If it's not right, dump it out and try again. So it was taking a few minutes for each person. We were about 40 people back in the line. I went up to see why the line was moving so slowly. After I saw the ridiculous process I bailed out. I don't want their free mediocre beer that badly. The 20-somethings in our group stayed, took them about an hour get get their beer.You are also entitle to a \"free\" gift, the catch is that you have to go to a different location to get it. There is a boat, but a long wait to get on it. The kids walked there (20 mins) away to collect a mini beer glass with the Heineken logo on it. So glad I bailed and didn't waste any more time there.The 'kids' liked it a little better than I did, but all in our group of 6, except one, thought it was a rip off. I hated it."

I definitely enjoyed seeing the bottling process and understanding how it all worked. Being from the states, the beer definitely had bolder, crisper, taste to it which I thoroughly enjoyed. They give you a Heineken band and a couple cold ones on the house with the tour. Don't forget to stop by the picture and video booths and enter your email, it was cool to receive them in our email when we got back.

They make a nice show - especially i liked the \"become a beer\" show - they somehow simulate that you are the beer that is going through several processes. They do this with beamer, water, heating and moveable ground (like force feedback) In addition they also have nice souvenirs there. I took one bottle of beer with me with an original Heineken label and my full name on it. Very nice! :)The staff is also very friendly and in addition you can of course also drink 2 glasses of Heineken beer plus a small glass for tasting.The only thing they could improve is that they provide a personal guide.Worth a visit!!"

We booked this in a package through tours and trips in Amsterdam and this was possibly one of better ones. The brewery is easily accessed by taking tram 24 which stops directly outside the brewery. On arrival we were met by a tour guide who gave us a wrist band which entitled us to two free beers and a redeemable tag to collect a free gift at the end of the tour. They then took us through the brewery while being free to look at each process of the brewing as we went. We were then brought into a little cinema room where we viewed a short virtual movie before setting out to make and bottle our own beer wit personalised label. Along the way there were many interactive games to play and went tour finished we proceeded to the bar where our vouchers were exchanged for two beers each After browsing through the merchandise store we were then escorted across the road where the heineken barge picked us up and brought us on a half hour cruise of the canals around the city and they dropped us off at the heineken brand store just off Rembrandt square where we collected our free gift (a glass). The canal boat then took us back to the brewery again but we did not have to return If we choose not to. All in all it was fantastic value at approx 13 euro when booked in the package the tour and canal trip was definitely brilliant value for money. The whole experience lasted about 2.5 hours"

The 4D brewing experience is not to be missed and is the highlight of the tour. There are sufficient markers along the tour to inform where the free gift is available and wht time is the last boat ride.

All included in the entry price of euro 18 you pay. I paid 15 after discount card of euro 3 I picked from my hotel. Do carry the discount card available at all hotels to avail the euro 3 discount. Further the experience include the fully guided Canal Cruise in Boat, which drops you to the central place in amsterdam near heineken store to pick your free gift. So you don't need to spend on canal cruise as well. The free gift they gave me was a beautiful beer glass though earlier they used to give a beautifully designed bottle opener. This entire experience is more than the value for money your paid. Kids are not allowed in this experience as the name suggest it's about beer and not the Teddy Bear.

The tour is 18 euro (add half again for dollars) per person but you can look online for websites with prepaid discounts of 2 euro). This is what we did and got the combo brewery and canal boat tour. It does take around 3 hours depending on how much time you take in the brewery building. This is a self paced tour so you can go as slowly or quickly through the building as you like. You also get to sample two small glasses of draft Heineken and if you take the canal tour which is across the street with a timed ticket, they drop you off at their shop and you get a new small glass to take home. The boat tour is about half and hour and there is bottled beer for sale onboard for 2.50 euro. Heineken is very popular here and the tour gets packed so get here when they open at 11 a.m."

Spoiler - all beer is brewed the same way.Although in this case they don't even brew beer there anymore.There's hardly any interactivity. In fact the only interactivity is when you do the beer tasting.Otherwise, you learn a brief history of the company, then see medals the company has one. Then you see the old copper stills, which aren't used anymore. There are some horses, but you can't get close to them. After those you go on their motion platform ride where you go \"inside\" of the brewing process, which is ok. You then taste some Heineken with a guy who explains how to taste their beer. After tasting the beer, the rest of the tour is walking around looking at old Heineken adverts and sponsorships they've done over the years. You also get either 50cl of regular Heineken, or 35cl of Heineken Extra Cold. This free bar is drunk is a strange overly loud, club type setting. Very odd. You also get a token which you can trade in for a 'small gift' at the \"Heineken Brand Store\" which is about a 15 minute walk away (a bit further than the Flower Market). I was bored throughout.I'd never go again. I'd never suggest a friend went. In fact, I'd discourage it.The Guinness tour is much better"

The tour includes the history of the brewery, the process of making their beer, and many fun effects & various interactive activities. Our group of 4 teenagers & 2 adults all loved it! Be aware that under 18's will NOT be served beer though - apparently the law changed in Amsterdam this Jan."

This ride was standing on a board, holding on to a railing watching a video while being splashed with water. We waited 25 mins in a queue for it. Seriously, it was terrible.Throughout you are bombarded with advertising and there are some subconcious adverts too, such as showing you the brand, giving you a beer and playing positive \"feel good\" music at the end. You will queue a lot for attractions that are not that interesting and recieve tons of advertising forced at you. Plus you pay for the experience. We never got our free beer at the end as the queue was about 10-15 mins long to recieve it."

The Heineken Experience in my opinion is overpriced, I managed to get a voucher to get 2 euros off but at 18 euros full price it's not fantastic value; granted there are two small beers included in the price but all the interactive things did not float my boat. In my opinion the whole place is gimmicky, tacky and touristy. It is simply massive self promotion - that is why it's a huge company and a brand name the world knows - but it is not something to write home about. Many people will find it fun, but there's so many other things in Amsterdam which will be a memory for life."

(40+).You see the giant grain silos,copper brewing vessels and the horses used to deliver the beer,not sure if they still do or are just for show !After that you're taken on a virtual 4D ride where \"you\" are brewed,a bit cheesy but quite good fun and from then on it's basically a giant Heineken advert ! not really complaining but it's very much aimed at younger visitors,there's a room where you can show off your DJ'ing skills,play Champions league football on the Playstation and plenty of displays where you can make videos and take pictures to send to friends,you can even try your luck at pulling the perfect beer ! Finally you get your 2 free beers and it really does taste better than the Heineken you get here (UK),it's definitely stronger !Of course you exit through the gift shop where there is all manner of Heineken branded merchandise to part you with your euros !On leaving you are given a token to exchange at the Heineken brand shop near Rembrandt square for a free gift,we didn't take the free shuttle boat but instead found it on foot the following day.All in all the Heineken Experience is well worth sending a couple of hours on !"

We bought the tickets online as they were cheaper (\u20ac16), as you get there they have a cloak room so you can just leave all your staff there, they will give you a wrist band with 2 tokens you can exchange for a drink in the end. All the employees we met were just amazing,so friendly and helpful. It is not a place to get drunk as other mentioned, it is an amazing experience were you find out about the history of heineken,check out old bottles and logo's and just really understand the brand more. There some amazing spaces were you can spend time playing games or taking silly photos. They will give you a little beer in the tasting room and explain the big mystery why dutch people leave the foam on the beer. In the end you exchange the token from the wrist band for drinks. Upon exiting the gift shop a member of staff approached us asking if we would be interested in a free boat trip+gifts. She has given us free tickets for the 15 mins boat tour, which departed across the street and it took us to the heineken shop were we exchanged a white token for a free Heineken little glass. It was a very nice touch and ending to the experience. Really if you are in Amsterdam it's a must and worth every penny."

The museum is interesting to walk around and it's great to see the big brewing tanks, you can almost imagine what the factory was like when it was in full use.About halfway through the tour, you are shown how to pour the perfect beer and given a glass of Heineken. After this point, the tour becomes a little more comercial and a lot of the things on show are just Heineken branded products and sports products which became a little boring.However, you are then taken on a boat ride down to the Heineken store where you are given another beer and have the opportunity to buy a bottle on the boat which is a nice touch.We would definitely recommend the Heineken experience as a good afternoon out in Amsterdam and a must see, even for a long weekend trip to the city."

You learn not just about the history of Heineken and the sheer success it has enjoyed, but also about the brewing process involved while walking around a very beautifully preserved brewery, complete with a stable of Shire horses.

We are a family of four (2 adults and 2 children) and paid \u20ac36 for our entry into the Heineken Experience, which included 2 drinks each (beer/soda for the adults, soda for the kids). The first half of the self-guided tour was similar to a museum explaining the history of the Heineken company and the process of making beer. Audio guides are also available or an app was available for download. There were hands on stations - smelling and/or tasting the barley, the hops, the mash. All of the old production copper tanks were open for viewing and some had videos running in them to simulate how the vat was used. The draft horses also live there part of the year and we were able to see them, and learn a little bit about their history. The tour includes a 4-D ride of the beer making process which was hilarious and we wish we could have ridden it twice. After the ride, we were shown how to taste beer (which included another glass of beer in addition to the 2 included in our ticket price). After the ride, the museum turns more into a marketing display using videos, games, and interactive displays. You can also learn how to pour a draught of beer. Finally, we end up in a pub like atmosphere for our drinks with interactive video screen tables to learn more about Heineken around the world. There was free bag and coat check as well as wheelchair access."

Be sure to ponder all the historical information. Didn't realise how much went into the beer making process, clearly the secret 'A' yeast creates the unique flavour. The museum is a must, even for non Heineken drinkers."

I was pretty high when I arrived and the guy at the counter definitely knew and we were just laughing at each other and I was already having a great time before even entering the experience! The staff was super cool and they all seemed to enjoy their jobs more than any other place I went to in Amsterdam. For 17 euros you get the experience along with a little 8oz beer with a story to go with it, then two beers at the end, plus everything else in between. The guy at the desk was a bro and gave me another token which made the experience even better. I was unaware of the canal ride at the end, but this alone made the experience even more worth it! The ride was slightly after the sun had set so it was a beautiful time to cruise through the city. The guide on the canal ride was a super cute Netherlands girl and I was able to have a great chat with her on the return ride when no one else was on it. She described how the staff changed roles a lot, so this kept them engaged and invested into their job, which I thought enhanced the overall experience knowing and seeing the staff care about what they do. I will probably never drink Heineken again, for it will never be as good as it was in the factory, but oh well... A decision you'll have to make for yourself.."

You can also personalize a bottle of beer for six euros, or use their green screens to share a commercial with friends for ten euros. But really it's all just one big advertisement that you pay them for. Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? If you want to see commercials, go to a sports bar, drink cheap beer and watch tv.

Pay for your ticket (actually expensive I thought) at the counter when you walk in and get a bracelet to wear with charms on it. One green charm = free drink (you get two of them) and one white charm = free gift (later found out it was a cruise through the canal that we didnt take) It is self guided, with radios that transmit in 30 different languages. Everything is in English. Coat/bag chek if you want to. There is a lounge for hanging out with a drink, all lit up in green. Oppotunity to sit on a couch and watch commercials for Heineken. Social media kiosks throughout to tweet and facebook pics of yourself or to email. Stops along the way to taste, smell barley and hops. Look into the giant copper bins used to make the substances. Plus a tour through the stables to see the Shires (not to be confused with Budwesier's Clydesdales). Another piece of history scattered throughout.

Went to the heineken experience to kill a few hrs in Amsterdam and found it a bit of a mixed bag...the history part of it was somewhat slow if I'm being honest...found myself trudging through the building bored...Things picked up during the interactive ride which was fun...they also do a tasting session where you get taught how a proper glass of Dutch heineken is drunk - actually better than it sounds!!!Best part was the free samples at the end...your allowed several attempts to pull a glass of heineken and the staff member hermann was not only informative and helpful but also wasn't shy about handing out the beers everyone had pulled...Overall it's not perfect but for between 16-18 euro it's a fun way to spend an afternoon in Amsterdam...Recommended!!!"

The atmosphere is a lot more upbeat, friendly, and fun compared to other brewery tours. You get 2-3 free beers, along with the experience, is worth the price! You also get a free bottle opener, but you can only get it from the other Heineken brand store which is not near the actual factory. The store within this building is quite small, but there are still a lot of cool items to purchase.Your hotel will probably have a better discount than the one the Heineken website offers online. If not, then definitely pre-order your ticket for a discount. Free Coat Room!"

I mean its kinda boring with the details first when you go through it but its fun when you get inside a room as you are the beer and there is sound/moving effects. You get to see how to drink a beer and you get to taste it thats one glass. Then you get two free glass to drink and thats the best thing in it. Another thing is you can play ps3 Fifa or PES. The thing thats was ehhh is that you get a free gift but you have to walk to the Brand Store which is 15 min walk away and its a bottle opener :/ I mean come on heineken. I think for the whole thing to be worth it just if they reduce the price from 17 to 10 Euro."

We loved that we click photos with every cutouts it was fun. We learned a lot about the history, brewing the different process it goes thru and The \"Brew You\" ride was really cool.

Backpackers) decided to check it out. Turned out it was really fun and interesting. We learned a lot about the history, brewing, and their current marketing. Both of us left saying 'I had no idea Heineken was so cool!'. Both of us are interested in marketing, so we were intrigued by a lot of the information about marketing efforts throughout the years. If you will be offended by seeing a commercial or two during your tour you'll be put off by that. I was especially interested in their sustainability. As a skeptic I was seriously impressed by the whole tour overall."

We visited this place without any research and thought it was going to be just another brewery telling you how beer is made mixed in with a little bit of history, and a lot of drinking. We also didn't know it was going to cost \u20ac16 per person which we thought was very expensive for a sight. But after the whole experience, I gotta say it's ALL WORTH IT!!!.If you take your time going through all the rooms, you could easily spend an hour or two in the building. There's just so much to see and do. I particularly enjoyed the interactive brewing room. Visit the Heineken Experience website to see all the different parts of the building.The entrance fee includes 2 free beers (Heineken of course), a short canal cruise that takes you to the Heineken Store via the grand canal where you'll pick up a free bottle opener. The canal cruise has a guide that tells you a bit about the sights along the way. Save yourself a few euros and take this cruise first."

The shop was great with loads of different nick-nacks for you to look through and you can also buy your very own personalised bottle of Heineken.The whole site is actually really big, so do put at least half a day aside to look around, but you could easily spend longer there.And to finish your visit of in the perfect way you're given a token for a free glass of Heineken ... well ... what else!"

You get to see a lot of the old bottles, marketing posters, etc. along with brewing equipment. You also see the horses and the cart. You can stir the hops, taste the wort, and you get some real beer at the end (along with a lesson on how to properly drink a beer). There are also games (pouring the perfect beer, etc) and various rooms in which their are chill out spaces and commercials/ad campaigns running. We had a lot of fun there and would definitely recommend the tour to family and friends."

I've visited a few breweries including beer and whiskey and this is up their with the best!Really enjoyed the tour - it is guided to a certain extent but you also have free will to wander around various attractions and take your time. A few glasses of Heineken are included in the price and you get to enjoy these at the end of the tour in the bar.I really enjoyed the interaction section at the end and also watching the past Heineken adverts. The gift shop is also a good find - we made many purchases in here and I could recommend this as a source of good souvenirs to bring back to friends.A tip before going - we managed to book online and received a discount on the entry price! Thoroughly recommend the tour - you won't be disappointed!"

(or you can just let the bar tender fill it for you. you get two instead of one for this)the brandstore wasn't located at the same place and was some distance away. there was apparently a shuttle boat bring people there but the frequency was so low we just didn't bother going even though we could redeem a free gift there. you could walk there i suppose, but don't bother if you're in a rush.tickets are a little pricey, but you can get a small discount if you buy them in your hostels (if they sell it that is)"

The Heineken Experience that we had so much looked forward to turned out to be not much more than a 90 minute commercial - for which we paid 18 euros per person.\u00a0It starts off with a detailed description of four generations of the Heineken family, with repeated reminders of how ethical, clever, and dedicated the whole bunch was. I think we got it the first time. They were/are real pistols, every one of them.We were then herded into another room to see the components of the beer in its various stages of manufacture and ended up in a cheesy virtual reality \"experience\" simulating being immersed in a gigantic vat of beer. (Disney has nothing to worry about.)Mercifully, the tour ends in a bar where each participant gets two beer. The management guarantees you won't stay too long savouring what you really came for, as the disco music is cranked up to Mach 3. Also, and of growing concern to the amateur tippler, there wasn't a bathroom in sight.The theme of the whole tour is the \"excellent quality\" of Heineken beer, which is certainly a given. (Why would you go on a tour if you thought it was slop?) However, they never stopped reminding everybody of that every few minutes. We figured that we paid about 25 cents for every time we heard the word \"quality\" in the presentation.Of all the tours our group took in Amsterdam, this was the only one in which it was more of a relief to end the tour than to begin. Obviously overpriced, the non-stop songs of praise about the family and the quality of the beer became overwhelmingly annoying."

You then get to see the ingredients which go in to the beer and taste various ingredients. Then you go through the old brewing rooms. This was all really informative. There is also an interactive ride demonstrating how the beer is made (you get wet!) after this you get to have a couple of free drinks and are taught the best way to drink the beer.

The family and company was way ahead of it's time in terms of supporting its staff in hard times and the humanitarian issues it has contributed. I actually did have a better appreciation for the Heineken label. I guess all their marketing worked but I did learn a lot about beer making that day.

Though a little outside the main city area, I would definitely recommend attending. Buying tickets at the door costs about 24 euros, and you have to wait in line. Not sure about buying online, but we bought ours through Sandeman's Walking Tours and it cost 17 euros and no waiting in line. With our ticket, we got 2 beers (either 2 half pints or 1 half pint that you get to practice pouring yourself) and a gift that turned out to be a bottle opener.This is a very cool attraction because of how engaging and interactive it is. There are a lot of cool things to do through the tour and Heineken has come up with some cool ways to teach the history of the beer to visitors, like a 4-D movie experience. There are DJ games, make your own music video stations, a stop to customize your own beer label, and more. We were here for about 2 hours, but if you take your time to experience everything the Experience has to offer you can easily spend longer. You get a chance to have a \"tasting\" lesson and at the end of the tour you can choose to enter one of two rooms - a lounge where you can claim your 2 half pint Heineken beers, or a room where you wait in line and can practice pouring the perfect half pint (you only get to drink 1, but I liked the experience of getting to pour it myself). The gift that came with our ticket could only be picked up at the Heineken brand store, which was a little annoying but fortunately it was on our walk home.Definitely worth checking out if you're in Amsterdam, and try to buy online or through Sandeman's to get a discount!"

I think I would have liked the beer more as a young person, but because of the higher cost in Canada, I have never actually tasted it before this tour. Since I prefer micro-breweries, I wasn't thrilled with the beer (it's quite weak, and only one flavour was offered to us). However, the tour itself is really worth a visit. For 18 Euro each (yes, I think this is quite expensive too for something that is free or a minimal cost in Canada, however the tour offers much more), my husband and I received quite the education in the beer-making process. As well, there was a lot of technology applied to one's appreciation of the beer. There were films and interactive displays which helped to keep people moving from station to station, as well as kept the fun atmosphere going. At the end of the tour, you go into a bar area which resembled some sort of disco complete with the coloured lights and everything. Most impressive to me was the staff throughout the place. They are a good group who really enhanced the experience."

To this end, a visit to the Heineken Experience (the beer with the smiley 'es') seems like a great combination - visitor attraction combined with partial inebriation!I went as part of a cultural outing with a group of discerning fellows to celebrate my forthcoming union with my other half. This attraction fitted in beautifully with the ethos - and my best man's partner, who made the arrangements, was highly amused to realise he had indeed managed to organise a piss up in a brewery!The attraction itself borrowed heavily from telling the story of the development and global success of Heineken through interactive and high tech gimmickry - best of which was an amusement park style cinema room complete with hydraulic platform that took and shook it's guests on a journey to 'be brewed' into a bottle of beer. There were rooms packed with giant, highly polished olde worlde copper brewing tanks (or kettles / vats...?). A passing view of stabled horses, games galore - including Dutch karaoke, a DJ challenge - a video bar surrounded by screens with glass topped tables providing magically appearing virtual beer mats wherever you placed your complimentary glasses of beer, which then span off to reveal a dizzying array of maps, location shots paired with the surrounding screens - one minute Holland, the next New York, Rio etc. A print your own label exhibit which delivers to you your own customised Heineken bottle - and several interactive screen games that would email whatever your achievement, message or design was to yourself - or whoever. Also naturally, it was interspersed with the usual museumesque paraphernalia of original equipment, adverts through the ages and more - a heady mix of new and old. And as part of the entrance price - you get beer. Two glasses of beer. Great fun - we spent 3 hours bouncing through everything they had to offer.Why only four stars? Unfortunately for all the glitz, glamour and gimmick - they were unable to solve one particularly outstanding issue - however proud they are of its commercial and global success - Heineken is just not the world's greatest beer! Apart from that - no complaints!Andrew"

It is by no means a \"must-do,\" but it is a very well done exhibit with a ton of stuff to see and do. Bonus: a couple of beers are included with admission. The tour can be done at your own pace, choosing to see/read as much or as little as you want. Movies, presentations, and signs guide you through the history of the Heineken family and the beer making process. There are also several interactive stations where you can make a commercial, take your photo, learn to pour the perfect Heineken, and take quizzes. The tour includes a ride, which is more like a movie with a moving platform, but hang on; they'd never allow this in the states without a seatbelt!My favorite part of the experience was sampling beer straight from the factory; very fresh. The tour ticket includes two tokens. Each token is good for one beer. If you would like to pour your own beer with professional direction, that costs two tokens. Two tokens also buys a Heineken Extra Cold, which appears to come in a larger glass as well (the extra cold tap was broken so we got two regulars). There are two bar areas at the end of the tour to get beer, and both were packed with people chatting and enjoying a drink together.My only real complaint is what it requires to get access to the rooftop; the purchase of a hamburger and beer for 8,50 Euro. I would have liked the rooftop view of the city, but we had just eaten and weren't going to buy burgers just to hit the roof.Travel Tip: Tickets are 18 Euro each, but if you buy them online they are only 16 Euro. You don't have to buy for a specific day or time, just show up with your ticket printed or with the image on your phone and you avoid the line for tickets and get right in."

It is a touristic \"exhibition\", created for tourists and merely and barely tourists. When you get in you are introduced to the history of Heineken with its founders who are portraided as heroes who saved Holland with the beer. After the introduction they bring you into a room where you are shown a video and there are some special effects and it's like you are the beer being pulled in the bottle. After that there is an interesting part: the process of producing bear, with a clear explanation of the ingredients, the process itself: that was the only interesting part. For the rest you are introduced to a variety of games such as \"be the dj of a heineken night\", tap your own beer etc. Another interesting part it's when you can watch all the commercials of heineken from the beginning until nowadays. I truly believe it's all a marketing strategy to make you drink a lot of beer and to make you believe Heineken is the best beer you can have in Amsterdam. Someone should write a dissertation on the marketing strategies in the HEINEKEN EXPERIENCE.. My suggestion: if someone gives you the tickets for free go, otherwise it's no worth spending euros just to see how good the Heineken beer tastes.

Heineken has tried their very best to add as many different features to their experience as possible and have embraced technology to help them achieve this. Yes it's just a huge advert, yes the price is a little steep but if you don't expect too much and accept it for what it sets out to be you should have fun. Loved the 4d ride and the James Bond mystery. The tasting session was well delivered and made fun. The room with the drinks at the end was a lot livelier than we expected and a good laugh. We visited at the end of the day when it was a little quieter, a good tip to follow."

A guy telling a story, some old beer tanks, some free beers at the end, some rooms where you can take pictures, old bottles, mostly nothing fun. Maybe if I would have arrived earlier, the one place where they included the tourists into doing something was closed. Don't expect much, but that doesn't mean you wont have a few small laughs. The souvenir store is great and expensive and the souvenir you get for free when you visit, you take from elsewhere (i bet many give it up). I expected so much more from this popular place."

Then the interactive part starts, which has some neat things to do. However, regarding the beer at the end of the tour, there is hardy any place to sit and drink your brew. I guess they don't want you to linger, but it is exhausting to have to stand for so long after doing the tour. Also, it would have been nice(as they do on other brewery tours) to have you have the option to taste many different types of Heineken's beers( I know someone who works for this company and he says they are always working on new products). Heineken could actually profit from this endeavor, as they could have the tourists \"rate' their beers and get an analysis, for free, of what the public prefers. Also, the price for this attraction is way too high."

Many breweries in the States run free tours so the cost of the tour seems a little much at first - but when you are already spending $5 on a glass of water, this doesn't seem like much of a stretch. The tour is fun, there is an app that helps guide you through things (if you want - otherwise not required), the old equipment is cool and in great shape, and there are plenty of reasonably well done videos that shed a little light on the Heineken history. Midway through, there is a Q&A session at a bar and if you quickly answer the questions, the bartender hands you another free beer. At the end, there is a bar and lounge area where you can cash in your beer tolkens for either two \"standard\" Heinekens or one \"extra cold\" version (go with the \"standard\" as they are nearly identical). Also, if you stop at any of the tourist stands that have fliers for the Heineken Exp, the price can be reduced to 15-16 Euro - so really you are looking at 7-8 Euro beers and a cool 90 minutes. Not bad at all."

At the end of the tour there is a shop, which is also a bit pricey, also a free canal boat tour to the shop in trhe centre (beers are 3 euros on the canal boat). All in all, considering this is a promotional deal, I think that the prices in the shop at least should be susidized to some extent (you can get t shirts etc at cheaper prices online).

If you had bought the I Amsterdam pass then the ticket to this brewery is discounted, which is kind of worth it because you get a lot of reviewers complaining about the steep ticket price. If you have one day in Amdam like what I had then don't miss this! They close late on weekends and we got in at 6.30pm for the unguided tour-they have very limited English guided tour, and who cares because by time you are done you're probably tipsy with all the free beer they give you. After you're done touring they group you and bring you in this room where this guide explains how the beer should be drank.Here are some TIPS:If you don't see bubbles rising to the top, then the beer is stale. If your beer is bitter then you're probably drinking it wrong. The correct way, well at least according to Heineken is to take a LARGE GULPS of beer, because the beer is smooth but the FOAM is the one that's bitter. If you drink your beer like you do your wine then it's going to be bitter. Also, you should raise your glass towards your lips, not you bending towards your drink. Your posture should be straight and the beer glass is the one bending to your mouthWhat I didn't like about this tour was that THE FREE GIFT was not collectible here but instead in a gift shop 3 blocks away so they try to RIP YOU OFF for the BEERS they let you.Make sure you don't throw away the rubber bracelet they give you when you buy the tickets, it has 2 buttons that's exchangeable for beer and soda (for underage kids) and a white button exchangeable for a gift at their gift shop which is 3 blocks away from the breweryThey have this room where you can take pictures with fancy beer backgrounds, print your face on a t-shirt, a small bar for you to enjoy the free beers (only exchangeable with the buttons attached to the bracelet) and purchase Heinekeen memorabilia at the gift shop after you exit the tour.The highlight of the tour is having a custom make beer bottle with your names on it, for 6 Euros"

You can also get free tickets to take a canal cruise to collect your free gift. I felt as if the younger patrons enjoyed this more.

Nice touches: experience how it feels to be a beer bottle, and for instance, the giant horses that are still kept in the stable to occasionally pull the antique horse drawn beer distribution carriages on show days.When in Amsterdam, the day will come you have seen enough art, enough historic buildings and war memoria, enough red light district etc and then it is time to have some uncomplicated fun here.

If you don't like Heineken you will still appreciate the tour.I have been on many brewery tours and this was one of the best CISCO brewery on Nantucket is high on the list too. I don't even really like Heineken in the first place.So when you buy your tickets you get a rubber bracelet with three golf marker type things in it. Two are for a free beers and one is for a free gift that you can't get at the brewery but have to walk to get ( I didnt bother).The tour is self guided has plenty to see and really gets you pumped up to drink some beer. The tour incorporates a cool ride where you are treated like actual beer in the brewing process, you walk by actual stables with horses, learn about history of Heineken, grains, yeast, etcAt the end you find yourself in a cool bar area where you can get your free beer. If you turn in both of your markers at once your get bigger super icy beer. In the gift shop you can get various items engraved. We got several glasses but you can get bottles, etc.I would highly recommend this experience if you have time in Amsterdam. The House of Bols tour was also great."

The end of the tour was a bar and you either got 2 regular heineken beers, 2 pepsi soda's, or 1 extra cold heineken beer.If you want to take the boat ride to the gift shop to pick up your free souviner be sure to get your ticket just before you depart the bldg, they only have a certain # of boat rides per hr. we decided to wlak there later in the evenig and picked up our gift no problem.All in all very fun and easy to folloe tour!

However, if you are staying in the center of town, you could coordinate it to see things on this end of town (Van Gogh, Vondel Park etc), then take the ferry back after the Heineken Experience, to avoid the long walk or tram ride back."

Admittedly, the beginning of this tour didn't do much to excite us.. a lot of history and factual information about making beer and the history of the brand..not too exciting to be honest. However after the first part of the tour is over it gets better and better!! There is SO much to see and do here, you can go at your own pace and spend as much time as you want taking photos or making a video or being a DJ! There are a lot of hands on activities, from crushing barley to tasting wort and smelling hops. After all this is done you get the chance to \"brew yourself\" in which you follow the beer production from start to finish. Such a good idea and it's really well done and most of all, a lot of fun! After this you learn about tasting beer, the colour, what the bubbles are for and what the foam does, a lot of genuinely interesting information. And you get a free half beer \"to sample\". At the end of the tour there are 2 free beers and a free gift for everyone, the atmosphere in the bar at the end is good, everyone enjoys it and i'm sure most would recommend going! We did Heineken and House of Bols, and honestly, if you're only doing one, Heineken wins hands down!"

Good interactive experience. the instructor took special efforts to know from which part of the world had the vistors come & explained the components of beer in detail. Liked the horse a lot, they were really well maintained & groomed. The area with UV lights. bottles & games were nice. 4 D experience is not really worth the wait in the queue. Couple of beers at the end of the tour helped, it could have been nice if some titbits could have been made available (may be for a price).Certainly worth the price, especially if you book online (you could save some time by skipping the queue at the entrance)Also bought a nice looking beach bag at the branded store."

Although the two heinekin beers you get at the bar is really nice ...we spent around 1 1/2 hours walking around steadily and then another 3/4 of an hour in the bar but this is really stretching it out a bit..at the end of the tour you can choose either a free gift or aboat ride..

I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. Apart from a few extra lights and a bit of painting it wasn't that different from before. Also there seemed to be a lot more queing going on. This may have been down to the time of year I went. Went early December previously now went in mid-June. I was disapointed not to be able to see the dray horses close up. They never seem to say what time you can see them. One tip I'd give is use one of the discount vouchers. I used one from the GVB travel map that gives lots of discounts in it and got \u20ac3 off the admission price. You do get 3 Heinekens included in the admission and can also get a free gift but this is given out at a different location about 15 minutes walk away. I would say this is a good attraction if you are under 30 but probably not for anyone older. Just sample your Heineken in one of the nearny bars that abound in the area."

Keep in mind, you're drinking Heineken, which isn't exactly a gourmet beer. You get 3 complimentary beers, but they aren't full size. There are a lot of gimmicks like taking your photo in front of a green screen and emailing it to friends and other interactive exhibits like pouring a virtual pint. There is a \"ride\" but it's only impressive if you don't get out much. It's essentially just a video with a few special effects like bubbles and vibrations. The final room, where you drink the beer, has the vibe of a college dorm. The floor is extremely sticky from spilt Heineken. All in all, I didn't learn anything from the tour as it is a giant self-promoting commercial that I paid to watch. I would not recommend unless you REALLY like Heineken."

Even though I don't drink beer, I still was interested in the company and its history. I loved all the old memorabilia of Heineken and the stories of each Heineken family members to have led them to where they are today. The 2 bar men were also very good entertainers, taught everybody the 'art' of drinking Heineken and why the foam on the top is a good thing. There were many activities and personalised memorabilia you can get. Our friends bought a bottle Heineken with a personalised label on it. It was presented in a cool looking tube too as its packaging. The only negative thing I will say is that along with your ticket, you get 2 free drinks and a gift. At the end when you 'collect' your gift, you are asked to go on one of their boat rides to the other side of town to visit their brand store just to collect your free gift, which was a bottle opener. However, the boats run every hour, and it was already full when we finished our tour. Plus we didn't fancy spending the next hour waiting around or going the other side of town. Other than this, it was a fun visit, I bought my tickets online and it was slightly cheaper and I was cautious of the potential queue, but it turns out that there was barely a queue anyway. Will definitely recommend it to everyone."

If you don't mind spending at least an hour (or 2 like we did), and can stomach the extreme commercialism of the tour, this is a really fun, interactive and interesting brewery tour. You follow along a path through the giant complex, learning how the beer is brewed, seeing the old tanks/machinery etc, reading/watching some history of the Heineken company/family, get to play some computer games and interactive things, and go on a virtual 'ride' as if you're the barley being brewed... and of course finish off with a couple brews yourself! Now if you're a beer snob or purist this may not be attractive due to all the commercials and dumbed-down beer information, but if you're there to just have a fun time learning a bit about the beer it is a lot of fun. Tip - buy tickets online and print them - its a couple Euro cheaper and apparently lets you skip the queue. We showed up on a rainy afternoon midweek and there were very few people there, no lineup at all. But that may have been due to the weather. Location - it is a bit out of the centre, but close to RIjksmuseum, so if you're feeling a bit tired after a long museum visit and need something more high energy then swing by Heineken afterwards, that's what we did and it was a good combination!"

The only thing I wouldn't really recommend is getting your name labeled on the bottle - its 6 Euros and looks quite cheap. Its just a sticker placed on the bottle - if you are flying with carry on only you will need to drink the beer in order to bring the bottle on board. I would recommend getting your name or message engraved in a glass located in the gift shop which cost 8 Euros for the glass, engraving and tin to stick it in. The woman engraving the glasses was wonderful. I put my name and a heart and wanted 2013 on it, she suggested putting Amsterdam 2013 at the bottom - great idea. You get two free drinks or you can pour your own and get one drink. I would recommend pouring your own - it was so much fun trying to get it right. We even got certificates at the end saying we were experts in beer pouring. It was just a good time. There are several trams that take you beside the building. I know of the 24 & 16 - the 24 goes from Centraal station, not sure about the 16. The Amsterdam Famous Market isn't far down from the Heineken Experience."

There is a free shuttle boat that takes you to the Heineken brand store (10 min walk) at the end of the tour where you can pick up a free bottle opener.

Print out your voucher or bring your phone to show the claim number on line. No need to line up if you have printed out your ticket voucher. Receive your bracelets with button tokens to be given in exchange for beer at the end of the tour. Walk through the tour at your own pace. The history is detailed and rather interesting. There is a virtual ride where \"you\" become beer and are brought from the start of the brewing process to the end of the shipping. There is a gift shop and then finally the part you have been waiting for... beer drinking. I recommend drinking the extra cold (larger glass) for two tokens rather than the not-so-cold smaller glass for one token each. It is the same beer but the colder one is much nicer and the large size is really the same as the two smaller ones. You can pour yourself a beer on one side of the bar or have the staff do it on the other side of the bar. (It costs more tokens to do it yourself - we could not figure out why). Be sure to make it clear which beer you want and be sure that the staff remembers that you gave your tokens. We saw several instances where the staff pretended not to get the customers tokens or said they did not give the right number of them. Seems silly but this is what was happening. Perhaps they were hinting for (additional) money? The gift shop is extensive and any type of Heineken goods are available there. Their is one additional white token that can be use to get a small gift from the other gift shop location which is about 15 minutes walk away from the brewery location. Maybe not worth the bottle opener gift to go so far out of your way unless you really have extra time."

It is by far not comparable to other similar places like the Guinness brewery in Dublin. But still I found my visit to be worth its money and to be instructive. Indeed, I could not reconcile with the negative comments on the poor instructive level of this place. Maybe the people should take the time to read the boards with all necessary explanations and speak with the people who are giving demonstrations. Actually, the brewing principles are relatively basic and the same for all breweries. The secret for a beer to be different from an other one is actually \u2026 a secret and resides in the mixture, type and quantity of few ingredients! The only key differentiating factor between breweries is their marketing and this concept is very well developed and explained there. Also, a lot of boards do explain how the Heineken family or the brewery is different and a.o. was innovative in the social domain in the Netherlands. The only negative point is that none of the exhibition, information boards or even the audio tour is available in french. Additionally, they also offer you a mini boat trip to reach the Heineken shop. I considered this was a plus given that you are not \u201cobliged\u201d to visit this shop but can enjoy a mini cruise on the canal for free. Will probably not do it anymore but it was worth the test. Finally, given the 3 beers received to taste and the mini cruise, I believe the entry fee of 18 Euros is reasonable"

So we had some friends over for the weekend and decided to see something really Dutch, the original Heineken brewery.First the price: 18\u20ac... wow... expensive, hope it's worth it...So you start in a renovated building, going through different rooms and floors, and discover the history of the brewery. Nice. Then you can taste the raw product.Little walk via the horses stables, then up to a tasting... a tiny glass of beer where a guy tells you how you're supposed to drink it. Amusing :-)Then you get into some amusement area, where you can learn to tap a beer, or simply order some beers (you can get one or two beers with the entrance tickets).So nice to quickly visit, have a beer, but the full marketing bashing makes me think that this experience should be either free, or merely the price of the beer."

I read a previous review of someone who was disappointed about the ride... the brewery is a brewery, not an amusement park. I thought the museum/brewery experience was amazing. Some of the videos in those lounge-y green chairs weren't working so that was a bit disappointing but I feel like they've probably been repaired by now. At the beer tasting afterwards, since it was still early in the day a bunch of other people passed on their beer buttons... so for 3 twenty-somethings on a much needed vacation, it was the perfect way to start the day."

Sure, you get a couple beers but the whole \"tour\" is more or less a waste of time. It tries to be a museum, but isn't that interesting and they throw a whole bunch of other gimmicky time wasters at you which are basically just glorified ads for Heineken. I don't really write negative reviews, but I've done free brewery tours which offer more than this. For the record, you do get a discount if you buy your tickets in advance (which I recommend, because there can be pretty big lines)."

As you went around you looked into big vats, some showing about 30 seconds worth of information film.The ride was very poor for anyone who has been to any theme park rides.The demonstration of the lager was over very quickly, mind you the lager tasted good. But in the afternoon 1 small glass was enough.The IT section was good for young people and those that wanted to send experience to friends on facebook.You were then led into a Heineken branded shop. but your free gift could only be got from another venue the other side of the city.We then went to go on the boat trip, and it was full and was the last one, the boat takes you to an area which is a 15 minutes walk to get your free gift - a bottle opener - so we were told.So unless you want to get a couple of drinks, a bottle opener, and possibly a boat ride for 18 euros don't bother with the Heineken experience."

If you haven't taken a canal crusie prior to going to the Heineken Exp. maybe you don't want to pay for one, because Heineken offer their own canal ride up to the Heineken store to gather your free gift.

Talks about the beer and a couple of glasses at the end in an ice type bar more than a beer bar, but kept in theme. Little 'ride' making you into beer. Then a boat trip to the shop with a tour guide.

We had previously been on a brewery tour of the Halve Maan brewery in Bruges, and very much enjoyed it, and the beer at the end!This is a completely different experience, but we enjoyed it just as much. We booked online, so we didn't have to join the ticket queues, instead simply showing our QR codes and being given our bracelets, complete with beer and gift tokens!The start of the tour is very much like many other museums - a video guide to the history of Heineken (very interesting, and well presented), followed by a series of photographic introductions to family members at various stages of the Heineken process. So far, so good, but so far, so ordinary.However, beyond this, the experience became much more interactive. The process of brewing was explained by expert staff, and you were given the opportunity to taste the brew at different stages of the process. You get to see, if not meet, some of the horses that still pull beer drays around Amsterdam, and then get to the tasting room where you are given a beer (you don't need to give up any of your beer tokens for this) and taught how to taste it, the Dutch way!Beyond this, you experience a 4D presentation where you go through the whole process of brewing - very good, and complete with movement, heat, water, etc! And then a whole tranche of fully interactive rooms - computer games, photography and video opportunities, etc, before the opportunity to give up your beer tokens in exchange for glasses of Heineken. Wonderful!The final token on your wristband gives you the opportunity to visit the Heineken Brand store, in a different part of the city. To get there, you take a 15 minute or so canal trip, free, which gives you the chance to experience the city from the canals. The store itself is much as you would expect, with the free gift, mounted on a postcard, being very fine.The tour is available, without the beer, to children, and our 12 year-old would have enjoyed it if he had been with us, but I think that is more of an adult than a family attraction."

We should get a free boat ride to the Heineken brand store where we should get a free bottle opener but there was only one boat per hour with limited capacity. If we knew this we wouldn't hurry out of the museum."

Heineken has made a fun experience for everyone, with a \"ride,\" interactive exhibits, and speakers who explain the brewing process for those unfamiliar with how their favorite beer is made. The large copper kettles and a peek at some of the brewery's horses make for fun photo opportunities, as well.

The Heineken Experience is a pleasant attraction that is fun, however it lacks the type of information and awe you get from a winery tour. I know beer and winemaking are different, but when I visit Italy, a good wine tour beats this experience 10x. The building is a mix between a souvenir shop, walk through museum, and a bar. It is primarily a self-paced museum with multi-media kiosks, visual displays, and some hands-on fun. You don't get to see beer being made, however there are some video clips that simulate the process. In the end, you get the feeling that it is just an excuse to sell Heineken novelty items. Each person gets two small beers included in the admission price. My 16 yr old son enjoyed the tour but for me it was just an expensive show and tell tourist trap."

Once inside, we were met by mass of people stuck in a hall, no way of turning back and forced to wait another 60mins, all while there were NO update on what is going on. Once through the bottleneck you are once again met by yet another waiting period of 20mins to see a movie, but have the option to skip and move on.!3. Needless to say, we skipped the movie, only to be met by another stampede of people trying to grap a small glass of beer, no way of even hearing a presentation about beer tapping.4. Moving on just to get of of the place you have option to take picture and videos of yourself, but actually receiving these by email would be a miracle5. Cant remember much after that as all we wanted to do was to get out of the place. 6. Once in the giftshop, we wanted to exchange our white token for the free gift that is offered when you buy your ticket, only to find out you have to walk another 15minutes to fetch it!!! What a joke!!!7. Does Heineken actually think they promote their brand by this?? I dont think so.Even if the excuse was that is was their busyiest day in the year, why then allow so many people into the \"attraction\" At EUR18 per person it was a total waste for us which not only left us EUR108 poorer but also robbed us of 3,5 hours that we could have spend in Amsterdam :("

You are guided along the way (people at the various stations) but it isn't a \"guided\" tour where you have to stay with a group. They have some fun photo cutouts for photo ops, some fun multimedia things were you can take a photo/video and send then to your friends via email, and of course the obligatory beer lessons and tastings. They have a need attraction/video where \"you are the beer.\" Very well done. Nothing is overly crowded and it moves pretty quickly. You get an understanding of what a large worldwide brand Heineken is and all the things they support (sports, of course - but also environmental issues and sustainability.) This was my second time doing thins experience within the past year (different set of family members this time) and we took advantage of the canal boat to the other Heineken Experience/gift shop. At first you feel like you're being taken advantage of when they offer you a \"free gift\" at the other shop. But then you hear about the canal boat that leaves on the hour and gives a nice 15 minute boat ride - and yes they sell great tasting, perfectly cold Heineken on the ride. The free gift was substantial (a nice bottle opener in the shape of the smiling E) and the commentary was interesting. In fact, it was during the canal ride that we learned from the announcer that the Van Gogh museum was closed for renovations, but that a substantial number of pieces were moved to the nearby Hermitage museum so we were able to adjust our plans accordingly and see them while we were in the area. Really turned out to be a time saver as we would have spent the time we were in the museum seeing VG paintings just getting to the original museum which I mentioned was closed for renovation.We were even able to take the same canal boat back to the Experience which is a short walk from the IAMSTERDAM sign. It left on the :15 or so. Gift shop in both locations was good and staff there helpful."

The only long cue we decided to join was the Heineken Experience. Was it worth cueing for almost an hour and was it worth the almost 80 euros for our family of four. To be honest not really.It is hard to figure out the target audience for this \"experience\". There is nothing all that interesting for kids so they can't be the target audience. True beer lovers would probably want to know more about beer making and its history than what is shown and if you want to have three small glasses of Heineken you might as well enjoy them in one of the numerous pubs in Amsterdam. So if beer lovers are their target audience they're not doing very well.My overall rating is however as high as it is due to fact that our 20 and 18 year olds seemed to enjoy it - and didn't mind the price as they didn't have to pay ;) They did however agree on the fact that the 4-D experience was more of a joke than anything else. It didn't really tell you anything about beer making and as a 4-D experience the only thing that made it amusing was the fact that it was well below any similiar thing we've experienced.The next time I'll experience a Heineken experience is in a pub - because as a beer Heineken is OK."

The brewery shop is over priced and the gift store is quite a walk away (20 minutes) but for your money, you get a free coat check, you certainly get entertained, and you get a free pint at the end for your efforts!

            "review": "Pay extortionate prices to be heavily advertised to and learn nothing!. I was thoroughly disappointed upon visiting the Heineken experience. Firstly I was under the impression upon entry that I would be visiting a working brewery - this is not the case. What this tour really is about is to pound the Heineken brand into you so hard that you walk away smiling and wanting another drink. There was nothing educational about this visit and I learnt nothing new about the brewing process (despite asking one of the individuals working there about it - he seemed to know less than I did) - Nor were you invited to learn anything about the bottling process (apart from a cheap diorama which gives you the opportunity to pay another 6 euros to get your name printed on a bottle) - apparently the brewery got moved 200km out of town around 50 years ago and therefore the actualy brewery is now just a tourist attraction where they constantly try to brain wash the hell out of you. One of the most eerie bits of the tour is just a room with maybe 10 pod like chairs which when sitting in you can watch all the latest up-to-date ADVERTS for Heineken (see photos). It was like some dystopian bullet-to-the-head brainwashing centre with no educational value but to \"educate you that Heineken is the brand to buy\" - If I have to spend time watching adverts, I expect to be compensated for it, not to pay 18 euros myself to go through a dreadful experience like that. I went to the Heineken Experience because I used to think Heineken was a decent lager (in fact it was my favourite lager as a youngster, i don't really drink it much anymore) - I came away feeling very betrayed and out of pocket - It is the kind of attraction that should be free since than pay for the '2 free beers' you get at the end (250ml - not even half a pint) simply by advertising to you so heavily (and at times subliminally) throughout. To put the nail in the coffin, to receieve the free key chain they promise you at the start of the tour, you cannot simply pick it up in the overpriced gift shop on the way out. Oh no. You have to walk 20 minutes into town to get to the 'Brand Shop' (or wait to the next hour, it was only quarter past the our when I left) to catch the boat (which is probably a 2 minute ride, with another 5 minutes walk).Shame on you Heineken - Unfotunately I will not be buying another beer from your company again after that charade. Very very disappointed and I feel very cheated"

We also got to go on the Heineken boat on the canal, which dropped us off by where the other Heineken store is in the city.

            "review": "Self guided? For 18 euros?. Our first disappointment came when told that the tour was self guided. As you go through the first section there is a 'virtual bar' with film of a barman giving you a potted history of heineken. So far so good. Don't pass the chance of a photo opportunity just beyond that. Once up the stairs you go through various rooms with photos and facts on the wall that largely repeat what the virtual barman has already told you. A rinse and repeat moment for slow visual learners. Then a real life person stands behind a bar and gets you to smell a bowl of barley and asks you what colour the heineken beer is. Hmmm so far so elementary school. By the way, heineken is GOLD because gold is for winners, not yellow because yellow is the colour of, you know what!Next up you get to see lots of impressive copper stills/mash thingies, some of which have black and white movies playing on the inside wall. A guy was standing about giving mini samples and tidbits of info if approached, but there was very little human engagement until the proper tasting sessions. This was I suppose the one brief highlight in the whole experience, and the chap doing the talk gave us all a bit of a giggle when explaining why it is that a glass of beer served in holland has so much froth on top.Onwards we marched into the next room which was a dark chill-out lounge where slick adverts for heineken were played on the walls. Thrilling stuff. Next came the virtual ride; rather a lame affair based on a movie where you 'become the beer', though the staff leading us on to the platform mustered plenty of enthusiasm for what we were about to experience. If you've ever been to a theme park it ain't gonna impress you one bit.There were a few video-game-like distractions between the ride and the final two glasses of heineken, but I didn't fancy waiting in line at this point, albeit they looked like a bit of fun, especially if you are with a group of pals. Off for the two drinks we headed (included in price of ticket). After walking around for an hour you'd think there would be enough places for everyone to have a sit down at this point, but we were unlucky. Two heinekens were drunk standing up. At 18 euros per person entry fee you'd think they could afford more than a handful of chairs. This confirmed my thoughts that people with mobility issues would not fare well here.If by chance you finish your tour near the top of the hour, and the queues arent too long, then your ticket will also get you a boat ride from the heineken experience along the canal to their brand shop where you can spend more money and get a complimentary gift (wee bottle opener). We missed the boat.To be fair, there were younger people who enjoyed the tour. I've enjoyed a number of thoroughly entertaining guided tours of scottish whisky distilleries which were either free, or just a nominal charge. The heineken experience by comparison was a bit of a damp squib, but if you're new to this kind of thing maybe you'll like it. I regretted that I didn't just spend that 18 euros in one of amsterdams fabulous ale houses on something a lot tastier than heineken! I've heard that the House of Bols Cocktail experience is a lot more fun so thats where I'm going next time. Different strokes for different folks.Any tour is only as good as its guide. As it was a self-guided tour I only have myself to blame for the yawntastic heineken experience. I did a truly dreadful job and I won't be giving myself a tip or a recommendation!Don't let me put you off. I'm sure you would do a far better guiding job;)"

On the canal trip afterwards to the Heineken experience shop in the city centre, the tour guide on the boat was such a good laugh, he gave us a lot of history of the city and the canals and we got a bottle of Heineken for \u20ac2.50 each, in a special aluminium bottle which we could bring home with us. The staff are all really friendly. The whole atmosphere is fun and relaxed. The shop at the end is very good too, merchandise was not too expensive compared to similar places we have been, and getting two beer pitchers engraved with our names and a bottle of beer with our own personalised label was a perfect way to remember our experience. We spent about 3 hours there, and we returned later in the day to avail of the free canal ride to the shop in the city.

As it turned out the brewery tour was fun, informational, and best off all included FREE Beer. What could be better? Go ahead and buy advance tickets on the Heineken Experience website and skip the long ticket line. The tickets are good for a year so you don't have to book a specific date. This is a very interactive tour and you can even take a ride in your beer (no kidding). Plan on spending at least an hour if not longer to get the most out of it. The ticket also includes a free short canal boat ride to the Heineken brand store where you get a free bottle opener. This is a very nice easy going break-a-way from all the other tourists sites in Amsterdam. Have a beer and enjoy."

First is the history of Heineken with some video, props, and pictures. Then a photo op in a cut out. Up the stairs into the plant area to see the vats and how Heineken is made. You get to taste the hops or something that goes into the beer process. Have your camera ready, good faces after people taste the juice. Out the back to the stables to see the horses then up the escalator. You enter an area and get more info on the making of Heineken from a young man and you can ask questions. You then get into a Q for the ride part of the tour. The best way to describe it is like several rows that you stand in and a movie screen in front and they make you part of the process of making a Heineken from start to finish. You have a guide in the screen and he goes through the process. Its fun. Then you get to make your own bottle. I couldn't get it to work in English. If you can't get it to work don't worry they will make you one in the gift shop. Its a real cool gift and its like 5 bucks. Made one for my nephew he almost cried when he saw his name on a bottle of Heineken. Off to the tasting room where they explain how to properly drink a Heineken. Yes there is a proper way to drink Heineken especially for the ladies. They get into everything from the bubbles and the foam and you get to drink some Heineken what's not to like. You then enter the interactive play area, more photo ops with props and the pictures are sent to your email and you can share (free). All kinds of hands on stuff. The restrooms are just beyond this area. Now when you started the tour they gave you a rubber bracelet with 3 tabs on it. ( We got ours from our hotel and it was cheaper than at The Heineken Experience. After the restrooms you have an area you can use 2 tabs to learn how to properly pour a Heineken and get to drink it after you get it right. Its harder than you may think. Hint Timing on the Tap is key. You also get a certificate that says you did it. You may choose to use 2 tabs on 1 glass of uber cold ICE Heineken. That was my choice. Or you could have 2 glasses of regular Heineken. That is the conclusion of the tour. But wait now for the gift shop. All kinds of Heineken stuff in here, also your bottle pick up or order if you couldn't get it in English or your home language. I'm telling you it's a great gift for anyone. So after you get some great gifts you are walking out and going wait I have 1 more tab left. What is this one for. Well I will tell you. You can get a free ride on a boat which will take you to the Heineken store not far away or a free gift at the store. We wanted the free gift. So we walked to the store (Should of taken the S baun) it's about 1 mile away. Anyway the free gift is a post card with a metal E laminated to it. It's a bottle opener/letter opener. Didn't play with it until we got home. Second best gift I gave to someone. Just saying. You can't buy it so use your tab wisely. Oh yea the store sells mini Heineken's and some in flavors you can only get in Amsterdam. Another cool gift idea. Just make sure they are not in your carry on or TSA will be enjoying your gifts. I put mine in my socks in the center of my checked luggage and no problems. Hope you have as much fun as we did."

            "review": "This ale fan was won over. As a keen ale drinker I put my differences with lager aside for couple of hours for the Heineken Experience. Although I'm usually more interested in smaller, less corporate breweries I had seen that this ranked among Amsterdam's must-see attractions and couldn't resist. Other reviewers and even visitors I overheard on the day compared the brewery to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and this is what sprung to my mind as my girlfriend and I made our way through the 12-stage tour at our own pace. The different stages offer plenty of variety with something for everyone, whether you're interested in the history of the company, the brewing process in general or are just looking for a fun family experience. The tour starts with the story behind Heineken before you move on to see and taste the key ingredients and walk through the old brew room. The rest of the tour involves a tasting session in English, a 4D experience which takes you through the brewing process as if you were one of the ingredients (also in English) and some funny interactive video and photo opportunities which you can email to yourself or someone else. As well as the half pint you get during the tasting session (or more if you answer the guide's questions, correctly or not) you get two more half pints in the 'world bar' at the end of the tour. You're also encouraged to take a token to the Heineken store which is a short walk or free canal ride away, where you can pick up a free Heineken bottle opener. These are all nice touches and left me feeling that I had got my money's worth for \u20ac18, not to mention a little bit merry.I would recommend that brewery enthusiasts go with an open mind. While there is plenty of information and history at the beginning, it feels more commercialised and gimmicky the further along you go as you're bombarded with sounds, dazzling lights, Heineken adverts and interactive activities that are all about marketing and nothing to do with brewing, which you might find off-putting if you're not expecting it. Saying that, my girlfriend and I were impressed and would definitely recommend the Heineken Experience to couples and groups of friends who have a couple of hours to spare in Amsterdam and fancy something a bit different from the city's more traditional sights. The clue is in the name; it's not just a tour, it's an experience!"

The tour itself was great fun and we loved the fact that there was so many interactive bits. Half way round you go on a little ride in which you get treated like a bottle of beer! It's better than it sounds - haha. Then you get taken into a room and given a small glass of Heineken while a bar man explains how it got its colour, fizz etc. Dont worry about how small the glass is as you get two more glasses at the end!! There was lots to do whilst taking the tour and I reckon we had been in there for a few hours by the time we had finished chilling out with our free beers in the bar at the end!!At the end of the experience you can either claim a free bottle opener or go on a canal boat ride. We took the boat ride as we thought this would be better and it was. We were very lucky with the weather and as it was such a beautiful day we sat outside on the boat with yet more bottles of beer!! The boat ride its self was nice and informative.I would recommend this for a good trip to take whilst in Amsterdam.Beer in not brewed here anymore though so please don't go thinking you will see beer being made as you will be disappointed!"

They try hard to make the whole thing seem fun, but how much fun can brewing beer really be? You're basically paying \u20ac18 for them to advertise their brand and you get two small glasses of beer. I'd say it's more worth about \u20ac10. The beer is lovely, though."

We had a great time here, we bought tickets online so we could skip the queue and I\u2019m glad we did as the queue was huge!!We got a tram from Amsterdam central station just because it was snowy and freezing cold otherwise we could have walked it in 10 or 15 minutes it depends how fast you walk!!Was interesting to see around the brewery and how the development of Heineken has changed. The staff are very educated in telling you how the beer tastes the way it does.The tasters are great. You get 3 free beers with your ticket. 1 beer when the guy pours your whole group a glass, then you all hold up your glass, say cheers in Dutch, look at the golden colour, the lovely bubbles keeping your beer fresh (my mouth is salivating!!)You get to take your beer into this chilled out green room where the whole ceiling is covered in green glass bottles.You can create your own label for a bottle of Heineken for \u20ac6. We would of done this but we couldn\u2019t bring it home with us on the flight :)You also get a free gift and a free canal tour with this ticket but the free gift you have to travel on the canal tour to get it (the gift was a Heineken bottle opener) and we didn\u2019t have the time to do this unfortunately.Then you go to the Heineken bar at the end of the tour and get to enjoy 2 complimentary beers each. Delicious!! :)The interactive ride through the beer production process was very enjoyable you get to \u201cfeel like Heineken\u201d!!"

Ah ok.. now all this even seems boring then let me tell you would reach an area which is full of activities like taking up your video, photos with typical dutch back ground or along with cycle. At the end there is a lounge where you can click snaps with jazzy back grounds. I visited this place along with few friends.

After all, I've been to tons of brewery tours here in SD, I know how beer is brewed, blah blah blah. But I figured, we're in Amsterdam, might as well. Sooo glad we went. It really is an experience. Tons of history about beer in general and Heineken specific. You get 1 free taster where they teach you about how the beer should be poured and drank! Then you get 2 (or 3) tickets for beer at the bar in the end. There's an area with real taps and they will teach you how to pour the perfect Heineken pint and let you drink the beer after. It was such a good time, super interactive and fun.And for the beer snobs like myself, Heineken in Amsterdam tastes totally different from Heineken in the US. So don't dismiss it so quickly."

We didn't wait long at all to get in- about 10mins including waiting in line for our tickets and for the free cloakroom. We found the museum interesting as there were so many different things to do! We learned about the history, had a beer tasting session, were able to take fun photos and enjoyed their 4D cinema. We paid \u20ac16 each as we picked up a voucher at one of the many 'Tickets and Tours' outlets in amsterdam city centre. Included were 2 free beers at the end. However, you also get a beer at the tastign session so you end up having 3 beers. We were also given extra as the friendly bar man accidently poured 5 instead of 4- they're not at all stingy with the beer! All the employees were young and very friendly as well as being informative.Another plus was the free gift offered if you go to the heineken brand store. Unfortunately we didn't have time to go however there was a boat running there every hour.Overall, a fun day out- especially if you're a beer fan! Would definitely recommend a visit! I went with friends however i also think my parents would've enjoyed it :)"

They also have interactive segments such as what it's like to be a Heineken bottle, tasting, their dutch/heineken version of sing star, loads of photo opportunity spots. At the end of their tour you chill out in the bar and get a couple of half pints.

Also the inclusive drinks are very nice and fresh. I don't drink Heineken in the UK where I am from but in Amsterdam it does taste much better and is stronger. It would be a good place to go during the day before a night drinking as you can make a start with the included drinks. I really liked the staff as they would tell you the truth if you asked, one agreed with me and explained the reasons why Heineken tastes better in The Netherlands. Worth a visit though it should be cheaper (but subtract the price of the drinks and it is averagely priced for an attraction in Amsterdam.)"

We booked tickets through the \"Tours and Tickets\" shops which are dotted around the city and saved us a couple of Euros each. On buying our tickets, we were given a free keyring bottle opener, which was nice. When we arrived at the location, we were given another key ring bottle opener, along with our wrist bands which included tokens for our 2 free drinks, and a token for a free gift (yep, another bottle opener key ring!! who needs 3 of them each?!)The experience itself was educational, and gave a good insight into the Heineken company and it's values, as well as showing practical demonstrations of how the beer is brewed. You also get a 3rd small beer as part of a \"tasting session\", which is great fun and very informative, with a very amusing barman. (if you shout out the answers to his questions you get even more free beer!)The price was reasonable, and you got 2 free drinks plus a smaller 3rd, so you can't grumble given the price of drinks in the city centre!

The river cruise they offer to the gift shop is good, especially if you time it right and see the city at dusk. Book online, it's cheaper!"

This is no longer an operating brewery, but the original remnants are still there to be explored. The historical aspects are interesting, with some interactive features on the beer making process. The tour is heavy on marketing as to be expected, but the staff makes it fun. I did not find the 18 euro fee to be out of line considering you receive a couple beers at the end and some small promotional gift (I received a bottle opener).All said, I was happy that I went. However I was there at an off peak time, so never waited on line long. I would not have wanted to be here at peak volume and would probably have a much different impression if I had. Truthfully it is not worth waiting on line for an hour or more, so recommend checking the queues before you commit."

The experience was a lot of fun, even for someone who is not a beer drinker. You learn the story of the Heineken family, see where the beer used to be made, go through the beer making experience in 4D, see the marketing behind the brand and learn what to look for in a beer. The e-experience of it all is a lot of fun - for tourists, there is free WiFi so you can check yourself in on Facebook to make your friends jealous that you are there. Two free drinks are included in the entry fee, which we thought was good value, as are the unique \"experience only\" gifts which you can get there - personalised beer bottles and etched glass steins. Most enjoyable, although we were there on a day that the Heineken people admitted was very quiet."

There are plenty of hands on exhibits and lots of chances to take photos.You follow one route around the museum, see how beer is made, go on a beer-bottling experience in a simulator, try some Heineken (of course) and have your own chance to learn how to pour the perfect glass. There's also the usual gift shop at the end, with a host of Heineken-branded stuff to take home - all in all, well worth a visit as it's a good mix of old and very new, with good interactive exhibits that will keep you entertained for probably 1 - 2 hours if you do everything."

It is clearly that they want to use this space to memorialize their brand - with good reason.The space is well laid out and very easy to get through at whatever pace you wish. You start off by going through a quick \"memory lane\" Then you get a live demonstration of the ingredients used in the brew - you can actually taste the ingredients (but stay away from the hops as my son found out). Afterwards you go through the old brewery area where you see how the beer was brewed. You can sample the mash while walking through the old oasts.They have a fun 5D experience where you become the beer that is being brewed. This is by no means a top-notch disney ride experience, but it is fun nonetheless and we appreciated Heineken taking the effort to put it together. Toward the end, you are brought in to a room where you can sample the beer and have a discussion with one of the hosts who explain the need for head in the beer, etc. You get two free drink tokens with your admission, and the last part of the experience is to go to a pretty cool series of \"bars\" that are playing music, etc. and you can just have a drink using your free tokens and enjoy the atmosphere.All in all, this was a fun way to spend a couple of hours on an otherwise, dreary, misty day. While this wouldn't rank up there with Anne Frank, it certainly is a fun time and highly recommended for people of all ages."

You get 3 drinks (though one is mini) with entry. You can also customise your own bottle and buy a host of heineken-branded merchandise. There are ferries that will take you from the Experience to their main store where you can claim your 'free' (ie included in entry) gift - a bottle opener.Even if you're not that interested in beer it can be a fun couple of hours."

It's education, interactive and fun. You learn a lot about the brewing process, the history of Henieken, and the staff are very helpful, even though they're doing the same thing all day/week/year. There are many interactive 'games' you can play, we enjoyed the 'beer pouring' test and a simple must, is to do the 'Tulips From Amsterdam' video sing-a-long, which you can then email to yourself. Dont worry about looking silly, everyone does it! You are given a wrist band with a couple of tokens attached which gives you 2 beers at the end of the tour, however, the final fun thing to do, is to see actually how many different ways you can devise to obtain more 'free' beers. EG, \"someone just took my beer off the table\", pretending to drop your token in the pot, etc. We obtained 10 beers, which probably helped to increase our enjoyment!Please tick the box if you found this helpful, thank you."

I was not let down. Having booked tickets beforehand, I was able to jump the queue and go straight into the museum. The first half of the museum focuses on the history of the Heineken brand and how the beer is brewed. You get to experience the beer at different points of the brewing process and you can even taste it before it's ready - not a pleasant taste, but good to know! Before learning how to taste beer, you experience being a bottle of Heineken inside a 4D ride, which was brilliant. The second half of the museum focuses on the Heineken brand now and allows for a great deal of interactivity, for example, you can be in a music video, you can be a Heineken DJ, or you can appear in the latest James Bond film! The experience ends with a free beer in the (very busy and crowded) bar, which tries to recreate the feeling of being in a club. A walk through the souvenir shop finishes off the experience well.Two important tips are to book tickets online and to leave your coat in the free staffed cloakroom at the beginning."

Lots of different exhibits and everything is very interactive. You get to drink 3 beers (one in a tasting lesson and two at the bar at the end) so this is definitely good value for your money. Everyone we encountered throughout the experience was very friendly and knowledgeable. I especially loved seeing the horses, all named after board members! One big perk is the canal cruise to the Heineken Store at the end. By the time we finished our tour, it was early evening so the canals were all lit up. The free canal cruise not only took us back much closer to our hotel so we wouldn't have to walk but it was also narrated and educational. We had already done a canal cruise but this allowed us to see the canals at night - beautiful!

Not to forget the 'ride' were you are transferred into the brewing of Heineken. I was invited here but I think the cost is around 25 Euro's, including a couple of cold ones in the end. Better have a wallet full as there is this fantastic lady who will carve your name in a glass, Heineken glass off course! The merchandise for sale is just out of this world, truly amazing!

The tram stopped 100 meters away, and since we had pre-ordered, we didn't have to stand in line. The stuff presented was so-so interesting, some historical info, some displays and some funny-stuff that had pretty little with beer-brewing to do. Finishing the tour in the bar with 2 beers included, and last stop at the store. The store had some nice gadgets that were slightly overpriced, and all in all we left the facility feeling satisfied, but not more than that."

Almighty Heineken beer is exhalted and praised the whole way through, and they bombard you with commercials left and right. There is actually one spot in which you can lie down in a booth that encapsulates you, and you do nothing but watch commercials. If that's not the definition of brainwashing, I dont know what is.

You are allowed two drinks and a free boat ride with your ticket, you learn about the brewing process etc as you would with any tour. However, a good addition included a small ride experience that 'bottles' you as a beer as you are the beer being made, heated, checked and bottled and a section on football sponsorship and community work.

The tour took us through the entire history of Heineken beer and the beer making process with some beer tasting along the way. There was a section where we got to see all Heineken ads (including a Hindi one !!!). We also got our name engraved on a bottle (for a price though). The crew was very cooperative and spoke very good English. The biggest attraction for me was the short boat ride to the Heineken free gift shop. The guide (Leonard, I believe) did keep us engrossed and made the boat trip very memorable exprience. The gift store and also the shop at the brewery are very well stocked and though the souveniers are priced a little on the higher side, one should definitely buy something to remember the trip.

Staff were genuinely enthusiastic to make the experience a fantastic one with them all having a clear pride in their work and an eye for detail. Many interactive exhibits along the way and just enough reading information so as not to get too bogged down in the details. Who ever came up with the idea of the experience is very clever and should be applauded. A great marketing tool but one which will pay off and provide its customers with a memorable experience. The beer tasting was generous with about 2-3 beers along the way. Clever personalised gift options throughout where you can pay as you go if you wish. If you don't want to pay for extras that's fine - you can email yourself funny pictures and video clips. The experience was extremely well thought out, efficient and very clean. I can imagine it gets busy but go early and avoid the crowds. It's worth it. The 15 minute boat cruise is a nice extra touch where they take you to the brand store where you can get a free gift. A large \"e\" bottle opener at the time we went. For \u20ac17 I can't recommend the experience enough.

It provided an interesting history of the Heineken brand and gave you a glimpse of some of their traditional brewing methods, but the rest then became more of an advert for them than anything else - nothing wrong with that, but don't expect more! The free beers you get are a nice unique selling point - a small glass after the 4D experience goes down well and then either 1 x 35cl extra cold Heineken or 2 x 25cl regular at the end with the tokens on your wrist band round the visit off nicely, although in a group of friends or family you'd enjoy the bar at the end more than the rest."

We didn't mind the queue as it was moving and the weather was good. To avoid the queue just book online in advance and you can go straight to the front - but you will need to print off your ticket. The brewery was so packed full of people the staff where having trouble keeping up, one member of staff (lookng a bit frazzeled) said that it was too busy and they couldn't cope!! We where rushed through the various areas (there was no map available), having to queue up again for 30 minutes to watch the 4D experience, with no staff to advise on wait time or if we could skip this part, a lot of other tourists got annoyed and there where a few heated words exchanged with various people. Due to the crouds they crammed people into the 4D experience so in the end it was a huge let down.Most of the interactive elements either had huge queues or they didn't work and once you got to the bar upstairs you had to queue yet again to get your free small beer. This part felt like you where in a dingy club, with sticky floors, standing room only and broken glass left lying on the floor and table tops. I am sure if you go when it is quiet and all the interactive elements are workjing and the staff are less stressed then this would be a good experience, but for 17Euros I should have stayed in the pub!!"

They even had samples of wort to try so you can see what beer tastes like before it is fermented. They also have a 4D movie that shows you the entire process from beginning to end. Then several more floors of different things to do including learning how to pour a beer. I would highly recommend this and you can easily spend 2 hours there."

My mom wasn\u2019t sure if this is something she would enjoy but it ended up being one of her favorite things we did in Amsterdam, it is definitely different than your average brewery tour. Make sure you have at least 2 hours to go through the tour as there is a lot to see."

We were a little worried about going to Heineken because it is pricey and we assumed it would be like every other brewery tour. IT IS NOT!! It is definitely not just a tour, it's an experience. The ticket includes the experience, tastings (2 pints!) and a token to take a boat to the store that's a few miles from the old factory. When you add everything together it is worth the price."

I thought that 17 euros was a little expensive, to get into this place but by the end I was fairly happy with the whole thing.You are taken on a journey through the history of this company and how they make the famous brew with a short 'brew ride' on the way and a couple of small beers at the end. If you wish, you can take the free, 15 minute boat ride, to their brand store where you do receive a small gift, as well. The whole thing is fairly light hearted and makes for a fun history lesson. Being a fan of Heineken beer, I think that it was worth it, personally but I do appreciate that it would not be to everyones taste"

They teach you how to drink a beer (like that's hard). After that, you get a choice of pouring your own glass of beer (one drink), or having the bartender pour it for you (you get two drinks). Mind you, these aren't very large glasses either. While every employee at the Heineken Experience is extremely congenial (I think they're all college students), the bottom line is that there are a lot of other places to see in Amsterdam that are worthy of your tourist dollars/euros."

Theres an movie room where you see the process of making beer and they spray you with a bit of water and another room where you just watch Heineken commericals as well. Finally there's the last room where you cash your tickets for 2 beers. It really gets tiresome by the end and the nightclub vibe towards the end makes it feel a bit juvenile.

The view for drinking the beer is not nearly as nice as The Guinness Brewery in Dublin, but it was fun, and I am glad I did it!"

Then we entered big room with brewing boilers etc. which was much more interesting. Then a ride on Heineken Experience, tasting beer, some fun with recording videos, photos and sending them to our friends -> to the bar for free 2 glasses/person and my wife doesn't drink beer -> so 4 for me :) And we were through! Expensive shop at the end, but we got 10% discount as we played rock/scissors/paper online game for like 30min to finally win and get the discount.Then we also went to the Heineken shop in the city (very near Rembrandt square) as you get a free gift with bracelet from Heineken Museum. We got free Heineken Sunglasses, good enough.Compared to example Guinness brewery in Dublin it was not so entertaining, but still worth a visit of course!"

However, towards the end they came along and rushed us on, which seemed a bit unfair as the place was open for at least another hour, and we hadn't exactly been dawdling.The beers at the end were good and I was glad I did the tour, but it was nothing special really.The gimmick of giving you a token for a ferry ride to their shop in town or the option to walk and pick up a free gift there, is very clever.

If you've never visited a brewery before you'll learn a lot about the process, and it's presented in a really entertaining way. If you're interested in branding or advertising, they show you how the brand developed as well as lots of really interesting advertisements from over the years. You'll get three beers over the tour, one done as a tasting and the other two in a bar setting at the end. We hung out in the bar area for about an hour afterward chatting with people from all over the world. Neat LCD tables and the walls were constantly changing to scenes from different cities all over the world. We ended up getting a few extra beers just by being there for awhile, and the staff were fantastic too.There is also an opportunity to have a custom bottle made with your name on it, comes in a nice tube and makes a great souvenir or gift for your friends back home.Lots of fun!"

This was great value for money and it's a great idea to let you draught your own beer at the end! Well worth a visit!"

They recommend you to take a boat to the brand store to pick up the gift but if you have to wait for more than 20 minutes and it is not raining you might as well just walk there. Ask for directions at the information.Over all I think this is a great place to go to. I walked there from the train station and it was not too far to walk and it was definitely worth it going there.

Secondly, I thought entry prices would be reflective of the popularity of the brand, but it was only \u20ac15pps, which gave you entry and also two full pints at the end of the tour in a pretty nice bar, where noone tried to rush you on (if you wanted them of course), and a taster glass about half way through, when you were taught how to drink Heineken properly. Even for non-beer lovers, it was really informative in terms of how it's made, and the branding and history behind it.Also definitely an appropriate venue for all ages - there are points of interest for kids, teens and adults.Would recommend!"

Then the worst part of all -- a series of multimedia rooms that have nothing to do with Heineken except that the people in the media clips are holding Heineken bottles. I guess it's supposed to make you feel like drinking Heineken is a young, hip thing to do. After a couple minutes of this, I was quite annoyed. It's the kind of stuff I'd fast-forward through on tv. You do get 3 small glasses of beer during the tour (1 during a \"tasting class\" and 2 more at the end), and of course, you exit through the gift shop. All this for 17 euros. My advice? Spend your 17 euros at a nice pub instead and enjoy your Heineken (or whatever) in peace."

I love beer and wine tasting and this is a great way to get more education on the process as well as getting to taste the BEST Heineken you've ever had!! I'm now, a BIGGER fan of Heineken after my visit here. I'm going to Amsterdam again this year, and will spend about one week there, and this is DEFINITELY going to be in the agenda!!"

There's some information and history of the beer and brewery, a chance to taste the non-alcoholic beginnings of the beer, which is vile, and then you sample an actual beer, which has to be chugged back in a manly fashion, and not 'sipped like a girl'. There's also a fun interactive 'ride' where you become beer, virtual beer pulling and table football, which we played against another couple, and lost spectacularly to. Then at the end you get two more beers in the bar before you shuffle off to the gift shop. We loved it."

If you expect to know a little bit more on how to make a great beer like Heineken, don\u00b4t sail on this experience :-(We entered in the Heineken experience at 17:10 as we were told previously, the day before, it was the last visit of the day. (If you visit these atraction go after lunch as you will have to drink 3 beers :-)).The visit started with an introduction of the business family as it passed througt 4 generations since 1864 , staying now in Charlene de Carvalho (married to Michel de Carvalho-brasilian)Then they simple tell you about the four constituents of the beer, and passed to another room with some poor videos of some stages of the process.And apart of the imponence of the former brewery, as maintained some process equipments, the rest of the visit was very very poor. No one explained anything, and the young guy that accompanied us, was only worried of rushing ourselfs to the end, as it was approaching to his/ and everybodys leaving time.There were also several flashing bright rooms, but sincerely it was not at the level of the exquisite Heineken. We almost dind't had the time to take pictures ( as we heard \" we have to go, the bar is going to close\" that was the main speach). I suggest that employees should increase formation when relating to public, and to have time to see everything, i suggest non entrance after 16:00.The tasting of the beer it was ok, as there was a kute dutch girl that lived 3 months in Brasil, and speaked to us in portuguese /brazilian (can you believe that? impressive!!!) When leaving the Brewery there was a nice dutch guy we could coment on the visit, and actually he was delighted when we started to speak in Portuguese gastronomy (Sardines, pasteis de belem, portuguese red wine).On the next day , it was the 15 min. boat tour on the canal which saved the experience. a boat tour is always a great experience( the dutch have great luck) Tip- If you really decide to go, in the office where you buy the GVB card( ask for the free book which gives discounts in several amsterdam atractions) the final price will stay in 14 \u20ac/each entrance, comparing to the standard 17 \u20ac/each."

Admittedly it is a huge 3D advert for Heineken but it will make you appreciate beer a lot more. It is a bit pricey although comparable to other attractions in Amsterdam. However, there is always flyers about that will save you a couple euros, plus you get a couple drinks included. Also, ask in the shop about the free boat to the 'Brand store' where you can redeem the free gift token. It's a canal boat that departs opposite the Heineken Experience that will take you there. Please be aware that once you have visited the Heineken Experience, rode the Heineken boat and visited the Heineken Brand Store, you will have an overwhelming desire to only drink Heineken for the remainder of you stay in Amsterdam, or at least I did. The branding works, I guess. On a whole, the staff are very friendly and welcoming and make the whole (Heineken!) experience a good one."

It was a bit later in the day we went in Saterday afternoon. Probably a time to miss with hindsight as there was what seemed like a few stag groups which seemed to spoil a it a bit as well. The one bar area closed as we came to it and everybody then crammed into the one area. Too crammed for comfort while holding your 2 glasses of Heineken and we did seemed a bit rushed at the end. Also the free gift couldn't be claimed in the Gift shop at the end of the tour but you had to get on a boat for a trip to another store. Sorry but this seemed too commercial and made the tour seem like a glorified commercial, which it is really i know. This just put us off at the end and we left without purchasing anything from the shop and that is unusual with me in particular, especially a beer shop.

I wasn\u2019t expecting too much as I\u2019m more of a wine drinker than a beer drinker...He was very excited being the hardcore Heineken fan he is. Started off with putting our bags and coats away safely with the staff (free of charge) then took ourselves around the tour (no tour guide) to see the history and changes throughout Heinekens time. There were lots of things to read and look at with fun pictures to be taken along the way. There is a tasting session where you are taught how to enjoy the beer to its full potential. A fun little ride where you are turned into a Heineken beer yourself (ha-ha this made me laugh....NOT what I was expecting!) Then you arrive at the Heineken bar where you are able to order two Heineken beers free of charge. You then proceed to the gift shop where various things can be bought and personalised things can be made (I bought a bottle of beer with our names written on it...Kind of goofy but I like it) So all in all its a fun interesting trip NOT JUST FOR MEN but for women also! I had a really great time and would defiantly recommend it to anyone else going \u2013 took us around 2 hours to do the entire trip."

You can wonder around at your own pace, the staff were lovely and there is alot of entertainment set up for you to play with - pouring your own fake beer!! You can also pour a real beer and recieve a certificate and enjoy your beer after or go straight to the bar at the end of the tour and receive 2 beers. The gift shop is great - they have a staff member engraving heineken glasses, so you can get a personal message on a glass for a reasonable price. The tour is priced well for the experience. This is definitley not a boring experience!"

The place is really big so your tour can last as long as you want. Each room you can stay in awhile. They have a lot of fun things you can do like take a picture of yourself & send postcards by email, pretend your a DJ and spin, sing in a music video and more! You get a small sample where they ask you questions and if you get the right answer you get another free sample. After the whole tour you get to drink your two free beers in the bar area which is pretty cool. Also after that you can take a boat ride to another giftshop for a free gift. Now the gift was a keychain or something small like that BUT go for the boat ride!!"

I've been on many brewery tours and they're typically pretty boring. Heineken makes sure that you learn about the brewing process (water, hops, barley, yeast) while engaging visitors. The canal ride that's included was a nice extra and it kept us from having to pay more money to do something similar, but it's also rather quick and takes you to a branded store that was a waste of time."

You can (at extra cost) get a bottle of Heineken engraved with your name. You get to drink the beer. And at the end you get to spend lots of money on the Heineken products. Oh - and don't forget the free trip on a boat (takes 15 mins) to the Heineken brand shop to spend more money on Heineken goods. Is it a huge Heineken advert that you have to pay 17 euro for? Well yes - but I'm such a sucker for the Heineken name - I love it. Pity they didn't have the Heineken flip flops in my size - I really wanted them :("

The exhibtions include the equipment used to brew the beer, the shire horses used to pull the drays and a sort of bottleing plant. My favorite bits are the ride in which you get \"brewed\", the tasting and remember if you are asked what you are looking at then it's a \"Heineken\".

You do learn a bit about the beer making process which I found interesting. I would agree with reviewer Kris_from_Edm that it is very much \"a series of beer advertisements\" that you just paid 17 Euros to watch. You did get to sample a small glass of beer along the way as well as getting 2 more at the end of the tour. If you're a Heineken connoisseur (as I am) you'll still want to go there. I did like the free gift (Heineken bottle opener on a lanyard) that you can get if you go to the off site gift shop. They do provide the (canal boat) transportation which was pretty cool too.

The 'museum' is basically just a PR exhibit for Heineken - Why Heineken is great, the letter the founder wrote to his mother, etc, etc. The 'how beer is made' part was so cheesy that it was actually hilarious, something you'd expect at Disneyworld. The 'make your own beer' thing is really just an opportunity to have your name on a beer can.Yes, you get two free beers at the end, plus an additional small one in a 'tasting room', but that's really all the place has going for it.It's not worth the time."

We left laughing and happy (probably a little tipsy as well). This is a must see, must do.The beginning. Very friendly, happy, informative people checking you in. The ticket is a little pricey, I think it was 17 euros? But we did not mind as the guy told us it included a few beers, a boat ride at the end, and a free gift. We figured, 17 euros was worth it for the canal ride alone.We never expected what we encountered. Well, the first part was pretty normal. A funny little movie at the beginning which was v.v. cute. Then up some step reading lots of posters as we went up. Then, the brewery. Someone handing out tastings of I think it was the hops....we passed on that. All the machinery showing you how they make the beer. Then, the stables. We figured we were closed to being done at this point but not at all. After the stables, they had us queue up to go into these small rooms. We went in, they are mini movie theaters. Four of us in the first row, four in the second, etc. They were tiered up so everyone could see. The movie started and told us we were going to experience the beer making experience as if we were in the beer. It was wild....the floor started to move, they blew bubbles down on us...it was hilarious. We left that room and went into a room where you can sit and watch any and all commercial they have ever made.....some I had never seen and were quite funny (weird but in a funny way). Then several rooms of interactive games. You can be part of your own Heineken commercial and they will email it to you....v.v. funny. I forgot, they gave us a beer before we did this and told us how to drink it. After several rooms of interactive games, etc.....you come to the bar. There are two bars. It appeared the one was letting you pour your own. We went to the other one where they have pictures from all over the world in a video on the wall. When you put your beer (here they give you two more) down on the table, the table is a map of the world lit up. When you put your beer down, a coaster automatically appears. It just goes on and on with the silly fun. Then the gift shop. Then, the canal trip in the Heineken boat. About a 20 minute boat ride with a tour guide (you can also buy another beer!). The only down side is they drop you off in a neighborhood that was a little far from where we wanted to be...it is a nice neighborhood...but far from where we wanted to be. No worries, we just took the tram. They take you to their second gift shop at the end of the boat ride and the gift is a musical pen.....what else would you expect:). All in all, I would highly recommend and the boat ride was very relaxing and picturesque. They went beyond our expectations and we still laugh about it now....even when we watch the commercial we made!WELL DONE HEINEKEN!"

These are available at most hotels and there are even some discount tour operators on the way that will offer you a similar deal.After paying our cash we got a wqrist band that entitiled us to two beers and a free gift.

Whilst learning all about Heineken and it's history and how it's made, there are tour guides in each of the sections explaining things to you in detail, giving you master classes and answering questions. You get to taste the beer in it's different stages of being made and as well as a class in how to taste Heineken, you are also given 2 free tokens, which entitle you to 2 free drinks at the end. If you didn't want to have the drinks, you could exchange these in to have a class in pouring the perfect pint of Heineken, which includes a certificate. There is also a simulator type of ride and a cool lounge to relax in for a bit after you've had your tasting session. Overall, a really fun, interactive and informative experience.

There's plenty of history and interactive activities around the tour, plus a beer tasting and complimentary drinks at the end. After you've visited the museum you can use the Heineken canal boat to ride back to the city centre, which is good as it's a good 20minute walk from the main centre."

When purchasing our pricey tickets, the man asked where we were from and even told us what he knew of Ohio which was nice. We got to tour at our own pace, skipping things we didn't want to see and spending more time where we wanted. 2 small beers or 1 large are included, as well as a 'taste' that they show you how to drink. Our 'taste' was actually 2 additional small beers, so I think we got our money's worth by the end! There were many stations that were fun, including a photo area that was free to email to yourself, and a bottle personalizing area. I would recommend this 'experience'!"

So the beer tokens - you can exchange them for 2 beers at the service bar, or exchange them for 1 beer at the self service bar where they teach you how to draught a perfect Heineken. Half way through the exhabtion you get a glass of beer anyway. There are lots of interactive facilities throughout where you can pretend to be brewing beer, take picture with their logo background, sing in a silly music video etc. It's all a bit cheesy and silly, but as long as you went in there in a playful light-hearted mood, you will have fun. For those who have trouble letting their hair down, they might find it boring. My folks (in their 60s) and I had a good laugh, posing, singing, jumping and draughting a perfect (half) pint!"

Its a fairly middle of the road experience, there is no actual brewing going on there and there hasn't been for a long time. There is a short explanation of how beer is made and you get a brief history of Heineken but you do feel like they are trying to ram the brand down your throat. I particularly liked the cased 'advertisement of the year award' which looked impressive but when you looked closely had been awarded by a regional lions club branch! Also one of the Heineken family that is pictured everywhere looks like an evil version of Bobby Robson (imagine him as a cigar smoking bond villain) which was quite unnerving. Most of the building is dedicated to selling you Heineken, (there is a room done out like a nightclub that is just showing endless Heineken adverts etc) Which i suppose is what you would expect but I just felt it was slightly ott. You do get 2 beers and the end and also a small taster beer half way round which they use to explain why Heineken is so great. The best part of the trip for us was a free canal boat ride (complete with commentary) to the Heineken gift shop, which is located next to Rembrantplein which was next to our hotel, so saved us a 30 minute walk. Go if you like beer and fancy advertising, but i think there are better things to do in Amsterdam. We found quite a lot of reduced price admission tickets in hotel lobbies and on the side of those tourist maps which meant the entry price as 15 Euros so keep an eye out for those."

It was a lot of fun, though at 17 euros each, not cheap. But I would recommend it. The Heineken experience is a cross between Chocolate World at Hershey, Disneyworld, a brewery tour and a disco, all wrapped up in one. You start on a self-guided tour of the history of Heineken and its brand, which was interesting. Then you move into the old part of the brewery where they made beer until the 1980s and learn about how Heineken is made. Then there is a virtual ride where you are \"brewed\" into Heineken. This was actually fun. You stand in tiers in these 10m x 10m rooms that move and shake to correspond to what is happening to the beer in the movie being projected in front of you. Then, you exit into a tasting room where you are given a small beer (.25l probably) and learn how to taste the hops, barley and Type A yeast that make up Heineken. Then, you sit in a lounge and look at huge screens that show the latest (long versions) of Heineken commercials, can check out the new Heineken bottles under a black light, and relax in these futuristic couches and watch retro Heineken TV ads. Finally, you get to \"holy grail\" where you get two full sized Heinekens and hang out in a disco where you had the feeling that you were at an exclusive party. Finally, upon exiting you can take a free canal boat ride to Rembrantplein and receive a free gift at the Heineken product store. Though the free gift was cheesy (a squat little pen that plays music), the boat ride was fun. All in all, the Heineken Experience was more fun that I thought it would be, and I would recommend it if you like beer (and why would you be in Amsterdam if you didn't?) or if you are looking for an indoor activity with beer-drinkers."

Buy the tickets online, it saves you 2 \u20ac per person and you don't need to wait2. If you spend a certain amount in the store (we spent 14 \u20ac in two) they will give you a free ticket for a boat tour sponsored by Heineken (lasting 10 minutes) departing opposite the Heineken Experience building - nothing special, but it's free!3.

Even though we were there for it opening at 11am, we had to wait for 30 minutes as they only had one till open. I'd recommend booking your tickets in advance. The tour does what you expect; good explanation of Heineken family history, beer production process and tasting of great quality, very young beer. I had thought 50 euros was a bit much for the family tickets, particularly when they are trying to recruit you to drinking Heineken, but actually it felt like not bad value overall due to the surprise elements included. There is a simulator ride which takes you through the beer production process which is good fun. There are a number of interactive experiences which the kids enjoyed; making a video of themselves singing, photographs in different poses, table football, a floor that moves as you walk on it and a game where they acted as a DJ in a night club.

You can get through it pretty fast I finished the tour in less than half and hour and I asked a bunch of questions. So you can stay as long or short as you want if you want to skip the videos. I am not a big Heineken fan, in the states it has quite a bitter aftertaste but the Heiniken extra cold they serve at the end is really good. It is not a real functioning brewery but has a lot of the old machines and vats that they used to use. You go through a video explaining some of the history and then move on through different sections where they tell you about the beer making process and the ingredients involved. I can see how this may be dry and boring for some, I on the otherhand enjoy asking questions about that kind of stuff. There is a little ride that is just a short overview of how they make Hieneken and is just okay. After the ride you do a tasting where they show you how to correctly pour a Heineken and look for the subtle nuances in the foam and glass. After the tasting you get 2 more beers in the lounge from the extra cold tap where the beer comes out 0 degrees C and is served in chilled glasses. This is probably the best part and for those who don't use your tokens and are beer drinkers you probably waisted a half hour. I had fun and enjoyed the 3 beers not bad for the price. If you don't like beer or Heiniken it is proably not for you though."

Some college friends living or visiting here seem to be turned off by the price (15 euros) however, it includes a lot! The tour gives you 3 beers (1 small, 2 large) and a canal tour. bathroom and coat check is included. The whole thing is very modern and has a lot of entertaining things. One of my favorite rooms was a huge screen displaying all of the heineken commercials, and the ceiling was made of empty heineken bottles, it was cool! The beer was great, and staff was very friendly! Fun for all ages."

I don't recommend this because you save 1euro in the cost of the ticket, but more because it allows you to miss out the que at the ticket desk where the cashiers are about as much use as a chocolate fire guard. Me and my friend were stood in that que, in what appeared to feel like the same spot, for over half an hour whilst watching the people who has been online walk through the front door and straight in to the tour!Once your inside you are given a heineken wristband which entitles you to two half pints of heineken. This is called the virtual tour for a reason, not only because you are allowed to wander around so freely, sticking your head in big beer containers to look at whats going on inside and twisting nobs and levers every where, but also because this experience is about making you the beer and showing you how its made by cooking you, shaking you, spraying you with water and showering you in bubbles. I am sure by this point you have no idea what i am talking about but if you go, i promise you you'll think back to this review and think \"now i know what he meant\"!!! Dont worry you dont get wet!dotted around the museum are various tour guides explaining what your looking at, (perfect for me because i am not the accademic type, i don't like self managed learning, i would rater someone else explain it to me, or even better, show me whats happening). You even get a lesson on how to drink the perfect beer to maximize your enjoyment, Ladies i am gonna warn you now, you are not allowed to sip lol!!!a few novelty rooms made from bottles and a few \"boys toys\" gadgets like massive curved chairs you lie in and watch the built in tvs. Hell you can even star in your own heineken music video or tv advert! you can even add your name to a heineken label and buy a personalised beer. perfect souveniers!!!!this tour is done at your own pace, no rushing you through, well worth the money. treat yourselfFYI i hate larger and beer, still my favourite trip so far! perfect for adults and children!"

If you feel like you'll have missed out visiting Amsterdam without visiting this brewery, then by all means go -- we did have fun playing foosball and looking at some of the exhibits. However, it's really not worth going out of your way for the \"Heineken Experience.\" It's a pretty standard brewery tour, but the location isn't particularly cool (this is far less interesting than the Guiness brewery in Dublin). To make matters worse, at the end your only reward is a Heineken, which you'll drink in a basement room lined with TVs that display vistas from Hong Kong, Manhattan, Rio, and Paris. Why nothing from Amsterdam? I would probably have skipped this side trip looking back. For a fun and interesting brewery, visit Daas Haavle Man (sp) a few hours away in Bruges!"

I have been to Amsterdam 3 times, the first two times for some reason I thought it would be waste of money to visit Heineken Experience, however the last time I realized I have been mistaken. There are many interesting parts of the museum, where you can learn about beer production and also many activities Heineken sponsored. There is an interesting part where you can watch advertisement videos of Heineken starting from 50`s, it is really interesting to see it as it doesn\u2019t only reflect the history of Heineken but also the way the TV advertisements evolved. On top of all these, you get 2 glasses of beer in the bar and also a small glass of fresh beer. I would really recommend Heineken Experience to be visited if someone visits Amsterdam."

This tour attempted to be entertaining by removing any informative content about the brewing process whatsoever. We looked in some old brewing vessels, were interactively 'brewed' in a sound and light 'experience' (that word again) and given advice on how to 'taste' Heineken. Finally we were shepherded into a bar for our two complimentary drinks. This bar had music, and fusball tables. As I said great if you are twelve. But then you can't sample the product. In my opinion this was more about the Heineken 'Brand' than it was about informing. Maybe I was being told you're just too old for Heineken. That would make a great strap line for someone else - 'Drink XYZ cos you're too old for Heineken!!'"

Their advertising has been unique throuhgout the past decades but very little attention went to this.

After enjoying a Heineken at every meal while I was in Amsterdam, it only made sense to go see how the number one imported beer in America is made.Even if you are not a beer drinker, like my wife, you can still have an enjoyable time at the Heineken Experience (Discount in the I Amsterdam booklet). The entire brewery is very accessible for English speakers since English is the only language (I recall seeing) in the experience. All presentations are done in perfect no accent English (how do the Dutch do it?). You can purchase a number of fun Heineken souvenirs, bottle you own bottle, and don't forget the two Heineken Extra Colds at the end (cola for the kids). I've never done the Guinness tour, but I've heard this Heineken one is better. If you are stopping in Belgium during your trip through Amsterdam, stop by a Belgian brewery and compare how the smaller houses do it compared to the giants like Heineken."

Also nice and warm when its raining and windy outside!Great value for money!Tip: go earlier in the day for a quieter experience and no cues. Also it costs 16euro on the door but 15euro from the 'Tickets and Tours' for anyone who is desperate for a bargain!"

We were told about the ingredients of beer which was not as riveting. We were told how drink beer from the smallest beer glass I have seen. By the end of tour each person receives 2 small beers(middies) and a small one.  \u20ac32 for two to enter and 2 and a 1/2 drinks you get, the Heineken experience was disappointing and can definitely be missed on your trip Amsterdam."

Tour includes quite a few really funny moments :) At first place, 16 EUR seemed as little overpriced, but it include two buttons which can be exchanged for either two beers at bar so value is better. Alternatively, instead of ordering two beers you can draught your own - but you'll only get one beer. That's what I opted for and I don't regret it. You can drink beer at any time, but to draught your own? Plus, you'll get certificate :)"

This \"tour\" provides a great history and insight into how the brewery got it start in the 1860s and how the product is made start to finish. I was most impressed with the philanthropy the Heineken family has engaged in since the brewery's inception. They were the first brewery to offer a retirement plan for their employees and when times were tough, they never layed off any emplyee. Instead, they offered early retirement options. The interactive nature of this tour is a great deal of fun and you even get a chance to enjoy the freshest Heineken you will every have in your life. I highly recommend the Heineken Experience."

It is a nice display of company history and the processes that take place to deliver one of the best known beers in the world. We have really enjoyed the brewing facilities with its original copper tanks and the opportunity to taste malted barley. That part of the tour is pretty cool.Rest of the tour is pretty average, lounge with what appears to be a Heineken commercials and some kind of interactive UN-entertaining lounge chairs. Beer tasting takes place later and I have to say that the performance of the instructors varies greatly and is quite inconsistent.(I have visited Heineken experience in the past)Every visitor gets 2 beers at the end of the tour, could be more if you ask me. The reason I am giving this excursion only 3 out of 5 is the bar area at the end of the tour. I was under impression that the quality of the beer is correlated to the cleanliness of the area it is served in and that bar was a disaster. Beer everywhere from the bottom to the bar counter. We have picked one of the later times to visit and the bar was in terrible condition. You can literally stick to the floor and I would not recommend leaning on any surface in the bar. Is it too much trouble to mop the floor and wipe the counters couple of times a day? Last part of the tour is the gift shop where the prices are pretty steep. I couldn't quite understand how can they charge so much for souvenirs with Heineken logo on it and items they usually just give away , when they should be the ones paying the customers to advertize their products. Overall interesting, a bit overpriced entrance (15 EUR online, 16 EUR cash) and very expensive gift shop."

At first it might seem a little slow (although still interesting), explaining the Heineken history and the brand evolution over time. You get to try or smell a few beer ingredients, you get to help the brewer, and so on. There's a very cool simulator called \"Brew you ride: be the beer\", there's an area to take funny heineken-related pictures (and even email them to your friends for free), there are a few lounges/chill-out areas... and in the very end, there's a bar where you get your 2nd and 3rd beer (or even soda, if you're not a beer fan).Allow 1.5 hours or even 2, to fully enjoy the \"experience\" without any rush."

Then, you are shown the old factory, informed about the ingredients of the beer, and a detailed view of how it is produced. There is also a 4D movie included where you can feel like you are actually brewed and bottled like a beer bottle.

It is only about a scene, but you don't see the beer making process in life. The tour was only oriented to sell the \"Heineken\" brand and to make you wish drinking a Heineken. So we could only think in having it finished as soon as possible and go for our Heinekens, which is quite stupid because you can get them much cheaper in any bar of the city.All in all, good if you don't have anything better to do."

We went to other much better attractions and museums for far less money. Don't be lured in. In fact we were so cross with ourselves for wasting all that money when we came out, that it has put us off Heineken."

The day we went they had trouble with one of the exhibits which meant that everyone waited in line for 1 hour with no air conditioner. People asked for their money back as they wanted to leave, but the manager on duty (an idiot with a waxed mustache) ended up making a bad situation worse, people were yelling, it was embarrassingly bad. A special warning to students given the price/value, spend your money on anything else. If you want to mwatch an ad for 45 minutes then be sold 2 beers for $23 to say you've been there, go ahead....but it's the least cool thing you'll do in Amsterdam"

You get to sample the beer firs on a room (small glasses) where the beer properties are explained, but at the end you get to a very big area that is set up like a nightclub where you can exchange two pins that are given with your access wristband. Visiting with 20 people were we all are friends, makes this a really fun experience. There is a music, lots of beer and a very fun atmosphere.It's something not to miss while in Amsterdam."

It was my first experince in beer factory and I took a great pleasure and learned how they make the beer. Also All of the information was well-presented and very interesting.We were surprised when we were bottled in the factory...Now I have 2 bottles with my name EROL.If you go to Holland dont forget to visit 3 places.First go to red light street.2 go to Heneken beer and take the tour about 2 hours Im sure you will thank me.And finally go the Madamme Tusseaud museum"

We found a discount card in our hotel's 'tourist information' area, giving us a 5% discount. I loved the old brewery with its huge shiny coppers, and the stained glass windows and other old artefacts, as well as the stables with the horses and horse drawn drays, which still get used (mainly for adveritising). The brewing process and history of Heineken were explained in a very informative way. There was no pretence that the beer is brewed in the same way today - the girl who told us about the ingredients used and the brewing process was quite clear in telling us it was now made at a large factory outside of Amsterdam.One great advantage was the fact that it was 'self-guided', which meant you could spend as long as you liked looking at things, or just walk past those that didn't really interest you - in our case the 'music video'. We did send an e-mail home though, which was free to do. I'm not sure which 20+ video one poster didn't like - I don't recall anything that was compulsory viewingBrewery tours usually involve you having to follow someone around and listen to their explanations, here you could read and take it in at your own pace. (Information is in English).The fact that you get 3 beers (one during the tour, when you get to look at the beer for colour etc, and 2 in the bar at the end) make it worthwhile - if you like beer of course. There are soft drinks available for those who don't drink or those under 18.Yes, there is a shop at the end of the tour, but every museum and 'tourist attraction' has a shop, why would this one be any different? You don't have to buy anything, just walk straight through!!One reviewer commented on the distance from other 'attractions' in Amsterdam. The simple answer is - get a one day tram card, or longer! There is far more to Amsterdam than Rijksmuseum etc, but thats for another posting I think!"

A friend recommended this tour but unfortunately we cannot say the same. It was so very, very disappointing. While we thought going to the actual premises would bring us a thoughtful, historical tour, instead it was a self guided marketing failure. You wales through rooms where you you could make Heineken music videos or DJ. It was very long and you are forced to sit through a terrible 20+ minute video. Then, when you get to the tasting room, you feel like you were walking in a night club with very loud and obnoxious music. Yet, this was not the worst part-the worst part was being harassed by two marketing people from Heineken. They plead with you to take their questionnaire, indicating it will only take a couple of moments. This is a lie-they took my husband away for 35 minutes into a back room while they made me wait alone in the \"night club\". It was terrible-do not do this!!!! Overall, I would not recommend this tour to anyone that is serious about beer. Terrible!!"

The reality is that it is a relentless marketing push, for which you pay a premium price.The \"experience\" starts off with a brief history of the Heineken brewery, family and beer. You then go on to learn a bit about the production of the beer, before getting the chance to wander through the former brewhouse. After this, there is a \"4D\" experience giving the visitor a chance to be \"brewed\" before you head on to various opportunities to design bottles, t-shirts etc at an extra charge. The tour ends with a couple of cold Heinekens at the nightclub-esque bar.The positives: The staff are EXCELLENT. The people you interact with for the tasting, taking you through the brewing process do a truly fantastic job. They were enthusiastic, genuine and really added a lot to the experience. The tasting session was good fun and of course, the beers at the end were much appreciated!The negatives: The marketing is relentless. The whole thing feels so much like an advert, it's hard to take in anything without a pinch of salt. The final part of the \"experience\" is purely about selling extras, which after having spent a fair bit of cash to get in, wasn't particularly welcome. If you're a beer afficionado already, this place won't teach you anything new.All in all, it was a reasonable way to spend an hour or so, but didn't really justify the cost. Although the staff were excellent, the detail of the exhibits wasn't really enough to occupy someone who already has a good knowledge of beer and brewing."

In my experience, Heineken gives you the best bang for your buck\u2026 and you get free beer at the end! It doesn't get better than that. I have been to other brewery tours in other countries, but no matter how good they have been, none have topped the Heineken Experience. I don't even prefer to drink Heineken, so this is not a biased review. The information about how they make their beer and also about the history of the company was well presented. I also enjoyed watching some of the old commercials. No need to go on and on. If you decide to go, I feel you will be satisfied by the time you exit the Experience."

Went in February 2009, amidst mass renovation and street works \u2013 the \u2018experience\u2019 was fully open at the time, but unfortunately the horses were not \u2018home\u2019, because they couldn\u2019t go about their daily delivery business due to the local roadworks (this has now been rectified, and I saw the horses out and about during a later trip).The entrance fee is on the expensive side (15Eur at my last count, with no consolatory discount for the lack of horses), and the tour is entirely self-guided. Whilst this means that you can quite happily wander around at your own pace, it also means that many sections are boring \u2013 consisting only of Heineken advertisements throughout the ages, for example.There\u2019s a little \u2018ride\u2019 (if it can be called that!) towards the end, where you take a virtual tour of the Heineken bottling/brewing process. Mildly amusing at best. At the very end, you\u2019re treated to up to two \u00bd pints of Heineken, whilst staff talk some more about the brand. Nice treat, but not really the best environment in which to chill with a beer.We treated ourselves to a commemorative bottle of Heineken on which we printed our own label, which we considered to be reasonably/moderately priced at 5Eur. The Heineken Experience is definitely something you\u2019ll only do once \u2013 though you\u2019re not missing out on much if you don\u2019t do it at all!"

U get a wristband with two buttons clipped on. Thats what u claim ur beer with. Then off u go. I spent about 2 hours in the place cause there is so much to see AND do! U check out how beer is made, the history of heineken animated behind a bar, tons of memorabiloa froms years ago, an interactive room to dj and party away, a room where u can make a music video in dutch, a 4D ride experience of being brewed, a video feedback place and also the videos or mails u compose at the interactive room can be emailed to you. There is also a place where u learn how to taste beer n check out its quality. In the final place of the experience is where u get ur beer and drink up. Nice place to chat with frienda or other travellers. Then there is the souvenier store. I get magnets as always. I suggest not to go in the morning especially if u cant handle ur drinks.

I'm not particularly interested in the process of beer making and I feel no brand loyalty to Heineken, so I did question why exactly I was going to this place. I left feeling like a bit of a Heineken convert, so I guess in terms of indoctrination it did its job superbly.It is more than that though, and worth a visit even if like me, you didn't realise you cared how the beer gets in the bottle. There are plenty of interactive exhibits and demonstrations as well as a chill out room where you sit back in the darkness and get bombarded with positive Heineken images to a laid back techno soundtrack. It all ends in a bar where you get to stand and discuss your Heineken \"experience\" over a few free drinks. You can even record your own appalling music video and have it displayed on the Heineken website.There is masses of merchandise and you can create your own personalised beer bottle for a price.It's all very slick and well presented. I came away feeling slightly empty but I can't deny it was enjoyable on the whole."

Perhaps because we went to the Guinness Warehouse in Dublin last year, we didn't expect something very different. In fact it was slightly less dynamic than Guinness if we really had to compare. We followed the routes and saw the different stages involved in the process. We were taken to \"experience\" the brewing process by standing on a platform which swings and moves according to different stages. And of course, we got two glasses of free Heineken at the end!We bought a Holland Pass which entitles use to visit seven attractions and we chose Heineken Experience.

They're almost all young, stoner-type American kids in Amsterdam for the pot (per our cashier Matthew.)At every turn, they were yelling for everyone to leave each section of the tour. The worst part of the experience was the bar where you get your two free drinks. It took forever and it seemed like there were people that had been there drinking all day. The floor obviously hadn't been cleaned all day and the staff was in there yelling for everyone to leave.This made the \"Heineken Experience\" annoying. I was expecting a more laid-back atmosphere. I'd probably try to go earlier, but beware the long lines. Try to order your tickets in advance.Also, if you buy the IAmsterdam card, you get 25% off...so tickets are only 11.25\u20ac."

The Heineken Experience is a great place to visit - so long as you like beer (which fortunately, I do!).The first part is a self guided tour, taking you through the history of the Heineken brewing company, then it's very quickly onto more about the actual beer.From here on, it's very much an interactive tour - there's an introduction and opportunity to taste the constituent elements (trust them on the hops!), freedom to wander round the old copper brewing vats and then onto their \"4D Brew You\" guide to brewing, which is great fun! You're taught how to pour a perfect glass of Heineken, how to taste, and more about the current/future exploits of the Heineken company. At the end, there's a chance to sit in their lively bar and enjoy your two drinks included in the cost - more Heineken of course!There's also an opportunity to have a personalised bottle printed, as well as glasses engraved in the gift shop at the end.All in all, well worth a visit. I found it very informative and the whole process of brewing was very well explained in an intersting and engaging way.It's \u20ac15 for adults, which may sound quite a bit, but that does include two and a half drinks, which are pricey wherever you go."

But before that, you learn all the manufacturing process and tips on how to take beer off the keg, for example. Another interesting thing is the video recorder: you can record a video clip, singing typical Netherlands' songs (of course you're not really singing, just trying to follow the subtitles on the screen) with a cheesy background, and send it to a friend by e-mail.

I'll admit my perception of the Heineken Experience is a little skewed because I'm in the marketing industry - so experiencing an incredibly richly branded museum like this was more fascinating than anything. I'm not a beer drinker, but my boyfriend's favourite brew is Heineken, so there was no way we were passing this up anyway. What's interesting though, is that despite not being a beer drinker, coming out of the museum made me feel stronger brand loyalty to Heineken. Again, fascinating from that perspective...That being said, there is still plenty to entertain the average person that's a little sick and tired of reading plaques next to paintings. Although there are a number of gallery-type areas featuring facts about Heineken or showcasing the evolution of the brand's image, there are also plenty of interactive elements. You can hop on a 'virtual ride' that moves as you simulate the journey a Heineken bottle takes. There's a gallery that lets you sing hilarious karaoke and take a photo ecard to send to friends and family. Another area showcases a number of modern Heineken branded experiences - including a DJ booth and a drum set made of kegs. Speaking of kegs, you also get to see a simulated brewery, and where the famed Heineken ponies spend their nights (and if you're lucky you'll catch a glimpse of them). The museum ends in a brainwashing room (seriously) where you lie in a comfy chair and cycle through dozens of Heineken ads throughout the years. When I went on the tour a couple of years ago, it was 10-15 euros (honestly can't remember) and you received three half-pints of beer (or a beverage of your choice) and a bottle opener housed in a mock Heineken bottle case - not a bad deal for a couple of hours of entertainment and a break from mundane history."

I'm not a beer drinker but my boyfriend is, and having never been to a brewery before I thought I might as well take the chance to get to learn a bit about beer. If this is what you want too, I expect almost any brewery would be better than this one. It was the second most expensive attraction we visited in Amsterdam (after the zoo) and for what? Firstly a fifteen minute queue - we hardly encountered queues elsewhere. You then amble around the tour at your own pace which doesn't make too much sense with the way things are organised. The first \"talk\" is actually a video, so that's okay because you can leave when it gets to the part you came in at. But you then receive three talks from guides, who do their best to stay coherent while some visitors pay attention, others stand and chat over them, and others push their way past to the next section. The guides had presumably been instructed to keep things lighthearted so I didn't get to learn about beermaking in the depth I had hoped. Another disappointment was that I had hoped to meet the dray horses but we were offered only a brief glimpse of their stables and no chance to get close.The branding message was a strong one, we were repeatedly told how unique and groundbreaking Heineken was and is, but not specifically why. After the brief history of the brand and the also brief discussion of the brewing method, the rest of the museum was unashamedly just advertising. You can sit in a comfy chair and watch Heineken adverts or scenes from films which feature the brand, in case you have never done this at home. One thing to think about was the fact that everything in the tour was in English. Clearly they do not expect the natives to be gullible enough to visit.You receive tokens to exchange for two 0.2l beers at the end of the tour, plus you get a smaller glass for tasting about half way round, so about a pint in total. Considering you can buy Heineken at more or less any bar around town, you can therefore not use the free drinks to justify the currently \u20ac15 entry price.My boyfriend, who likes Heineken as much as he does the next ordinary European lager, is adding it to his \"Would rather not drink\" list as a consequence of this uninspiring \"Experience\"."

You're guided through Heineken's history and the brewing process. You get to view the original, copper brewing equipment and experience your first sample of \"Wort\" -- no alcohol yet! You're guided to an optional \"ride\" which is a short, cheesy, but fun interactive video.A tasting and 2 free beers come with admission. You have the opportunity to send short videos to family/friends with a Heineken Cam for free. For 5 euro you can personalize a bottle of your very own Heineken!Overall, it was an enjoyable experience - but keep in mind that you'll be subject to clever advertising and corporate spin. Take it for what it is - learn about a significant company of Holland and enjoy the beer!"

The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming.15 EUR isnt a bad price for the attraction because you get a heineken beer in the tasting room and two in the bar at the end! The attraction is informative starting out with the history of the company then going on to ingredients and how the beer is made we had a talk by a member of staff which was very interesting about what goes into the beer, why they give you small servings and a layer of foam I learnt something! The brew you ride is simple but aimed at younger people, it was funny though. there is a section where you can watch all the adverts through the ages which was good too. The bar section at the end was not too crowded and they have interactive tables which was exciting! There is a lot more things throughout the attraction aswell this is just a brief overview.I would reccomend this attraction if you are looking for something a bit more lighthearted and fun for the afternoon, I would also reccomended if you like heineken too. 15 EUR sounds like a lot, but competitive compared to a lot of the attractions in the area and you can put your coat/bags in their cloackroom for free which is also nice, you can also take photos all the way through the attraction!!"

It includes a little of everything: the history of the company, how the beer is produced, a tour around the old brewery, horses (!), some digital tricks, football etc. etc. Enough activities to spend some 90 minutes there.There is one problem though. It is the corporate world, so of course all the presentations are about Heineken . Heineken this, Heineken that, the great and charming Freddy Heineken, the beautiful and dynamic Charlene Carvalho Heineken ... It is so excessive that at the end you are willing to curse them. But, as a matter of fact, it couldn't be different. What would you do if you were the Heineken guy preparing a presentation for your company?Anyway, I respect their work and their ideas and give them four stars.The ticket is 15 euros per person. According to my humble opinion, it should be lower. It is funny, but you pay less for Van Gogh Museum which is closeby.And of course, dont go there to get drunk! They offer you only TWO (2) glasses of this divine liquid. Count them: DEUX, DOS, DYO, DUE, ZWEI! Probably rightfully so. Imagine a bunch of drunk guys shouting, annoying and vomiting around.

We thought it would be fun to learn more about beer brewing and the history of Heineken and did expect the experience to be very Heineken-focused and biased, so really didn\u2019t have the highest expectations. Still we were both a bit disappointed with the whole experience, it was OK \u2013 nothing more.It\u2019s well thought out, it's fun and interesting enough, staff is really friendly, but it really isn\u2019t worth the \u20ac15 entrance. The place is just one big celebration of Heineken, their products, the company, the founder etc. It's just too much to have to read: \"The founder of Heineken, always thinking about his employees first, arranged an early pension scheme during economic crisis in 19XX, so he didn\u2019t have to lay off employees\u201d. How very nice of him, he was such a good man, but at that point you start feeling a bit nauseated (and you haven't even tasted the beer yet).Our problem wasn\u2019t really the poor value for money. The entrance fee was too high - yes - even with the three tiny beers included (and we didn\u2019t receive a free gift as someone mentioned in their review, I think they\u2019ve scrapped that bit). It\u2019s was more the principle that you really shouldn't pay to be exposed to one long Heineken promotion - which in essence is what this place is. It should be free or at least very inexpensive, as the value of having my attention (as consumer) focused on one brand for 1-2 hours is priceless for Heineken. Hey... they should be paying me! Had they added more information on beer brewing in general, how the yeast creates carbon dioxide etc. and showed how the beer is brewed (as they did earlier), it would become a more balanced experience that I'd be willing to pay for. They do mention the process briefly, but it is too superficial. It is not closed for renovation anymore, as it says here on Tripadvisor."

There wasn't much to see anyway. We then waited in line for 15 minutes for a ridiculous motion ride. I don't even know why they bothered with this. We were only laughing at how stupid it was. We were then ushered into a room with a couple of annoying bartenders to serve us a beer, which we had to admire and smell before we could drink. After this, we went to the last bit, where we had another glass of beer. This place was overly crowded, and there was nowhere to sit, and barely room to stand.

You can then see the brewing process and taste pure hops.Then you 'become a bottle of Heineken', by standing on a juddering platform and watching a odd video featuring a English bloke. Even though the H.E. only just re-opened one of the platforms was already broken!Then you get a mini beer to drink and go in to a weird room of 'pop videos' you can 'star' in. Then there is a room of music and visuals of nothing much, chairs where you can watch decades of Heineken adverts and posters. Finally you get a half of Heiniken in a room with about three seats.Over all we felt this was a bit of a waste of time and money, you hardly know anything more about the beer or brewing after it and it all really feels like they are selling Heineken to you throughtout and nothing much more."

Apparently it is supposed to be open 'this summer' but with summer upon us it is still not open. We spoke to a staff member inside the Heineken building who said that he thinks it may be open by September 2008, but he gave the vibe that it may even not happen by then. This is obviously something that has gone way beyond the anticipated timeline, but to the disappointment of many tourists I'm sure. It's still something on my list to do because I've heard that it is great, but it will have to wait until my next (if ever) visit to Amsterdam."

I expected a small tour, a little taste and then to be shuffled out the door. Not so. There is a self guided tour that goes over the history of the beer. Old posters. You visit the brewing kettle room, those things are massive. In the middle is a quaint bar where you can get a sample (you get three samples each with your entry fee). After that, they have some interactive areas. Take the time to make a video and send it to your friends - lots of fun. There is also a strange room with pod type beds where you can lay down and look at old commercials - fun as well. Overall, a great time. We actually took the time to visit the gift shop and speak to some of the employees. The ones that we spoke to said it was a great place to work and they had lots of fun. They seemed proud of their company and wanted us to know it. A refreshing change from some of the other tour spots we have visited."

It is clearly set up as a display for Heineken promotion, but is so well designed that one doesn't mind paying to go to their commercial.When you enter, you are exposed to recreated streets and shops where you might be expected to drink their beer. It is very well put together.As you progress, you are invited into a tiny theater. When you enter, you find a small room with metal bars to lean against, not expecting anything but a commercial film, but when the film starts, the floor starts moving, and you are subjected to what it must feel like to be a bottle and moving through the bottling process at the brewery. It is so cleverly put together with the floor moving in all directions as the bottle moves down the line, that it becomes a fun experience.From the movie, you proceed through a number of displays. They are in a spotless environment with huge polished copper vats, and you are free to wander. After you leave this area, you enter an area where friendly bartenders give you a beer or soft drink.Pushing on, you go through more exhibits, including a surreal area where you can watch Heineken commercials. Eventually you wind up in another place where you can have two more beers or soft drinks. The bartenders are just as congenial at this gathering hole.Of course you have the opportunity to purchase Heineken things like shirts or glasses and other items. When you leave, each person receives a nice bottle opener as a souvenir.The Heineken experience is a fun time for adults and when you consider the price of everything else in the Netherlands, it is a real bargain."

On entry you get four different coloured tokens that you exchange as you go round.The first part of the self-paced tour takes you through the rooms of the old factory, and introduces you to the Heineken family, and the process of brewing. Information was presented in English, as well as other languages.There is an amusing attraction half way round in which you go into a smallish room with a screen, and you get to feel what it is like being a bottle on the conveyor belt. It made us chuckle.Shortly after this, there is a mid-way bar where you exchange one token for a drink of Heineken \u2013 there was also Pepsi, Fizzy Orange or water for non-beer drinkers.Towards the end of the experience, there are a few other stand-alone attractions. One seemed to be a small simulator ride where you were driving a horse-drawn carriage through the streets. Another was something curious with music and a DJ, and a third had people lying on space-age style seats looking up at screens. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t try any of these final things, since the queues were building up (or, in the case of the DJ thing, we didn\u2019t understand what was meant to happen, and were a bit wary of getting involved with something that might embarrass us!).The end of the tour leads you to the gift shop, and the final bar where you can exchange two tokens for drinks, and then back to the entrance foyer where your last token is exchanged for a nice souvenir gift.We were probably in here for 70 minutes, or so, but could have stayed longer if we experienced the three separate attractions towards the end. We would have liked to have seen the Heineken horses up closer \u2013 the only time you see them is through a window, looking down on their stable \u2013 but this aside, we recommend this as a good value, fun visit."

Both me and my boyfriend loved it there!LOCATION: It is a bit out of the main part of Amsterdam, situated in Heinekenplein. You could walk there, but it could take a while - we just took the tram from Centraal Station (Tram 16, 24 or 25) to Heinekenplein - you can't miss when to get off, just stand on the left side of the tram and you'll see a large building marked HEINEKEN BROUERY. OPENING: June, July and August: Mondays through Sundays, 11.00 - 19.00 hrs. Last ticket sales: 17.45 hrs. September, October: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10.00 - 18.00 hrs. Last ticket Sales: 17.00hrs.COST: 11E to get in - and we think it's well worth it, as you get 3 tokens each for 3 drinks at the 2 bars there - they're Amsterdam sized drinks so hey, they're free! If you don't drink beer there's soft drinks available too. You get a free gift at the exit - but I won't spoil the suprise. We were pretty pleased with ours. MUSEUM: The first part is all about the history of the beer and what goes into making it, and so forth - this was quite interesting, but not the most interesting. You can enter a room where they used to make the beer, as well as numerous other attractions such as assuming the role of a Heineken bottle which is quite fun, a virtual ride on the Heineken Horses, you can 'DJ', and various other interactive bits - even a bout of karaoke where you appear in your own video, and it was fun watching other people do it. We loved these bits! You can send emails home to your friends, video messages, make them jealous that you're in Amsterdam and they're not!You tour the museum yourself at your own pace, as fast or slow as you like. We went quite early in the day and there were no crowds at all. We spent about 2 hours here I think, doing the tour, the interactives, the bars and then the gift shop. The gift shop at the end is great and quite cheap so we were suprised. 5E for a massive Heineken glass tankard - bargain!! VALUE: 5/5HEADLINER?: 4/5 - It should be!FUN FACTOR: 5/5OVERALL: 5/5WOULD WE RETURN? Do we like beer and free stuff? (The answer is yes!)Have a look at my photos and see for yourself!"

Some are fun, some are interesting. Their is plenty to see and do. Even a couple of 'rides' that show the life of a bottle of beer and one on a hors and cart ride through the city! Plenty to see and do. The first bar you get a half which is incredibly refreshing and nice and cold. Their is a shop with plenty of gifts available for decent prices and noce are tacky. The place has a definite advertising aim but who cares?! Its fun and free beer! You finish in a nice bar where you recieve two more small beers and the Long Neck if you made the H sign with your hand. We spent nearly an hour in here, beside the seats their is an interactive map on the wall that has touch screen technology showing the sites and attractions in Amsterdam. You then move on and recieve your free gift which originally a glass in a presentation box but has now been replaced by a Heineken bottle made of tin that opens in half revealing a bottle opener! Cool!Overall, we had a fantastic time and will return. You can't beat paying 10 euros and recieving 4 free drinks, a free gift and as much time as you wish in a museum! Superb!"

You enter the attraction and follow the signs and numbered items along the way. After a while you come across the 'bottle ride' which is a small platform for 20 ish people where you face a large screen and you are jigged around on the platform while a video of the bottle line plays, the idea being you feel like a Heineken bottle on its journey to being filled (fun). After this you move to the first bar where you can have you can have your first beer. After this bar you continue to the next section and a further ride that takes the form of a beer delivery dray where you sit in 4 seater replica traps and watch a video of horses delivering beer around Amsterdam, again being jigged around (also fun). Next stop is the final bar area and shop. 2 beers are served here. When you exit the attraction the final token is exchanged for a 'gift' which is a nicely packed 250ml Heineken glass as a souvenir.....VFM (value for money).If you would also like to see the canals of Amsterdam after a visit here, it might be wise to book with the cruise company across the road from the Heineken Brewery as they are far less busy than the mor centrally located companies, and you see exactly the same canals on a 1-1 1/4 hr tour."

It took us two tries to get on it. I recommend getting there early - about 1 hour before the tour starts. There was a cafe across the street where you could watch for the line to start forming and have a cup of coffee. At the end of the tour they give you all the Heineken you can drink.

Afterwards you can cross the bridge back towards Leidsplein and there will be a Carousel Pancake house - AWSOME Bacon Pancakes. They do Bacon and pancakes different than in America. They cook a couple of strips of bacon and then pour about an 18 inch wide pancake on top of the bacon slices. After getting that early morning buzz the pancakes were excellent."
