Very pretty, even in the fall: leaves starting to change, but flowers still in full bloom and gardens looking terrific. Fountains still working too. We made sure to have visited a local boulangerie and corner store 1st so we had the makings of a picnic including a little wine. Very lovely. The sculptures are fantastic, especially the statue of Liberty and the Zadkine (his museum is near by) and the deer family and the lion. Too many to list. A lovely afternoon!"

We walked around the park. It is quite large for a city park. The flowers that were blooming were beautiful. A lot of runners, strollers and families pick nicking."

My co-travelers and I hung out there and ate sandwiches from Brioche Dor\u00e9e across Boulevard San-Michelle just outside the gates of the park. In college I studied at the Sorbonne and my classmates and I spent many afternoons between classes studying and relaxing in the wonderful and surprisingly comfortable green metal chairs in the park. Last spring, when my husband and I traveled to Paris for his first visit, we picked up sandwiches (the same ones I loved 20 years before) at Brioche Dor\u00e9e and ensconced ourselves in the park for several very restful hours. It was so beautiful and restful and the spring flowers were amazingly beautiful."

They were pretty in many respects, however, I believe there are many gardens in Paris that I enjoyed more......Jardin de Plants, Park Monceau, Tuileries, etc. We were there during lunch and were amazed to see about 25 men and women in business attire playing petangue on their lunch hour. We even observed an instruction class with a woman as the instructor. The fountain was one of the prettiest sights."

The park is relatively big and has a wonderful central area with the lawn, flowers and a fountain, but if you go away from that area - there is not much, just passages between trees. So don't plan to spend much time there. Of course, it is my opinion. i still wonder what can they show you for such an expensive walking tour, maybe there is something i missed"

I had found out there was going to be a concert in the park on a Sunday afternoon, so we bought some wine, olives, grapes, cheese, and some sandwiches. Brought them to the park and sat on a bench and enjoyed the view and people watching. It was so much fun. Then later there was an band that played music in the park. It was so cool to see how relaxed it was with kids running up to and on the stage, the conductor stopping to talk with the kids, it was a family event. Filled our hearts with JOY! Just plane cool. If you go to Paris, check for the free concerts on a sign in the park. Pack a lunch bring some wine and enjoy the day walking around the park people watching and the music."

Otherwise the gardens and the children's playground are well worth the visit. If you have kids to 2-11 I would recommend The enclosed playground. There's a small fee but it's completely worth it, and it has an inc toilet which with kids is helpful."

The competitive ambience was intense for a, seemingly, light affair! It was great to watch for a while. Then we walked through these beautiful gardens and noticed a band setting up on a rotunda. We found a seat and waited. This band was a jazz swing band who were just fantastic. Really high quality... Wish I knew who they were. Overall, the gardens are a must-do in my books!"

One of my greatest pleasures in life is to take the metro to the Vavin station for a meal at the legendary La Coupole (Fantastically ordinary traditional comfort foods), then cross the street and walk up Rue Brea then Rue Vavin to the Jardin de Luxembourg, then stroll through the grounds up that huge Grand Bassin where all the little boys of my childhood would sail their rented toy bateaux \u00e0 voile, then up north towards the Place de l'Od\u00e9on, then towards the St. Sulpice area, then up towards Saint Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. Paris has changed so much in atmosphere. As much as I do not want it to remain a museum city {Paris needs desperately to reinvent itself to compete with NYC and London, as well as all other exciting modern metropolitans), it is good to have this quaint connection to the past, through this majestic Jardin de Luxembourg, with great architecture, landscaping, and regal statues lining the grand walkways."

It was hot, and I wasn't ready to jump into any hard core tourist sites. The Luxembourg Garden was right around the corner from my hotel. What a gift. The garden is part of a palace built in the early 1600's by Marie de' Medici, the widow of King Henry IV of France, and today this is where the French Senate meets. There is a lovely cafe on the grounds with tables shaded by the many trees that line the estate. It proved to be an excellent spot to enjoy a Caf\u00e9 au lait and watch the endless parade of locals and guest enjoy a hot summer day."

But these days we mostly just cross the beautiful garden on our way to somewhere else because it is completely overrun, especially in summer. But we still visit the regular free exhibitions of large photos affixed to the outside of the wrought iron fence of the garden on Rue de M\u00e9dicis. At present and until 15 January 2017 there are 80 panels on French cultural heritage protection projects (\u2018Le Patrimoine, une Passion, des Hommes\u2019). Tourists in search of a jogging round, a playground or flocking to the Jardins to have a picnic on the lawns - which is forbidden, of course - will find better alternatives elsewhere."

Crowded along the main promenade grass area, less so further along in the gardens, but the reason no one sits on the grass in these areas is because the uniformed park staff shoo you off----rather rudely in our case----if you set foot on the grass in those areas. We obviously missed the signage, but would have appreciated a more civil discussion to redirect us to the main promenade grass area where everyone else was sitting. There are park benches in the quiet area where you can sit, but not ideal if you plan to picnic, throw down a blanket and take in the sun. For that you have to use the main promenade grass area."

I recommend this garden ONLY if you're in the last two day of your Parisian vacation, are exhausted (i.e. no more walking), and would benefit from a picnic (wine, bread and cheese) surrounded by grass, trees and people taking strolls through the park. Otherwise, enjoy a two hour picnic at the Jardin de Tuileries so you can quickly walk over to the Musee d'Orsay to enjoy the largest collection of impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world."

I just like to know where I'm going so I can see everything I came for. There are numerous statues that are absolutely amazing. Personally, I have an attraction to Lady Liberty. She is here on a much smaller scale and every time I've gone, I've never had to wait to get a picture. In the spring and summer the garden is worth the time it'll take to travel around it. And if you're a fitness traveler, this garden is one of the best for jogging. There is always something going on and something to see. From the bee apiary to the statues to the manicured trees and shrubs there is so much to enjoy. They even have a playground for kids. It looked pretty cool, enough that I wanted to go play on it too. There is something for everyone here. You won't be disappointed."

It's truly gorgeous-- with perfectly manicured grounds, but what I loved most was exploring the \"pockets\" of cool spots all around the main gardens. There's a great \"playground\" where you pay, I believe, 1 Euro & there's endless fun for children, plus a restroom, snacks & it's enclosed so you feel safe while your kids zip around. There are picture-perfect tunnels of trees, all sorts of benches where you can sit, read, relax. There's a pond where you can check out fish & ducks but most of all, it's just a beautiful spot to unwind in urban Paris."

They are split into two thematic areas - one resembling a French type garden, with the manicured lawns and fountains, and the other being an English type garden, with a multitude of trees and lots of lush greenery. There are more than a hundred sculptures scattered throughout the gardens, so art fans will have lots to look at. But those who are not art fans can simply grab one of those metal chairs and relax after an exhausting walk."

            "review": "Luxembourg Gardens. The \u201cLuco\u201d as the Parisians call it, is a palace, a museum and one of the most beautiful gardens in Paris, constructed in the 1620\u2019s for the queen Marie de Medici. Three functions united in one place that the centuries have modeled and transformed without losing its charm.Nowadays the palace houses the Senate, the Upper House of the French Parliament, which is sometimes visitable by guided tour. Esteemed temporary art exhibitions are held throughout the year at the Museum. Round the rear of the museum, orange and lemon trees, palms, grenadiers and oleanders shelter from the cold in the orangery of the palace. As for the garden, with its collections of precious flowers, its poneys, beehives and lake for miniature wooden sailboats, is a true heaven where adults and kids can stroll, play, picnic, sit on chairs spread throughout, just relax or exercise. The Luco is a mixture of French culture, nature and playground.Situated on the border between Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s and the Latin Quarter, the gardens, which cover 25 hectares of land, are split into French gardens and English gardens, being largely devoted to a green parterre of gravel and lawn populated with statues and centered on a large octagonal basin of water where children sail model boats. Coming closer we even notice that there are fish in the water, which doesn\u2019t worry the little children who sail their little boats in the pool. They use long sticks to navigate the colorful miniature wooden vessels; the sight of them having so much fun with these non-motorized little boats is almost anachronistic.The garden is famed for its calm atmosphere. Surrounding the bassin on the raised balustrade terraces are 106 statues of former French queens, saints and copies after the Antique. You will also find a small version of the Statue of Liberty.The gardens include a large fenced-in playground for young children and a vintage carousel. There are many other activities and facilities for children such as puppet theatre, pony rides and playgrounds. Adults, whether they are Parisians or tourists, can play chess, tennis, \u201cp\u00e9tanque\u201d and cards.East of the palace is the 1630-built Fontaine des Medici, an elaborate fish pond. Next to it stands a Music Kiosque, a gazebo with free musical performances. There is a small cafe restaurant nearby, under the trees, with both indoor and outdoor seating from which people enjoy the music over a glass of wine.There is also an orchard with a variety of old and forgotten apples, an apiary for you to learn about bee-keeping and greenhouses with a collection of breathtaking orchids and roses. The gardens have appeared regularly in French literature, perhaps most famously in Victor Hugo\u2019s \"Les Miserables\" where Marius and Cosette first meet. Henry James also uses the gardens, in The Ambassadors, as the place where his character Lambert Strether has an epiphany about his identity. The final scene of William Faulkner's novel Sanctuary is set in the gardens. The orderliness and symmetry offers peace and tranquility. Symmetrical lawns surrounded by borders filled with bedding plants, gravel paths, clipped hedges, trees and more statues including a model of the statue of Liberty, form much of the park. The Luxembourg gardens are a great place to relax whilst visiting Paris. A very inexpensive map \u2013 size A3, 4 colors, downloadable - is sold on Amazon from the collection called Voila Paris. It shows the location of the attractions with photographs, so that you can find your way around it easily, especially if you have kids with you."

Mine is 8, she was not only fine but she reveled in playing in a mostly parent-free, kid-run playground. In fact in was beautiful to see the children organize themselves without any parent input (except for the occasional overly- bearing(?)/controlling(?)/fearful(?) \"helpful\" instructions. The kids organized a volunteer \"work\" system at the zip line (which goes fairly fast and turns!). This system included kids who brought the zip line bar back to the front of the line, kids who took that and helped the littler kids on and/or gave pushes as wanted, and even kids who collected eye glasses at the front of the line to give to the kids when they finished their turn. The system had a few flaws, like any, but it was mostly fair, safe and the kids loved \"working\"."

The garden is much more empty except for a good number of runners and walkers. I felt a great sense of peace walking through the gardens (despite the armed guards near the palace).

People not obeying the restrictions were told to pack up and move, families with toddlers were chased - strange. Three strips of grass by the southern gate (by Rue Auguste Comte) were open for people sitting down, but nowhere else."

This park is a bit off the beaten tourist track, so it seems like the population is usually more locals and less tourists.

We get our coffee and croissant (or take-out breakfast from McDonald's on the corner) and just sit at the garden. We relax and enjoy the atmosphere. I like to come here to plan out our day : where are we exploring to and what are we going to eat. It's also nice to sit under the trees and just people watch. I love seeing children playing with the boats in the main pond. I hope to visit there again and really explore the entire garden."

The palace is beautiful (I only looked from the outside) and the statues and gardens are extremely pretty- well worth spending an hour or two here, if only to get away from the crowds for a while and take in a bit of real Parisian relaxation time. There were public toilets available (didn't use them so can't comment on their cleanliness), pony rides, places to get a drink or ice cream and plenty of quiet spaces to contemplate your visit. About 15 minutes walk from the river, uphill (but gently) and through an attractive neighbourhood."

I was disapointed that they charged to go into the kids play area. If I went again I would take a picnic as very little is open on a Sunday so was difficult to Get a cold drink or a snack unless you wanted to buy from the only cafe only in the Jardin which was very expensive."

Petanque areas but booths where it looked like you could hire to play were closed. Tennis courts where you had to be a member to play. Boats for hire to sail on a pond were just floating on their own and blowing around in the wind, not remote control. If your boat hits the side, you push it with a stick to get it sailing again. Probably good for children. Might be nice if you just accidentally come across it, but I wouldn't go out of your way to visit."

It is surrounded by artful plants/trees, and is a fantastic shady nook in which to just sit (on the usual Parisian chairs) and people-watch, read, contemplate, pic nic. One or two of the locals were sketching and painting.The sound of the fountain is really calming, if not soporific!

A large, public park free of the souvenir peddlers and grimey scammers that roam most of the interest points in Paris.On our last day in Paris, we finally made time to take a stroll in the park around the palace, since it was close to our hotel that was holding our luggage.Upon entering, we were greeted by a live mini-orchestra, performing for a small crowd. It was a lovely first impression.We walked around, sat in the sun for a while and people watched, walked by the pond where children (smh adults) play with toy boats, and just overall relaxed.This is a wonderful way to spend a Sunday morning or afternoon, to get away from the crowds of other major attractions in the city."

There are toy sailboats to rent (we paid 3.5 Euros for 30 minutes)--the wind carries them and every now and then they need a little push. There is a great playground to play on (including a zip line for the 7-9 year old set). There are clean bathrooms (bring a little change, as they aren't free). There are a few places to buy snacks. And see a miniature Statue of Liberty. On a beautiful day in Paris, this is a great destination. Easy walking distance from RER stop. Bakeries, cafes and restaurants easy walking distance (including an Amorino branch to buy gelato on a hot day)."

No matter what angle you enter from there is something to see & enjoy. The best feature, though, is the lake with the kids sailing their rented yachts & the grown-ups driving their remote controlled cruisers. There is history, wonderful botanicals, the Medici Fountaine, terraces, manicured lawns, flower beds, tennis courts, pony rides & lots of seats to relax in. All in the most wonderful of Paris arrondissements. It's a short walk to all the classic destinations of Paris.You have not enjoyed Paris until you visit the Luxembourg Gardens."

The park was packed with people running round the edge, people doing all sorts of physical activities, Pilates, Yoga, Chi Gong, Tennis, Group sports competitions ......... and on the boating pond were the most beautiful yachts imaginable that you could hire for a reasonable price. Chairs to sit and watch are FREE, and there are nice cafe's all around. The only thing to be wary of was the 'entry of the wild horses of the apocalypse' - ie the ponies that are used to provide horse rides round the park. It seemed they are dropped off the lorry each day and then are left to gallop down to where they collect passengers - it looked HIGHLY dangerous but was quite exciting!Oh and the trees & flowers are also beautiful! - WELL WORTH A VISIT!"

The Luxembourg palace is beautiful building where the French senate is housed and it sits beautifully amongst the garden."

The Luxembourg Garden is a vast garden (23 hectares as per Wikipedia) with lawns, flower beds, statues etc. The seat of the French senate, Luxembourg Palace, is situated in the same premises. The garden is so vast, that it can be accessed from different roads and metro stations. The place is visited by locals for picnics, jogging and general relaxation. From a tourist point of view, it depends on whether you have spare time on your hand. If you are visiting the Notre Dame or Sainte-Chapelle and have adequate time on your hand you can schedule a visit. If not, nothing much missed either."

The best advice I ever received about visiting Paris was to: take a walk, eat some food, relax in the gardens, eat some more food, and walk some more. Not entirely poetic as one could be when discussing Paris, but the point is to relax. There are so many touristy sights to see in Paris, and they are spectacular! But what is also worthy of enjoying are the gardens, and there are MANY to choose from. This one is wonderful for kids as there are toy-boats for rent for children to sail in the petit basin (not super cheap, but not outrageously priced, either).The grounds are much bigger than you'd imagine, and has an entirely different feel than the regal Tuileries Gardens next to the Louvre. Bring a picnic blanket, buy an ice cream cone from the many sellers, and sit alongside locals as they bathe in the sunlight.Nearest Metro Stops: - (RER B) stop is Luxembourg -(RER B) stop is Port-Royale- Metro, line 4/10 stop is Odeon (this one is a bit further, but not bad)"

And the boats on the pond provided us with a fun half hour (much better than we expected).The main disappointment was not being allowed to sit on the grass for a picnic. We didn't realise this (there were no signs that we saw) so plonked ourselves in a shady spot near the playground. Luckily we had almost finished eating before being moved along by security. Apparently there is one spot in the gardens you can sit on the grass but where this was was not clear!But aside from this minor irritation it is the most lovely place to visit with kids."

My daughter (10) didn't seem very interested, but ended up have a great time sailing her boat! We enjoyed watching the kids running around the pond, using their sticks to push the boats and seeing where the wind would take them. Overall the park is beautiful. We picked up sandwiches and found a quiet place away from the center by a fountain and pool to eat."

The few people who were in the Gardens were quietly doing what people do in large parks: lying on the grass, sitting on benches, strolling, visiting with friends, picnicking, children were playing \u2013 just everything. There was no reason to feel unsafe, as Paris police and French military were stationed at intervals all around the Gardens.

The excellent basis layout of the gardens is a given. The use of flowers to generate color interest and balance is terrific also.

We had gone to look at the merry go round but it was unclear where it was located as there were no signboards. We headed randomly towards the left (back towards palace) and finally saw some recreational activities. There was pony riding, a playground, a small basketball court, a puppet theatre a cafe, a carousel. The carousel was closed, and the playground charged for entry for both adults and children so we gave that a miss. However, our toddler got to try the pony ride, and it was great fun for her.

On the Saturday morning of our visit this section of the garden was corded off due to a beekeeping class in progress, extracting the honey. Fortunately we could see a little of the action from afar before we moved on to enjoy other sections of the park we had not seen before. As always the park attracts locals and visitors, it is a delightful large public park in the centre of Paris."

We spent many years in Paris and raised our family not far from the Luxembourg Gardens, before moving back to England. Covering 23 hectares (57 acres), the formal french park layout encompasses rows of trees precisely planted along gravel walkways, two fountains, and more than 80 statues, including a small version of the Statue of Liberty by Bartholdi, that was given to the United States in 1886 and is in the Jardin Anglais. The gardens remain a splendid spot to rediscover nature and find peace in the middle of the bustling metropolis. Hard to believe, that one is just a couple of hundred meters away from the tourist-and-student quartier of the Left bank.Children float rented toy boats in the wind that ruffles the water of the octagonal pool in the park's centre. The formal lawns are dotted or framed with trees, bushes and flowers. Many of these are out of bounds, others can be crowded by sunseekers in the summer high season. In autumn, the chestnut trees drop their shiny seeds, to the delight of children. At the south end of the park is the Palais du Luxembourg, erected in 1631 in florentine style, to remind Marie de Medici, widow of Henri 1V, of her native Florence. It served as headquarters of the Luftwaffe in WW11, and houses the french Senate today. Not open to the public.Boulevard St. Michel adjoins the east side of the park. It offers a pleasant walk downhill, through the Latin Quarter, crossing Boulevard St. German and ending at the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 and Notre Dame Cathedral."

If your looking to sit down on the grass for lunch or to relax you'll be arms length away from a stranger. The fountain where kids put in their boats and push them around is fun to watch. The boats have flags from different countries and there is one that's a pirate ship so if your bringing your kids and you can't get the boat from the country of your choice the pirate one might be good."

A bunch of metallic chairs are available for free for people to just sit and gaze at the surrounding, the water. We walked around slowly, enjoying the fresh air and the calm setting.

Jardin du Luxembourg (\u76e7\u68ee\u5821\u516c\u5712, Luxembourg Garden) is one of the most favorite garden of Parisians and tourists. It is located just south of the Latin Quarter in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. The duke of Luxembourg originally owned the Jardin du Luxembourg. It was purchased in 1612 by Marie de' Medici, the widow of King Henry IV. After the king was murdered in 1610, she decided to move from the Louvre to a new residence. She built a new palace and had the garden laid out in an Italian fashion. It was the beginning of the current Jardin du Luxembourg. The current garden covers 22.45 hectare (55.5 acres). Today, the Senate is housed inside the Luxembourg Palace. The Senate owns the Jardin du Luxembourg, but it is open to the public. Jardin du Luxembourg is featured several times in popular culture such as in Victor Hugo\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables (\u96e8\u679c \u60b2\u6158\u4e16\u754c) and Henry James\u2019 The Ambassadors (\u4ea8\u5229\u2022\u8a79\u59c6\u65af \u5927\u4f7f).We walked from Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (\u8056\u65e5\u8033\u66fc\u5fb7\u4f69\u4fee\u9053\u9662) to the north entrance of Jardin du Luxembourg in about 15 minutes. When we arrived at the gate, we saw republican guards patrolling on site with machine guns. It must be the Senate that occupies the Luxembourg Palace. It was a pity the beautiful garden beside the palace was blocked by some construction. In few minutes of walking, we saw the beautiful monumental Medici Fountain, which was built around 1630 by Marie de' Medici. Medici Fountain was moved to current location and extensively rebuilt in 1864-66. When the lighting is right, you can the see reflection of the giant Polyphemus, in bronze, observing the lovers Acis and Galatea, in white marble. Not so far from the fountain, there is a statue of L'acteur Grec in the front of a long lawn, and at the end is the Panth\u00e9on (\u842c\u795e\u5edf) in far distance. Pretty soon, we noticed the center area of the park with an octagonal pond, known as the Grand Basin, in front of the palace and many flowers between the paths. It was a warm afternoon. We saw lovers, families, tourists, and people in suits and ties sitting in the chairs and enjoying the sun. They really know how to enjoy their lives. There are many sculptures and beautiful flowers in the gardens. Be sure to stroll it, and you might find the La Libert\u00e9, a miniature version of the Statue of Liberty.You can simply get one of the many chairs and take it to the exact spot where you want to sit. Those chairs are made of steel and are quite heavy. The only problem is the birds also love them and left droppings on them. There are numbers of metro stations in the area; you can pick one that suitable for you. It is also very close to other attractions nearby. You can easily walk there after you visit the nearby attractions."

Lots of chairs and benches to lounge and stare. It's French style, which means very formally laid out, and it can be dusty and pebbly so leave your Louboutins and Berlutis at home. It showcases France's upper house, the Senate, which gives added gravitas. One thing you shouldn't miss: they nearly always have a wonderful open-air exhibition of thematic photographs fixed to the railings along the rue de M\u00e9dicis.

A great picnic spot, food is easily available outside. We had a great time here,sitting on the lawn,watching small kids floating wooden boats in the mini water body,having a picnic lunch...and talking for hours! Expect a huge crowd in weekends. Folk musicians and local bands perform outside the garden on weekends,which is truly entertaining.But always keep something with you to protect your face,at least a big handkerchief, because there is so much dust in the air. Also wear a wide rimmed hat,because near the water body there is no shade from the afternoon sun.Loved this place for the beauty and lots of flowers."

A great feature is the central boating pond where children (and more likely their dads) can hire miniature boats to sail, powered with the aid of a stick. What is great is that there are plenty of sturdy metal arm chairs provided all over the park. We spent several hours relaxing in the sun with our newspaper, picnic just watching the world go by."

We only spent about an hour at the park but the experience was well worth it. It was a sunny day and we could easily see how people could spend a lot of time on a regular basis enjoying the park. You can stroll wide comfortable paths, view the flowers or just hang out by the beautiful pond and watching a family use a remote control to have a boat navigate the water. We could easily imagine it filled with people throughout the warmer months.As to Ernest Hemingway , he lived in the Latin Quarter in the early 1920's with his first wife and very young son Jack. The story goes that he would put Jack in the stroller and walk to Luxembourg Gardens. If there was no gendarme presence , he would spread kernels of corn on the ground to lure a pigeon to him. He would grab the pigeon , snap it's neck and take it home to enhance the diet of the family of a struggling writer. It reportedly happened often enough that family made it through hard times but were completely sick of eating pigeon. I'm not positive of the truth value of the story but it certainly adds to the lore of Paris."

Two kids and two adults to pay 9 euros for the kids to play? Disappointing, especially in a city that is very friendly for kids and all museums are free for under 18.If this is a capacity issue, they could just charge a nominal fee (50 cents?) and not let in more than x kids/adults."

Toddlers have a fenced-in park of sandboxes, a water spigot and patches of lawn, crowned by the statue of a woman with one breast exposed and usually a pigeon resting on her head. Parents sit on surrounding benches An indoor puppet theater welcomes crowds of children seated at the stage, calling out GUIGNOL, GUIGNOL while parents sit apart.  Children can ride the classic merry-go-round to catch brass rings or enjoy high flying swings. Snacks of freshly baked waffles may be enjoyed nearby; there are seats and benches everywhere. Pony rides occur in summer, and live music fills the bandshell on Sundays.  Parents purchase access to an enclosed amusement area filled with climbing structures. Older children can fly on a trolley wire or climb a cable mountain. Toy sailboats are rented by the hour to float in a circular basin on the lowest level of the park, in front of the Senate. Youngsters push them off with long sticks. A few remote-controlled power boats chase the resident ducks about. Around it all, effigies of famous French queens, carefully pollarded trees and the colorful ever-evolving flowerbeds evoke a sense of calm and order. Open from dusk to dark each day. Highly recommended."

We knew it was very early spring, but that wasn't stopping a good crowd from enjoying all this beautiful place has to offer. We saw many families enjoying the grounds, strolling, kids running and playing. We especially liked the little lake area where the kids can set sail small boats and watch them float across the water. There was a wedding going on and what appeared to be college age kids in large groups who appeared to be studying the gardens for a class project. As I said. It was a bit early for the flowers and shrubs to be in bloom but that did not deter our excitement of discovering this lovely place."

While other places like the Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel, and museums have a lot to like, they are so tourist-centric that it's hard to really enjoy them. Everywhere you look it's selfie sticks and boisterous crowds.At Luxembourg Gardens, sure, it's busy and there were some people taking photos, but by and large it seemed to be people just going to the park. We saw lots of teenagers hanging out, playing, holding hands, just being teenagers. Older men were playing bocce while friends cheered and jeered nearby. Children played and mothers walked around with strollers. It just felt like a slice of French life, and oh by the way the park is beautiful, with trees, flowers and statues scattered all around. My favorite area was the Beethoven bust, nestled in some striking trees.If you're staying in the Saint-Germain area and want somewhere to just relax and take it in, Luxembourg Gardens is a great place to do that."

Located at the western end of the Luxembourg Gardens, the Medici fountain dressed with ivy curtains is one of the most romantic places in Paris! Do not miss the place if you are passing in the 6th district.Formerly called the cave of Luxembourg, the Medici fountain was commissioned in 1630 to Thomas Francine engineer Florentin by Marie de Medici, then widow of Henri IV. so tired of the intrigues of the Louvre palace and nostalgic of Italy, she wanted to feel the atmosphere of water lilies and fountains present in the Boboli Gardens in Florence.Often remodeled during its history, which was first a cave, will even be moved in 1861. Alphonse de Gisors then added a pool of water, 50 meters long, bordered by a row of sycamores that gives to the place its magical allure. The current sculpture, in my opinion one of the finest in Paris, is the work of Auguste Ottin; it is a representation of Polyphemus surprising the nymph Galatea in the arms of the shepherd Acis. God it's beautiful!"

And I was not the only one. There were some families with children and the gardeners allowed them to plant some flowers!I am very happy I decided to spend a couple of hours there.

We have tended to stay in this area of the Left Bank over our more recent visits to Paris, and have enjoyed many walks in the Luxembourg Gardens, summer and winter. Always a pleasure - a truly relaxed place in a frenetically busy area, bordering on the Boulevard Saint Michel. I have many happy memories of this place, including one of a small boy worrying his mother by showing attention to a large tree-clipping machine. Small boys are small boys.If I have any criticism, it is that it is not as intensively managed as many UK and Irish city parks such as St Stephen's Green and Merrion Square (Dublin). Little effort is made to enhance its attractiveness in winter. It is possible to do this with an effective programme of flower-planting. I have in fairness to say that, on our most recent visit last October, the park's management seem to have appreciated this, and are trying to improve matters.Perhaps not an absolutely top attraction in Paris. However, if you are in the Left Bank and have the time, I would recommend a relaxing walk in the Luxembourg Gardens at any time of year. Obviously, summer is the best time. Best regards, OMB/JR."

Don't plan to eat or drink in the cafes in the gardens, highly overpriced and not so good."

It is the perfect Paris destination for couples, families, everyone to take time out from busy sight seeing days. Most visitors try to pack in sight seeing destinations during their visit. When you have seen all of the 'must sees', pick up a baguette and make your way to these gardens. Take a leisurely stroll around the gardens, before securing a chair - try to get a reclined one - and taking a much deserved break from walking around the city. People watching is prime here...especially on a sunny Saturday or Sunday, where locals and tourists alike flock to the gardens. There is often a band playing in the gazebo. Fantastic destination if you have children with you. You can hire a sailing boat for a few euros to sail on the lake....pushing it with a stick...a lovely step back in time. Walk to what I call the back of the gardens, past the tennis courts, and there is a great playground. You do have to pay a couple of euros to enter but it's worth it and the kids will have a great time. There is a stall selling treats and drinks and look out for the nearby stall making fairy floss.....yum. Lunch or a coffee at the Pavilion restaurant is a great option too....no matter the weather. Sit outside on warm days and inside if it's cooler. I always order the Dish of the Day and have never been disappointed. Once you have discovered the gardens, I'm sure you will return any chance you get during your stay."

First of all, what was a big surprise for me: everywhere, instead of the usual asphalt, a strange coating, similar to a very fine white sand that has all the properties of dust. I suspect that this is the authentic coverage of past centuries, but that does not help. So I would recommend not to wear for walking the dark suede shoes, as it smoothly turn into white. The same on the Mars fields. In general, the impression is excellent, lots of chairs near the fountain, where you can watch a beautiful view of the beautiful antique building, which still functions! Just before the entrance to the park very tasty pancakes are sold, only 1 euro. Chocolate with caramel mmmm!"

And what better place to escape the hubbub than the exquisitely laid out Jardins des Luxembourg.Laze away the day watching budding Federer's hammer balls on the tennis courts; seek the shade of the Medici fountains; marvel at the pristine architecture and precise arboreta and topiaristic splendour. The gardens cover many hectares and it's absolutely free - unless you need the toilet or indulge in one of the carefully planned attractions.Take a baguette and a bottle of wine - but be discreet and leave this charming oasis as perfect as you found it."

If we had discovered it sooner, we would have walked through the gardens more often, along with the other Parisians and tourists who stroll along the elegant manicured lawns and tree-lined promenades. Napoleon dedicated the park to the children of Paris, and, during the summer, many children come to ride the carousel or watch puppet shows. There's a beautiful fountain in the middle of the park. The original palace there is now home to the Senate - the upper house of the French Paliament. It's a great place to walk, jog,have a picnic, or just sit and relax. Allow at least an hour."

Paris is a large city full of narrow streets which was quite a change from the small village in the Alps we had visited as part of our travels. The day we arrived was getting on and this park was a short walk from our hotel. We passed the St. Sulpice Church which was worth the stop and not at all crowded. The park itself was large and green and a nice change of scenery from urban Paris. There were kids sailing boats in the large pond and all sorts of everyday people wandering around. Conveniently there were some pay public toilets as well. Definitely worth the time to stroll and relax away from the hustle and bustle of Paris."

If asked about what is my best and prefered gardens in Paris, i would definitely say The Luxembourg Gardens.Best season to visit is spring, summer and fall but, mainly, when everything is blooming. It's a colorful painter's palette with all those wonderful colors that brings luxury,peace and rest in this most romantic place of Paris.Unlike old classical gardens , it is made in a way english gardens are.Several little spaces of green where you could read, rest , listen to music, have a nap or sandwich or a romantic chat with your lover. Kids can watch Guignol, ride ponies, pushing little boats in the pond, play games and once tired taste some icecream. Adults, have chess, petanque\"metal bowl game\",tennis, basketball,reading, sunbathing, having a piknic on the allowed lawn (summer only),among all those marvellous statues, wonderful trees,peaceful ponds and a beautiful view of the palace of Luxembourg (senat house). In Summer season music is played at the kiosk.The good thing is that the gardens are at the center of Paris."

Very large park, we only saw a small area. The next day we walked through after seeing the Pantheon. I couldn't find where we were on the map, talking in English (there are maps all over the park) and said \"ici\" which means here. A woman jumped off a nearby bench and pointed to the red circle that says \"ici\". That was very helpful. Once we were oriented we walked on the other side by the many playgrounds."

My husband always goes for an early morning jog and this was one of his favourite running places in Paris. Great if you want to sit and have a picnic lunch instead of paying for a cafe style lunch.

The theatre is very popular so plan you visit and get early if you want to see a show. There are also pony rides, tennis, basket ball courts and spaces just to sit and relax, meditate, jog... All of these things go on. The grounds are splendid and well maintained all year round. Not to be missed"

Found immaculately maintained pathways, well pruned trees and hedges, and statuary that fulfilled every expectation of mine. I watched three generations of women, adoring their youngest girl-child, and an older couple enjoying their iced sorbets. Sat on a classically French green bench and read in the sun till i too felt as French as my surroundings. Went back the next day and the next."

The Luxemburg Gardens have both, a park and gardens, plus the beautiful Luxemburg Palace. My favorites were the two pristine lawns and the huge fountain that sit directly in front of the Luxemburg Palace. Each lawn is adorned with a beautiful marble statue and is surrounded by lush flowers. The lawns and fountain have chairs all around them for you to sit and relax in, its very European and very nice. There\u2019s a large gravel walkway that loops around the park, its lined with a statue of France\u2019s past Queens, they\u2019re really great to look at and see the years of each of their reigns as you stroll through the park. It was easy to picture these Queens taking the exact same walk in this beautiful palace garden. The Palace itself was beautiful and regal, you can only see the front of it from within the garden but its stunning and well worth it.I was able to get a Nutella crepe and a glass of wine at one of the parks little kiosks. We found a restroom over by the children\u2019s playground and paid the attendant a few cents to use it, safe and clean."

For a short visit I suggest that you: 1- Enter the Garden from the northern entrance2- Visit Medici garden (inspired by Italian gardens)3- go by the Senat Building and the garden in front of it4- Exit by the other northern entrance close to Musee de Luxembourg - there is an Angelina Cafe by that entrance- try a cafe and pastry!

There is a large pond where children can play with boats but I don't know if they hire them or bring their own.

Luxembourg RER station is right across so if you are coming from CDC or ORY airports, it is easy to access. There were quite a few tourists with bags relaxing before heading off to the airport.

There are other children's activities, including pony rides, puppet shows, and a merry-go-round. The huge Luxembourg Palace is on the grounds of the Gardens. There are more than 100 statues, including figures of 20 French queens.We arrived a little past 6 P.M. for a picnic dinner, on a weekday.

People sitting in the chairs along the pathways enjoying the fresh air, students in groups doing homework, a group sing along with accordion and guitar in process at the bandstand and what seemed to be hundreds of children pushing boats across the pond in front of the Palace! What a vibrant and well used green space. If I was visiting Paris with a youngster the gardens on a Saturday would be a definite must do. Made me appreciate all the natural outdoors we're surrounded with here in British Columbia.The border plantings were outstanding with vegetables and herbs (chard, basil) mixed into vibrant reds and tall grasses..along with Caster Beans ( DH recognized these from his prairie upbringing ) well worth a visit for anyone remotely interested in gardens.

There are places to sit and just soak up the sun and watch the people walking through the garden. There are different levels that can be explored. If you prefer shade, there are areas to sit. Tennis courts are available for use and there are restroom facilities on the property. If you like photography there are many great pictures to be taken. There are several ways which to enter the gardens and many statues displayed throughout. In front of the palace is a water fountain that you can sit and enjoy.I would highly recommend a visit while in Paris."

This is my favourite garden in Paris, with parallel applause for the walking the path between the squared trees of the Tuileries Garden. The Luxembourg is a great place to have a morning run or sit on one of the many benches before carrying on to the Latin Quarter, the Musee d'Orsay or Notre Dame and Pont Neuf. I would say a coffee or tea however I have never been able to coax a caf\u00e9 aller from any cafe owner in France. The gardens themselves are beautiful and like all in France, very manicured. Flower beds are spectacular in high summer moths. Personally I prefer more wild free form gardens but they do have a charm."

The kids playground (admission 1.20 for kids, 2.50 for adults) includes a flying fox, huge climbing equipment, sand activities and a kiosk. All able to be supervised from seats outside the playground if you choose. A carousel next door (cost 1.50) was a real treat with a game of jousting to collect steel rings available to children on the coveted outer horses. There were also swings, horse rides, tennis, a toddler play centre a other activities we did not get around to. Highly recommended."

In a central area is a large pond the the children launch boats across. It's fun to watch the children get excited and race around the pond. If I had little one I would bring the here to wear them out. The Medeci fountain is one of her favorites in the garden. The garden feels more like a locals park less tourists. If you get a chance you should include this in your sites to see. It's free! Easy off the Metro."

And what a joy! The Luxembourg Gardens, kind of like Versailles and many others fall into that category. To me, it is a simple and complimentary way to feel like nobility for an instant. Grab an ice cream at nearby \"Dalloyau\", pull a chair, feed the pigeons and marvel at the regal design of this palace and gardens...while enjoying hundreds of Parisians and tourist do the same thing...exquisite!"

In summers specially on weekends expect it to be packed with people. A lot of time mostly throughout the year it has a nice amount of people mostly during weekends. Its a very pleasant and tranquil place to go around during week days, refreshes ones mind. It has a fountain in the centre right as you go down the stairs where you can pull a chair and just sit around admiring children playing with small boats in the water or just read a book or have a nice quite snack. On the weekends theres normally some free music concert going on to entertain people. Depending on the time of the year right at the entrance gate you may find a ice cream vender. Theres a stall inside the garden too where you can buy sandwiches and drinks ect and sit and eat out there. Over all a very nice place to relax and calm down. Once you exit the garden walk down the lane and you can find a few nice little shops to shop or window shop from. As you will keep descending you will reach the fountain of Saint Michel in the Latin Quartier which is surely worth a visit!"

To our joy and delight we went to the Gardens and saw the most complete Chagal exhibit featuring paintings from early 1900's until the 1970s. Extraordinary! I have no idea if the exhibit is still there but if you are in the neighborhood, Paris, you should check it out."

See the monuments-Statiue of Liberty, 1870, Marie de Medici area and many more.The Museum next door is expensive and really not worth the money."

They run it off. And a secret place to do this is the Jardin Luxembourg. A loop around the park is just over 2k. No matter what time of day you go there you will find other runners doing the same thing. Once the park is closed, the runners still run around the park but on the outside. While the park is open there are 4 fountains to ensure that you are keeping hydrated.Enjoy. I love running in this park."

Being from New York City, it took us some time to get used to dirt walkways, but the grass and vegetation and flower beds are all amazing. The flowers throughout Paris are planned and kept so beautifully. We loved this park and would have returned to it except that we ran out of time and had so many other gardens and museums and neighborhoods to visit. Plus it doesn't hurt to have armed guards nearby at the Palace. makes you feel more secure in light today's world."

Short walk to Parthenon. Gelato stands on the grounds. May have had the best one hour nap of my life while wife and kids were taking a stroll. Should be on everyone's to do list when visiting Paris. Easy accessible."

I acknowledge that I am drawn to the big city gardens more than most, but after experiencing the Tuileries near the Louvre, I was expecting the gardens at Luxembourg Palace to be a real come down. Nothing could be further from the truth. I spent a few hours on a perfect day in early September admiring the setting for the beautiful palace itself. The grounds were immaculately maintained, and even some of the larger trees had been manicured to near perfection, giving the entire location a feeling of formality, stature, and respect, while still making the various visitors comfortable enough to sit in the many chairs generously scattered along the many paths throughout the gardens.The grounds are considerable, and people can feel they are in beautiful, pleasant, and intimate surroundings, because the grounds are creatively broken up into large, medium, and small sections via the creative landscaping. I did not take a formal tour while there, but I believe they were being given.If you enjoy city gardens, do not miss the chance to spend 2-4 hours here. There are lots of picture perfect sidewalk cafes just across the street as well. This is a good place to tie in with a walk to Notre Dame Cathedral."

Paths here are tree lined and mostly gravel. As you draw closer to the \"Palace\" there are floral gardens, quite fantastic, also a pool of water and fountain, many statues, many potted flowers. It is quite lovely, many people in all areas of this park, but it's so large it did not feel crowded, lots of seating everywhere....good picnic place.

To truly enjoy this garden, bring a picnic basket and a good book to enjoy the afternoon or evening in. There is plenty of photo opportunities here and it's an amazing venue for day events. There is a wooden sailboat activity here where a family with young children could also partake in. I would love to return and have a nice picnic in the park here again."

And it's a great place to be a bride.There are plenty of chairs placed all over the park, not to mention benches, for you to sit on and read, eat, people-watch. I didn't get the sense that it was okay to sit on the grass.

The thing is these gardens are really attached to the French Senate building so they have all this refinement defined in and are so well kept and clean. At the same time, they're one of the most central and accessible, open space, green areas this side of the river, so you feel like you could go there to escape the city. Lots of seating space but a confusing vibe. Do people come here for an elegant stroll around the floral gardens in their fancy attire, or to throw their legs up and take some sun by the pond? Who cares? It's somewhat green, it's pretty and it's free."

We had not bought tickets beforehand and were aware there could be queues which there were. We stood in line for forty minutes and then, as we didn't have prepaid tickets, were sent to another counter to buy our tickets, come back and go to the end if the queue again.Positive note though, the security line was quick though have been told can take up to two hours on a busy day.The palace visit was pretty busy but held up by people on their audio devices and therefore shuffled along for about an hour. As part of each room is cordoned off, it is difficult to appreciate the beauty and splendor of some if the rooms with so many people ( we were there at 11 am on a wet day). There are some beautiful ceiling paintings to be admired too.The gardens were quite pretty as it is Sumer and in flower though none of the fountains were in operation. The most disappointing though was the modern art structure on the avenue ( called Dirty Corner) which blocked the view of the water and looked like an old pipe dug out of the ground. Spoilt the whole structure of the garden layout.All in all, not up to what I expected but at least only cost 15\u20ac to go in plus train fare."

We visited this park en route to Pantheon after breakfast, and as most attractions don't open until 10:00am this was a good side visit to kill time...and to see more of Paris. We were there about 9:00am, and many locals were jogging, walking and exercising around the various tracks.The park grounds are very big with several entrances and many sections, gardens, plant nurseries, statues, playgrounds and (what looked like) a day care centre. Obviously the most spectacular section is that opposing the Palace Luxembourg with it's manicured gardens, well kept lawns and huge pond. There were ice cream \"carts\" but as we'd only finished breakfast we didn't investigate further.We only spent about 45 minutes using the visit mainly as an interesting way to the Pantheon after breakfast, but you could easily spend 2 hours (or more) if you wanted to walk the tracks and see the many other sections we did not.Overall, a glorious place to visit on the way to/from the Pantheon...on a warmer/fine day a perfect place for a take-away cafe lunch. A prefect accompaniment to a tour of the palace. Highly recommended if you like parks, statues & gardens."

My 6 year old son loved sailing the toy boats on the pond and then the enclosed playground was perfect for both our 1 and 6 year old. The younger adored the sandpit area for smaller children and the older one loved the zipwire and climbing frames - and my husband and I enjoyed being able to sit back and relax on a bench."

This beautiful park used to be the palace grounds for the Palais du Luxembourg which was built for one of the Louis' mother, after the revolution it became the seat of the French Senate. The park has beautiful statues dating back to when it was a palace. The grounds are impeccable with luscious lawns and the perfect place for a recharging picnic. We have been there a couple of times and the relaxing quiet compared to the hustle of the city surrounding it is surprising! The last time we were there on a Saturday and there were pony rides and other things for the kiddos. If you feel like a tennis match there are courts- you can tell all your friends \"I played tennis at the Palace\"! The best thing to do is to people watch! kick your feet up, enjoy the sun and quiet! But don't put your feet on the rim of the pool! the pool police will yell at you! and he was not kidding around!"

If you have nothing else to do and have a down day and just want to go for a walk, this is a great place. In addition it is within about a 30 minute walk of the Montparnasse skyscraper and another 15-20 minutes walk to the Pantheon. Also in the area is the cemetery if you have interest.I would suggest going to the top of the Montparnasse tower first to get an overview of the area, I spent more than 30-45 minutes at the top just surveying Paris, and got some spectacular pictures. Then I went to the gardens and then to the Pantheon. Total time around 3-4 hours, then had lunch nearby the Pantheon and enjoyed the French lifestyle. Paris is what you make of it, no need to rush through things. Pace yourself.Anyway the gardens are good, but nothing special, for photographers, maybe great, lots of beautiful flowers to take photos of. Just if you have nothing better to do or want a short cut walk to get to the Pantheon, sure why not. "

Our friend failed to mention that this \"garden\" is more like a city within a city and requires at least a day to visit the entire place. No kidding - it's huge.We walked here from Arc de Triomphe - it's a long walk, but when in Paris, do as the Parisians and walk. Along the way, we stopped by the boucher and picked up ham (Paris has the best ham ever), the boulangerie and picked up a few loaves of yummy bread (ditto for Parisian bread), and the fromaggerie and picked up some cheese and butter (what is it about Parisian butter that makes it so good) so that we could make a picnic in the park.We grabbed some water and made our way into the park and were immediately struck by its size and beauty. This is no corner park - this is a small city requiring a map (which they do offer on signs throughout the park).We made our way to one corner of the park where there was a long reflecting pool complete with ducks, a fountain, and ample seating all around the pool. A handful of the obligatory college students were in one corner debating something, but most of the chairs were full of locals eating, reading, or sleeping. We grabbed a handful of chairs, spread out our picnic, and wondered how we could pull off a move to this most wonderful city.How civilized to have thought of building so many parks in the city? We could have spent all day here, just lounging around and visiting the many other attractions inside Jardin du Luxembourg. I guess that we will include that on our next visit to the City of Lights.NOTE: If you want a great book on all the major gardens in Paris (there's hundreds of gardens, but about 30 are the most well known), consider \"Hidden Gardens of Paris\" by Susan Cahill. It was recommended to us by the landlord of the apartment we rented, and we found a copy at the wonderful bookstore Shakespeare and Company. Confession - we read it over and over and planned quite a few day trips based upon this book."

Excellent place for the jet lagged tourist to hang out. Nice scenery, people watching, and sculptures located throughout the gardens. There are plenty of chairs around for sitting and sunbathing. If you are there in summer and want to lounge on the designated grass areas, take a towel or blanket. The grass has goose droppings and some trash. We especially enjoyed watching children using sticks to sail miniature sailboats in a public pond. There is a marionette theater as well. And it is a good place to run or jog."

Wonderful treed avenues with numerous open grassed spaces usually with a sculpture or two surrounded by flowers.Sit and watch the locals playing boules and try to work out what's going on, they are very friendly and are pleased to tell you the object and the main rules. We started at the museum end and finished at the spectacular Palais du Luxembourg and watched the kids sailing the model boats in the pond in front of the Palais.Walking on the gras is not allowed so stick to the many paths."

For example you can rent a little remote controlled boat and remember being a child while you play with it, enjoy the gardens flowers and trees, on some days you also get live music being played! Its just an amazing place that almost surely will have somethign to offer for every type of personality!"

Due to having 2 very sightseeing filled days, we only managed to visit the gardens just before we checked out of the hotel- but I am so so glad we did visit, even though it was just for 15 minutes. The gardens are so amazingly well-maintained, truly stunning. On a summer day, you could easily spend hours here, just exploring and taking time to sit down and enjoy a pastry or cake.Like all of the main tourist sites in Paris, the gardens do have a police presence, presumably due to the events in Paris earlier this year, but this allows you to feel completely secure and safe. If you are an artist, the gardens would be a absolute dream for inspiration. This is a MUST visit for everyone."

There are areas to sit and enjoy the parks with green chairs dotted around for you to sit on. There are quiet places to eat a picnic, sit in the sunshine or just watch the world go by. Our favourite thing to do was rent wooden sailboats \u20ac3.50 for half an hour and sail them on the small boating lake with fountain. Each boat has a national flag and we were even lucky enough to get the pirate ship - cue many 'high speed chases with the Black Pearl!' The owner makes each ship himself and it was one of the higlights of our trip to sit in the sun sailing a boat! There is a fantastic play park which is \u20ac2.50 per child to enter for the day. The reason for the fee is clear, it is a well maintained and cleverly planned park with a large curving zip line, a huge climbing pyramid and several climbing areas with slides, swings and roundabout. Parents can either pay \u20ac1.50 to go into the park and sit on a bench inside or pull a green chair up to the railing and keep an eye on your child from the other side of the railing. It is safe and well maintained. The park also has a carousel and puppet shows at different times but check this in advance as they are not every day. The perfect place to enjoy a quieter, slower pace after sighseeing and adventures."

The first was to explore the beautiful chateau located at the front entrance. The second time, I went to a small building serving as a community gallery where I viewed photographs from an interesting photographer. There are multiple areas for children to play, informational spots around the garden for their education and amusement. There are beautifully kept floral gardens with statues of historic proportion. I relaxed in a provide chair and enjoyed a sandwich for dejeuner then walked the gardens. great place for a leisurely stroll and a favorite of runners too. There were magnificent fountains and statues situated throughout the gardens. I can't say enough about this lovely place."

If you're into history, art and architecture, you will appreciate the serenity and tranquility of the gardens. Grab a coffee to go from a nearby cafe and take a seat. Don't forget to take a picture of the palace and dare I say it, a selfie. Great for kids."

I've spent just a few hours in these wonderful gardens but I was really amazed, they reminded me the 'Valentino' that we have in Turin.Entrance is free, if you don't want to visit the museum, and you can walk everywhere looking at the big nice palace, built in the classic French style, from outside.They are huge, full of 'green' and with lots of people, however you can walk and relax quietly, even find a bench where you can rest your feet. I don't know if it's usual but when I've been here there was a classical concert in one of the gazebo, making the ambience even better! In the middle of the gardens, in front of the palace, there is a really big nice round fountain where children can play with wooden boats, making this park a perfect choice for families looking for a good way to spend the afternoon.It could seem strange but, for me, this is one of the most beautiful places in Paris, it reflects perfectly the way I imagine Paris with the eyes of a foreigner: big squared palaces, music in the streets, big parks and big green avenues."

We observed horseback riding and people picnicking on the lovely grounds. On Sunday afternoons, there is a Puppet Show which we are so glad we did. Although the show is in French,(which we don't speak) we laughed and enjoyed the show. Very much a way to have your children enjoy the \"simple pleasures\"--our 8 year old loved it. She was able to sit down front with all of the children.. no adults allowed in the first few rows. To end the day, we rented a toy sail boat and a stick for our daughter and she and my husband enjoyed setting it assail in the huge fountain. Again, a wonderful, simple pleasure that we loved. As we were leaving the Gardens, we sat in on a Piano concert in the park. A very memorable day indeed!"

The basin has little boats floating that can be rented (they all have different country's flags on them, and there is a pirate ship!) - they are great fun to watch. In the middle of the day, people are having lunch, reading their book, just relaxing in the sun. The statues of various women in French history are very interesting to look at. Some of these experienced recent vandalism - I can understand why the park does not stay open all night (it opens at 7:45am) I could have stayed in this park for hours. Highly recommended."

Kids (and adults) can rent sailboats (about 20inches n made guaranteed to float) for 2.50euros fir 30mins. Well wirth the $. Don't worry about the country's flag on the boat because no one else cares! Take the kids to the children's park. For a small entry fee (about 2.50 euros kids snd 1.75 adult), you'll be able to spend 3hrs here easily. There are play apparatus I hadn't seen at other playgrounds including a zip line for kids. The rules say for ages 7+ but many parents allow kids as young as 4 on these. Young kids will need help!! Most kids under 10 will need help to put the zip line in start position. French kids are well behaved and there are lots if Brits n American families here too. There are playgrounds fir toddlers and young children, too. There are few food places so bring your picnic lunch or snacks, even if you've eaten. Kids always get thirsty and hungry after playing! "

I sat and listened to the band playing in the rotunda, marvelled at the gardens and the magnificent Palace, watched the local children sailing remote controlled boats on the lake and that just scratched the surface. This is absolutely a must do in Paris !!!."

The current show did not disappoint as the joy and excitement was the same in their faces today as it was more than 50 years ago. The park itself is also lost in time with the wonderful playground, beautiful flowers and real toy sailboats that are operated by wind, not remote control. If you are coming to Paris with children, you should not miss The Luxembourg Gardens."

Our family stumbled upon Luxembourg Gardens by chance when we were looking for a place to have a picnic and enjoy our macarons from Dalloyau which is just across the street. There was a group of students doing a very nice choral presentation in the Gardens and we sat nearby to listen. When we wandered through Luxembourg gardens we discovered that it was a place for people of all ages, especially families. You could rent little wooden sailboats with flags from different countries for a few euros and watch them sail across a pool, racing with sailboats from other countries. The children that we watched loved it! There was also a carousal, a playground for very little ones and not so little ones, a tennis court, a basketball court, pony rides, a small pear/apple orchard, and a kiosk for ice cream, crepes and sandwiches. There were many private little places where people of all ages were relaxing and reading a book or visiting with friends. The Garden is huge so you could get a good walk in if you went from one end to the other. Beautiful trees provided shade and a feeling of nature in the middle of Paris. Washrooms were available for 1/2 a euro. If you and your family are looking for a place to take a break from touring for an afternoon, I would highly recommend Luxembourg Gardens. It is a place to relax and enjoy Paris in a whole different way."

There were also areas for kids to play and also some of the oldest beehives in Paris."

If you have kids, make sure you go over to the Octagon Pond in the middle of the gardens and locate the \"Location de Voiliers\" (Sailboat Rentals) to rent toy sail boats for the children to sail in the Octagon Pond. They will enjoy this experience of sailing a toy sail boat with a stick to guide their boat in the pond. The wind acts as a motor for the boats to sail. They rent them for 1/2 hour at 3.50 euros and 1 hr for 7 euros.

Did not get into the palace as we seemed to enjoy just the calmness and greenery around."

They have wonderful landscapes and, to a large degree, are used at vast living rooms for the city\u2019s residents. The parks just feel different from ones in North America.The Luxembourg Jardins are the largest of those parks. The Luxembourg Palace, by the way, was the home of Catherine Di Medici, and now houses the French Senat.We visited the park twice on summer evenings in June and July. The park isn\u2019t fancy in the sense of elaborate flower gardens, but is well laid out with walkways; fountains; and areas to sit, talk, and play. The manner in which trees have been trimmed is pleasing and reminiscent of countless paintings.This park is certainly worth a walk if you are in the neighborhood and is a very civilized outdoor gathering area in a city known for its refinement. Pull up a chair and have a nice evening with friends."

Natural growth trees coupled with grand staircases down to a pond and beyond trees carefully clipped into box shapes, making avenues to yet more distant places. It's close to 'luxembourg' metro located on the RER, so if you have checked out of your hotel, drag your luggage over to the Jardin and spend some hours taking it easy before getting back on the RER to Charles de Gaulle airport.

Walking through the gardens are free, but the activities will cost a few Euros. There is a fabulous playground with several different areas to play in that cost for adults and children alike (2.5 for Children 1.25 for adults). However, many parents just pay for their children and sit outside to watch them. We chose to go in and sit on a bench inside. It is a fairly large area and not all areas are visible no matter where you are sitting. There are bathrooms and a sink just inside to the right after you pay your fee. My 6 year old loved the zip line and my 4 year old loved the climbing frames of which there are more than one. A dark wooden one is made for older children 5-10ish and then there is a more colorful one for the 2-5 year olds. There was a sandpit that many of the younger children 1-3 we're playing in. It had a little 'castle' that had ropes and baskets on pulley's that the children loved to move up and down. Outside of the playground there were several other activities for kids: including sailing miniture sail boats (about 3 Euros), a short horse ride around the park, and a puppet show. My kids chose the horse ride. It was about 3 Euros as well. They have small horses in a group of 4 take children around the park. The horses are led by someone and the children are given hairnets and helmets to wear - so it is entirely safe. Our 6 year old loved it, but the 4 year old was little scared when the horses got too close together. It was only like a 3-5 minute ride. There is a Marionette puppet show that was on at 4:00 and was (5.50 Euros) - we didn't make it in time to see the show. The Marionette Puppet show is in the white building next to the playground, not the brown building that says Marionettes. So, it can appear that the show is not on. There is a man that rings the bell when the show starts to get everyone's attention. For adults, definitely walk down to see the Luxemburg Palace, pool, and garders- which are just gorgeous. This is where there are many people taking photos and selfies. There may have been more to the park, but after 2-3 hours we were ready to go back home! The park is easily accessible by the metro. Hopefully you'll have a beautiful sunny day!"

Took my delicious sandwich to a chair in the Luxembourg Gardens and watched some tennis, then took a stroll. There's a playground (quite large), some beautifully landscaped lawns, the Luxembourg Palace (which I think is the building that houses the French Senate), and extensive gravel paths. There's a carousel too, but it wasn't operating when I was there. A beautiful city oasis."

It was time to take a rest from sight seeing and really SEE Paris. We grabbed some baguettes and headed to Luxembourg Gardens. The park was full of locals enjoying their lunch break. Mothers, students, lovers, workers and joggers all intermingled. We found spare seats under the shade of a tree and enjoyed our lunch, plus a good dose of people watching. I love French landscaping. Lawn, straight lines, beautiful paths - throw in a palace with a pond and it's idyllic! My husband decided to take a nap after lunch, so I strolled around taking in all of the statues, kiosks, children with sailboats & greenery. What a perfect afternoon. Then the thought struck me: when have I ever done this in my home town?"

There is even an apiary! (bee keeping)I began taking my daughter there when she was about one year old, for her first steps on grass, on the lawn reserved for babies and parents. She soon graduated to the enclosed children's play area, which you must pay to enter, but is completely worth it. There are fun things for all kids from about age one to age 12. A big sandbox, lots of slides, a big truck to drive (very exciting for toddlers), places to hide, and even a T-bar for older kids. In addition, the nearby kiosk sells pretty good coffee, so a parent can enjoy coffee and reading while keeping half an eye on the kids--it is not so easy for them to get out of the playground.Without kids, I recommend the gorgeous caf\u00e9 just across the street, Le Rostand, so nice to sip a coffee there or eat a meal.

This has become one of our favorites places to visit in Paris and on this trip found a hotel not too far away. It seems that a run in the morning or leisurely shaded walk on a hot summer day through Luxembourg Gardens always becomes one the favorite memories of our trip. It will help to recalibrate your compass after a day of being a tourist. I love watching the children with their sailboats in the fountain. We have also happened upon lives concerts. There are vendors selling crepes or galato. We also enjoyed a glass of wine at the outdoor cafe."

And instantly amusing - the people watching is great, tourists and locals alike. You can get food at the supermarket just across from the metro and enjoy a lunch, or walk up rue de Tournon on the north side of the park and buy some pastries, macaroons and chocolate from 3 really stellar patisseries along the street.

We arrived at about 9:30 to find a long, long line snaking around the court yard. The audio tape did not work well. We found the furnishings in the palace space. What made it worse though was the large crowds. It was very difficult to really view or appreciate the palace or gardens. Later I did listen to the Rick Steve's audio, it was very helpful, but did not cover the rooms in order of the way we were \"herded\" in. If you choose to go, I would try to choose the least busiest of times (see Rick Seve's) Paris travel guide and preview his audio tape to help make your tour more meaningful."

Don't know if it is my nostalgia of childhood days, or if it is an unbiased review, but this park is just wonderful.Weather permits, it is a must see place for so many reasons.1- if you have small monsters you want to entertain head there for sure. Depending on the days (weekends, Wednesdays, school holidays) there are pony rides, and also puppet shows. A gated playground (yes you pay for it) is also a great option for children to vent after a full day at museums, shops and restaurants. There is also the swing section (also paying) but surely a delight for small ones. THE highlight is the pond with the boats you can rent from the kiosk across. For half an hour your child will make you smile while slightly going crazy trying to keep an eye on him or her while trying to steal the wooden ship across the pond. For the record it is only 30 minutes! 2- If you are heading solo, with friends or as a couple, it is a perfect place to relax, talk, listen to music, or picnic. Super romantic as well. 3- I love running a few laps there, though it does get crowded..4- Just go there for a green break in this exhausting city sometimes.Good to know: the toilets next to the playground are relatively very clean as you have to pay a fee to enter. Also the kids get stamped on their hands while entering the playground so that they can go in and out all day."

Here one can enjoy one's lunch, read, sit on the grass, or sit on the provided chairs and benches or maybe listen to music on your phone. Yes, there are a few people jogging, - but don't worry, these are Americans.As you look around there are wide, white flat paths, palm trees, shady green trees, boxed shaped shrubs and yellow, red and orange flowers overflowing in their pots.The children are well catered for with their own play area and they can also hire a little sail-boat and float it on the large shallow pond.Three statues I particularly liked were the original model of the Statue of Liberty, the fountain for Eugine Delcroix and the statue of Saint Genevieve the patron saint of Paris.However, do not visit in mid-winter - not unless you really enjoy snow on the ground.

I say apparently because we weren't chased off any nor did i see any boards that specifically prohibited access.

Getting around: Because i travelled with someone less able ot walk, some information about the BusThere are to major bus lines that stop at either sides of the park near the entrance. We got of the 85 from le Marias.

I enjoy it as much on the weekends when it is used by families for exercise or to entertain their children. The large pond in summer afternoons is gorgeously alive with sailboats large and small. The trail around the outer edges of the park are used by joggers on Sunday morning. Biking children with (often) their fathers, also on bikes, having a conversation while riding is perhaps my favorite thing to watch."

When viewing French Impressionism art where there are public gardens, it is usually of people strolling as if wanting to see others and of being seen, which means viewing space and nothing to obscure them. Hence, few trees which is less enjoyable a walk in the heat. The idea of preening while walking was also a motif, which means few areas to recline. There is not much to view there and few people today have the need to preen in gardens. There are some seats there, but most people want to sit in the grass and every now and then an officer would chase them off and when he left, they would sit in the grass, which means they do not have many areas that are for the public to relax. They did have a Great War exhibit outside the gardens of battle areas then and now in France. That was very interesting, but nothing to really view in the garden."

Nothing is better than sitting in a chair (ok, truthfully you take two chairs: one for your body and one for your legs and then you snooze and read) by the lake. It is fun to watch the kids with their ever present boats. Depending on the season, the flowers are so beautiful here. We were there a little early this year so they were not in their splendor but it was still beautiful. The only problem with this park is it is very dusty. You can take the RER and it will exit you right by the entrance."

There is a large man-made pond/fountain encased with stone that is used for sailing toy boats. Highly recommened! If you have children aged 5-12, bring them and rent a toy sailboat for three and a half euro for 30 minutes, or by the hour and your kid (especially boys) will be entertained! Restrooms are difficult to find, but they exist. When you're done, head across the street and enjoy a great beverage!"

This is one of my favorite parks in Paris, as it brings back memories of 50 years ago, when I lived nearby and would spend endless hours here, sitting on one of their \"pay\" chairs, doing my reading and soaking in the ambience. At the northern end of the park is the Luxembourg Palace, built in 1615-1645 as the royal residence of the regent Marie de M\u00e9dicis, mother of Louis XIII of France. Since 1958 it is the seat of the French Senate. In front of it is a large basin where children let their mini-sailboats ply the water, and the rest is basically flowerbeds at the center and treed areas with mainly chestnut trees providing shade at the side, including the typical heavily pruned \"square\" trees at the southern flanks. In the north-eastern corner is a bandstand where on several occasions we have experienced different music groups playing, recently a Salvation Army band, on an other occasion a group of music students from Slovakia. All over the park there are a great number of beautiful statues and the famous Medici Fountain is located at the southern end, with at its back the intriguing little noticed L\u00e9da fountain.

Perhaps more should be said of the intimacy that comes from finding shelter under the same umbrella?It was a joy to see the variety of flowers on display around the manicured lawns. The wide use of colour in the floral displays was something I particularly enjoyed. I liked weaving in and out the trees in the gardens too taking time to view the statue displays. Stumbling across a singing group also added to the experience. The rain did not dull them and the personable happy birthday they sang to a troupe member brought good cheer to all watching. If it had been sunny it would have been the perfect place for a picnic although for those that travel light there is a cafe in the grounds. I think that if you enjoy being outdoors or gardening in any way you will enjoy a visit here. "

This is not just an enchanting tourist attraction, but a living, breathing part of Parisian life. Beautifully manicured grounds and statuary meld with Parisians whiling away a sunny weekend afternoon--reading, talking with friends, watching their kids play on the playground, and more. We stopped at an amazing nearby patisserie, grabbed a baguette, some cheese, and a bottle of wine (they opened it and supplied cups!) and camped out on a bench to talk and watch the world go by. Behind us, a group of friends played charades. Then we meandered over to watch some men play petanque and tried to figure out the rules and objectives of the game (much like curling). In all the tourist hustle and bustle of seeing one site after another, this was one perfect gem of an afternoon...Watch for signage, as some grass you cannot sit on.

It feels odd to pass the armed security guards outside the Senate building on the edge of the gardens and then find oneself inside one of the best city parks in the world. There is a real sense of being in a green haven away from the hustle and bustle of France's throbbing capital city. Some of the landscaped lawns are quite exposed but there are still plenty of places to find some shade, especially the tree-lined avenue to the northern side of the gardens. These were absolutely full of families, young people and romantics of every kind the two evenings we walked through the gardens in early June. We also liked the excellent photographic displays attached to the railings on the southern side of the gardens overlooking Rue Vaugirard. You might want to pop in to the Le Luxembourg brasserie at 58 Boulevard St Michel after touring the gardens - we enjoyed a very good and reasonably priced (by Paris standards at least!) evening meal and late night drink there."

There are lots of green metal seats to sit upon under the shade of the trees or in the sunshine to catch rays. Sculptures, statues and works of art grace the lawns and paths. An oasis for apartment dwellers and visitors. Lots of open space for fitness enthusiasts that you will meet at every turn.

The Jardin du Luxembourg, or the Luxembourg Garden, located in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, was created beginning in 1612 by Marie de' Medici, the widow of King Henry IV of France, for a new residence she constructed, the Luxembourg Palace. The garden today is owned by the French Senate, which meets in the Palace. The park, which covers 23 hectares, is known for its lawns, tree-lined promenades, flowerbeds, the model sailboats on its circular basin, and for the picturesqueMedici Fountain, built in 1620. In the sprawling concrete metropolis of Paris these wonderful immaculately kept gardens dotted throughout the city are a welcome respite for weary tourists taking in the multitude of attractions in the area. With glorious ornate gardens, impressive architecture, lakes, statues and fountains it\u2019s ideal for photographers or simply to relax in one of the many seating/reclining areas and chill with a glass of wine and simply watch the world go by. The gardens are popular with tourists, locals, walkers, runners and lovers alike taking advantage of this tranquil setting.

It's simply an oasis of quiet, calm, and stunningly landscaped flowers and greenery where Parisians go to relax, talk, and read. The anchor is the beautiful Palais du Luxembourg. Take a leisurely stroll and soak up the Gardens' statues, flower beds, hedges and delicious ambiance. Don't miss the breathtaking Fountain of the Medicis, which we did not find until our third visit."

The fountains are gorgeous and there is plenty of seating available."

There are areas to listen to music and other areas of quiet. With 60 acres of green space, paths, fountains and statues, there is a place for everyone and everything.

A large public place with a plethora of mini-areas that are distinct and yet seem tailor-made for various situations. On a number of days, we jogged through the park and turned around at the distinctive Pyramid of the Louvre. On other days, we wandered the various paths seeking solace with what amounts to nature in the middle of a massive city. We sat by a small lake, surrounded by Parisian families just enjoying the spring air and feeding the ducks (and unfortunately the pigeons) while keeping thought of returning to work at bay. There are a number of dining options within the park but they seemed either too cheesy or too expensive (poor value) and so we never ate anything in the park that we didn't bring with us from outside. But, I would say that the Luxembourg Gardens are a fantastic place to take in some of the ambiance of Paris without the crowds."

There are lots of great individual chairs that can be moved around which was nice.Overall, it's a beautiful park so if you need some downtime after exploring Paris and want to relax away from crowds I highly recommend coming here.

There is a merry-go-round with a typical Parisian game of \"catch-the-ring-with-your-wand-and-get-a-prize\", and puppet representations in a traditional th\u00e9atre de marionettes. You can also rent miniature sail boats that kids can have fun maneuvering with a stick in one of the basins.For adults, it is a great place to run, to sun-bathe by the fountains on the chairs and deck chairs at your disposal, to visit (do not miss the Medici fountain), or to just stroll. Not far from Montparnasse and the Pantheon it has much less tourists that the Jardins des Tuileries, which makes it much more authentic. Do not miss the photo exhibit on its outer gates which takes you on an exploration of the French mountain landscapes."

The Luxembourg Gardens are no exception.Well well worth a 2 hour visit in a tight schedule.The gardens are beautifully landscaped and you'll see Paris residents relaxing here. Many who live in apartments see the gardens as their front garden. You can't take a bad picture here.Find the very first Statue of Liberty here. Its fiendishly well hidden. Indeed they don't make a big fuss about it.But it predates the New York version.It is of course much smaller. maybe 2metres high.Get there by number 38 bus going south from Boulevard San Michel. Costs 2 euros. Or take the RER to Luxembourg station.Try a cafe Corse at the booth, which was surprisingly good. The park shuts overnight so don't think about a midnight trip here. There is no entry fee."

It was a spectacular spring day and all of the locals were on the lounge chairs \"catching the rays.\" The children were playing with boats on the pond - which is always fun to watch. The gardeners were planting the spring flowers so it was a bit early for a beautiful floral display. The Parisians love this park and they use it to jog, relax, picnic, play tennis, walk the baby and to socialize in general. It is a very tranquil, peaceful beautiful park and is definitely worth visiting."

The gardens are at various levels and can easily be accessed by stairs. I saw kids sailing little boats in the big pond in the centre of the grounds and kids on ponies. The locals obviously enjoy the facility and one of the lawns can be accessed. There were a large number of people on the lawn enjoying the spring sun. This is a great garden to visit."

I was lucky enough to visit on a warm sunny day and was the perfect place to meet up with one of my best friends' and his children. Watching all the children run around together was so cute and the gardens/park made a great place to play hide and seek (hehehe it was a perfect place to be a 4-6 year old again) The place is very relaxed, something quite amazing considering you're in the middle of a large city, and its beautifully designed with both French and English styled gardens, numerous statues (including a miniature version of the statue of Liberty (Because yes she's French)) and monuments a HUGE pond (Grand Basin as its known) and smaller ponds dotted around. It even has its own little theatre.The gardens are very safe, as it is also the home of the French Senat, which has to be one of the most stunning buildings I've ever seen (It's completely different from a lot of the other palaces in Paris and was one of the first to be built so close to the road (many were set back)), it is dutifully guarded by Gendarmes although their presence is non opposing and its almost like they make an effort to stand back just far enough for you to feel free to do as you please but still know they are there. Not to mention after talking to a few, my aforementioned friend being one of them, you come to find they're pretty nice normal people even on duty (I wouldn't recommend it but I even got away with a little flirting with one, I was in Paris would you expect any less?)All the people I saw there were also unbelievably beautiful just like the gardens they were sat in. It is true that there are different seasons for different visitors and almost unanimously every time I visit its filled with predominately French people.The only thing I'd note is there is only one patch of grass you're allowed to sit on but there are so many chairs that's not a problem and there are signs to tell you were you can and can't sit if you get confused"

Then there is the 'main strip' where you have a round pond and another grass area, both of which have chairs all around them so you can sit in comfort and relax.If you are in Paris and just want to relax in some beautiful surroundings then I would take a walk to Patisserie Sadaharu Aoki and get yourself some tasty treats and then pull up a seat in the park and just people watch for an hour or two."

Any sentient tourist has at least seen pictures of kids pushing model sailboats in the Grand Basin and of the glorious French and English gardens, but nothing captures the pulse of the place better than a stroll through the gates and along the miles of gravel paths. All ages, shapes and sizes of Parisians take to the paths these mornings, in such densities and speeds that strollers like us retreat to the hundreds perhaps thousands of olive green steel chairs that the groundskeepers devised more than 90 years ago. The chairs are relaxing for reading, sunning and courting, perhaps obscuring their real purpose, which is to discourage people from lounging on all but a small patch of the impeccable lawns. For services and surprises, the Luxembourg Garden clearly outranks other celebrated playgronds from Eden to even the 14-times larger Central Park in NewYork. For 200 years, for example, the garden has supported an apiary, a museum in itself and a brilliant service to the surrounding flower beds. Then there are the orchards of more than 500 varieties of more than 1,000 pear and apple trees, all splendidly espaliered, from seedlings to octogenarians."

This is the perfect place to have a pic-nic, a nap, take a run, or simply walk through the gardens and fountains. There are certain green spaces where you cannot step in. Best month to go: April. The location is an advantage since it is in the middle of Paris, very close to the quartier Saint Germain des Pr\u00e9s."

It's not free (\u20ac2.50 per adult and \u20ac1.50 per child) but I guess having a charge prevents over crowding. The best part of the playground is that there is a separate area for kids age 7+, so little kids don't get trampled by big ones. Also, there is a covered area with benches, as well as a kiosk selling snacks and drinks.Outside the playground is a really old carousel, and I have read that there are also pony rides, but we didn't see it. We did see the remote controlled toy boats available for hire, but we didn't try them."

Walking through museums and chateaux and you wish to relax like a true Parisian, then I suggest you take the Metro (underground railroad) to the Luxembourg for a few relaxing hours. The Metro station is Luxembourg.I suggest you walk around the garden to admire the statues and the bee 'school' before you sit down beside the large pond. On a warm day you may even be able to dip your feet in the pool and no park guard will blow his whistle at you.There are kiosks in the garden if you feel a little hungry or thirsty, and there is also a restaurant where if the weather is kind you can sit outside under the trees. As this area of Paris is where the students live, the prices are not at all steep.There is no fee to enter the garden.If you exit the garden on Rue Guynemer, you will see a Rue Fleurus which runs from it. Just a few buildings along Rue Fleurus is where Gertrude Stein and her lover Alice B. Toklas lived and where the two played hostess to such famous writers as Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald, and the Spanish-born artist Pablo Picasso. There is a plaque outside the building where they had lived."

Sometimes I come to give my feet a rest or to sit on a bench or in a chair and eat lunch. But often, I just amble through the beautiful gardens, which encompass about 57 acres behind the Luxembourg Palace, seat of the French Senate. I walk along the promenades, admiring the colorful flower beds, statues, lovely lawns and the stunning Baroque Medici Fountain.Visitors often gather around the large octagonal pond with a central fountain known as the \"Grand Basin.\" Children can rent model sailboats to sail there. Other activities for the younger set include a puppet theatre, a fenced-in playground, a merry-go-round and pony rides. There is also a cafe on the grounds.The Musee du Luxembourg, the oldest public museum in Paris, stands on the edge of the gardens. Many excellent temporary art exhibitions have been held there, and I recommend checking to see if one of interest will be on during your visit. Sometimes, the wrought-iron grill that surrounds the gardens features an art exhibition, and I have never been disappointed in any that I've seen.To escape the large crowds that come here, I recommend arriving in early morning when most visitors will be jogging around the inside perimeter or late afternoon. There are many restaurants near the gardens. RER B Luxembourg Gardens is closer than any Metro stop."

To the west is the gardens and tress with sandy walkways and a special area for children to play. It is the quieter part of the park and not in the sunlight. This is a more functional garden. Then there is the main area with all the people sunbathing on metal chairs even if there is only a hint of sunlight. It is a joy to watch the little ones with their boats flooding around the pond with a fountain in the middle. When our little one was a bit younger it was a great investment of 3 Euros for 15 minutes."

Or just sit on one of the many parkside benches for a picnic (as do many of the Sorbonne students or office workers in the area.

Perhaps it is a non-permanent seasonal structure. I especially loved the lovely statues of various queens in the area just south of the octagonal sailboat pond. The Senat building on the north side of the garden is beautiful (and heavily patrolled). On weekday mornings near the tennis courts, there are people who do something like tai chi with swords and fans, with an instructor standing by, and they can do it because there aren't so many people. On the weekends, there are families and children, so nice to see. Charming place to visit and revisit."

The gardens are great all year round but my favourite times are late spring and autumn when so much comes into bloom and the couleurs are so vivid.You could spend hours here walking the paths, looking at the statues, the magnificent Medicis fountain or just sitting on a bench or a seat and watching the world go by.Bring your lunch, a coffee or a ice cream and just soak up all the calmness before going back out into the real world and everyday life."

This I can only assume getting ready for the Summer. The whole area was well tended and although a little cold, I can imagine it being a calm and relaxing place to visit when the blossom and leaves are in the trees. The gardens cover a vast area, with cafes, tennis courts and play areas. Because of the flatness of the area it does attract a lot of runners. The French Senate building sits at the end of the gardens and is a good looking building enhanced by the gardens. Would definitely return in warmer months to be able to take in the atmosphere and sunshine."

There is a small caf\u00e9 on the grounds, so you can have a beverage and/or snack and people watch for a while as you gather your composure before continuing your stroll through the garden to find the next gem of discovery.

The Jardin was so beautiful, verdant, lots of colourful flowers, Palm trees, fountains, along with some hidden ones to discover. The restaurant under the canopy of trees was fantastic to drink coffee and for people watching. The painting class only enriched the experience of the Jardin, and allowed me to take it all in.

The \"Jardin de Luxembourg\", located at Paris' busy and affluent \"6\u00e9me Arrondissement\", quite near famous \"Boulevard de Saint-Germain\" and \"Boulevard Saint-Michel\", may be considered the green heart of the \"Quartier Latin\"! Amazing gardens, manicured lawns, all extremely clean and well kept: a real wonder in our days! \"Jardin du Luxembourg was created in 1612 by Queen Marie de M\u00e9dicis, widow of King Henry IV and mother of King Louis XIII of France. Missing her native Italy, she decided to build herself a new palace (the \"Palais de Luxembourg\") in imitation of Florence's \"Pitti Palace\", surrounded by parks and gardens resembling those of her childhood. Queen Marie de M\u00e9dicis, regent of France, probably didn't imagine the importance of her gestures for the future generations. The \"Palais de Luxembourg\" is still there and houses today the French Senate. The garden, covering 23 hectares, brings shade, freshness and beauty to Paris. Stroll slowly along its lawns, alleys and promenades. Enjoy each corner, each detail and pay special attention to basins and fountains (specially the fantastic \"Fontaine de M\u00e9dicis\"). During Summer months, hundreds of students are seeing around the garden at open-air drawing classes! Really amazing! If you dare to miss a visit to this magnicent garden, I bet you will regret forever! Enjoy!"

There are chairs everywhere for people watching, quiet time, and reading your favorite book. Often there is a photo display on the iron fence just up from the Odeon. This is quintessential Paris, and free. The Luxembourg Palace was also Nazi headquarters during WW2 and a prison during the French Revolution (1793). The Senate is not open to the public (except by special arrangement, I think), but there is a Museum to explore (with moderate charge).

The gardens were originally the palace gardens, for the palace which is now the French Senate building.There are chess boards in one area of the park, next to tennis courts, other ball game courts and petanque areas. Pony rides available in another part of the park during the warmer months. There are normally small kiosks selling snacks and drinks, and a permanent cafe installed in the park. There are bathrooms open during business hours, with a 0.20E charge.This park is a great place to bring a picnic during the summer, and many Parisians and visitors to the city will do the same. It's nice to watch the little boats sailing on the fountain pond in the centre of the park, and a good place to go running as well, you will be in good company!"

Especially enjoyable is the long vista South from around the pond in front of the Musee. The gardens are closed at night and you wouldn't want to go in them anyway, as they are unlit."

Kept our kids fascinated and active for hours - a great break from the more adult-directed activities and an easy stroll back to the Latin Quarter for a late lunch. Great way to spend a winters morning with the kids. Note that there is a small fee for entry to the playground - 2.50 euro per child and 1.20 per adult."

Well, maybe the Luxembourg Gardens are not among the traditional 'main ones', but, if you need a break from haring around, this is a good place to do it. Just give yourself an hour or two's rest in these gardens and you'll be ready to get back on the tourist treadmill, revived and refreshed. When I first visited these gardens in the 1970s I was disappointed. They did not appear to be well looked after, with their patchy lawns, lack of flower beds and abundance of dog poo. Revisiting in 2012 I was very pleasantly surprised, with all the above problems rectified, and in 2014 I found myself going there four or five times during my 10 week stay in Paris (for work). The highlight this year was seeing the interior of the Luxembourg Palace, at the north end of the Gardens. It is a beautiful former royal palace which now houses the Senate (the French equivalent of Britain's House of Lords). Its Conference Hall, which overlooks the gardens, is simply magnificent, with superbly preserved tapestries, painted ceilings and the throne that Napoleon used to sit on. It isn't open often, but is well worth the visit if you find a day when it is. It opens to the public on the \"Journees du Patrimoine\" (Heritage Days) which happen during one weekend in September each year. They also open the palace greenhouses with their rare orchids (again not usually open to the public). The Gardens' focal point is the Octagonal Pond with its toy sailing yachts which can be hired, great fun for your kids, but the Gardens contain other points of interest. It's a very relaxing place to stroll around, and has lots of tree shade, should you find yourself there on a hot day. Oh, and it has many hundreds of chairs to sit on, should you wish to really relax, or people-watch. When you're ready to resume your 'serious' tourism, the Gardens are very close to the Pantheon, the Latin Quarter and the church of Saint-Sulpice. These Gardens do not charge for entry, and are a welcome, tranquil haven if you have enough time in your schedule."

Ordered by Marie de Medicis in 1612, to surround her palace, Luxembourg gardens design have been restored under the first Empire area. It is now owned by the French Senate based in Luxembourg Palace. Its a perfectly placed spot to have a break while touring in Paris, up the hill next to Notre Dame Cathedral and below the Pantheon. I go there almost every Sunday morning from 10 AM to 1 PM to practice RC sailing boat within an informal club of hobbyists. During summertime, little sailing models (not radio controlled) are for rent to enjoy kids and make them having some fun around the fountain while parents are in need of time to relax. Many chairs are available, some more comfortable than other, would you find the one that fits you the best? It's a nice place to meditate on where your are, where you come from and where you go. With the Actual Senate Palace next to you, and those little sloop sailing yacht in the basin, you might drift backward in time and see little kids in old fashioned clothes, or the Duchess Marie looking at you from the Palace windows. Once recovered from your resting time, you may have a few walk down to the gardens and enjoy the techniques of cultivating fruit trees or just have fun under big ornamental ones. It is true that many joggers uses the park to improve their pace, but they are just turning around the park, once inside, you'll see them only on your way to quit the place. Then it's you choice: go up East to the Pantheon, down North to the old center to Notre-Dame or South to reach Montparnasse or West (North west) to have a walk form there to the Hotel des Invalides (passing close to Hotel Matignon). This last option is a long walk but will make you see some really nice architecture all along the way."

While the Palace serves as the seat of the French Senate, ordinary folks are free to enjoy the park grounds. And its popularity shows in the number of visitors that are here daily. Families bring the kids for a stroll, feed the ducks or sail toy boats in the central octagonal basin facing the palace. Others sit, read or reflect on the benches or lawns. All in all, it's a good place to slow down and relax. But the park is also well known for its statuary collection - stroll a short distance to find the stunning Fontaine Medicis, and there are also about twenty statues of French queens or famous women arranged in a relative semi-circle around the basin."

I first visited as a tourist five years ago & fell in love with the place then, to experience Parisian life first hand watching the locals enjoying their space and the atmosphere that is created by everyone from tots to teens & beyond making use of open free park space is magical. From jogging to tennis, Nordic walking to tai chi, kite flying to sail boats, donkey rides to go carting, boules to swing boats, the list is endless including a childrens puppet theatre & several places to sit and eat or drink or picnic if the weather permits . There are changing free exhibitions in the orangery during the summer months, and a extensive list of concerts at the band stand which for me is the only time I came close to being home-sick when listening to English school children playing to a large audience and really enjoying their moment. There are no bikes allowed in the park and only a very small area where dogs are allowed, but I think this is a bonus as it means it is dog dirt free which can not be said for the rest of Paris ! Of course to see the park in the spring & summer is a bonus, all the planting is at its best but living in the arrondisement I visit almost daily and it never fails to please me. Playing tennis there is another highlight or simply just sitting and watching others play, taking in the sunshine or chatting to people from all walks of life, my idea of heaven, will it be yours ?"

There is nothing wrong with it - there are expansive grounds to stroll about and enjoy the peace and quiet, observing the local at play. One facility not encountered before is the free chairs scattered throughout some Paris city parks, especially those that incline backwards - great for a rest in the sunshine.As Gardens go this is probably average compared to that in other major cities. A good spot to relax as part of a city visit but not worth a special trip."

This is where the locals on the Left Bank take take a stroll, meet friends, and eat their lunch (on the green chairs scattered throughout). One end of the gardens is located a block from the Pantheon and the Latin Quarter so definitely visit while you are exploring the Left Bank. The gardens are nice, fairly quiet, with fountains, playgrounds for kids, and the buildings which house museums. Also a good way to get from the Latin Quarter to Montparnassse."

I heard lots of folks preach its virtues, but when I got there, it just looked like any old large European park, or American park, in a great city would, better than most, but not worth flying around the world to see. Even so, Paris was a fine thing to see, (although how they manage to have a more miserable subway than San Francisco is somewhat of a wonder). Anyhow, this park is fine if you need to cut through it on the way to something else, and/or, if you have lots of time around town. If you have only a couple of days, maybe brush by and peek in it to say you saw it, but don't worry that you missed anything. In fact, if you want gardens that are the best on the planet, go to Versailles first, then if you have time, pass though this park just to check it off your bucket list."

Find a chair, one of those reclining ones, perhaps a little wine and snack, and just chill out ! people watch. These gardens are more family orientated because of the swings and park, sail a boat on the main pond or if you feel more energetic play tennis.Don\u2019t miss the art posters on the railing surrounding the garden !"

I imagine all the children who live in the tall apartments surrounding the garden playing in this park as their back yard. A place to play with the boats, paths for their bicycles, tennis courts, and other attractions. But I also note that many, many locals sit out, facing the sun, capturing a few moments of rest, warmth, and relaxation during their day, before work, during lunch, for a break. But perhaps, that is just how I would use such a great park if it were in my town."

Well, not really. But the Parisians love the place too. It was an odd October Saturday afternoon - 80 degrees! Sat and stared and relaxed and read. Only issue was making sure I wasn't close to someone smoking. A lot fewer smokers than even 10 years ago, but still... And it's so fun to watch the little kids with the boats in the big pool. From the gardens, it's a short walk to Boulevard St Michel where I discovered Simon - the parapluie or umbrella store. Pricey? I replaced my traveling umbrella with nice sturdy model that was worth it. And a short stroll further on down to the many Gibert Jeune bookstores! Print is not dead! I picked up some great books to improve my French. And you can find English language books too."

With Eiffel Tower in the background, you can admire the flowers or the little lake in the front of the Palace, while you sit on the chairs that are surrounding the gardens. It is one of my favourite places in Paris, where you detach from the city life and simply relax. Great place for taking photos even if it's raining, the contrast between flowers and sky being fantastic. Highly recommending."

I would go running here in the mornings at around 8 (early for Paris time!) and enjoy the quiet serenity with the other runners. The autumn leaves were crunching underfoot and made for some beautiful photos along with stunning flower beds. My must see of the trip. It does get very busy throughout the day so I would go early."

It's great for kids with donkey rides, little yacht boats for hire to push for kids to push with sticks from the sides of le Grand Bassin, a merry-go-round where kids can collect keys as they glide round and every-so-often a puppet show. As for the adults - a feast of the senses of the French and English gardens, and a discovery trail - whether seeking out the bee hives nestled in a corner since 1856, the orchid and rose gardens, the graceful Baroque Medici fountain (or the more secret Fontaine de Leda) or the free photography exhibitions hung on the railings. Definately highly recommended!"

When the chestnuts blossom, or on a hot July afternoon, or like now when the leaves turn golden and fall.For reading - be it a newspaper, poetry or my iPad -, having an improvised picnic, lazily watching busy children running after their sailboats around the central pond, socialising with friends or watching people - those many available green chairs have a magic attraction on me. And compared to Central Park Luxembourg Garden is tiny - there is no risk of getting lost. So try it, try getting lost, wonder around without a purpose (I still haven't found all the statues which are supposed to be famous...), and enjoy your day.Joie de vivre...and highly recommended!"

The flowers and garden are immaculate and of course, the palace, pond and statuary all add to the ambiance. Bio Marche St. Germain is a great market for supplies and Le Bon Marche also has everything your could need for a picnic, including many bio (organic) items. Lovely place!"

It is a short walk from the Pantheon (3-5 minutes), Sorbonne (5 minutes), and Quartier Latin (10-15 minutes). The Musee de Luxembourg is located in the park which often features nice exhibitions. For kids is a nice place to run around, and you can hire boats which they can play with in the pond which keeps them busy and running for at least half an hour. Perfect when the weather is nice. Note that it has opening hours - first half of october it closes at 18:45, second half 17:15 and so on (time table available on webpages of senat.fr)."

Nearest metro stations are Luxembourg or Saint-Sulpice. The Pantheon is very close by. It is a perfect place to bring kids. The huge central lake has model boats for hire and plenty of park benches. Elsewhere you will find tennis courts, boule and hidden away a puppet theatre. The grounds are Italian Baroque in style and were built for Marie de Medici in 1615, who lived in the impressive Luxembourg Palace. Today the palace is home to the French Senate and guarded by gendarmes. Hidden away near the park entrance on Rue Guynemer in the west is the earliest version of the Statue of Liberty."

This royal palace is certainly one of Paris' smaller royal residences (esp compared to Versaille, Fontainebleau, and the Louvre - which was originally a palace), but the scale is perfect and the grounds and gardens are lovely. There is a large pond where vendors rent small model sailboats to children on week-ends. The flowering gardens are beautiful, and the formal gardens are lovely. A very popular place for locals to relax and sun on week-ends. The palace is now a government building, but it is a regal and royal setting - and fortunately the gardens and grounds have been kept public. Not to be missed!"

Exceptional use of color, texture, space and motion in the design of the flower beds adds to the enjoyable experience. Wander among the trees and check out the sculptures. I found them hidden along the winding paths. The morning is quieter and has less people. Those enjoying the garden included people relaxing, reading, watching people or just talking to each other. Children were playing kickball with their school groups or climbing on play equipment. There is enough space for everyone to do their own activity without getting in the way of others. Park attendants were helpful. Walking paths are clearly delineated. I loved the energy and essence of these gardens.Hidden away and almost missed is the Medici Fountain."

There is so much history here, from the architecture to the generations who have grown up with this beautiful setting as their playground.

Relax with a picnic, play tennis, stroll with your lover or family-this is one of the most beautiful places in the world to chill. You don't have to travel to Thailand or Cambodia or Ayres Rock in Australia. Luxembourg Gardens has a special aura about it..a special feeling and presence.

Loved that you can just pull up a comfortable green chair almost anywhere you choose to sit and enjoy these beautiful gardens, whether you want to sunbathe or sit under the leafy trees. Two styles, one for laying back in! People playing tennis where you could sit and watch and others doing yoga or fen shui on the grass. A beautiful park with such atmosphere and plent or buy takeaway or icecreams. Only negative comment is we were approached several times by young women asking charmingly 'do you speak English?' and when you smile, assuming they need help with a map, they ask you to add your signature to 'help deaf and mute children'. A big con so beware. My husband had to raise his voice to get rid of them the third time!"

The gardens were designed for a Medici princess who later became queen of France. Construction of the gardens began in about 1612 and its design was heavily influenced by \"Italian Baroque.\"While the history is important, this background was the furthest thing from my mine when I was walking though the gardens.

One area was set aside for young children accompanied by their parents could play. There was also an art exhibition in a building at one end.

The subway exactly opens at the entrance of the Garden. So if you are new to Paris (like me) I would recommend taking the metro to reach here.Before I came here, I had just heard about this place through one of my colleagues who has been here earlier and had squeezed it in my itinerary, but trust me it was worth a visit. I was here with my 1.5 year old and my wife and they both loved it.It is a HUGE, beautifully landscaped garden and has something for everyone. It is a place where you will find the Parisians in a different AVATAR (experience a different side), some enjoying with their friends, some reading books, few families come for a picnic, someone sipping beer and some just come for sun bathing... Its a place to relax and unwind. One can grab a chair and sit at any place which you like. It has beautiful old fountain called Medici fountain and of-course one cannot miss the huge Luxembourg Palace. In case you are thirsty or hungry there is a food kiosk available. If you are low on budget then there is a MC Donald right outside the garden, across the street.Enjoy!;-)"

Luckily we managed to end up with dreamy memories thanks in part to smartly packing delicious french sandwiches for mid day picnics in the parks between sites. The Luxembourg Gardens are the best. Next to climbing to the top of the Eiffel Tower, this was the favorite place in Paris for our 8 and 11 year olds. Peering in from the gate promises lush fantasy settings for picnicking or setting up your eisle to paint, but there are so many things to do here beyond leisurely reading a book, polishing off a bottle of wine or snoozing. For only 3 Euros (for 30 min) our kids were completely thrilled to slide a little wooden boat into the big fountain pond and captain it with a wooden stick like kids have been thrilled to do for more than 100 years. Seriously they LOVED doing this. It may be the one thing they tell their own kids about one day. That and the little carousel by the playground and the puppet theatre. Don't be shy, ask where the pony rides are and walk just beyond them to the little carousel. This little ride is only 1.5 Euros per child for a nice long ride\u2026.but unlike to touristy carousels near the Eiffel tower, this old fashioned little ride is a game too! Be sure to get a horse on the outside of the circle. Those children are the only ones who get a small wooden baton which they use to try to hook a small brass ring (think jousting knight) as they pass a little green dragon. It's a very old game invented right along with carrousels, but somewhere forgotten in the larger display models in touristy areas. Our kids were in heaven.Also a kid classic-- the Theatre Guignol. Guignol is a famous puppet from the early 1800's in France. The puppet shows are at 4pm on weekdays and 11am & 4pm on the weekend days. The plays are in French, but they are full of action and are so much visual fun, everyone will enjoy watching this very traditional show.Fill your spent water bottles in the drinking fountains and save your Euros for an ice cream. Your kids will think France is magical."

Although Paris itself was not very clean in June 2014, the Luxembourg Gardens were. A great place to just sit, watch the crowd, enjoy the sun, and chill out. We were treated to an unexpected exhibition of World War 1 with very rare photos. There was one of various Indian soldiers fighting in France basking in the sun. It was a dramatic display of the pain Europe had gone through the war and how many Indians, Africans, Australians, etc fought for a cause they had little connection to. You should plan to spend about 1-2 hours here."

But still nice place to chill out with lots of chairs to enjoy a nice takeaway meal! The children's play area was mostly pay-to-play and with so many kids being herded in, we decided to give it a skip. The carousel was not that pretty but there was some sort of improvisation to make up for that: kids were given a stick and as they went around, they had to use it like a lance to catch some metal rings. Don't think there were any prizes for the kid with the most rings, but it still looked quite fun. Only thing was that any kid unfortunate enough to be sitting on the inner parts of the ride were not able to participate, making the experience a very depressing one for both kid and parent. Every round reinforces what a dumb and terrible decision it was to sit in the inside and eventually, after some irreparable psychological damage has scarred your kid for life, you will feel so guilty that you pay for another ride (so he can sit on the OUTside this time) but all the while you know its too late... the damage has been done."

The old Palace provides a stunning backdrop to children playing with toy boats on the small boating lake whilst a band played nearby under the trees.If you are in the area and fancy a short time of reflection away from the busy streets, then take a stroll through here, you will enjoy it."

The gardens are beautiful and free to enjoy, but almost everything in this park for the kids costs money, but it is still cheaper than any of the museums in Paris. Here are some of the activities we tried:1. There is a large playground which you have to pay to enter (2.50 Euro per child, 1.20 Euro per adult but adults can wait outside if your kids are older ie. 5+). The playground has good climbers and slides, and the big attraction is a zipline like ride that does a little loop. Go early in the day for the zipline, as it gets lined-up in the afternoon.2. You can rent a model sailboat for 3 Euro for 30 minutes and \"sail\" it around the pond. Watching other kids at first it seemed a little lame because you just direct the boat with a stick and give it a push (a remote control would seem more interesting), but the kids enjoyed their half hour, and you meet lots of other tourists when your boat collides with theirs.3. Pony rides for 3.50 Euros last about 5 minutes.4. There was also a puppet show (http://www.marionnettesduluxembourg.fr/acceuil.html) for 4.80 Euros that appears to run daily in the summer, but we did not go.The park is also a busy place with an area for chess matches. There were also a few tables playing contract bridge. We also saw a boot camp and a tai chi class."

You can spend hours there, walking around, sitting on one of the many chairs available for free, watching people play tennis, etc. It's a very beautiful and relaxing place to be.The cafe is another story. The waiter was extremely rude to us. There's a walk up window to get food and drinks attached to the same building the restaurant is in, but I guess they are separate. It is not obvious. We had some drinks from it, so the waiter would not help us find a table and chairs (people move them around) even though we wanted to order lunch from the restaurant. He didn't send us away, but wasn't helpful either. Later I guessed it was because we had drinks from the walk up stand, but I'll never know for sure. He made hand gestures at us, gave us dirty looks, and somehow got my wife to clear dirty plates of previous guests from the table we were trying to sit at (while I was off trying to fetch chairs). He ultimately refused to wait on us. As one of the reviews below noted, it did sort of ruin the experience. I also saw the waiter chase and confront another patron into the restroom area. Incredible. Almost like a parody of the well-known stereotype, except it was for real. The people in the walk up stand were nice though."

They got boats and sticks to play with in the fountain, that was entertaining for a bit, and then we got a drink at the cafe. The waiter was overworked and insanely rude to us - we asked for a small lemonade and he brought us a giant Sprite (for 6 Euro). Sprite is not lemonade, FYI and 2 small lemonades shouldn't cost 13 Euros! So when we complained he got really rude and that sort of ruined the experience.

First of all we hired a boat to sail on the pond, which was hectic but fun, then we sat in the sunshine and watched the children play on the grass...for all of 3 minutes, until they were reprimanded by the park guards! The man who told them to 'keep off the grass' said that there were dangerous animals that could cause them harm on the grass!! I really couldn't work out if he was joking or not. We gave up on the grass and headed for the playground. By the time we got there it was around 5.20. A quick play on the climbing frame and then we would head out for food, or so I thought. However, when we got to the playground we realised that to enter we would have to pay 2.50 euros per child and 1.20 (approx) euros per adult. We were disgusted. It was absolutely packed in there and looked like a complete headache, without having to pay for the privilege! If we had been intending to spend the whole day there it would of been slightly different, but for a 10 minute play it just wasn't worth it. I don't think we have ever had to pay to go into a 'public' playground before. Even the Diana memorial playground in London is free of charge."

If as a parent you don't want to pay the entrance, you can just pay for your kids and then sit outside the fence and watch them from there. As an american, a bit weird to have to pay to use a playground, but it was well worth it. These gardens also had sailboats for 3 Euros/ half hour. We got sailboats and the kids pushed them with a long stick. The fountain in the middle of the pond eventually brings the boats back to the edge. Our kids enjoyed this as well. Nicely kept gardens as it belongs to the government. Great trees and shade. They sell snacks and sandwiches. there was even a pony ride that you can pay for but we didn't do it."

My wife had read about the Gardens prior to our trip. It was on her to-do list. If you had asked me ahead of time I honestly would have passed. It turned out to be a wonderful introduction to Paris and a great way to decompress after the flight and the Metro ride to the hotel. It is so relaxing and the grounds are impeccable. We got a kick out of watching several men play Bocce ball. I could not understand a word they were saying except for, \"Oh, merde!\" after a miss-throw and, \"Viola!\" with a winner. Here one will also find the Luxembourg palace, children pushing toy sailboats in the Palace pool, many statues including the original model for our Statue of Liberty. We sought out the marionette theater but we could not find it. There is much going on here yet it is still very calming. One could spent the good part of a day here with a picnic basket and a bottle of wine. My wife and I had neither so after about 90 minutes, we left to see what else Paris had to offer."

No cost to enter the garden. Opportunity to rent little wooden boats to sail in the fountain. Beautiful place to take photographs."

The atmosphere was very relaxed and not too crowded. We didn't see any boats for hire in the fountain, but our kids had a wonderful time - the park inspired their imaginations. While our children played, we just relaxed in those fabulous chairs and enjoyed the people, the flowers, the landscaping and the scenery. It was a glorious sunny day. Please just go!"

We decided to take public transportation through the public bus which was only 8 euro a person. If we took the metro we would have stopped to many places for transfers. The bus dropped us off right in front of the majestic Luxembourg Gardens entrance. As you enter their are many cafe's which are very overpriced so I recommend going across the street to pick up stuff or find a small non commercialized hut selling food/drink. The gardens are nice many locals exercising and reading. Beware it does get crowded after noon so arrive around noon to get a chair.There are chairs dispersed all over the park some lounge chairs if you can find them. There is a small view of la tour d'eiffel and of course the palace of Luxembourg. There is art all around the park specifically lion statues. The park has flowers all over and is beautifully maintained. We went on Bastille Day so the palace was closed and I dont know if it has an entry fee. Bathrooms in the park cost money to attend also. In the park their are people trying to sell boats to put in a fountain but they wont bother you unless you bother them. My favorite part probably of this is their was no venders trying to sell a eiffel tower or t-shirt. Afterwards you can go to the pantheon down the street a block away which is also nice. Overall this was beautiful and would gladly attend again."

There was a snack restaurant next to the playground where we ordered a croq monsieur and enjoyed it on the lawn in front of the lake/fountain area. After lunch we went down to the fountain and found you could rent little boats that you could put in the fountain and push with sticks when they got too close to the side.

If you feel more a tube you can carry a ball or play tennis or cycle around too. My fave is to just sit around eat n watch the world go by."

It was funny as many of the young men had their wares set out then scooped up the tarps and scurried off when officials came by as did the mini-Eiffel Tower salesmen. Very enterprising, especially the young man with a bucket containing bottles of water; I was almost willing to buy one over the bright watercolor prints of local highlights (I didn't buy either as I had a watercolor print from my last visit to Paris, and I was also afraid that if I pulled out money and bought something would be like the images of showing money to beggars in other areas). Later it looked like the young men were handing off to the next shift off to the side of the gardens, just like a changing shift at a factory; later we spoke to a local where very indignant as those free enterprise vendors don't pay taxes to the state. I'm pretty sure that there are rule against stepping on the grass, but I can't guarantee it as we stayed to the wide paths. The benches were full as we wandered mid-day on a beautiful sunny day."

Afterwards we went to the playground (2E50 per child for all-day play with in-and-out, and I think 1E20 per adult).There were plenty of seats outside for parents to watch their children play from afar. There was a great climbing net, a fun zipline and a big climbing/slide structure in the part that was meant for kids over 6, and the other side had equipment for kids under 6. Our 4 year old loved the big kid side. I wished we'd gone there earlier in the day to get more bang for our buck and more play time for our kid.We also treated her to a pony ride (3E30 or so) of 300m which she loved. The flowers were just beautiful. I really wished we'd had more time to spend here."

There were chairs and benches were visitors could sit to read, eat or do whatever else they pleased.

My best part about this park is that it is very dog friendly. you hardly see a leash all the dogs are close to their masters. There is a small pool area which all the dogs seemed to love. Not only would they splash in the water they would jump into the poor area nearly coming up to their necks. I think I saw \"dog laughter\" for the first time. This is such a beautiful park. A little something for everyone. If you don't like to walk you can rent a pedi vehicle which can sit two, four or six (it also has an electric motor)."

But they were still beautiful and very photogenic so I recommend seeing this site although it is not as spectacular as for example Shonenbrun in Vienna. It is better than the Tulleries but not as convenient since that is next to other attractions so easier to access.Paris Pass lists the closest Metro station as Odean which is technically true but if you use RER line B there is a station named Luxembourg which is right next to the gardens so use that instead. There are other lessor known attractions in the area if you have time to explore them."

She was so right and this became one of the highlights for our children while we were spent a week in Paris.

I enjoyed sitting in the green chair and watching people go by. We also went to the play grounds, which were great for our son, but there were a few injury accidents with children playing on sections of the playground that were do suited for their age (which I fault the parents for).

Our children (9, 7, 5) loved running on the paths, playing on the amazing playground, eating at the cafe and walking around the palace grounds. We just missed the time of the toy boats (they close at 6:00 I think). Also, a tip: look for surrounding metro stations vs. trying to navigate the RER to the Luxembourg station."

I found myself enjoying the sun just like a Parisian taking a break. I was hoping to see children floating boats on the pond, but that day was an afternoon of band concerts given by school children in the pavilion. Proud parents, grandparents and casual observers were able to enjoy concert of exactly the same beginner band music I remember from my children's first concerts in Naperville, Illinois USA. I felt a part of our shared experience. The gardens are huge, walking around to the shady fountain pool, people were reading, relaxing and of course, kissing..after all, this is the city of love! Spending a leisurely hour or so in the garden is good for the soul."

When compared with Jardins de Tuilleries, it's less impressive but still very relaxing. This park seems to attract less tourists as majority of the visitors the day we were there, were locals. There is a big pool in the middle where children play with remote controlled sailing ship and there are chairs all around to sit and relax. Another activity for children is ponny riding. The parc is very big, so you can chose any place you like: under the shadows, under the sun, away from all others etc. Unlike Jardins de Tuilleries, there is no caf\u00e9 inside (or at least we did not come accross to any), so if you want to have a light lunch here (which I recommend), buy it from one of shops/caf\u00e9s outside. If you are tired of walking (which is very probable when visiting Paris), these gardens will be a great spot for relaxation."

Most flowers looked recently planted and needed more time to \"fill in\" for a lush look. It was mid-June so these may be the flowers planted in early May waiting to fill out. Similar gardens in the states often transplant mature flowers into their beds and replace as needed, which doesn't emulate a natural garden at all. Color combinations in the beds were fascinating. There was a large pool in front of the palace that had small toy sailboats for rent being operated by children. It was great fun to see their excitement as they poked them from the edge with long sticks. There was also a bandstand area with many people arranging chairs to get close, but we never quite heard music being played. Lots of set up but never heard the music. There were a few food stands and also a toy kiosk for the kids. There's mounted benches and portable metal chairs everywhere which can be easily dragged around to make whatever seating arrangement you wish. Great area for people watching.

It is a beautiful place to visit and you can just relax, watching children sail small sailboats, older men playing chess or young people relaxing on the lawn. It is a beautifully manicured retreat from busyness. Plenty of people there, but a large place with lots of things to do and see"

A \"refreshing\" stroll through the Luxembourg Gardens in the cool of the early evening was definitely a simple, yet rewarding highlight of our visit to Paris. Catherine de' Medici's vision for a bit of her hometown Firenze in the midst of Paris remains true to this day. The fountains, gardens, sculpture, hidden waterways, pergolas, and grand buildings around the perimeter are not to be missed. It is a true oasis nestled beside the bustling arrondissements of Saint-Germain-des-Pres and the Latin Quarter. There was a noticeable absence of tourists at this time of day; rather local people walking with their children, walking their dogs, taking an evening run, sitting in the many chairs offered or on a stone bench tucked away near a secluded waterway, or meeting friends under the arbor for an impromptu \"picnic\" of wine and cheese! My only disappointment (and of course why I just HAVE to return!) is that we had trouble finding the entrance to the adjacent Musee du Luxembourg where there is currently an exhibition of Josephine Bonaparte: An Extraordinary Empress. Unfortunately it was very close to the museum's closing time and I suspect that the entrance was probably outside the park on the street side. If you're having dinner at a nearby restaurant, I highly recommend Luxembourg Gardens as the perfect thing to do before you dine. Although next time I might delay dinner and bring my running shoes!"

The park is the garden of the French Senate, which is itself housed in the Luxembourg Palace.The garden is largely devoted to a green parterre of gravel and lawn populated with statues and centred on a large octagonal basin of water, with a central jet of water; in it children sail model boats.The garden is famed for its calm atmosphere. Surrounding the bassin on the raised balustrade terraces are a series of statues of former French queens, saints and copies after the Antique. In the southwest corner, there is an orchard of apple and pear trees and the th\u00e9\u00e2tre des marionnettes (puppet theatre). The gardens include a large fenced-in playground for young children and their parents and a vintage carousel. In addition, free musical performances are presented in a gazebo on the grounds and there is a small cafe restaurant nearby, under the trees, with both indoor and outdoor seating from which many people enjoy the music over a glass of wine. The orangeries display art, photography and sculptures.this place feels like heaven."

We were staying in a hotel near the Gardens and having two children under often started our day with a walk through the park. The trouble was, it was often quite hard to leave! Firstly, there are chairs and deckchairs scattered throughout the gardens, so you can settle anywhere and watch the world go by. There is a little boating like where children can hire boats and push them round with a stick, in that very old-fashioned way. The edges of the park have lovely green spaces and glades, perfect for picnics. There's a bandstand so quite often music would come wafting across the grass. Then you can watch the locals playing boules - quite absorbing once you start! There is a lovely play area in the middle for children which costs a Euro or so to enter per person, but the facilities are excellent inside for tots and bigger children. This is a lovely spot. Happy memories made here!"

Whether you want to just sit and stare at a fountain and a beautiful palace, hit a tennis ball, or let your children play - this is the place for it. It's all very French in its formality - tree lined avenues, grass you're not meant to walk on - but I guess that what makes it special. Amongst the hustle and bustle of Paris, this is a much appreciated tranquil space - so grab a baguette from a nearby bakery and enjoy a sunny afternoon of people watching. If you have kids, they'll love the open space, or racing a yacht in the ornamental lake. Enjoy."

Enjoy the park, statues, fresh air, and the folks either playing sports or just enjoying the sun. On certain days there are musicans playing in the vestibules. There is also a museum located on the property which houses many rare paintings. Get a Visite Paris Metro Pass as the metro services everything in Paris and is super easy to use.Rich and Dr. Linda W"

The beautiful Palais du Luxembourg and it's spacious pond, Grand Bassin, are the central features of the park. There's a spacious grove of trees on the east side of the park that offers cooling shade and live music on a hot afternoon. Don't miss the adjacent Fontaine M\u00e9dicis, which sits at the end of a pretty, tree-lined, rectangular pond. South of the Grand Bassin is a large rectangle of grass that's flanked on both sides by avenues of square-clipped trees. It's the only place in the park where you can sit on the grass so it's full of people. If you can't find a spot on this patch of grass, there's plenty of metal chairs to lounge on throughout the park. On a busy day, the chairs are at a premium but be patient as you'll eventually find a vacant one. The best way to enjoy this special place is to while away an afternoon with a good book, bottle of wine, baguette and cheese surrounded by the locals."

Beside the Versaille as the top sample in paysage architecture, but outsde the limits of Paris, here in Paris, we have got another example of top scenery, when it concerns the gardens with the lawns,trees, flowers, pools, fountains,statues, pathways, cast iron and wooden benches.Bordered by the Rue de Vaugirard from the north and by the renown Boulevard de Saint Michel from the east, that stretches right up toward the northeast and the island, Ile de la Cite with a famous Cathedral Notre- Dame, this vast grounds around the beautiful Luxembourg Palace represent the one of the most wonderful and powerful parc, that I've ever seen in the whole world. It is a second largest public park in Paris and is located in the sixth arrondissement.There is a spectacular view, through the alley of trees with the tiny graveled walkway, at the Pantheon in the distance. I was delighted, as I strolled by the park lanes, with the monument to Jean Antoine Watteau, and naturally by Medici Fountain, since the Maria Medici, native from Florence, was the founder of the Luxembourg Jardins and the palace in the center of it. This palace was designed as the imitation of the Pitty Palace in her Florence in Italy.Beside, I stopped for a moment, to cast my glance at the original model of the Statue of Liberty and at the statue of great french writer Gustave Flaubert.After the Buttes des Chaumont, another place for genuine repose."

Children with their families, young people, or lonely readers using one of the many chairs available. There is a small lake around which people sit and chat. The building of the French Senate and the many trees provide interest and shade. Well worth a visit to pause at the end of a day sight seeing, and there are plenty of cafes in this area of the Latin Quarter to take a glass of beer or wine, or a cafe."

It's relaxing, there are lots of locals and tourists around taking advantage of the beautiful green space. The games areas (chess, tennis) and the pond for model boat sailing were fun to see.

The children enjoy sailing small boats in the fountain which can be rented; we enjoyed watching the children. The garden is elevated at one end so you can enjoy a raised view of the planting. The trees are pruned in a most unusual way making for a very beautiful corridor on exiting the garden from the far end opposite the Palace.Even on an overcast, drizzly day, it was a lovely respite."

We had a great day in the parc having a small picknick which is not allowed everywhere on the grass, but you have enough pard chairs to choose, even those at the pond in front of the palace you have chill chairs watching children playing with their toy sailboat. Looking at a old everlasting joy for children and adults."

When you get tired of the hustle and bustle of St. Germain des Pres and St. Michel, just walk a couple of blocks and you are in the garden, adjacent to the Palace. Built by Marie de\u2019 Medici, then queen of France as her \"humble\" abode away from the Palace of the King, it now houses the French Senate, a museum, and is the second largest public park in Paris. Two Medici women were Queens of France, Catherine and Marie. The first one taught them to eat with fork and knife as opposed to using their fingers, the second one brought a great deal of culture and beauty to the court and the capital, including building this Palace to remind her of the Pitti Palace in Florence and the park surrounding it. And the beautiful Medici Fountain. Yet, the French still look down on Italians\u2026 beats me why\u2026In any event, there is a Musee de Luxembourg which we did not patronize, because we wanted to benefit from the lovely afternoon in the Park. The rain had stopped and the intoxicating aroma of the blooming flowers, the buzz of the bees, the quiet talk of people walking around or seating on the free chairs all around, the blue sky, it all combined to make it just a perfect moment."

I probably wouldn't have ventured here, but I was training for a marathon and couldn't skip my run; I wanted to feel safe and wanted safe (non-cobblestoned) footing. I left my friend sleeping and hit the park before dawn on a frigid December morning and ran the outside circuit in loops, criss-crossing the interior when I got bored. It was a delightful place to run and watch the sunrise; around the park, shops and bakeries slowly opened, the smell of coffee and pastries filled the air. I began to see other runners, too, and my New York City Marathon sweatshirt attracted some attention. It is one of my fondest running memories."

Perfect and poetic sculptures... Tree - alleys... Areas of grass.... Waterfountain.... Romance.... This is actually a place to stay and explore... I guess a whole day wouldn't bee enough... Here you certainly will feel tranquility and relaxation... Our mission this day was something else, unfortunately, so we just passed through, slowly though because of its overwhelming beauty....

There are little cafes/eateries dotted around if you choose to linger for lunch or a snack. We were here in April and the weather was unseasonally hot, so the flowers were out on show. Also lessons were available for bee-keeping - now that's a first in a city! We did go back for a second walk, during the week when it was quieter and enjoyed every minute."

This is the most amazing playground I have ever seen for kids. Truly magnificent. Kids of all ages would have fun, but probably best for the 3-10 year old set. Because you have to pay (even adults) to go in, many send just their kids in and watch from just outside. Plenty of lounging chairs for parents and you can definitely keep an eye on your child even thought for a playground it is quite big. Zip lip type activity, rope climbing structure, slides, etc. Could have spent an entire day here."

The gardens are lovely and a large fountain in the middle has plenty of chairs where you can rest up between museum visits and long walks. Many folks picnic here, bringing food from other areas or from carts and small cafes within the park. Locals and tourists comingle making for interesting people-watching. Take time to kick back and put your feet up for a while and take an afternoon break here. The beautiful Luxembourg Palace is also here but I don't believe you can visit it, just admire the view from outside."

Originally founded by the Medicis in the 17th Cent., these gardens are now adjacent to the home of the French Senate, the Palais Luxembourg, separated from the gardens by a large pool. Situated in the Latin Quarter,they are the 2nd largest in Paris, and contain many points of interest. The surface is largely composed of lawns and gravel divided up by intersecting paths, along which almost 100 statues and busts are placed. They are devoted to French luminaries from the World of the Arts, notably the poets Baudelaire and Verlaine, the painters Delacroix and Watteau, the composer Massenet and, the writers Georges Sand and Flaubert. Napoleon\u2019s great military companion ---- Marshall Ney----- also has a spot. The only foreigner of note is Ludwig van Bethoven, the subject of a dramatic statue by Bourdelle, but Bartholdi\u2019s first model for the Statue of Liberty adds a recognizably foreign note. Not to be missed, and built at one end of a long ribbon of water is the Medici Fountain, constructed by the wife of Henry lV, behind which is the Fountain of Leda that once stood in a Paris street scheduled for demolition. At the South end is the Fountain of the Observatory, the work of the prolific sculptor Carpeaux. The Garden is not notable for shrubs and flowers; the only truly formal section is that of the Petit-Palais Luxembourg. Its main purpose is as a place with liberal seating where tired Parisians can park themselves, read their newspapers, gossip with their friends, and breath in a better quality of air than they will find in the rest of the city."

You heard laugh and happy screams from families. Sometimes there were concerts and performances for visitors... The Medici Fountain and the great sculptural group with the giant Polyphemus were old but timeless, a fascinating piece of art with stories and history behind. What else, you won\u2019t miss the magnificent Palais du Luxembourg that houses the French Senate..This was a well design, well used/shared garden for the public in Paris.It was worth to spend time to drop by, enjoyed the openness of this huge green space, the garden, the landscape, the view, the fountain with great sculptures.. Best time to visit : May-June. Dec.-Feb. may be chilly and too windy.A little more for sharing...My favorite itinerary when I have half day free time to spend in this neighborhood :1. Take the Metro and get off from Odeon, visit Luxembourg gardens in early afternoon.2. Have afternoon tea at Dalloyau, indulge myself with a piece of their signature cake..(Dalloyau was just across the road of the park.)3. After tea/coffee time, walk to the Pantheon direction and spend another 1-2 hours strolling along the scenic narrow streets and small courtyards..4. Find a restaurant and enjoy my dinner at Quarter Latin.."

During the summer months, Parisians escape the summer heat by taking their lunch to the Luxembourg Gardens and sitting in the metal chairs that surround this little fountain. In January, there are almost no other people there but the fountain is still running and even more lovely. It is only a short walk from the Luxembourg Palace, on the east side. Take a moment to savor the beauty of this fountain and garden in the middle of Paris."

It was gorgeous and it seemed to be a popular spot for tourists and locals alike to recline and take in the afternoon, but when it came down to it it was a garden. Some greenery to glance at, say \"ah how nice\" and sit on the grass. I would recommend visiting to anyone who wants to relax for a while or spend a little quite time mulling over the tile of your novel, but if you are looking for excitement and fanfare this is not the place. If you are on a limited schedule I would say put this on your list of things to see, but maybe toward the end where you keep the things you might not get to."

Most beautiful in Autumn or Spring, you can't help but feel happy walking around and watching the children push the little sale boats around the pond. The park is so large that it's easy to find a secluded spot - not an easy feat in Paris!

We also saw several pilates, yoga, karate, and fitness classes going on. The area feels very safe and clean and there are so many options for children, adults, and elders. The big fountain pond is kind of the center of the gardens. Parents lay out in the sun in chairs while their children play with sail boats in the fountain. There are a few food options and public bathrooms. It's not usually over-crowed. In my opinion this is one of the best places to visit in Paris!"

Manicured gardens and classic architecture await you in this idyllic setting. Leisurely stroll in the garden or have a seat and contemplate whatever is on your mind. Maybe even read a book while soaking up some sunshine on a clear day. An afternoon in this park should be a prescription for high blood pressure because it makes you feel as though all life's pressures have been taken away."

We read a review below saying they rented bikes and rode around the park so we did the same. We got there quickly from our St. Germain location and entered the park. It was crowded with people and we noticed no one else was on a bike. When in a less crowded place a runner spit on my husband's bike- no lie. A couple minutes later we were spotted by the police and told no bikes allowed. We left the park and ditched the bikes. Came back in on foot and enjoyed the park that way. Good free activity, lots of people watching, just do NOT ride a bike or you may get spit on for breaking the rules. ;)"

There are often bands playing on the bandshell. People hang out and have a great time. This is a wonderful experience. And when you're finished, you can walk down the adjacent streets and find wonderful restaurants."

Have returned throughout my lifetime; am now a 60+ year old lady; it is where my heart resides. So back to LG, my most loved, enjoyed, revelled in place. In the old days, puppet shows. The gardens are what I love most. And the history. Look at the statues! Almost exclusively women, because the palace was built at the behest of the Medici queen of a lackluster French king, a wife who wanted a little bit of breathing room.. The statues are essentially a tribute to strong women, starting in the 12th century. In summer, the garden is usually a vista for installation art that is built around the marvelous sculpture. To die for. (Note: I am not given to hyperbole.)"

We visited on a crisp, clear Sunday morning, and the park was filled with French families enjoying the beautiful day and the beautiful surroundings. Children were sailing rented boats in the large pond, and others were sitting in the numerous metal chairs, just enjoying! It really is a wonderful spot, especially if is a planting season. When we were there, the chrysanthemums had just been put in all the planters!"

If you are romantic and a nature lover take out 2 hours for this park, for some nature love, a satisfaction to the eyes and fall in love.

It is a large sprawling park that is much used and loved by residents of the 5th & 6th arrondisements, the neighborhoods that border the park. There is a wonderful small museum, Musee du Luxembourg, off of Rue de Vaugirard that regularly features new exhibits. And around the Rue de Medicis, along the outside of the park, there is usually a photography exhibit along the massive gate. For small children, a visit to the playground is a must despite the small entrance fee. There are are great amusements and fun climbing structures. The small carousel near the playground is not to be missed! Children love to take a ride and to try to catch the rings with the sticks provided by the person who runs the merry-go-round. There's a place near to buy drinks and snacks. Children might also enjoy the large pond where they can push wooden sailboats across the water and race to catch them on the opposite side. Tucked away near where the (mostly) men play chess, there is a wading and splashing area for children. Very refreshing and fun on a hot, dusty summer day. If you are fortunate enough to be traveling with a dog, you may bring your dog to Luxembourg Gardens but only to certain parts of the park. The entrance by Medicis is the allocated dog entrance. Finally, I recommend Paris to the Moon by Adam Gopnik and Hemingway's A Moveable Feast for expat / insider's look at the park and the neighborhood, and The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas written by Gertude Stein who lived just a couple blocks away. Enjoy!"

They were just planting them when we were there and within two days they were done. The gardens change seasonally and are always stunning.The gardens are well maintained and the Parisians make good use of them. Joggers are in abundance. As soon as the sun shines, people are sitting in the specially designed leaning back chairs \"catching the rays\" and eating pic-nic lunches. The children rent boats to play with in the ponds and there are all sorts of other activities going on - tennis, basketball, tai chi and bocce. It is really fun to observe how lively these gardens are. It is also nice to see how respectful people are. Even though they are well used,there is no litter or grafitti."

My daughter and I spent several hours two weeks ago at Luxembourg Gardens walking tree-canopied paths, gazing at beautiful statuary, lovingly tended flowers and fruit trees laden with golden and blush-colored pears and apples. After an hour or so, we sat on a bench to enjoy our French pastries and expressos in the sun in front of our favorite statue -- a magnificent stag, its mate and their fawn -- and people watch (our favorite past time in Paris!). Besides the warmth and joie de vivre of its people, what I love most about Paris is its respect for history and art - of beauty. You get an overwhelming feeling of permanence there, that you are part of history. The park bench we sat on, the paths we walked and the statuary we gazed at were all 100-200 years old. Think of the thousands of people - ordinary and famous (Jim Morrison loved to sit and write here, as well as many others) - who have sat on the same park benches to reflect and drink in the beauty of this idyllic place on a sunny fall afternoon - and so it will be for centuries to come. Such is the beauty of Paris. There is nowhere else like it and I can't wait to return."

The sculptures are amazing: George Sand, close to Blvd St Michel, is achingly lovely and Diderot looks appropriately philosophical. Once, the Museum had a Rodin exhibit that rivaled his home a few kilometers away. Have a picnic, walk your dog, watch the people, recharge your batteries. Enjoy!"

There's an amazing play ground, with zip-line and other unique forms of entertainment; as well as puppet show, pony rides and places to eat. One of my favorites is the old fashion sail boats...no frills or modern technology, just an antique sail boat and a stick.

Denfert-Rochereau and the discovery of the Luxembourg Gardens.The combination of green grass, beautiful gardens, ornamental lake and large shady trees made a very hot summers day in Paris much more enjoyable than it might otherwise have been.Well worth a visit."

The gardens are beautiful, and there are a number of asphalt and cinder paths around the perimeter and winding through the gardens. There were a lot of people out on Sunday morning, and one might have thought it was a race except no one wore numbers. I think that the perimeter of the park is somewhere over a mile long, and I ran several laps in each direction on different days.I believe that the park is only open during daylight hours, and there are gates and tall fences (with spikes) surrounding it. As such, it is kept very clean and beautiful."

It was a nice change from the busy city and there were lots of different areas. This would be a great park for locals, but I don't know if it was worth the long walk we had from the Notre Dame to get there. We also found it very hard to find toilets - when we found them, you had to pay to use them.It is possible that I would rate this differently if we had visited in a different season and if we had taken the metro instead of walking."

The Luxembourg Gardens are a delightful stop, especially after a slow wander south from the left bank. Enjoy the ambience of the dappled light in summer and the sparkle from the water where young and old play with toy yachts. There are lots of statues and a stately building. You will find few nicer places in Paris to sit and rest your tired feet. One small warning. The cafe can be a very mixed experience, especially if it is busy, which it often is. The food is average for above average prices and the timeliness of the service can vary enormously.

It has a big playground for kids (be prepared to pay to get in) and a lovely carousel which our two little girls loved. Lovely for walks or a small run...nice to get away from the bustle of Paris for a while. Also sand pits and little slash pool (free). Best part was the puppet show in the the theatre next to the playground ...don't miss that, so quintessentially Parisian for young and old!"

It's a perfect people watching location.During the time we were there (on a Saturday), there were three different orchestras playing music - a popular jazz set, classical music and military march music. Each set lasted an hour with an hour break between. Food is available, but it is pricy and very average. Better to bring a sandwich or something to keep you going if you intend to stay for a long while."

Like many places in Paris, the gardens and landscaping are very grand and opulent with huge fountains, statues, columns and monuments, everywhere you look it is a feast for the eyes. We were blessed to be here on a warm and sunny September day and although the park was full of people, there was a certain tranquility and relaxed feeling that was just magical. I love how this park is full of chairs that you can just plonk yourself into, stretch out and people watch to your hearts content. The playground was fabulous; large, shady and fenced off with a reasonable entrance fee. My daughter was so upset to have to leave the playground and make our way back to our hotel, she could have stayed for hours and hours more and frankly, if I wasn't catching a train out that evening, I would have been happy to stay too."

WOW, what a change from all the hustle and bustle of this huge metropolitan city.You are not allowed to walk/sit on the grass except for one area. We had sufficient room to plunk ourselves down and have a picnic and short nap. It was a glorious day and we so enjoyed watching the locals, many with their families. Lots of small children so well behaved playing with their parents or other small kids nearby.When we got up and walked around again (about 5 p.m.) we were just enthralled in all the activity going on around us. These were mostly NOT tourists so it was great joy to observe them. Very few cell phones and no electronics for the kids. They were simply playing and well behaved.Flowers were gorgeous. Everything about the place was joyful. We left finally, with big smiles and a real appreciation for Parisians and how they enjoy themselves."

There is such a variety of things to do here (sit and people watch, jog, play chess, watch kids float their sailboats at the fountain, enjoy a picnic). I love this oasis. It gets you away from the hustle and bustle of the big city and you can sit and relax with a book and read. Because the sun is setting earlier now, the guards usher people out by 715pm. It usually happens around dusk when they close up the gardens. Too bad :("

The landscaping is absolutely beautiful, there are various ponds, shaded areas, open areas, tennis courts, etc - something for everyone. What I appreciated were the multiple benches and seats, so it was not difficult to find a place to relax and put your feet up. The Gardens attract families and couples, but I also saw many older women reading their books under the shade of the trees, etc. This is a perfect place to relax when the weather is good. I highly recommend a trip to the Luxembourg Gardens if you are in the area. It is about a 10 minute walk south of Blvd Saint Germain. I imagine, however, that the Gardens would not be so pleasant in the winter nor in the rain - in that case I would probably say that a visit is not mandatory."

The sporting opportunities include a running track around the inner periphery; tennis courts; football and basket ball areas used by local schools; very well equipped childrens adventure playgrounds; roundabout; toy sailboats for hire and use of the large fountain basin by families with model ships of all types;well used petinque courts; chess tables and willing players. For the horticulturalists there are flower beds to gladden the eye and a large collection of apple and pear specimens with every type of cultivation demonstrated. An apiary is a demonstration site for courses held in the adjacent gatehouse which is used for diverse activities. The park is home to many outdoor sculptures and houses international and local art exhibitions. There are places to eat and drink and clean, staffed toilets. We never come to Paris without visiting this old friend and we take a new memory away each time."

The flowers here are simply amazing and with the beautiful vistas in many directions, statues, vases, ponds and fountains, a very beautiful and serene place to visit. Lovely to see the joy people were getting from the tiny sailing boats. My only criticism was having to stand in a long line to use the toilet which I also had to pay for. I don't know what the disabled do in this instance? Also the woman who was taking the fee for the toilet practically threw me my change and was clearly angry about having to give me 50p change from 1 Euro. Where I come from, we do not have to pay for toilets so this part is a culture shock. Overall, a very enjoyable visit and worth seeing."

With Fall and then Winter fast approaching it is a good time to remind people that beautifully laid out gardens are exceptional spaces at all times of year. With an attraction as popular as Luxembourg Gardens, the colder months may be an even better time to go and appreciate the lines and forms of the garden. With the French love of tree-pleaching on full display in the Fall and Winter, visitors can see the structure and bones of the formal side garden and still appreciate all the greenery of the less-formal English park part of the garden - this evergreen oasis section of the park tends to be less-crowded too.

One man 'played' at the edge of the lake with his remote-controlled yacht. It was a lovely sight to see as it slid across the lake leaving a mark behind it in the water. The absolute essence of tranquillity - even the ducks didn't mind the yacht. They seemed to know it didn't mean them any harm. Beautiful flowers, trees and shrubs adorn the park and there are ample chairs which can be moved around to suit wherever you want to sit. It was a lovely end to a wonderful few days in Paris.

Located in the southerrn part of the park, the private play ground has a 2.50 Euro entrance fee per child and a lesser fee for adults. My 5 and 7 years old went in by themselves so I never paid. I watched from outside the park fence, sipping a cafe, with all the other mamans and peres. Kids quickly make friends with other children and have a wonderful time engaging in many languages, especially on the zip-line, the likes of which my kids had never seen in a NYC play ground. The playground also had a couple of great self-propelled merry-go-rounds and a giant rope web for climbing, among other wonderful play feature. There is also a small W.C. inside the playground, which can come in very handy.Beyond the playground, the gardens themselves are wonderful for kids to explore with lots of hidden nooks and crannies with statues and fountains. One day we also caught the puppet show in the theater near the play ground, which was charmingly old school and made me happy to have spent the money to support such a rich tradition. And no visit would be complete without sailing boats on the large central fountain. Have a crepe and call it a great day in Paris."

There are plenty of chairs for lazing in the sun and benches for sitting in the shade under the trees. You can rent a tiny sailboat for the pond, watch people play tennis or basketball, and further along behind the children's play area are the teams of boules players and more benches & chairs for watching the games. The Guignol is a novel experience for visitors, both adult & children, and there is always something going on along the main entrance walk into the garden. Immediately outside the entrance during summer is one of the best ice cream stalls in the city...dozens of flavors, too...and inside the park there are two cafes. The one closest to the entrance I prefer as a tearoom. Waiters can be rude (worse here than elsewhere in the city IMO) and tricky, ie I've had them put off taking our order until right AFTER the time for serving food has passed. The other cafe on the other side of the pond, back by the basketball courts and the children's play area, is more casual and this summer had lovely friendly waitstaff. The food used to be better, more French, than it was this year but, although expensive and catering more to touristic tastes, for what it is, it is still very edible. There is so much to see in this park I can't possibly detail it here but suffice to say whether you are interested in trees and flowers, sculpture, games, a stroll or a lazy afternoon reading in the sun, this is the place to for you. Of course there is the excellent Luxembourg museum attached to the park as well, but like most museums in Paris it is open only on certain days, so be sure to check it out first."

The rain was a bit chilly but only intensified the colors of the flowers. The trees were manicured and made canopys over walkways. It would be hard to critisize a thing about these gardens. Possibly a few more benches to stop along the way. This a place you want to visit and stroll along not dash through."

The Luxemburg Gardens were simply beautiful , with many gardens of blooming flowers, ponds and small ( man made lakes), trees with benches to sit under, groupings of chairs that many school groups use to enjoy a lesson in these historic and lovely surroundings, or others moved as needed to play cards, or chat. Don't miss the sculptures as you stroll along the grounds, too. We additionally enjoyed some refreshments at a cafe , up on the left side of the grounds, with a great vantage point to people watch.Picture taking is spectacular. The setting is both energized with all kinds of people, and quiet and peaceful with folks reading , painting, biking through the grounds, walking babies, etc.If you get a chance, and enjoy gardens, this is a must see in Paris!"

From little patches of green and color (they are all filled with flowers in the spring and summer) between the stones to massive spaces to explore, you have a lot to choose from. Parisians love to get to a park whenever the sun peaks through the clouds, and so should you! And one of the most beautiful parks is the Luxembourg: a patchwork of several city blocks of flowerbeds, fountains, trees, benches, small cafes, and playgrounds. The central fountain is breathtaking in the spring when it reflects all types of gorgeous flowers, and there are plenty of chairs to go around to sit with your family and friends and have a picnic. Well worth it! Go and enjoy and savor!"

The garden it self is broken up into many areas, it is more like Central Park, but with alot more flowers. There are pony rides, a playground, swings, and cafes that will all gladly take your money. Yes, you have to pay to let your children play in this park. Crazy!!"

We visited twice during our recent trip, once when we were down the street at the Pantheon but then returned later in the week just to have some rest and relaxation. While there, we listened to a great concert, watched a colorful parade of local college students travelling through the park in what appeared to be some type of \u2018initiation\u2019 took in numerous gardens and enjoyed watching the locals play games of bocce ball. Luxembourg has something for everyone, if you want to sit in the sun, there are plenty of spots around the gardens but if you want a shady spot, you can find that as well. Adults and children will both find things to pique their interest.If you are travelling with children, the the playground and the sail boats provide a respite from museums and monuments. The playground which charges an entrance fee is a busy spot but your kids can join in the fun and might even be daring enough to try and communicate in French. When we visited, the French children practiced their English with our grandson. Another attraction for children are the sail boats which sail in the fountain in front of the Medici palace. The sail boats which are for rent in good weather are maneuvered around the pond with large sticks. While it sounds quaint in comparison to a video game, plenty of kids were enjoying this throwback activity and if your kids are interested in sailing the boats, it creates a great photo opportunity. We brought along a stale baguette and my grandson spent time feeding the pigeons which are always looking for a handout. I always enjoy a visit the mini Statue of Liberty (another great photo op) which resides in the park and of course the numerous flower gardens and statues. There are food stands inside the park near the bocce courts and right outside the gates you will find numerous places to grab a snack. I would recommend this park as a lovely place to visit."

I have been to this garden twice already and plan to make weekly visits. It is that great! The French know how to design gardens. That much is obvious. What is really interesting is how they go about keeping people in the park. It's simple - provide lots and lots of chairs which can be moved about. I have been in so many parks where the absence of places to rest just entices you to keep walking and leave. The Medici fountain is so beautiful and offers a cool sanctuary when temps get high. The pool is a great place to people watch, especially the children sailing their boats. In an era of high tech toys, all a kid really needs is a wooden sail boat, a pool, a stick and a bit of a breeze to have the time of their lives!Put on some comfortable shoes, pack a picnic lunch and head off to this fabulous outdoor space. Leave yourself at least three hours to really enjoy it!"

The gardens are centrally located (close to Montparnasse and the Latin Quarter), free (always a bonus), and the perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of city. I recommend stopping at one of the many surrounding Boulangeries and/or general stores to pick up a baguette, cheese, and wine. There's a long strip of shaded grass where many people go to relax and enjoy a picnic in the park. We always bring a blanket, some small cups, a knife for the cheese, and a corkscrew. Whether you are site-seeing or looking for a place to relax, picnic, or read a book, I would highly recommend stopping through Luxembourg Gardens. You can enjoy beautiful views of the gardens, check out the palace, or take part in some of the surrounding park activities. There's something here for everyone. Side note: Bring some extra change to use the bathroom facilities."

The staff were very friendly and we were able to banter and joke at our lack of French speaking skills and the waiters very good English! The gardens are lovely with the children running around the lake with boats. We also discovered the tennis courts and pony rides for children too. Then we found a beautiful statue hidden under the trees to the right hand side of the Senate building with a little lake in front of it. It was lovely to sit there with the sun shining through the trees above and watch the ducks swimming around and watch the world go by!"

Whomever gets the most rings gets the next ride for free. it feels like a junior circular jousting match.For adults the park is a perfect place to get away from the noise and rush of the city.

Slightly surprisingly, you have to pay to get in (I think about 5 euro - children AND adults!), but as we had been to Disneyland Paris at vast expense the day before, we must have been sensitised to having to pay through the nose. But, the kids loved it - there is a sort of zip wire which was slightly terrifying to watch but was marshalled very effectively by the children playing on it and only became dangerous when some interfering adult got involved. My wife and I spent the whole afternoon reading books on a shady bench whilst the kids played happily. One implication of the charge, I suppose, is that it didn't get too crowded and the fence around it means that you feel safe that the children won't wander off."

Drinking in public is quite acceptable in Paris and there is no drunken thuggery as a consequence. This makes for a really pleasant atmosphere in the parks at lunchtime and evenings. The park shuts at 8.15pm and the Gendarme come round warning everyone 15 minutes beforehand. When the time comes they walk through the park, blowing whistles and everyone leaves the park. We left through the South entrance and walked through the Sorbonne area, a treat in architectural terms. Picnic in the park, any park, if you get a chance!"

The fist tourist attraction our family of four (2 adults, kids visited in Paris was the Luxembourg Gardens - not too far from the apartment we rended in Paris. First of all, the gardens are magnificent - beautiful sculptures tucked away in every nook and corner, lots of beautiful fountains, and much much more. There are Parisians sitting around, reading books, having lunch, or just whiling away the time with their friends.For those with young kids, there are two specific ways to keep your little ones busy. First, there is a nice playground with all kinds of amazing playground equipment. My kids, 8 and 10, had a wonderful time here. Be warned though - there is a fee to enter. I don't remember what it was, something small in the 2-4 Euro range. Many Parisians send their kids in and sit on the benches outside (presumably so that they don't have to pay). The second is a circular artificial lake in which you can sail a boat. You get to choose a boat with a national flag and use poles to guide it around the lake. The boat can attack other boats, etc. My kids had fun watching this, especially as one boat had an encounter with a resident duck. In retrospect, I wish we had rented a boat.In short, its hard not to enjoy yourself here, irrespective of your age."

We are \"old hands\", I guess, at visiting Paris ( my spouse lived here for many years and is fluent in French; I've been here at least a dozen times), yet we still enjoy strolling through and sitting in this lovely, grand park. Yes, it's a tourist magnet, but it's also a favorite spot for Parisians as well. So, here we were, still jet-lagged from our arrival the day before, on a lovely Saturday afternoon, lazily walking through the park, flowers blooming everywhere, watching boule players intently focused on their games, hundreds of locals just sitting in the sun. It was a grand way to kick off our 5-week stay here and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Paris."

In the central area of the Luxembourg garden, visitors travel to France found a lake called the Grand Bassin. Children can rent small boats on the lake cruises. It is surrounded by lots of fun to play as puppets dancing or horseback riding, very suitable for tourists who have children.Among the fountains in the Jardin du Luxembourg, the two most beautiful fountain are Fontaine de Medicis and the Fontaine de I'Observatoire. Fontaine de Medicis brought romance spirit of, smoothiness of Greek mythology, a small lake located in the northeast garden. As the Fontaine de I'Observatoire expressed solidarity with her five continents representing the continents of the world. This fountain is located at the southern end of the park, so Davioud, and Fremiet Carpaux designed in 1873.Please go to France to experience. Mercy."

Such a beautiful setting with plenty of space to run around and enjoy our special family time. Although the weather was brisk (okay very cold!), we enjoyed watching the children play with their motor yachts in the small ponds and admiring the spring flowers slowly coming into bloom. I would imagine during mid summer, the gardens would be packed with locals, soaking up the sun in their lunch breaks. Within the park, an enclosed kids play area operates with excellent equipment, a little cafe and toilets. There is a charge for entry (both kids and their parents) approx 2.50 EUR but still good fun. We wrapped up with delicious homemade crepes, coffees and watched the people go by from a lovely little caravan also located within the park. A really enjoyable afternoon and well worth the visit."

Jardin de Luxembourg contains several large areas of formal gardens, pond (where one can rent boats and feed ducks), an area where people gather to play chess, and a formidable palace. Admission is free, but the park closes at sunset (in summer, 9 pm). It is most easily accessible by the Luxembourg Metro stop on the RER B line. We grabbed some food in Le Grand Epicerie at La Bon March\u00e9 and headed to the gardens for a picnic. There are areas with chairs and shade. The gardens are large and open, and there are policemen walking around to ensure safety. Even at dusk, it felt like a very safe area, with many families and couples strolling, and no merchants selling tacky wares or other people soliciting tourists. On Fridays and Saturdays, there is an area for a marionette show. It appears to be a well-established outdoor theater in the shaded woods. The stars of the gardens are, of course, the formal gardens themselves. The perennials and annual flowers in their beautiful coordinated shades, and the formally sculpted trees give a feeling of the architectural rigor of a royal French garden. One could feel immortal here."

There are 60 acres with gorgeous flower beds, trees, grass, ponds, children's activities, and fountains.The original palace was built in 1615 by the widow of Henry IV, Marie de Medici who missed her hometown of Florence, Italy so much she had this re-creation of her childhood home Pitti Palace.

You can rest, take your dogs to the doggie area (special place for this), jog, walk,eat in a cafe, picnic, play chess, play tennis, play cards, or enjoy the children's area.

If gardens in Paris will never compete with those in London, this one still is a lovely break from the urban hub of the Quartier Latin. Easy to reach (a few minute walk from the Seine), refreshing and peaceful in most parts, offering a bit of freedom for children to run and play around and lovers to linger about, with fountains and lots of different little corners, it provides more shade than the beautiful Tuileries Gardens on a scorching sunny day. Above all, it's one of those Parisian places that's kept most of its original typical flavor through the years."

As a Parisian, I cross the Luxembourg garden twice a day from my home to work and vice versa.The garden is the property of the Senate and is extremaly well taken care of. It is groomed every day, flowers are changed each seasons.The garden has different parts, the \"bassin\" where you sail boats, the old part where you can read under very old trees, the children playground, the orchads where are grown very old species of fruits, the apiary, the Orangerie with art exhibits, the museum and the tennis courts.You can picnic, you have 2 restaurants, you can buy ice cream and eat French pancakes.It gives a sense of what must have been the French garden of a palace, yet it conveys a great sense of modernity: children, families, students, lovers, aging people can share this experience."

You can watch children sail small boats in the basin, watch people playing tennis (or play), take children to a marionnette performance, etc. There are often art displays on the fence nearest Boulevard St Michel (Tour de France photos at the moment). We usually take our breakfast into the park in the morning and often go back in the evening to take photos of the flowers or watch the sky turn colors with the Eiffel Tower in the distance.

If parents are willing to indulge, kids will enjoy renting little sailboats and pushing them around the pond. Smaller kids - even those not speaking French - will enjoy the Punch and Judy - style marionette theatre. Everybody pretty much enjoys the crepe stand.Do not plan to spread out a blanket and picnic on the grass, as that is forbidden here (and throughout most of the green space in Paris) - but you can pull up a few of the green chairs and enjoy your feast and a little nap.As far as the museum goes - it has recently had a face-lift, which really makes the artwork stand out. Unfortunately, more people than ever crowd into this very small space, and it can be downright disagreeable. I would strongly suggest taking a tour, if there is an expo that interests you. It will still be crowded, but at least you will learn something about the art you came to see."

There are different areas: one in the formal French style of garden, one with playgrounds for children, a Guignol theater, a merry go round, another space has even bee keeping facilities, but my favorite is the \"forest\", with tall trees and a romantic old nineteenth century wood and iron chalet surrounded by iron tables and chairs where you can have a coffee and salad in the moving shade of the tall trees, looking at pretty statues and an old fountain. After a visit of the Cluny museum, buying books at the famous Joseph Gibert bookshop, I like to go to le Jardin du Luxembourg where lovers still kiss on the benches and children run after the pigeons.

After 2 non stop days in Paris my kids really loved it there as in the garden there is a large playgroung. However this is at a charge. If I am not mistaken it is about Eur2.50 for adults and the children are for less. There is also a kiosk where you can have a drink or an ice-cream and even a restroom. If you go there put on hats, sunblock and wear a running shoes as we were not comfortable with the sandals. There are other activities to do. For older children there are the bicycles, sailing boats with remote control and even cars with pedals.Keep in mind that these attractions are all at a charge even though the garden itself has free entrance. There is the pond with ducks but there were no pony rides when we went. Overall it is nice."

We discovered that we had 90 minutes to wait and so sent off to discover other areas of the gardens. Our first stop was the boules (kind of like lawn bowling) courts. We sat down and watched the men play had a wonderful time. They completely ignore everyone around them so you\u2019re not intruding at all. Next we went to the big fountains in the middle where they have sailboats going all the ground kids can take sticks provided by the park and push the boats away from the wall to keep them ceiling sailing. I kept thinking that if this were in America, the boats would be destroyed within a day but all of the kids were so respectful of the boats - it was wonderful to see. Next we found a chess game area and it was very different from what we expected \u2013 this was a super fast game that I would have lost in about 10 seconds \u2013 amazing to watch the minds at work. I was amazed that anyone could think that fast. These men however did not seen as friendly to an audience as the boules players had been and so we moved on. It was a beautiful day and I\u2019m sure that contributed to are experience but I can see wasting away an entire day in this wonderful park.

Our group of 3 adults and 2 teens was feeling more than a little hot and road-weary and the kids had already declared \"no more churches!\" So, we were absolutely delighted to find this shady, green oasis in the middle of Paris and walking distance from our hotel in the Latin Quarter. We visited in the morning and stumbled almost immediately on the stunning Medici Fountain. We were all content to just sit in the shade of the beautiful trees surrounding the fountain, drinking in the beauty of the morning and the surroundings. Afterward we strolled through the gardens, tracking down the mini Statue of Liberty and admiring the many other amazing statutes. We highly recommend this beautiful and idyllic spot for a respite from the hard \"work\" of being a tourist. :) It is the kind of place that will renew your spirit and love of travel."

Stop at a bakery and walk here and have a calm and peaceful picnic.We stumbled on this \"garden\" while walking around. There's not much to see, it's just a beautiful place in Paris that you can't begin to describe.One thing that struck me was that the \"gravel\" was tiny agates. I am a rock hound and we search all over for agates, and this place is lined with them! It was calm, and peaceful, and truly fit for a king.TIP: So, Paris is an amazing place. If you try just a little to fit in, you will have a great time. If you act like a rude tourist, you'll probably have less fun, since you'll be treated like a rude tourist. As with anything in Europe, if you try to blend, and they see you are trying, the whole experience will be great. If you are willing to try, and want to really experience the culture, and go with the flow, you will fall in love with this place!For example, on the plane ride over, listen to something like In-Flight French, then carry the book around. Sneak a peak before requesting a table or ordering and memorize the lines. If they see you are trying, and being polite, they will be a lot nicer. In general, everyone was VERY nice to us (in a professional way, not a southern US nice way). Also, when you go to a restaurant, the service is slow and long and very very quiet. People practically whisper. Expect this and play along.However, I can't emphasize enough, if you are perceived rude (e.g., expecting fast service, or are loud, or want people to accommodate weird requests, or demanding, or you want a fast overview and won't slow down, or have really loud kids or kids who can't sit still or listen), you should go on a full-service tour that will be able to help accommodate your needs. Otherwise, you will probably have a rough experience. That kind of personality isn't tolerated. Paris is quiet and beautiful. Go with the flow, or go with a western-based tour group and it won't matter since they go to touristy places."

Walked the entire length, from Carpeaux's Fontaine de l'Observatoire on the south end to the Palais on the north end, while exploring Montparnasse on the evening of Sun., 30 June 2013. Was pleasantly surprised to see how busy it was at 8-9 PM -- picnickers on the lawns, food vendors, strollers, sunbathers seated around the Octagonal Lake -- families, children, couples, groups, elderly, young. Fontaine de l'Observatoire is an especially aesthetically pleasing fountain, with its 4 female figures representing 4 continents holding up a globe. Sat down to enjoy the ambiance at the Octagonal Lake for a while. Wanted to explore more but had walked till I dropped so had to return to my room."

The French are refreshingly much less paranoid than we are about kids getting the odd bump, not that I saw any injuries during our weekly visits over 3 months.

My first attempt to visit the Luxembourg Gardens (2005-ish) didn't work out because I traveled to Paris in December for my birthday and that day was too cold for more outdoor walking. However, since the Luxembourg Garden's hosts a museum, my friend and I toured the traveling exhibit instead.When I traveled to Paris last year in early fall, I made a point to return and was very pleasantly surprised. I found what I refer to as an outdoor museum that contained beautiful landscapes were accented by amazing sculptures -- some in plain sight and others that revealed themselves to you as you walked around. Everything about the Gardens seemed to be based in art, so the serenity of the place was palpable. It was clear that great detail is paid to maintaining the lush gardens. The many acres of Gardens is contained by a beautiful wrought iron fence. The Gardens were bustling with individuals, families and tourists who were enjoying the scenery; the many-colored foliage was quite beautiful and serene and definitely worth the 9-year wait. I sat for a while taking in the sights but did not eat at the park restaurant or walk around the small pond or lush lawns because I wasn't wearing the most comfortable shoes and had already walked a few miles down the Seine. However, the Luxembourg Gardens is worthy of being on your list of Parisian interests to take in (bring Euros for the bathroom stall since the facilities are not free of charge). I will return because in Paris I have my favorite places to go."

When I need to relax, to get rid of the routine or any gloomy thoughts, or just to realize how happy actually I am, Luxembourg Gardens is the place I go to (provided I am in Paris, of course). Over the last ten years, every time I go to Paris, I definitely go there, at least for a while, to enjoy the calm scenery - beautiful trees and gardens, flowers, children playing, ducks in the lake, young and cute lovers on the benches, people playing petanque or tennis and the remote Eiffel Tour above the trees... When you go there, find a free seat, forget about any problems you may have, take your time and relax - you will see the genuine face of Paris, you will feel Paris and you will enjoy it, trust me!"

You can rent a toy sail-boat, jump rope, ride your scooter or your bike, kick a soccer ball around, read a book, jog, have an expresso at the cafe, practice your headstands (yes, we saw a guy doing that!) - or if you're a tourist, you can sit and admire all that action going on around you! We were so charmed by the garden that we totally forgot to visit the museum on the grounds!Since the Tour de France takes place next month, on the fence that surrounds the grounds the powers that be have hung AMAZING photos of the cyclists in scenic spots - if you go this summer, check them out as you leave the gardens.The Church of St. Sulpice is only a few blocks away, and you might want to stop in a moment to admire its beauty, and thank the Lord for the chance to visit France!"

Suddenly, there was something dropping from the sky onto my husband's grey jacket, mustard coloured and as big as a Euro coin. Pigeon???? Pigeons are a constant menace and one needs to take a plastic bag or paper to sit on as the seats are absolutely spotted on a regular basis with their droppings. Our friend immediately pulled out several tissues and we had Brian's jacket cleaned up in no time at all and also felt we had made a Parisian friend.

I loved how statues were dotted around the area, and that it was big but not so much so that you are put off to explore it all. I was looking in particular for the original Statue of Liberty, and enjoyed hunting for it in the gardens while also seeing some other great work. The Medici Fountain was also very impressive, though it seemed cordoned off at the sides so you couldn't really walk around it properly. The gardens were also one place to see relaxed Parisians playing bowls, and French families relaxing in the summer - while there clearly were tourists around, it was nowhere near as intense as other areas, and it was just a nice way to relax if you have some time to just enjoy Paris (and it is well-located if you're in the area of St Germaine having visited Notre Dame). It's especially great if you have a little time to yourself away from your party to chill out. The museum in the gardens is also well worth a look - I didn't look round the permanent exhibition much but was really lucky that there was a great Chagall exhibition on at the time of visiting."

Still, the highlight for me is the octagonal pool where children sail toy boats. These are very traditional, not remote controlled. They run from side to side to push the boats with sticks. There is a lot of seating around the edges and you see many families. It's a great spot to pause while touring the St-Germain-des-Pres area."

Right in the middle of the Rive Gauche, this huge, sprawling park has a fantastic playground, swings, tennis and basketball courts, trails, fountains, and a large central pond. Several snack booths, a puppet theater, and lots of other kids make it a haven for parents who want to let their kids burn off some steam while they sit back and do as the French do: drink a caf\u00e9 express, watch the people go by, read a book, enjoy the afternoon.The Jardin des Plantes and its Menagerie, and the Jardin d'Acclimatation with its rides may seem more obvious choices at first, but they're both heavily programmed (and expensive to boot), while the Jardin du Luxembourg allows more free-form play for the kids and a bit of respite for the adults at little or no cost. Highly recommended."

But we did stay in Paris, if only for four days, and Paris was my favourite city of the whole trip. I cannot find anywhere to write a review on the city itself so I have chosen to write on the Luxembourg, since I feel that typifies much of what I feel about Paris.Firstly the bad bits: I do not like the queues that seem everywhere in Paris, and I do not like large numbers of people who smoke in public places, especially restaurants. Now the good bits: everything else!You would need to be far more poetical than I to adequately describe the feel, the ambience of Paris. I loved strolling down the boulevards, sitting on the sidewalk, the architecture, the patisserie/boulangerie, the markets, the history, the people, but possibly above all the parks of Paris; which brings me the Luxembourg Gardens. We visited all the major parks and Luxembourg was our favourite. The spring flowers were out, and the place was so colourful, beautiful lake, lots of activities like tennis, lots of people all relaxed and seemingly quite happy, and lots of free chairs in which to rest and relax.This is Paris in the Springtime, and I love it."

A place to relax and enjoy away from the hustle and bustle.The outside of the perimeter fencing were clad with large historic photo prints of 100 yrs of the Tour de France and were great fun and really interesting to look at."

Uses include miles of walking paths, an open plaza with a large pond and rentable toy sailboats for the kids (not daily except in summer), tennis, boules, chess, jogging, photographing the statues (look for the Statue of Liberty) and monuments. kids' playground, puppet theater, etc, and plenty of chairs, benches and lawns for just sunning (check the signs to see if the lawn is interdit -closed - or not). The park opens early; at 7 AM it's almost your private space. And barring the worst imaginable luck this park is safe, due to its openness and a regular police presence."

The park isn't technically quiet, as it is usually filled with families and children from the neighborhoods but there is a fountain and chairs to sit on so what more could you want in Paris? Oh yeah, there's a public restroom on the east side of the park beneath the concession stand that's only a Euro. That's a valuable thing to know about!"

Luxembourg Gardens are a large and beautifully manicured public space. Clean and no inhibitions. Enter at the North end and escape the hustle bustle of tourist Paris. Exit at the Fountain of the Observatory and you discover the relative calm of the Montparnasse district."

The gardeners keep this place up to royal standards, with extravagant, interesting plantings, groupings of annuals in varying ranges of colors, all quite \"correct\" in the French style. Check out what looks like an apple \"library\" at the opposite end of the Gardens (from the Senate part). It features an amazing variety of small apple trees, all espaliered to a fare-thee-well, and labeled to boot. You are not supposed to walk on the grass, but there are wide paths all over the place where you can walk or run with what sometimes seems like all of Paris. Even when the Gardens are crowded with sun-seekers the atmosphere is cheerful and people are careful not to run you over as they jog by. There are benches and chairs for your use; take a little time to sit and just enjoy the beauty. And if you want you can rent miniature sailboats from a kiosk next to the pond and have fun sailing them with others, both kids and adults."

So much so, that we took her back again. The playground is wonderful, and for adults, it's great to have those soft tiles that cushion a child's fall, as they're also good on our aging joints. Her favorite activity was sort of a Tarazan swing, with a weight on the bottom that went around a track. She must have ridden on that 4 or 5 times! She also enjoyed the rope Eiffel Tower, even though I would not let her climb to the top, as it's pretty high -- she got half way up. There was also a play gym with slides and a pole and tunnels to crawl through. We stopped at every playground our walks took us by, but this one remained her favorite. So glad that we were staying in Saint Sulpice, as it was a short walk to Jardin du Luxembourg.Sandy"

We arrived at lunchtime and a friendly group of 15 year old parisian boys approached my sons and politely asked if they would like to play a game. My husband and I sat in the classic green chairs and read for a couple of hours while our boys blissfully played basketball. The one and only hoop is right next to the puppet theater and a really cool playground.Little girls in school uniform were dancing around a maypole in the background. Felt like we were in a painting.

There aren't too many places on earth better for people watching or just plain chilling out with a book.For families with children, the Jardin du Luxembourg offers distractions aplenty, from pony and donkey rides to Punch and Judy shows, a mini zip line to propelling boats in the large fountain pond in front of the Palais (now home of the French Senate). The beautiful gardens offer inspiration to aspiring green thumbs, and peaceful oases of calm in a big city. Chairs for lounging are everywhere; pick up a sandwich or pastry at a local boulangerie, put your feet up, and enjoy! (For those who miss their takeaway coffee, there is a Starbucks at the Odeon metro stop a short 10-minute stroll from here...so worth it for Americans missing that large coffee to-go).The southeast corner of the Luxembourg Gardens is pet friendly for leashed dogs, and, if your dog is small enough to be carried or put in a carry bag, you can take him/her anywhere in the gardens without hassle. In warm weather, there is often music in the park (we heard an excellent American HS band do a concert here last July). There is also a nice casual restaurant for outdoor dining (good salads).Don't miss: the mini Statue of Liberty; the tree planted as a memorial to those who died on 9-11; the gardens and apiary on the south end of the park; just sitting in the sun (or shade!) and soaking up the atmosphere.

When we went to the garden it was unusually cold there with temperature of 1 deg C and windy. We could not stay there long to enjoy it. They have a pony ride and toy boat sailing in e lake. It's a common place for Parisian to come for a jog, walk, play tennis, excercise."

This is the most fun and best maintained playground ever. It costs just over 2 euros per kid, and the hand stamp lasts all day, so you can leave for lunch/picnic and come back, etc. There's fun for little kids and big kids(zip lines!).You can pay a reduced price to go in as an adult, but really - why? -- just take a seat in the ubiquitous green park chairs and sip a coffee while your kids have the time of their lives. There's rubber surfacing and excellent maintenance, and only one exit, so all's well.The entire park is beautiful really. It's one of the prettiest public gardens in the city -- beautifully sculpted fruit garden, pretty statues, soft mossy grass, and bright flower beds, all fenced in neatly. Spending an afternoon here is a must while in Paris."

Couple of teams were playing boules. Toy size sailboats to rent and sail in the large pond by the palace. Tennis courts. Even an aviary. Lots of chairs so it's a wonderful places to sit and read, have lunch, or just people watch. Of course, the gardens are not blooming in March, but it was still a lovely place to walk."

Supposedly filled with lovers and families and old gentlemen playing chess, the atmosphere in this picturesque garden in the sun must be lovely. There are lots of varied and interesting sculptures around, probably the most famous of these is the small version of the statue of liberty, located in the west of the garden. There are also tennis courts, and a truly huge children's adventure playground that there is a fare for. We jumped the fence and were told off by park guards. Worth a visit if it's sunny and you're in the Latin quarter."

This is a free attraction with no line (there was a queue to get into the palace) and I think it's worthwhile visiting if you're in the area.

It's bigger than we expected it to be, and the Luxembourg Palace adjacent to the garden looks very beautiful. As others have said, lots of exercisers in the park. People with their dogs go there too, so watch out for their \"droppings\" and be aware that some dogs are let off the leash...There are seats around the fountain, and it seems clear that on warmer days this is a nice place for a picnic and to relax."

Sporting facilities for adults also exist, though they're used mainly by locals who play tennis or the local favorite, p\u00e9tanque.

Many lovely vignettes of public art, landscaping, and statuary await as you wander through the gardens (but be sure to stay on the paths as walking/sitting on the grass is frowned upon). My favorite spot is the Fontaine Medicis, which backs up to the rue de Medicis. Or you can pull up a chair and relax near the grand basin where ducks will approach you for treats.

Just the maintenance during the winter showed us that the gardens must be amazing in the warmer months. It was a great place to take a long stroll, people watch and check out the amazing trees. Would have loved to play chess at the tables set up there and watch the kids play in the large sandboxes. Didn't find the Bocce courts but did see the Tennis courts. One of my favorite places that we visited."

We visited Paris in the Autumn season so it was a bit chilly, but Luxembourg Gardens is free and as close to Parisian life as you can witness in an afternoon. Lots of young locals come here with their blankets, picnic lunches and guitars. Parents bring their children to sail their toy boats in the fountain. Elderly couples bask in the sun with a book while lounging on lawn chairs provided for public use. The pathways are a bit dusty (gravel/sand paths) but the pretty roses, statues and music make you forget about the dirt. We wish to visit again in the summer time."

In 1611, Marie de Medicis, the widow of Henry IV and the regent for the King Louis XIII decided to build a palace in imitation of the Pitti Palace in her native Florence. She purchased the hotel du Luxembourg (today the Petit-Luxembourg palace) and began construction of the new palace. She commissioned Salomon de Brosse to build the palace and a fountain, which still exists. In 1612 she planted 2,000 elm trees, and directed a series of gardeners, most notably Tommaso Francini, to build a park in the style she had known as a child in Florence.[2] Francini planned two terraces with balustrades and parterres laid out along the axis of the chateau, aligned around a circular basin. He also built the Medici Fountain to the east of the palace as a nympheum, an artificial grotto and fountain, without its present pond and statuary. The main palace is now the seat for the French Senate. Take time to watch the children with their remote control sailboats in the pond."

And if it is summer and you're in need of some humor, watch the tourists spreading out their blankets for a picnic on the grass only to be thrown off by the park 'police.' The confused expressions of those who don't understand why they are NOT to picnic on the grass but in the chairs or benches on the paths is worth a good giggle.

There are also various sporting courts for basketball and tennis and lots of benches, trees, and open grass for those who prefer a more private spot to reflect.

Children will find this place a great spot to romp aroung and play...a place where they could touch most anything they wanted (unlike at a Persian muesum) and laugh or shout as loudly as they wanted (unlike at a fancy Persian restuarant.) Keep in mind, though, that many people come to relax or read, so be sure to have the children play far away from those people.Tip: Bring a bit of bread. Kids will be quite amused with throwing small pieces of bread to the endless amounts of ducks and pigeons at the garden.Hope this helps. Let me know if it does ! :)"

I love all those places dearly, but there is something about the Luxembourg Gardens in the morning with the crepe and coffee vendors, the children at play on the playground, and the tai chi groups doing their daily exercises that just makes you feel like you could live there. There is an apiary, numerous statues including a smaller (and earlier if I'm not mistaken) Statue of Liberty, several low-slung chairs suitable for reading and relaxing, as well as walking/jogging trails throughout the property. It is peaceful, happy and beautiful... a place I wish I could uproot and transport to my own neighborhood. Go to the Luxembourg Gardens is you want a moment to catch your breath, take in some natural beauty and reflect on what a wonderful city it is despite any complaints you or others may have about other aspects of Paris. It's a true gift to have this place in the heart of the city... don't miss it!"

Art walks, lit walks, conflict walks, river walks; walks up the wazoo. There is, however, another method employed with increasing popularity \u2013 running Paris. You can search \u201cParis runs\u201d and most of your results will have nothing to do with irritable bowel. They will, however, open up a workout with a view you won\u2019t find anywhere on the planet. I started running in Paris in the late 90\u2032s and would get so distracted and lost I\u2019d sometimes need to get to a Metro to find out where I was. Even then, I might have to hop a turnstile and stand in that cramped subway car with all these civilized Parisians trying to ignore my stink. C\u2019est la vie, baby.My recent visit was merely a stopover and I really wanted to get out into the city to see it in a different season. I was shocked at all the runners burning up my favorite rues and boulevards. Here\u2019s a course anyone could complete, based on being able to click off 4-5 miles, and have an absolutely delightful time in the process\u2026Garden Party \u2014 Luxembourg and the TwilleriesThe run between these two landmark gardens in the heart of the city is my favorite street run for a couple of reasons. The quiet, narrow rues provide a very Parisian neighborhood experience. The reserves at each end of the route combine beauty and history in a wonderfully natural setting. Both gardens are living, evolving museums that act as a refuge and a tribute. At Luxembourg, there is the formal elegance of a time long past when royalty strolled the protected grounds amidst the plants and sculpture. The Nazis also took the palace over during the occupation, but that was heroically resolved. The palace is surrounded by walkways that make great paths for exploring the park and you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re running around in circles to get to every cranny.The Twilleries has a similar feel with less elaborate plantings but more dramatic sculpture. The route is straight up and back with no traffic, making it quite meditative. Twilleries is also the sight of the start of the French Revolution and you do get an odd sense of the struggle when you make your turn at the Champs-Ellysees. Head south to Pont des Arts, which is covered in padlocks. The idea here is to leave a lock with the names of the couple in love and the relationship will last as long as the lock is sealed.Cross the river to the Biblioth\u00e8que Mazarine. Circle the building to the west and then head south on Rue de Seine, a quiet commercial street early in the morning. There are several vegetable stands, bakeries, cafes and galleries mixed in. Run until you\u2019re hungry or the carts and delivery vans clog the street to the point of pointlessness."

You pay a couple of euros to get in but can come and go all day. There are also bathrooms inside this palyground area so no need to pay to use the WC hut in the other part of the park. Can also get a cappuccino to have while kiddies are playing! And, a water fountain in the middle of the playground. Also, some crazy swings that the kids loved were nearby - again you must pay but we got at least triple the time promised as there was no line behind us. Lots of people on nice days here but always seemed to be able to find the perfect spot to sit. What a beautiful park!"

I recommend to visit it during spring or summer where you will be able to really enjoy the scenery, as the colors of the trees are really beautiful, and most of the activities of the garden will be available. During fall or winter, I think it is always a little bit sad but this garden is really a place where you can see the parisien life. You will need at least an hour to enjoy the walk, discover all the statues hidden between the trees, enjoying activities like music stand, games for children (mini-boats on the fountain, poney ridding, playground), eating a snack while relaxing on the grass, or taking pictures in front of the Senat. It is a safe garden, with many security. Many french local stars are living around and it is not impossible to see them having a chat with friends or playing \"p\u00e9tanque\" sometimes. The only bad point is the if you have a dog like me, only a part of the garden is allowed for your pet and it is not the beautiful and grassy one, my dog often goes out of it dusty! Anyway if you stay like a week in Paris, I recommend it a lot!"

I brought a sandwich and drink with me and ate lunch while sitting on one of the plentiful benches. Three generations of a Paris family were eating next to me and they were worried that the children were bothering me--and I got to speak some French while letting them know that I was enjoying watching all the people. The park was crowded but it did not feel crowded and people-watching is the thing to do. As I was leaving, I noticed a concert band warming up for an afternoon concert under the trees. There are bathrooms available and food stands also. On a rainy day, it may not be the place to be, but if the weather is good, you could spend an entire day here and have a great time."

After eating we moved to an area of grass (the only one marked \"sitting permitted\") & unfolded our plastic poncho as the grass felt damp. Here we enjoyed a well earned rest. My husband is known for his after lunch naps!!! That is until a group of teens came & sat right next to us & started smoking!!! When I first went to Luxembourg Gardens (2008) on a Sunday, I loved how the place was filled with families. I suppose if they live in apartments, then this is their backyard & the place they go so the kids can play. Lovely flowers & fountains with paths for walking at a relaxed pace.Luxembourg Gardens are really worth taking some time out from your busy sightseeing schedule to just chill & people watch.

People scoot a chair in front of themselves to put their legs up. Turn several together to create a table for a chess board. Move them to a sunnier spot. And LG is one of the best places to people (and bird) watch in Paris. Lovers strolling, children sailing little boats in the massive fountain, old men playing chess.

The French families come here with children to rest ; there is plenty to do for children.. a pond to sail their boat, or rent one, a puppet theater with a very wonderful program. and the gardens are.. a pleasure for the eyes with wonderful sculptures, old trees, and flowers. Each season the flower-beds are arranged according to the time of the year. Spring : mostly pinks and light yellows, Autumn : yellows, brown and red. The Senat grounds have also a beautiful gardens. There is a nice small museum : Le Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg.. whith a permanent collection and exhibits... plenty to do for a whole day without rush. You can take a book and sit, or watch the spectacle of people going by, or take a nap after a busy day in the Latin quarter ... the Park is situated at the top of Blvd St.Michel... it closes late in the Summer and around 6pm in the Winter... ENJOY !!!"

It was a welcome segue from the hustle and bustle of busy Paris.Housekeeping: There are public toilets there, but as usual in Paris there is a charge to use them.Travelling around Europe with a toddler is hard work, so we welcomed the opportunity for her to run around and be crazy without disturbing anyone (and she had a lot of fun feeding the birds). There weren't a lot of people around, so we basically had the place to ourselves that day.We bought (an overpriced) hot chocolate from a boutique little cafe just inside the gates of the Gardens and took a stroll, eating baguettes we had bought from a patisserie earlier!

But- it is lovely for an older tourist- and yet again, a reminder that the Europeans (particularly in Nancy and Lumxembourg) seem to value Art for People- this sounds so cliche and Radio 4- speak- but in this visit to Europe-the experimentation with US as audience to ART at the Pompidou Museum in Metz, the scattering of Mexican modern art (sculpture by Javier Marin) through the city of Luxembourg and the FABULOUS trains in Europe that ARE CHEAPER than the UK. But back to Luxembourg- the reason we visited was a random article we saw in the newspapers, saying that this city was worth a visit, despite the fact it has a sober reputation. And the city is gracious, with gardens that reminded me of a more dramatic park than the one in Edinburgh. The city is built around a valley (now the park) and crossing the aqueducts, a good days walking will take you to the cathedral(unfortunately closed for the marriage of the Crown prince) and lovely restaurants. The train station is ten minutes away form a wonderful restaurant 'Nouveau-cafe gourmand' (Namur) where the pastries are sinful, and the coffee is superb. We walked the whole day- in and out of the park, into churches, art galleries and shops. And if you do want to eat cheaply-there is a small Indian restaurant(Gourmet Bagel) at the cross roads of care street and the aqueduct - for a really superb curry. Luxembourg is gracious, cultured, and also has a hospitable EU office- where all the things you did not know are available from well informed staff. Finally- walk through this city- spend time viewing buildings form outside, and take the time to visit the viewpoints in the park-a good city for away trip."

Particularly lovely are the delicate metal chairs - the essence of Parisian charm - for you to enjoy in the gravelled areas. We were also fascinated to see the original smaller version of the Statue of Liberty about 10 feet high and bronze, which can be found at the end of an avenue on the western extremity of the garden. It is surprising how different this statue seems when much closer to the scale of the human body. We would always visit this garden when in Paris, which is lovely in all seasons."

Once they got a slight push by way of the movable sails and the wind they are floating from one side of the pond to another end, but not always predictable, where they had to be caught, turned and pushed again.

It is a beautiful place to sit and enjoy fresh air in between other attractions - it's less than a ten minute walk from the Pantheon, for example. But the Parisians go to stroll the gravel paths or watch the kids play around the fountains, or just sit with friends and catch up on news. The old palace, which is now the home of the French Senate, is a beautiful building (on the outside, at least), and there is a garden of statues of the ancient queens of France, as well as other typical garden statuary, but really the appeal is to just enjoy the weather, the greenery all around, and the sense of being among the regular people of Paris. The gardens also have tennis courts and a children's playground for those who'd like some recreation, and there are lots of restaurants and cafes on the peripheral streets. We were there in both summer and winter, and enjoyed it in both types of weather."

The day we went, our feel were so hot that we cooled them in the large lake and watched the passing parade or Parisians going about their leisure. Some nice grassy spots too to relax and even have a snooze - just check that the sign allows you to sit there or you could risk a fine (so I am told!) \"Pelouse Interdite\" means keep of the grass but it's easy to tell - just follow what the locals are doing and you'll get it right."

The Jardin du Luxembourg is on my list that includes the Eiffel Tower. Entering from the Blvd. Saint Michel, it is a short walk to the Pavillon de la Fontaine, a vintage kiosk, where brunch, or simply cafe or a soft drink in the outdoor setting is heart warming. From there, it is another short walk to the Medici Fountain, which is striking because one can't help but wonder why it is such an appealing sight.This time, a daughter--younger--but not a child, was with me. We both came to the same conclusion: We must take my granddaughters to Paris, and take them here to ride the ponies, watch a puppet show, and play at the pond with a model sail boat. There is also the Carousel, of course. Paris can be very child friendly Simply wander and inhale the beauty of the floral displays; see the statues dedicated to poets and royal ladies down through time. At the far end, their is the Orangerie, where contemporary artists display their art. Throughout the park, one may pull up one of the many chairs and sit to relax and absorb the surroundings."

There was a shaded small pond with fountain off to the side that really beakoned after walking in museum all daay.

The garden is a place where you can just put your headphones on, and enjoy the scenery while relaxing your mind and soul. The garden is huge actually, you can have a walk in the garden between the big trees. You can also relax there watching the birds or the small lake enjoying the calm and peace of the place. Many people go there for running and practicing some other sports. There are few small shops there if you would like a drink or a snack. Truely recommend for people looking for peace of mind for sometime in this busy world we are living."

Kids were playing with boats on the lake, couples sitting at tables playing p\u00e9tanque, people playing boules and tennis and others just relaxing on loungers. There are enormous rows of topiaried trees at one end that look somewhat surreal. A definite MUST SEE, highly recommended, oasis of calm and tranquility within the bustling city."

The day we were there we watched a big group of locals playing the French version of Bocce Ball, called Petanque. So quaint and picturesque!

Sit around the fountain on one of the reclining green chairs, watch the old men play chess or petanque, watch children ride ponies, read a book in a secluded corner, marvel at the landscape architecture, the quiet space in the middle of a city, even when it's full of people."

This was a quieter place in Paris, away from the throngs of August tourists.I walked over to the Marionette Theatre , open is summer with two shows in the afternoon, pony rides , chess players , boules pitches, tennis and basket ball courts, an impromptu game of football. Lunch is available in two restaurants .The gardens are impeccably maintained , dotted with beautiful statues of famous French notables. There is also an apiary and orangerie. Avenues of trees grace the sounthern end of the gardens. The French Senate and the official home of its President are within the gardens as well -- at the Palais de Luxembourg and Petit Luxembourg.

No human at the station, and the ticket machine would not accept our US credit card (magnetic strip rather than a chip). This was the only place we had this problem, although we had been aware of the possibility. So we walked north to the St.-Michel Notre Dame station.

The large gardens\u2014actually a sort of big park\u2014are owned by the French Senate rather than the city of Paris, and are a great place to relax as well as being pretty to look at.The park is extremely well tended and landscaped. It is relatively quiet because of its large size (except for the voices of children and the wind in the trees), and it is filled with chairs in which you are welcome to sit and relax for as long as you wish. The area south of the Luxembourg Palace (where the French Senate meets) is very photogenic, although technically you are not supposed to photograph the palace itself without a permit (the Senate worries about inappropriate uses of photos\u2014guards may whistle at you if they catch you sneaking photos of the palace). There's a pond where kids can rent small toy boats to sail. The flowers are regularly replaced so that there's always something beautiful in bloom.There are areas of grass where you can sit, and areas where you can't. There are many semi-hidden areas behind the trees that are extremely relaxing to visit. There's a puppet theater for children, as well as a very nice playground (paid admission, but it's not expensive). There are tennis courts, p\u00e9tanque fields, a pony ride, a museum that hosts temporary expositions, a beekeeping area, jogging trails, a gazebo with occasional concerts, and more. I consider this to be one of the most relaxing and rejuvenating spots in the city. There are some snack bars and restaurants if you are hungry. If you choose to simply sit and read a book for a few hours, nobody will disturb you. If you have kids who are becoming irritable after hours of touring the city, the extensive playground might be just the thing to put them in a good mood. The park is nice enough that it justifies going there specifically to see it. Best to visit while you're already in the Latin Quarter, just for the sake of efficiency."

The flowers are splendid and the architecture delightful. On our first visit it was cool and overcast but on subsequent visits we discovered that 25-30 degrees of heat adds to the pleasure!

The gardens themselves are like any park but there is a huge playground in the middle with probably 500 kids running around it. You have to pay to enter the playground area but the kids seemed to be having a great time in there. My daughter certainly did and it was a nice break from the museums and churches."

The gardens are beautiful, and it's a great place to people watch, read, or picnic. Children can still sail boats on the little pond in front of the palace, just like they did in the iconic impressionist paintings. Take some food and wine and have a picnic or find a chair and read a book. Note that sitting on the grass is only permitted in a couple areas that are marked. If you don't see a sign, stay off the grass. Clean bathrooms available for 40 cents per use.Sometimes the gardens get crowded, especially on weekends in the summer.

The temperature reached 35C yesterday morning so we found a cool spot under he huge plain trees opposite the tennis courts. It was very empty but the nearby children's playground was packed. And noisy. Still, the vast garden caters to all ages and tastes. The formal garden is so long it stretches from one rue to another. The large fountain looks too inviting for the sweaty people but nobody misbehaved! We sat for about 2 hours reading while other Parisiens did the same, all with style. This is a free for all garden that is meticulously maintained and manicured. The city is incredibly well run and clean. This garden is the cherry on top of a meringue cake!!! Well worth a visit."

The gardens span a very large area but has much to offer. The pond where children can play with motorized boats is classic and must be seen. With the backdrop of the old palace it is quite picturesque. Take a baguette or a pastry and simply sit and relax. Music is often playing somewhere in the park.

From childhood memories of pushing the little sailboats around the central basin and having to pay old ladies(usually war widows who got that privilege from City Hall) or going to the ancient marionnettes theater on Thursdays or Sunday afternoons, enjoying an icecream frm the vendors at the gates ...to old age when our grandchildren can also play in a magnificent play area, ride poneys while I sit in now free chairs or the grass (it's no longer frowned on) or play tennis at very cheap prices (until 11am) or run around the perimeter with dozens of amateurs only to stop to admire the flowers, the fruit orchard with succulent looking pears each wrapped in paper to preserve them against pests or the bee enclosure. And then there are caf\u00e9s, concerts, chess players, p\u00e9tanque ( not bowling), AND the excellent art shows in the former orangerie of the Senate. There is even a world class museum next to the French Senate within its grounds. Can you say more ?"

Sitting on the grass is forbidden, but do as the Parisians do, grab a chair, pull it up to the edge of one the gorgeous lawns and open a book. The Luxembourg Gardens is the perfect respite from what can often be the chaos of urban Paris. An hour or two here each day should be required of all visitors to remind us of what makes Paris such an incredible city."

A boating pond, tennis courts, a bandstand and a puppet theatre provide changing activities and there are lovely views, including the Eiffel Tower away to the west.

The playground is conveniently located next to the puppet theater--also not to be missed. There are special low-to-the-ground benches in front reserved for the smaller children. The fact that it's in French doesn't matter--the action, puppets, scenery are enough. Then there are the sailboats which have intrigued children for years.

My daughter and her friend enjoyed imitating the poses of much of the statuary, and we have a dozen or so very fun photos of that bit of entertainment. We were unable to explore the entire park because of my limitations re. walking long and far, but what we did see was food for the soul. Just lovely.

Locals and tourists alike just hang out relaxing and enjoying the sunshine. There are hundreds of chairs and benches for people to sit at, a pond where children can float a boat (for a fee, of course), a carousel and amazing playground our kids would have adored (ages 2 and 5). There are bathrooms on the grounds, which I believe are for a fee (we did not use them) but entrance to the park is free.The park is adorned with beautiful golden statues and has tons of shade if you want it. You'll find students due to the proximity to the Sorbonne and other universities and business people working on their laptops or people just taking a break reading a book. We enjoyed just sitting and chatting until they closed the park an hour before sunset, which was really late due to the summer solstice (June 21st). If you do go at the same time of year, the area gets very lively for the Festival du Musique, the music festival where people just set up stages and plug in their amps and entertain the public. The park is not too big and easy to walk around. There is a Senate museum right on the grounds and beautiful flowers and water features throughout. We loves the grooming of the trees into popsicle shapes. The whole area has good shopping as well and some beautiful 3 and 4 star hotels. Highly recommended as a stop for a few hours of quiet and relaxation and of course, my favourite, people watching!"

As a native New Yorker I have been to Central Park in Manhattan many times but the Luxembourg Gardens are very different. They are cleaner, extremely well kept and very beautiful. For me a visit to the Gardens is a time to relax, enjoy the welcoming environment and escape from a busy day at work. I love Paris and Luxembourg Gardens make me feel at peace. No visit to Paris is really complete without spending an hour or more in Luxembourg Gardens."

So we decided that a stroll in the Luxembourg Gardens would give us the exercised needed before long-haul flights. If you haven't been to these exquisite gardens, then do go. Here is info about their history as listed on Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardin_du_Luxembourg.On a warm afternoon Parisians come out of their apartments and sit in the dappled sun under the trees. It was like an Impressionist painting with the sun filtering through the lush tree canopy. People strolled lazily around, and lolled on the lawn that allowed public access. The Medici Fountain is exquisite.Of course we had to visit the tearooms where we indulged in salted caramel icecream sundaes - and this is a delightful memory that will endure forever. Sitting outside the Luxembourg Gardens tearooms eating these toothsome delights. And as if in a fairytale, a young bridal couple strolled by, she looking chic in her knee-length cream dress with full skirt, a blush-coloured satin bow at her waist and matching cream bolero. They were off to join their family and friends for a wedding picnic in the park. Utterly delightful!"

Located in the southern most part of Paris' Latin Quarter, the Luxembourg Gardens offers the widest varieties of relaxation and outdoor family time. Paris is full of gardens from the historic, large-sized ones to the small, cozy gardens hidden throughout the city.Luxembourg certainly qualifies as a large garden. It's the gardens of the beautiful Luxembourg Palace which is the home of the French Senate. The gardens have something for everyone. It's filled with close to 100 strategically placed sculptures, beautiful floral landscapes, and fountains each surrounded by benches prime for unwinding and people watching. As we walked through these sections of the park we noticed Parisians enjoying the soothing quiet. But the gardens offer much more. There's a large playground in the center of the park with a huge assortment of jungle gymns, monkey bars, and slides. Directly behind the playground we found Parisians playing a kind of tennis while to the left we sat and watched a boules game. There are plenty of paths for jogs or romantic strolls. And in the middle lies a beautiful crafted grass section bordered by some gorgeous flowers. We sat in some chairs that surrounded the grassy garden center with a large number of locals and just soaked up the setting. The Palace sat in the background like a postcard. It was lovely.There's so much else worth mentioning including the Medici Fountain and the Luxembourg museum. We had a wonderful time there and didn't want to leave. There is so much to experience both with your spouse and/or family, plus it's a wonderful opportunity to experience the Parisian culture. We loved it."

There are fountains, chairs available and even cafe's. I use to teach school not too far from there, and my favorite pass time was to have a mini-picnic during my lunch breaks with my colleagues. There's also a jogging trail around the perimeter. It's not marked as a jogging trail per se, but it's pretty obvious once your there. There's also a small museum showing different exhibits. They also have areas to play chess etc., and for the kids lots of play areas.During warmer months, there'll be entertainment such as orchestras or visiting bands.

When I was a child I would have loved the playground at Luxembourg Gardens. Our 5-year-old certainly did. I guess the only downside is the small charge for entry. It was our last day in Paris and I had successfully managed to spend all of my euros by then so the last bit of pocket change that I had was just enough to pay for my son's admission. So my wife and I just sat next to the fence and watched him play with Parisian children. It was definitely a great experience for him."

I visited on a bank holiday when school was out, so there were lots of children playing with sailboats in the pond. It was a chilly, windy day so I didn't stay put for long, but it was still enjoyable to walk around the park and see the dogs of Paris and their people. In nicer weather, I think a picnic in Luxembourg Gardens would surpass any cafe or bistro experience."

Very soothing to one's nerves and spirit.The well coiffured lawns and manicured trees add to the charm of the place. We visited the gardens on a Sunday and there were many joggers, people who had come with their kids to relax and plenty of people exercising.... But the atmosphere was still very peaceful and relaxing.The greenery is beautifully maintained. The little pond in the center had little sail boats and ducks. The only thing that I would give a thumbs-down to here was the fact that the toilets were locked (they were chargeable at 40 cents per person - but they were locked) Thankfully, there was a mechanised toilet just outside on the pavement which we could use.Do keep the weather in mind before making a trip here - we were caught there by the rains and that dampened our spirit a bit as we could not take many pictures of this lovely place.1. Romantic place if you wish to go with your partner.2. Fun and happy place with rides if you wish to take your children here.3. Absolutely the must-do place if you wish to go for a jog with your jogging buddy (or alone too)4. The place to be - if you wish to linger alone with your thoughts.Do have the coffee ice-cream here , if you are a coffee-lover. For Euro 2.50 in a waffle cone, the icecream is really value for money."

For children, apart from the boating pond, there is the best city playpark, for which you pay a small entrance fee. It is fenced so difficult for children to run off, there are age specific areas and a small kiosk selling drinks, sweets and ice-cream and a larger food stall just opposite the play park. There is lots of seating and shade underneath the trees. Toilets too. The best place to take the little people to burn off some steam and give them a break being tourists for a bit. There are a few crepe kiosks in the gardens too."

This is Paris' largest park and it's really amazing. If you go on a sunny Sunday you will literally see thousands of people there.We went on a great Sunday after a few days of rainy weather so it seems like everyone and their kids were all here. Literally thousands of people. On the weekends they have live music concerts that are free so people are all gathered around listening to the great music.The park has chairs scattered around the park which you can move to other areas or near the fountains if you want.There are several entrances/exits all around the park. The park is massive. In the center is the fountain which is beautiful. They had small boats in it that kids were playing with on sunday. And something that some people don't realize is the fountain is FULL of big fish. So if you throw in some food watch them float to the top and gobble up the food. Your kids will LOVE it!There are tennis courts, basketball courts, and there are even pony rides that you can take your kids on. Tickets are \u20ac3 for shorter 300 m rides and \u20ac5 for two tickets which you need on the longer 600 m rides. Our kids loved it! So something great you can do if you have young kids.The Palace there is also gorgeous. It's fun for the entire family. They have various events inside the park. On Sunday they had kids practicing their fencing lessons and another concert in the end of the park near the kids playground.The only thing not so great is there are only like 2 bathrooms for the entire park. If you have kids and don't have much patience for waiting.... just go across the street from the main entrance and use the McDonald's bathroom in the basement. You have to buy something (just get a bottled water if you're not hungry) and they will give you a receipt with a Code to use the bathroom (WC - water closet). Just punch in the code on the door lock."

It is very large with many different attractions within its fences which often have artistic/photographic displays on the street-side. Of course, in spring and summer it is particularly delightful and I have seen open-air concerts and operas there during the warmer months, so check to see what's on. The Fontaine de Medicis offers a shady, welcoming space to sit and dream for a while in the many chairs around the rectangular pond leading to the impressive fountain. Near here is a restaurant with indoor/outdoor seating and a public toilet. There is also a take-away with outdoor seating and an attached caf\u00e9 near the Marionette Theatre - there is another public toilet nearby. No matter what your age, you will find many spots to sit and while away a few hours, reading or watching the world go by. And there are some very interesting attractions near le Jardin du Luxembourg - the Panth\u00e9on is just a short walk away and is a fascinating insight into the way the French honour their great men & women. Don't miss Foucault's Pendulum in the grand foyer which, despite being a copy is still impressive (the original is in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers). In part of the old Palais du Luxembourg on one perimeter of the garden is the S\u00e9nat and the Mus\u00e9e de Luxembourg which has temporary artistic exhibitions and is often worth a visit. Buses, the Metro/RER B all stop outside the gardens so it is easily accessible."

There's also a kiosk that sells coffee, tea, drinks, and sweets along with little trinkets. My daughter had great fun. To make it a cheap outing, I stopped at a local bread shop on Rue Vaugirard (somewhere between Boulevard Raspail and Rue Guynemer) for sandwiches and a little grocery store (8 a Huit - 31 Rue de Vaugirard @ Rue Jean Bart) for drinks and snacks. We picniced on the playground and had a great day!"

Even observing the placement of empty chairs gives one a hint of what was happening before. The two cages has tasty offerings, the children's boat basin delightful to watch, the Fontaine des Medicis fun for its mysterious water flow. One can spend a whole day here exploring all the statues, checking out the bee hives, watching the chess players,or taking in a children's puppet show. Fabulous in any season and at Ny time of day although it does close at sunset."

This attraction is a \u201csleeper\u201d and does not appear high on many of the sample itineraries that we read. It is absolutely worth 30 minutes or 3 hours \u2013 whatever time you feel like taking as a break from the museums, crowds, and other wonderful things to take in while in Paris.We only had 4 days \u2013 but our trip to Versailles was cancelled (for unrelated reasons) and so we were looking or something that we could do within walking distance of the Latin Quarter.It was a beautiful sunny day, with blue sky and warmth. People were spread through out the gardens, tennis courts, fountains, lawns and everywhere else that people in Paris go to just soak it all in. I might have felt less enthusiastic about the time we spent at the Luxembourg Gardens if the weather was anything less than spectacular. It is a great place for a picnic lunch, people watching, reading by the water, or strolling with someone you love \u2013 or hope to love someday!Enjoy!"

It's a garden in Italian style...huge and beautiful, originally owned by Duke of Luxemburg. In 1612, it was purchased by Marie de' Medici, mother of Louis XIII and later designed in a more French style before it opened to the public. It is a wonderful garden with a octagonal pond at its centre where children float small boats. It is full of seasonal flowers, fountain and Palais du Luxembourg. Travellers who bring their children along should not miss this spot as it is in the 6e arrondissement of Paris."

The fountain des Medicis often has sculptural art exhibits floating in the water. A few weeks ago the pond was covered in ice and was covered in mallard ducks; a kind of art.

Of course, we were there when local children were in school, so my children pretty much had the run of the park.

The Jardin du Luxembourg is the second largest public park in Paris and is the garden of the French Senate, which is housed in the Palais du Luxembourg. Behind the palace lie the Orangerie and some modern sculptures, as well as a beautifully sculpted homage to Delacroix. There are various statues of former French queens and famous women around the area of the garden fronting the palace. My favorite items of interest are the sculpture of the Actor (you can see the Pantheon behind him) and the area of the garden near the Medici Fountain \u2013 it looked like a nice place to just sit in. The first model of the Statue of Liberty was likewise in the garden."

Fashionable women of all ages were decked out making me think I was underdressed. But that is Paris, people dress to take out the trash. The gardens are truly lovely, with beautiful statues that intrigues one with their history and the ever changing flower beds and massive pots encourage me to return each time i am in Paris. After spending time in the hustle-bustle of Paris I can see why everyone flocks to the parks, it certainly helps the soul to become reacquainted with nature.

Jardin du Luxembourg seems to be used by local people for running and walking exercises, plus people that work on the Palace where the France senate is located. I'm not sure if it is possible to visit any part of the Palace, anyway you can take photos of the garden, palace from the outside and several statues.You can easily get to Jardin du Luxembourg by metro. I don't remember in what station you should stop, but all stations have metro maps with the location of the main point of interests, which include the Luxembourg. The Pantheon, another interesting tourist attraction, is nearby the Luxembourg and you can actually see it from there. There are several restaurants and fast food restaurant in the area, plus other stores that you can easily explore by wandering the street along Jardin du Luxembourg. So my suggestion is that you go to Jardin du Luxembourg, explore it, relax and of course take several pictures of the statues, birds and the Palace. After that you can have lunch no any cafe or restaurant that just steps way from the exists and finally visit the Pantheon. The area in gerenal is full of people, traffic, maps on some corners indicanting the attrations in the area. You can go around without the need of asking for directions. It's absolutely a pleasant area to spend some time.The entrance is free."

The park is filled with the famous green metal Parisian chairs to sit and people watch or just take a break for awhile. Every summer that I have visited, there are different arrangements of flowers colorfully displayed, great photo opportunities. There is a big octagonal pond in front of the Senate House that houses a few mallard ducks and usually during the day in the summer, there is a toy sailboat rental cart right beside the pond. For around 2-3 euros, children of all ages can enjoy sailing a French wooden sailboat for an hour. Kids and adults have fun sailing the boats with stick around the pond. The wind just pushes the boats around. During the summer, I have also seen donkey rentals for an hour for the children. They are led and walked around the gardens. The children enjoy this experience which the United States does not offer.Despite how busy the Luxembourg Gardens can get with foot traffic, one can always manage to find an empty seat with plenty of the famous green french metal chairs. A very relaxing stop. The views from the Luxembourg Gardens are quite nice as well- the Senate House, Pantheon, and Montparnasse Tower (the tallest building within the Parisian skyline).Very accessible from from Metro stop at Blvd. St. Michel and lots of shopping and restaurant opportunities in the area."

The inscription read \"if you do not respect an outlawed queen, respect an unhappy and miserable mother\"; this referred of course to the fact that her son was killed at Tewkesbury, England during the War of the Roses. I was surprised to find these personages of English history here, then realised that many were linked to french history too.Just ambling through the jardins, admiring the perfect symmetry of the french style of gardens, and reveling in the joie de vivre and enjoyment of the people there made for a perfect Sunday."

Aloha!We went to Paris the last 2 weeks of September, during a very hot spell when temperatures in the city reached the mid 80's farenheit - so all of the parks were well frequented with people catching early fall sunshine!This was my first trip to the Jardin du Luxembourg and I have to say it is the epitome of what I think of as the perfect Parisian park! From the lovely flowers to the large pond with the little boats, to the boule players, to the beautiful statuary, this place just stole my heart!We spent about 2 hours wandering around the park, sitting in the sunshine and people watching - I loved every minute of it and certainly plan on going back on our next trip to Paris in 2012!"

No matter where you set our eyes, the earlier harsh white light of noon was turned into a soothing and tranquil glow. Secondly, it seemed that more families were present with their children floating boats in the main fountains, or just enjoying the late afternoon sun reading, or enjoying a good conversation. But be aware that the park closes down just before sunset in the summer, 7:30, so take advantage of this remarkable garden and get there early, 4 or 5, and relax, and enjoy that golden glow."

Lots of joggers, people reading, small yoga groups, etc. I wouldn't necessarily put this at the top of the list of things to see in Paris, but after you've done the major things, you will have earned the relaxation that these gardens provide. Extremely picturesque and close to the Pantheon.Interestingly, Luxembourg Palace houses the French Senate, which explains two otherwise curious things about the gardens: the guards that are marching about, and the abrupt and serious closing time when the guards shepherd all the visitors out of the park."

There were lots of Americans there so our kids were able to make some friends. There are many jungle gyms, 2 spinning contraptions and sections for toddlers. Warning: There is no supervision at this playground and some of the equipment is dangerous. We saw several children get thrown off the spinners.The playground has plenty of shade so it's tolerable even in the heat of August. There are tiny bathrooms which were clean for park standards, and a small concession stand selling beverages and candy. There's a small entrance fee: EUR2 for kids, EUR1 for adults. Many parents chose to stay outside (adding to the lack of supervision).Right outside the playground is a long strip where kids ages 3-12 can ride pedal cars for a small fee.Our kids loved the playground so much that we went back 2 more afternoons. The museums can wait till they're older. For this trip, we just enjoyed watching them have a great time at a beautiful Parisian park."

The Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg is part of the Palais where the Ministry of Culture and Senate are domiciled. Check the temporary exhibition program as there are occasional gems. Sometimes, the iron railings of the park are used for exhibitions and displays and so there is always something of interest. One of our fave activities on a nice Parisian day is to get together a basket with some fresh bread from one of our preferred boulangeries; some tomatoes, ham, cheese, lettuce and apples or pears from Monoprix/Monop and along with some mineral water, enjoy a leisurely lunch in the gardens, where there are many locations from which to choose."

Jardin de Luxembourg (Luxembourg Gardens) is located within the 6th district and is the 2nd largest public park in Paris. The park also houses the French Senate, located on the park grounds within the Luxembourg Palace. This park has quite an interesting history. In 1611, Marie de Medicis, the widow of Henry IV, commissioned to have this imitation of the Pitti Palace built as a tribute to her native Florence, Italy.The calm atmosphere of the park is what I find most appealing. The park itself contains over one hundred public sculptures and works of art, in addition to breathtaking and picturesque gardens. On any given day, visitors will have an assortment of activities to partake in. The gardens include a fenced in play ground, a toddler pool, tennis courts, and plenty of seating throughout all of the park grounds. For young children there are small sailboat rentals and antique toy cars to ride. In addition, there are often free musical performances in the gazebo and art exhibitions in l' Orangerie and within the small gallery building. There is also a small quaint cafe, with indoor and outdoor seating available. What you will find most frequently are people sitting back with friends and family...sharing stories of life and love while drinking wine and snacking on baguettes.A simple yet fulfilling experience that you will not regret...just sit back and enjoy."

Our first visit to Paris - my college-aged daughter and I started out walking towards Rue St. Germaine from the Bon Marche area, or so we thought. We ended up at the gate to the park and peering through at the beautiful gardens, thought we should take a look. We wandered into a refuge of quiet beauty - I immediately knew this must be the Luxembourg Gardens I had read about. To our right was the Medici Palace - grand in every way and to the front (or back) of it was a walkway filled with various flowers and statues. We continued up the path and came to a fountain and statue which we read was the Medici Fountain. The magnificent trees gave much needed shade from the sun and benches along the path offered a peaceful resting spot. Towards the middle of the area was a large, round, shallow pool where we watched children leading small sailboats around. At the end of the garden area were tall, pine-like trees lining a path out to another gate. We saw small cafe areas to the side which led to a concert area where we heard an American high school group playing jazz. I think they were called \"American Music Abroad.\" This garden offered many things for people to enjoy and we had hoped to return before leaving but did not get the time. I am very glad we stumbled upon it as it turned out to be one of our favorite spots in Paris!"

Whenever my wife and I come to Paris, we always make it a point to spend at least one afternoon in the city's Luxembourg Gardens, the Sixth Arrondissement oasis of peace. Over the past twenty years of our visit there, we continue to be enthralled by the rich tapestry of Parisian life, of past, present and a hint of the future, strands of human existence that are woven together as in a fine Aubusson or Gobelins.The past so elegantly reflected in the stately and commanding Luxembourg Palace, the impressive Fountain of the Medicis, the Orangerie, the ancient trees, the stately, formal gardens, the statuary, the gravel-paved paths that enwomb the site. So palpable and intense is the history of the park that one can all but breathe the presence, almost reach out and touch the lives of those who once so elegantly trod here ... the wealthy, the estated, the powerful of Parisian society. The reincarnation of centuries past, of simple and unfettered lifestyles so long ago gone yet increasing, nostalgically yearned for are one of the Gardens' mystical, spiritual, arcane yet sense-arousing draws.The future hinted at with the growing incursion of technology, of cell phones and Ipods, of PCs and Nooks in this most peaceful of Parisian paradises.But it is in the present, in the people who stroll and play here, who laze and nod and nap, who paint and write, who muse and converse, picnic and play here amid the all-enwombing, all-entombing pervasive ambiance of peace that draw my wife back, year after year, to revel in the diversity of races, ethnicities and cultures that co-mingle and, while remaining separate, somehow homogenize into a cohesive and living whole for the few hours spent together in the quietude of the gardens, the silence of contemplation beneath a warm and unctuous Parisian sun punctuated now and again by the gleeful laughter of children sailing their little boats on the Garden's expansive lake, by their wailing cries when they stumble and fall on the park' s gravelly paths, For utter peace, for a place of immersion into self and self-thought, one cannot do better than to spend some time in the Luxembourg Gardens. Pull up a wrought iron chair or two (as so many visitor do, the second chair to prop up one's extended legs) and sit back, relax, listen to your heart beat, feel your life force course through you veins, let the aura of the Gardens absorb your being and, when at last you are compelled to leave this Parisian oasis, go forward from this place of beauty refurbished and relaxed. The self-healing and rejuvenation that one can find here, free as the Parisian breezes that swirl and lift their dust devils above the garden's blooms, are more physically, psychically and spiritually soothing that are the massages and mud baths that lie in wait beyond the Gardens' gates at the city's most illustrious (and expensive) spas.Ah, Luxembourg Gardens. Come and rediscover yourself. It is well worth the time spent here and it just might become, for you, a special place that touches and changes your life."

My wife and I came here shortyly after stepping off the Eurostar and were immediatley impressed. We were staying in the Latin Quarter and the Gardens were just a short walk away. I don't know what it is, but as soon as we stepped foot throught the gates I just felt a wave of laid back relaxation take over me. There was a latin band playing music under the trees. When you get to the common area, there is a big pond with water fountain Surrounded by a giant gravel ring and then grass of course that makes up the park. There lawn chairs everywhere. We found a couple of chairs and just camped out. People were sunbathing on the grass, lounging on the other chairs and taking pictures with the fountain. There's a nice building surrounded with pots of flowers and statues providing a cool backdrop. Along the building their is a huge path that runners were going up and down.I have to say, back here in America, the park would be filled with people wearing clothes like tank tops, printed tees, cargo shorts and flip flops. At this park (and in Paris in general) people are dressed much nicer. I could take pictures all over the park and submit them to a fashion magazine. I felt like I was in the middle of one of those Ralph Lauren commercials or something. The weather was perfect too. 70 degrees(in May) and really quite comfortable. It's a place where you just want to come and lounge. Like starbucks...but not."

Lovely flowers, a large pond, where people were sailing boats, plenty of benches and chairs, lovely green grass, where so many people were sitting having picnics, and a gorgeous house at the top of the gardens. It's very picturesque.Entry to the gardens is free and if we ever go back to Paris and the weather is nice, then we will certainly head here for a picnic and just spend some time enjoying life and people watching.I'd highly recommend this for couples, families or just those who like nice scenery and want to sok up the local atmosphere."

That is exactly what we did our first day there! We took a stroll down Rue Mouffetard, as it was close to our hotel, found a bakery, a wine store, and a cheese shop (which you can easily do no matter where you wander in Paris). We made our selections based on what looked good since we don't speak much french (it's hard to go wrong in the food dept. when in Paris) and then walked to Luxembourg Gardens and enjoyed our little picnic. The gardens were beautiful, the food was great, and it was nice to see lots of locals doing the same thing we were! The park is quiet and calm and just lovely. Our stop at Luxembourg Gardens was a really great way to get over our jetlag and get adjusted to the pace of things in Paris. Highly recommend!"

It is made up of 60 acres and is Paris' most popular park. I'ts formal terraces and wide walkways are adorned with statues of French queens and many other interesting statues. There is an lovely octagonal pool in the middle of the park where children were sailing miniature sail boats and locals were gathered in small groups over a picnic or reading a book or newspaper. There is an open-air cafe and a puppet theater, a bandstand and even tennis courts. As we walked through, we passed several lone musicians playing in different areas of the park.The beautiful gardens sweep down form the Palais de Luxemborg which we learned is the seat of the French Senate and was originally built for Marie de Medici, widow of Henri IV. The architecture is beautiful.When I return to Paris, this is a place I will visit again when I have a couple of hours to relax, sit by the pool and enjoy the view and jambone and fromage baguette and watch the people of Paris, It was a lovely experience and I'd absolutely recommend visiting the Jardin de Luxembourg."

I'm not sure I'll have time to post a formal trip report for my Paris trip as we are doing so much every day but I thought I'd take time to post a review on this beautiful park.My wife and 13 month old baby are on a 1.5 month long trip and we absolutely LOVE parks. We've hit a few here in Paris so far. The Jardin du Luxembourg is really beautiful with a water fountain in the heart of the park. There is easy access to the park as there is a metro/RER stop right outside of the park. We walked to it as we were in nearby Latin Quarter eating lunch.The park itself has some beautifully manicured lawns but unfortunately they don't allow you to sit on the grass, which is a shame. Instead the city has placed hundreds of metal chairs within the park that people are free to use. There are some cement pathways and in the middle it's tree lines so it's good for some shade. Especially for days like yesterday that was absolutely hot and humid (about 95 degrees out). Many people were reading books, just resting or talking on the phone. Several people were sleeping on two chairs. Where there isn't grass there is just dirt areas which isn't ideal to sit on. We brought a big blanket and sat enough the trees for shade. It was very peaceful. It was especially nice as our baby is just starting to walk. There are a few statues within the park but the focus are the fountain and some beautiful flowers. In the heart of the park there are some tennis courts and also there is a child's playground where they actually charge you to get in. Adults are more than children. Nothing special. Just the usual type of playground toys. Also, they had miniture horserides for children. We only saw one person sitting on the grass and he was sleeping. Everyone else really respects the park rules. I didn't see anyone selling any type of drinks within the park but just outside the park gates there were several vendors in carts selling drinks and across the street from the gates there is some restaurants and newsstands. Also, near the entrance off to the right from the main entrance there is a beautiful fountain with statues that make for a nice photo. All in all a great place to sit back and relax a bit. Probably difficult if you are only here a short amount of time but we are here in Paris for 10 days and really love parks. If you are a park lover stop by."

You can't get into the Palace itself as now used for the government.One unique thing about this park is the thousands of metal chairs everywhere which makes it great for just sitting around and soaking up the sun. now if only they let people on the grass, it would be perfect.

In the distance is the sound of playground equipment squeaking & turning. It's all a background noise that occasionally gets punctuated by the sound of someone re-arranging one of the garden's metal chairs, the sound of a child running by, the raising of a voice or a drawing out of a French vowel to exclaimate a point. In the far distance you occasionally hear the crack of a petunk ball striking another - the petunk matches are really serious affairs by those men that play.

Les Jardins du Luxembourg includes reflecting pond, fountains, statues of French queens, etc. Wonderful for a few hours or an afternoon in the park... great place to sit & read, people-watch, etc. During the spring/summer, the city puts out thousands of chairs for everyone to sit (wherevery you want).Kids play area looked fun (but at 41 I was not allowed in by myself!)."

We also went to see a traditional puppet show which was enjoyable even in French as the story was known and loved being the 3 little pigs which most people already know the story. My daughter then had a pony ride which she loved. The gardens are very clean and well tended it seemed that a lot of people make their way there on a weekend with a good book or to meet friends and just while away the time."

            "review": "Terrific formal European public garden-- a must see.. As opposed to another review shown above on the Lux. , this is not a shabby hotel but a wonderful , large and peaceful formal public garden adjoining the Latin Quarter. There are many beautiful things to see here including the rear of the French Senate building (originally built as a chateau for one of the Medici's along with a gorgeous sculptured fountain) , a central foutain/mini-lake , many sculptures (including one of the Statue of Liberty w/ a large American Oak and a plaque commemorating Sept.11th) , rides for the kids (including poney rides -- all for a fee) ------- I could go on but chose to show some in pictures instead. Try it, you'll like it."

Pick up some delicious \"take-out\" at Gerard Mulot down the street and spend a leisurely few hours walking around the gardens or sitting in the fountain area. The place is a work of art."
