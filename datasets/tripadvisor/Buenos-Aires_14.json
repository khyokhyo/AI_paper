Ceilings of the church were decorated with frescos of fine art painting. The floor is covered with venetian or bazantine-style mosaics. Like many Cathedrals the world over it is a pictorial museum. It features the Tomb of General San Martin. When the tomb is open it always is flanked by a uniformed honor guard.Please leave a donation - these free visits are a privilege, and although I encouraged it the group of tourists I joined donated nothing (all American), I was saddened."

If you are a Christian (and even for other religions) and you admire Pope Francis you should visit the cathedral that served as the home for his religious service as cardinal for so many years. The cathedral is also a historic place, the tomb of general San Martin can be found inside. I have been impressed by the many groups of young students (10 - 14 years of age) who came to visit the cathedral, keeping the religious sentiments alive among the young generation and make them familiar with the the glory of their country."

In a side chapel of the cathedral one can visit the tomb of general San Martin (and his assistant generals, and an urn of an unknown soldier), with official guards. This itself makes this building an important site for those interested in Argentina. The cathedral is unusual in its appearance from outside (a similar neo-classical shape can be seen in the cathedral in Vilnius). Behind the main altar (you can walk there) is a framed mosaic that Pope Francis sent to this church after being elected as Pope. There are also other important sites in this cathedral, such as the figure of Mary the patron saint of Buenos Aires (she is holding a ship)."

His black sarcophagus is guarded by three female figures that represent Argentina, Chile and Peru, three of the regions freed by the General."

The crowds were heavy due to the San Martin holiday, but definitely worth visiting due to its significance with respect to Pope Francis, as the former Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires before becoming pope. The facade of the church looks more like a public government building than a church, which is something to take note of when visiting the cathedral."

Also currently it's protected by temporary iron gates on the outside perimeter, just like the Pink Palace so one would think is a law or public building. When we visited we had the luck of witnessing guards marching inside to open the tomb of one of Argentinas most prominent figures which rests inside. So, we just followed the guards inside and boy were we surprised. The inside is massive and reminiscent of The Vatican's St. Peter's in decorations, colors, scale and general luxury. It was very busy inside because of the ceremony but it was truly an amazing church. Each altar is a work of art on its own and the main altar is fabulous. Every detail and every corner is been decorated in opulence. It doesn't feel like a very religious or meditation inspiring place, but we witness several people praying with great fervor at the altars. "

Once inside, the building looks very church-like. The interior is quite grand and of eclectic architectural styles. The cathedral houses tombs of important generals, a tomb of the unknown soldier, as well as the tomb of Argentina's liberator General Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn.

It's located on the historic Plaza de Mayo which you must visit if you see little else of Buenos Aires. Plaza de Mayo is the site of casa rosada from whose balcony Evita delivered her famous speeches, and bits of the cabildo where the May Revolution (25 May) that inaugurated the liberation of Argentina from Spain, began.The facade of the cathedral is 19th century and to my eyes is nothing special. The interior is mostly 18th century and is well worth a look around. I've attended mass here several times. During mass it is usually very crowded and you can't really see much. At other times you can wander around the main nave or the side chapels which are quite numerous and diverse -- full of paintings and statuary. The main attraction for provincial tourists is the tomb of general san Martin,one of the most famous of all the liberators of South America. During the day it has an honor guard provided by Los Patricios, the oldest and most prestigious regiment in the Argentine army, in 19th century uniforms. Provincial Argentinos flock here to pay respects to their hero.The interior is in a fairly constant state of renovation because it is so ornate by local standards. Generally speaking, though, it is archetypical of 19th century church construction."

This building was influenced by Argentina's liberation and constructed in the 1800's, and is heavily influenced by classical Roman of Greek forms of architecture. The frieze above the main doorway is full of iconography related to the return of Joseph to his father Jakob and to his brothers - uniting the tribes, in this case, the different factions in Argentina after the liberation and during their 30 year Civil War. The inside is lovely and very different from other cathedrals in Mexico, Central and South America. There is an interesting story about San Martin, who's buried in an adjacent room, and the Holocaust Memorial, which was placed in the room where the Cardinal prior to the current Pope Francis is buried."

Fortunately people remain fairly respectful and don't get too loud. A hidden treasure is the alcove containing the mausoleum of General San Martin which is guarded by 2 austere soldiers.

Drop box has no provision for visits prior to 2011 so drop box date is not correct. My visit was in 2011. I just joined TripAdvisor this month. The architecture of this particular church is somewhat different from that of most churches. This church has a Greco-Roman design on the outside. The inside however has the traditional design found in most Catholic Churches. After Easter Sunday mass the Arch Bishop of Buenos Aires greeted well wishers at the rear of the church. I had the opportunity to reach out and shake his hand while he looked up at me with a look of astonishment. Maybe because I am taller than him or maybe because I am an American. Nevertheless the luck of the Irish must have rubbed off on him because the next thing I know he got elected Pope. ( I am American of Irish descent )."

It reminds me of the superior court in a state level with all those columns in Greek architecture. The interior is a cathedral alright One interesting section is the burial place of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, the founding father of Argentina, Peru and Chile, the Roman Catholic church did not agree to have him buried at the cathedral, his supporters managed to create a wing on the right of the cathedral and had him buried there. His mausoleum is guarded by 3 life-size female figures that represent Argentina, Chile and Peru, three of the regions freed by San Martin. And the only access to this mausoleum is through the cathedral. Quite interesting"

Inside, one sees beautiful stained glass windows, an ornate alter, fairly good oil paintings depicting the life of Christ (with emphasis on the crucifiction), an armed guard whose swords dissuade one from defacing the rather large tomb of the first governor of modern Argentina, now beatified (although I saw nobody praying to him), perhaps for being one of those 'good' politicians. In one alcove there is a life-sized model of Jesus riding a donkey, something I have not seen in a cathedral apart from Christmastime. Several alcoves have small dolls representing Mary and dressed in elaborate dolls clothes. Again something unusual from my limited experience. A nice side chapel was separated by large curtains, allowing the three occupants to pray in relative privacy this Sunday, while tourists like myself paraded through the main part."

It has been rebuilt and renovated a few times. Now the cathedral is mixed with 18th century dome and 19th century facade. The interior has 18th century precious statues and altar pieces, and Renaissance decorations. The big attraction inside is Mausoleum of General San Martin. He was a Spanish captain that helped Argentina, Chile, and Peru gain independence from the Spanish in the early part of the 19th century.At the Mausoleum they have 2 soldiers standing guard.

I like the intricacies of the art works of these alcoves, walls and ceilings. Tomb of General Martin - two guards stand alert next to this tomb. This General helped liberate Argentina from Spain. I think he did the same thing in other countries such as Peru (saw his statutes in Lima, Peru).Other attractions near by: Cabildo, Parque de Mayo, and Casa Rosada.I said my prayers before leaving this beautiful Cathedral.

A surprise was the tomb of Argentine liberator Jose de San Martin with an honor guard of Argentine soldiers in full ceremonial dress uniform.

This low-rise neo-classical structure, with its massive pillars and triangular facade busy with stone carvings, and topped with a very modest cupola, began in the 16th Cent., but not all that well, because it had to go through several reincarnations most of which were a result of poor design or bad craftsmanship in its earlier phases. It occupies a prime site at one corner of Plaza de Mayo, and as the major ecclesiastical building of the city it seems like a massive understatement. The interior is more in line with its status, with lots of religious flourishes such as a Stations of the Cross executed by local artists, and two unusual statues of the Saviour: Christ of Buenos Aires, and Christ of Great Wealth. A little more wealth is needed, as several areas are not in good repair, with peeling surfaces and eroded plaster and brickwork. Most of the available money seems to go to the maintenance of the Cathedral's showpiece, the Mausoleum of General San Martin and two of his senior military associates who, together with Bolivar, brought about the independence of the continent. Apart from the florid architecture, sculpture, the high-raised pedestal with the great soldier lying flat on his back and draped with a shroud, and the Roman style multi-concentric decorated dome, there are plaques of appreciation from several other countries to whose liberation San Martin contributed. A nice democratic touch is that the Unknown Soldier of Independence is also buried with his superiors. Two live soldiers are permanently on guard. The cathedral boasts an enormous organ of 3,500 individual pipes that is worth a look, although I did not hear it play. The final sight that struck a chord with me is a small chapel ----- the first on the left as you enter, that holds a celebrated icon ----- a small framed portable representation of the Virgin called Our Lady of Lujan --------- that San Martin carried with him into battle, with gratifying results. On the left wall of the same chapel, almost as a non-sequitur as I cannot see the relationship, you will find a memorial to the Holocaust, and plaques describing the 200,000 survivors who made their homes in Argentina."

My experience near the Cathedral spoiled my entire week in BsAs, and I would never stay in the city again in consequence. The Cathedal, Plaza de Mayo, and area near the Cathedral has a concentration of those pickpockets who throw \"pigeon poop\" on tourists. They work in pairs.Here's what happened to us, although similar stories are told by others. To get to the area my husband and I took the Blue Subte line, and got out at Peru station (because they had closed access to the Catedral station, for what reason we didn't know at the time). This meant that we had to walk on the streets near the Cathedral, near entrances to the Subte, and Plaza de Mayo. Two middle aged ladies, well dressed so you would never suspect them, were standing nearby as I looked dow into the Subte entrance and saw it was barricaded. Suddenly I felt wet runny liquid \"goop\" all over my hair, clothes and bag I was carrying, which came from behind me. It was dripping down my forehead, and I could hardly see because my glasses were covered with it. There was a lot of it - perhaps as much as half a litre! I turned and could sort of see one of the women pointing at the sky, as if to indicate a bird, and the other one had pulled out a kleenex tissue and was approaching me, looking concerned and waving the tissue back and forth, as if she would wipe it off. Of course there was far more quasi \"pigeon poop\" than could be caused by one bird. And I had read about this pickpocket method, so I immediately moved away from both of them, didn't let them touch me or my bag, and waved my cane threateningly as if to strike them. My husband came toward us, and they ran away. So I didn't lose anything.The worst was that there was a policewoman right nearby who did nothing! When I returned to the hotel I was told my the staff that it likely was because the police see this all the time so they don't bother. The grey stinky stuff was so vile I had to go back to the hotel and take an entire shower, and start washing everything. This wasted an entire morning and was very unpleasant. The stains would not come out of my clothes when I tried to wash them. I had to throw that bag away. The stench still lingered in my bag contents for the entire rest of the trip, although I washed them and tried to get rid of it .  I posted about my experience on one of the Buenos Aires forums before, but think that I should mention this again here. Tourists, most of whom at some point visit the main Buenos Aries downtown Cathedral, should know what is going on in that area. If this happens to you, don't let them near you because in the process of \"cleaning you up\" they will steal your belongings. My husband now refers to these as Poop-edores, because they are worse than pushy obnoxious vendedores."

Here you will find the mausoleum of General Jose de San Martin. There is a memorial inside the church for Jewish victims of WWII behind the altar. Definitely recommended when in Buenos Aires."

A bonus is that it included an important gravesite as well as the country's tomb of the Unknown Soldier. I stumbled out of the hot Buenos Aires sun after visiting the Casa Rosado into the cool interior of this cathedral under the Classical portico.I felt as if I had been transported to Europe. I almost forgot I was in Argentina - and it is landmarks like this cathedral that have given BA the sobriquet of Paris of South America. The nave is pretty symmetrical with clean lines and rich moulding. Even though most of the architecture is from different periods - Rococo to Classical to Neoclassical - the image as a whole is unified and pleasant. I happened to visit in-between services; however I would take a guess that the acoustics would be excellent. The altar was impressive and massive. I especially liked the dome and the high windows - enough light made the interior feel heavenly. Of course, the tomb of General San Martin was breath-taking. A black marble sarcophagus, flanked by statues of Argentina, Peru, and Chile, guarded by the members of the Argentinian military is one I will not forget. Nearby are the remains of Generals Juan Gregorio de las Heras and Tomas Guido, as well as an unknown soldier of the Independence War.The cathedral is free to visit and photograph. I respectfully encourage a small donation for upkeep of the building, though. Touring this site is the perfect way to have a reprieve from the Argentinian sun and see a historical treasure."

            "review": "A Cathedral with two pluses!. The current cathedral was built on the place reserved for the major church of the town when Juan de Garay founded Buenos Aires in 1580 and on a series of previous churches that had occupied the site, something which is common in Latin America. Some think that the Cathedral\u2019s exterior appearance (of official looking) seems to be a bank, government offices or something of the sort at first sight. There are some \u201carchitectural\u201d reasons: its Neoclassical fa\u00e7ade, the tall portico, (inspired by Classical architecture) and its 12 columns make the church look more like an ancient temple. However, the decoration of the fa\u00e7ade representing Joseph\u2019s meeting with his brothers and father Jacob in Egypt, and intending to provide an allegory of the unity of the Argentine nation, clearly speaks of a religious place. On the other hand, the 12 Corinthian capitals of the columns of the portico symbolize the 12 apostles.  In the interior, you can feel a European flavour (as in many parts in Buenos Aires, indeed). Abundant Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque decoration; the floor is stunning. Pay attention to it. All the usual beautiful work you would expect in a cathedral. But there is a plus: San Martin, our national hero, the Father of the country, is buried here. Don\u2019t miss his resting place. This gorgeous mausoleum has Guard of Honour (worthwhile seeing it changing). These colonial era-dressed soldiers are always willing to have a photo taken and even posing with visitors. So, don\u2019t be shy and ask for a pic!A brief note: San Martin died in France, but in 1880 his remains were brought and placed in the black sarcophagus one can see nowadays. He is surrounded by 3 life-size female figures representing the 3 countries he freed: Argentina, Chile and Peru. Two other Great Men\u2019s remains are there as well: those of Generals Juan Gregorio de las Heras and Tom\u00e1s Guido. Finally, the Unknown Soldier of the Independence\u2019s tomb is there too.It is right that it has nothing out of the ordinary; that it only offers pretty much what one would expect from a cathedral. But a detail makes it different from others: Pope Francisco used to hold mass here!  Free entrance. Photos: allowed (both flash and non-flash). However, it is a good idea to be respectful of faith followers and to avoid being camera happy during the service."

Most capitol cities around the world invariably has a Cathedral belonging to one or more religious denominations - BA has the Metropolitan and it belongs to the Catholic Diocese.It has a striking exterior in a plain colour with a magnificent fa\u00e7ade - an intricate frieze of sculptures above twelve columns. It\u2019s interesting to note that it has been rebuilt without any towers and it reminds me of some ancient Mediterranean temple.Once inside we immediately noticed the soaring height of the roof and the intricate tile walkways and floors.It\u2019s not as ornate as some South American churches but still has a baroque style and a gorgeous rococo alter. Look for the unique statue of Christ carved from the wood of an algarrobo or carob tree.The layout is in the shape of a Latin cross with transept, three-aisles and side chapels connected by high arches.One of BA\u2019s earlier liberators is interred in a mausoleum here - General Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and an eternal flame burns for him outside the church. If you are here at the right time you may witness a guard ceremony however even without this showy spectacle the church is well worth a visit - not too much of the favoured gold leaf detail on every square inch! It\u2019s very close to Plaza de Mayo and within easy reach in the city centre.Enjoy your experience!"

It was built over and over before this final version persevered, so it's interesting from the standpoint of the Argentinian version of a national cathedral; 2. Pope Francis has a history here; 3. it is free and right there at the edge of Plaza de Mayo, which makes it easy to locate and visit. Again, while it has some nice features and art, the fact that it is not over-the-top in decoration and style is a comment on the country and its relationship to God.My favorite thing related to this cathedral was that we were walking to Plaza de Mayo one Sunday afternoon and came upon a mass of people outside who were listing to a sermon in the closed-off area in front of the cathedral. The passion of some of the crowd was amazing. There was a screened facade erected on the front to hide construction being done when we were there."

Another surprise is the live guards on hand to protect the St. Martins honored tomb inside the cathedral. Very worthwhile visit even though some of us may think of tall stretching gothic spyres, this is just as authentic, inside. I enjoyed the Sunday morning mass yesterday, very spiritually touched.

There appears to be masses held on a daily basis but you are freely allowed entrance into the building during these times. The crypt of San Martin (roughly the equivalent of George Washington for Argentines) is to the right of the entrance and the reason why most probably stop by. Suspiciously reminiscent of Napoleon's tomb in Paris, it is definitely worth a visit. To the left of the nave, there is a memorial to the Jewish community from the Catholic church containing sheets of prayers rescued from the ruins of Auschwitz and Treblinka.Initially the church was a bit of a challenge because I am not fluent in Spanish and there are no English subtitles on the placards, nor is a map of the facility or audio guide available. Traveling with a native guide made up for these issues immensely. Recommended."
