It is beautiful & authentic & we've been to many of the best layouts in the USA. Along the walls are Exceptionally Well Done educational posters describing & picturing the real places being modeled. We stayed only an hour but with just 2 days in Budapest, we gave the guide an ambitious list of things of must sees."

But there is a lot more than that.It is bigger than I thought it will be, and the details that went into building that is pretty amazing. You can find unexpected scenes everywhere too (dinosaurs, Star Wars references, UFO-s, and Back to the Future-car is hidden in there as well)Definitely check it out, even without kids, but they would probably like it even more."

It's the second time I've been there with my daughter and it's great. There are miniature landscapes with trains, cars, miniature people and a load more scenes to take in. There are buttons to press and get interactive with. Normally - as a dad- I'd give something like this a wide berth.. I mean I'm not into miniature people, trains or landscape miniature scenes but after 2 hours of being interactive I was quite proud of myself:-) It's a kids thing... and they just light up when they go in there. There is a small cafe, and also a play / drawing area for ages 4/5 to 11 /12 ish. I can't exactly remember the price for a child but it's around 1,350HUF and on a rainy day they'll be glad you took them. I'm attaching some pics... enjoy"

We were greeted by very friendly staff who explained the layout of the place before offering a cloakroom and locker for our valuables, we were then shown through to the start of the route, around what is basically a very very detailed and interactive model landscape of various cities and towns in Hungary, Austria and Germany.At points around the model there are buttons you can press that bring the model to life by either moving vehicles or other parts of the landscape, lighting up areas, or making sound effects, we had a great time trying to spot them all as some are really small details and harder to find. There are also many many trains running as part of a continuous loop of animation which really brings the whole thing to life.As you travel round there are also information panels with separate miniature dioramas detailing the communist period in Hungarys history, which I personally found really interesting to read. Also there is a nice little refreshment area at the end.This place definitely ticked all the boxes for me and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit."

The models are extensive and offer many interaction if you like that kind of thing. The models covered many of the sights in Budapest and the surrounding areas. This was a really good exhibition the only down side was the actual construction of the models. I always prefer hand crafted, intricate buildings that are pain staking replicated. These were a little more flat pack."

There is an interactive part were you can press buttons to make cars, vans and trains go round, turn lights/sirens on etc. There is also information on the buildings all in different languages. Keep an eye out for the little items that are unrelated to Budapest and the surrounding areas! We had fun spotting them. The display is bigger than I thought.

Our apartment was in the street behind Miniversum so my children could see the children's play area every time we walked into town. One afternoon we decided to visit and they were desperate to play with the trains and we had a fabulous time! Its a model version of Hungary (with bits of Austria and Germany as well), but there are lots of interactive buttons to press to make things work as you go around. My kids loved making the buses and trains move! Once you've been round the main display there is a children's play area with lots of Brio wooden trains and track, plus a remote control train track (not sure on the brand) and that kept our kids amused for a long time. At the end there is a shop you can buy trains and track to take home with you. There is also the option as you leave to register for discounted return tickets.This is a definite must do for visitors with train-loving young children!"

It offers some nice cuts from budapest and the hungarian landscapes. When I visited the museum it was almost empty which was nice. The entrance fee isn't very low compared to other attractions in Budapest. The museum\u00a0 isn't very big either. Took me about 1 hour to see evrything.The museum does offer alot of information about the stuff you see in hungarian, english and german. The museum is mainly focussed on hungary but also shows a bit of austria and germany. To conclude, the museum is a nice short stop. I would defo recommend it to the enthusiastic modeltrain fans.

I initially thought it was a little small, before turning a corner and realising that I hadn't even seen half of it! You can spend hours here!Staff are very friendly too. The only problem was that some of the buttons either didn't work or it was difficult to see what they did."

However, my husband and I wandered past on our way from the opera house and he was keen, so in we went. Well, I'm glad we did as this was a great, unique and very fun attraction. The staff involved in creating the exhibits clearly work very hard and do a great job maintaining it! Lots to it, and the interactivity is good too. Kids would love this attraction! If you have time, it's definitely something different and fun to do in Budapest."

Someone in front of us stopped to take a photo of a display outside the premises and that caused us to pause and pick up a leaflet.Our first impression, on going indoors, was that it seemed quite a small (excuse the pun) area that the exhibition occupied. However there was much more than we could initially see. Having just walked from Heroes Square we found the first exhibit (which depicting that site) to be astonishing in its detail. We loved the interactive facility - allowing you to move vehicles, listen to sounds, activate lights etc.There was just so much going on at each exhibit, it was a real feast to the eyes. The number of trains and vehicles on the move at any one time added astonishing realism to the already realistic static models.I couldn't help but compare it with Madurodam in the Netherlands that I visited a number of years ago. Madurodam is, however, much larger, being on a scale of 1:25 as opossed to the scale of 1:100 used at Miniversum. The much smaller scale makes Miniversum all the more fascinating, not only the detail in the models, but the attention to detail in the many figures. I particularly liked the group of divers and the accident victim receiving CPR!Some reviewers have remarked that this is great for children. I'd say it is suitable for all ages. It was an unexpected highlight to our visit to Budapest. We spent around two hours taking in all the sights and could have stayed longer had our feet not been a bit sore. My only question is: Why is this not advertised at Tourist Information or in Travel books about Budapest?"

There were not many people inside.The exhibition takes 3 rooms and lights places in Budapest, Hungary, Germany and Austria. Tiny models of people, small cars, buses, running trains\u2026 The exhibition is interactive and by pushing buttons you may turn on street lights, transport or just hear sounds of nature.

It is an opportunity for kids to learn about \"Life Under Communism\" with very cool towns and villages laid out in front of them with trains and other vehicles running through the detailed scenes. The best part was manipulating the buttons to make certain vehicles move, make farm animals move (or sound off) or windmills turn. We all really enjoyed it."

Partly because it was not overly busy at the time I visited, allowing me to explore at my own pace. But also because it was such a different place from most I visited plus it wraps what you learn in fun.And you can learn stuff. With display monitors offering you insight of different areas (in multiple languages) across Hungary, Germany and Austria, I probably learned more about Hungarian life under communism here than in any other place.As for the fun, well it is easy to have a fascination with miniature trains. I think all of us who has ever owned a set imagined creating something similar to the Miniversum. And as much beyond a play set as it is, it still offers buttons to push, trains to move, lights to flicker and sounds to make. A smile inducing hour and twenty minutes."

I really enjoyed it here they have set up as a working Mini City with accurate building and working trains. There were toilets and lockers provided for free. It was worth coming here but be aware there is a second section as we spent a lot of time on the first area and then needed to rush the second part as we have not given ourselves enough time. I would recommend coming here with children, just as a couple or as group of adults. I think small children would not appreciate it and although it does have interactive buttons, there only make small changes and you really need to look out for them.

Inside is a massive network of model railways complete with people, animals, famous buildings and landmarks with a whole host of interactive buttons to push to bring the model world alive, including movement, sound and vehicular movement, some of which is so slight it takes a while to work out what's moving.

Miniversum is not as large as the model railway display in Prague, and certainly not as large as the biggest in Europe (in Hamburg Germany), but what this display lacks in size (it is not small, being the 3rd largest after the above two), it makes up for in detail. We haven't seen the Hamburg layout yet but certainly in Prague, detail was sacrificed in favour of size. Miniversum made no such sacrifice and as a railway modeller myself, i can say that the detail here is superb. Everything is very well done, from greenery through to little street scenes. What it doesn't do which Prague does is cycle through night & day, but the layout has lights nevertheless.There are also many self-actuated aspects via push-buttons around the layouts. They are not labelled and you have to work out by observation what they do. Sadly though, many seemed not to work.There were many trains running, more than in Prague, and like Prague, there were scenes of the local city which can be recognised by tourist & local alike.IN SUMMARY, an excellent attraction if you are a railway modeller, or have young kids in tow, or are just interested in the hobby."

The detail in some parts is very good and the trains add a bit of life to the static. There are bits that move when you press certain buttons but we couldn't always figure out what bits.Some of the detail is very charming, I really liked a farm scene with tiny chickens that dance when a button is pushed.If you look closely there's a lot of humour in the everyday scenes, such as people falling over fruit, alien ,landings and general lots of little stories you can see being played out. I think it'd be better if there was more diversity in the displays, but it all put a smile on my face anyway. "

The scenes are filled with funny details and interactive visitor-controlled gadgets like flashing lights etc.Ticket price was only a few euros, so it is highly recommended.

The attention to detail was amazing and we loved pressing the different buttons to activate sound, light or motion. (Our 6 year old grandson would have loved it too!!). An added bonus was the detailed information and photos on the walls about Hungary in the Communist era which was fascinating. I would recommend Miniversum to anyone visiting Budapest. We spent 2 hours there and loved it. Apparently Miniversum has only been open a year which explains why it didn't feature in our guide books. Our hotel (only 5 minutes away) had many interesting brochures on display - but not Miniversum. A pity, as Miniversum was one of the highlights of our trip and I'm sure would benefit from extra publicity."

Buildings from Budapest and beyond are accurately represented but what makes this exhibit really special is the attention to detail and in the interactive features. Every scene features either moving parts, lights or sound or all 3. A combination of buttons allow you to make vehicles, animals, people or other features move, light up or make sound. The movements can be very subtle so it is very effective in getting you to look closely at the details. In addition to this, the characters in each come to life in the way they have been thoughtfully arranged and fit together so that each scene tells a story. Careful observation will show you hens pecking in the farmyard, a fire engine at the scene with moving 'water', flashing lights and sirens, paramedics giving CPR at the scene of an accident to name just a few. A miniature masterpiece that needs a lot more advertising to give it the attention it deserves."

Many are interactive too, although not always easy to spot what the buttons actually do. We had a great time looking for the 'romantic couple' who always had a red love heart balloon. My favourite ones were spotting Tarzan and Jane ones and also a couple doing the final scene from Dirty Dancing in a lake. There were also some rather odd little details if you look carefully. We did enjoy giving stories to some of the scenes. I wish the communist scenes were a bit more authentic, with relevant minitures. Sometimes new Mercs, Mini's etc would pop into them! But that's me being pedantic. We spent about 1.5 hours there and were glad we went."

I absolutely loved it, played with all the interactive buttons trying to figure out what they start or what actions they are linked to. Some buttons need to be fixed, as they haven't worked properly, but they got the action started in the end. If you are not into doing childish things, just have a look at the trains and engines which work and travel on the boards. The price is good (around 6 EUR/adult) for the time spent. If you are obsessed with details, you probably need to book some more hours in there.There is a nice cafeteria inside, where we got a free drink with the mini-cards we got from the hotel."

Hidden from view was a vast wonderland of scenery representing Germany and Austria. It included country villages,castles,churches and mountains.I was most impressed with an incredible scale model of the train station I had just arrived at; Keletti in Budpest.It was unbelievably real.Hero's square is also represented.This is a train buff's delight. I was pleased to see that they are considerate of their customers furnishing a clean available restroom. There is a small snack bar where parents can relax while the kids explore the whole layout. They don't take advantage of you either charging reasonable prices. Model train buffs have a lot to see: 600 villages, 5000 little people,1000 autos, and 100 trains. I like the fact that they accommodate tourists with a 19:00 closing on weekdays and 2100 on weekends- no locking up at 5 here.I thought 1900 HUF adult fare a little pricey but there is a family ticket that covers 2 adults and 3 children for under $20 US dollars and the rent on Andrassy ut is not cheap.

Although recommended by the vendor to book advance (maybe just a good marketing tool), we were there Sunday noon, no crowd.Disappointed to my son (4ys old) and to me since the model layout is narrow due to the room provided limits and the exhibition lacks any logic how its sections continue from one room to the next one. No interactivity although kids can push some bottoms to switch on and off some lamps. More than half did not work by the way.As shown on the photos, many elements were a bit weird such as shape of the football stadium is trapeze due to the room shape where the model was laid down, a highway is cut off. There is a lake which is plastic painted into green. I have seen so many models where water was used for various purposes (lakes, waterfalls, fountains, etc).The price was 15 EUR for 2I will not return"

As a young boy, I wanted to be a train driver, back in the days of steam ;-) I recently saw this attraction on a well known video sharing website and was inspired to visit.Miniversum is located on Andrassy Street, not far from the centre of town and easy to get to by walking or by Metro Line 1. I think the cost of entry (HUF1900 for adults, HUF1300 under14's and family tickets available) was very reasonable. It is possible to book tickets through their website, and this seems to be aimed at making sure that there are not to many people there during peak times, which would reduce the experience. The three main layouts take you on a journey through parts of Hungary,Austria and Germany, and show many well known landmarks in each of these areas. The buildings are, as far as I am aware, all hand built, and clearly to a very high and detailed standard.There is an interactive element to the layouts where visitors can press colour coded buttons to activate motions, light or sound on the layout. Some did not appear to be working, but that really didn't take much away from the experience. There is a lot of small detail and humour built into the layout. Figures are seen sun bathing on a roof terrace, police attending an accident, tramps sleeping by the side of the street, and much more. The layouts are computer controlled and you can see the monitors and handling software in operation at the end of the layouts.A small cafe operates in the building, which is very reasonably priced, a good point considering that the attraction is in a very touristy area of the city.All in all, it was a good experience, and one that I would be happy to recommend to anyone who has an interest in trains or modelling."

But ...1,900 HUF for the entrance fee is rather expensive when you spend much less than an hour here (no senior discount but discounts for the 2nd or 3rd visits). I extended as much as possible my visit by clicking on every interactive button (some of them not working) but I managed barely 40mn, my friend zapped in 10mn!It is cute and well done but really tiny (the scale), I thought the scale would be much larger but it is the smallest possible to have running trains. What I really regretted because I was going there for the cultural aspect of what to visit in Hungary is that they only featured north western Hungary: Pannonhalma, Sopron, etc. and then some Austria & Germany but I would have like to see more of Hungary."

The one, which is located right on Andrassy, combines Hungarian, Austrian and German cities on the territory of 300 square meters. It is not comparable to Hamburg's \"Miniature Wunderland\" (1,150 square meters) because of Miniversum's simplicity. Nevertheless, we still got a lot of excitement while visiting it.This place didn't look busy at the time of our arrival around 6pm, so we were able to watch miniatures in peace. All cities were connected with a complex system of railroads (even above your head) that made this place quite dynamic. Some of the trains was possible to control yourself with a use of provided spinning wheels. There were also buttons, which activated movements of some objects in the little world. However, it was challenging to find them because of so small and unrecognizable movements of the objects itself.What disappointed us is that this exibition supposed to have Budapest and Vienna. However, there were literarly 3-5 familiar buildings in these cities. The miniature, which is located outside of Miniversum to advertize it, was much more Budapest-like than miniatures displayed inside.Another disappointment was that besides trains, there were no other transport in motion. It looked quite simple in contrast to Hamburg's one, where cars, busses, ships and airplanes move.Anyway, it is great to have such a unique opportunity in Budapest to stare at everyday's objects shink in 100 times!"

Miniversum is a a brilliant family attraction; rooms and a large enclosed courtyard full of miniture models, railways and buildings. The attraction is well designed, has an incredible level of detail, and variety of models and locations to keep the kids excited and entertained throughout. Everything from Heros Square, villages, circus, lakes, historical castles, mountains, ski slopes, military and so much more. I didnt count, but there are miles of train tracks and trains constantlz moving around the scenes. There's a cafe with good snack food, and a play area where children can build their own railways.Recommendations:Adults, when looking at the minature scenes sit down on the wooden ledge so that you're at eye level with the layout. It's singificantly better than always viewing from above. Look out for the dinosaur!Improvement:every few feet they provide buttons which can be pressed by visitors. Some flash lights, some turn wind turbines, or switch on little fountains. There's no guidance as to what button does what. I'm assuming Miniversum thinks its a fun challenge trying to spot what button does what action. It's not. It gets really frustrating for kids and adults pressing a button and having no idea what it does. Either I'm bad at this game, or by estimates 30-40% of the buttons don't work. I wish they could be labelled."

I had not been a fan of such models before but we went because the children wanted to see it. I must admit I did not regret that I came along. It is great how accurate the copy of the real sights was: you see it in Budapest in real size then you come in and it's just awesome to see the same in miniature size. They opened a few months ago so everything is brand new and at the same time still a secret tip, I am sure it will be a much bigger crowd in a year or two. It is packed with interactive action and therefore everyone can learn interesting fun facts about Hungary. To summarise: it is a lot of entertainment and very well worth its price, you can easily spend 2-3 hours with the family for a family ticket at a price of less than 20 \u20ac."

Very amazing miniature city models. It's hard to believe that anyone could make such exquisite things! It's eye opening for both adults and kids!"

We recently visisted Miniversum in Budapest.The whole atosmphere is amazing, family freindly, the exhibition itself is in a beautiful, top detailed old, but very nice building in the heart of Budapest. It is a real good deal for a model train fun, I would say must see thing, everything is brand new, heavy railway tarffic on the layouts, very nice details and proffesional work can be identified there everywehre. The layouts are worked out perfectly, very unique deatils, nicea and perfect details as you just can see the in the real world in Budapest. Further to that certain locations from Germany and Austria also can be found on the layouts Hope these guys will keep up this quality work and they will extend their exhibitions with new themes. Also worth mentioning that entrance fee is very reasonable \u20ac6,5 for an adult."

We enjoyed it immensely, there was information about each city depicted and we enjoyed the interactive buttons. There were numerous trains going in all directions, lots of tunnels and towns. There was much more there than we originally thought. It took us about one hour to go from start to finish. Highly recommended."

Pay attention to all small details, kids will love the \"treasure hunt game\" when you push the buttons and explore the what will happen. Please do not spoil it for them, let them discover! You can do the tour in one hour but if your kids are train enthusiastics you may spend here easily 2-3 hours - especially if you try the pencakes in the caf\u00e9 too! :-)"

This is a truly magical experience for anyone interested in trains, travel or central Europe. The layout is such that it depicts different towns and cities from around Hungary, Austria and Germany with trains running around the display which are small-scale versions of real-life trains from each country. Lots of well-designed model buildings and streets in each town (I particularly liked the townscape of Eisenach) and you can actually feel the different atmospheres of each country as you move between each display (I have been on trains in each of these countries and the atmosphere created here is what is felt on each country's real rail network)! I was particularly impressed by the very accurate train station announcements at Wien Hauptbahnhof, having been at the actual station only a few days before. Very friendly and helpful staff. There is even a play area for kids where they can create their own model train consists and then run them on small electrically-controlled tracks. A must for all visitors to Budapest who are interested in this sort of thing! And very easy to get to too by Metro line 1 to Opera station."

            "review": "Excellent and unique experience for adults and kids. We have visited Miniversum with our 6-year-old son today. We have arrived around 11am on Saturday and found only a few people (as time passed more and more people showed up). If we had known in advance that we are going we would have the opportunity to book time online - great service (!). The location of the place is excellent even for local people. It is downtown Budapest in a very nice surrounding, however parking can be challenging and expensive - yet you can get 25% discount if you visit Miniversum - make sure to check online before.The place is exciting. It worth every penny on have to pay. They have good package for families with one or more kids. The exhibition takes you from Budapest all the way to Germany through Austria with model trains. Several famous buildings, typical landscapes are built up. The builders made efforts to make it interactive as much as possible and according to discussion with the employees even more developments are planned. Not only the landscape and buildings are amazing but you find lots of joke and \"easter eggs\" on the board watching the people on the streets, the cars and the landscape. It is fun just to visit, but if you can afford and you have the time participate in the tour behind the scenes!!! It is around 40 minutes and even my young son enjoyed it!I am convinced we will visit the place again!!AND if you are visiting with young kids make sure to go back to the \"playground\". There are tracks to build with, there are trains the control and even houses you can build!Plan at least 2 hrs to visit but you can easily spend there more!!!!"

My friends and I had a blast! I definitely recommend it!"

The first impression when I entered the Miniversum was \"overpriced\", but when I noticed that it is not just one hall but several halls full of exciting miniature worlds, we all fell in love with the place. It was interesting to press the buttons and see what will change. There were also nice funny extra things hidden in the miniature worlds, which rewarded a visitor who looks the details carefully. Miniversum's clean toilets are a good bonus during a city trip with family."

Miniversum is a superb idea: a realistic model railway museum with fantastically thought out scenes that captivate and enchant. A delight for children and adults alike, the smooth motion of the trains really brings the detail in the scenes to life, and the child-like wonder on visitors' faces shows the value of the experience. There's also a convenient caf\u00e9 making it ideal as a lunchtime stop on a stroll down into town from Heroes Square. Highly recommended!"

It seem interested, so we decided to go there. It was really nice. Many cool stuff there. We both enjoyed it. I also had been to the one in Hamburg before. Both of them are same the theme, but i found each of them have their own unique thing in it. It was really fun to visit. I do hope the gifts shop can be more bigger and more choices from the souvernir. I do know that it just opened about a week ago when we were there. So that is fine. We would like to visit again next time when we are in Budapest."

My 4 year old son and I both had an equally fun time enjoying this train utopia for over 2.5 hours. Although you can walk through the exhibit in 15 minutes, you are not doing it justice. You should stop and marvel at the amazingly intricate details and hidden secrets in this incredibly realistic recreations of various real places (at least one hour). Take a break in the caf\u00e9 and then spend the real time allowing your child or you (I admit I participated), in building your own tracks and playing with real models.I am not a train aficionado, however my son and I spent over 1.5 hours playing with trains. One tip: read the brochure and learn the code for pressing buttons throughout the exhibit so that you can make things light up, move or make sound. Enjoy!"
