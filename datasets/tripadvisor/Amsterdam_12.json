We spent a sunny Sunday morning walking around visiting shops, having brunch on a canal boat, and generally taking it all in. Only watchout is the hordes of bikers who can make things a bit hairy while strolling about."

It oozes creativity.The Jordaan is Amsterdam at its quirky best.Will definitely come back sometime soon."

This coveted neighborhood was originally a left-wing working class & immigrant getto that was part of the unique urban development project that created the canal ring from 1612-52.In fact, Rembrandt (1606-69) spent the latter part of his lesser life in a rental house on the Rozengracht and was buried in a poor man's grave at the nearby Westerkerk (1631).It has become an expensive upscale area in the center of Amsterdam and home to many (modern) art galleries, boutiques, specialty shops, restaurants & bars. The three popular outdoor markets are the Lindengrachtmarket on Sat. w/ stalls featuring handcrafted items, cheeses, fish & flowers, the Westerstraat on Mon. from 9am-1pm w/ 200 stands of textiles & food carts and the Noordermarkt, the oldest one since 1616, on Sat. organic food and on Mon. textiles.The main church is the Protestant Noorderkerk that was built between 1620-23 and opened in 1636.Finally, do check out the monumental buildings w/ old stone tablets on the facades indicating the profession or family sign as well as the many inner courtyards w/ small restored houses & little gardens."

The are still has the canals and bridges that make Amsterdam unique, but it has some more modern houses and smaller businesses. There are many houseboats in the area that provide a view of the unique and diverse living spaces in Amsterdam. The are is rather quiet and there are few food and shops but there are great restaurants and shops that border here (9 streets and westerpark)"

The area is very clean and is full of hidden gems. We started or exploring near Elandsgracht and headed towards Westerstraat. The narrow meandering street are full of cafes, art galleries, and court yards. Many phot opportunities as you wind your way towards Noordermarket. Fortunately, it was Monday the Center of Westerstraat was where the market was happening. The street was lined with kiosks filled with clothing items: shoes, dresses, and purses. As well, there was a area selling 'antiques'. There were also a lot of material stalls too. There was also a fresh produce section closer to Noordermarket. A highly entertaining experience walking through Jordaan, well worth the time."

No, not every road goes across the canals so be aware of your location. Use church steeple at Westerkerk at visual landmark. It's at the middle line. Love to sit at a bench, canalside, and people watch. Yes, shops etc but walking around was what we did. Saw galleries, heard children at school. Saw some fine dinner cafes (inside) on Anjeliersstraat (northern part) and on Elandsgracht (southern part). "

I was aware of the 'gentrification ' of the Jordaan,, and the relaying of the cobbles is a benefit... but the renovations seem to be sympathetic and nothing can take away the feeling of following the curve of a boat beaded canal ,and looking across at a front window crammed with curios and decorated with all manner of hanging baskets and drift wood. Amsterdam, where a man's home is truly his castle. The Russian Orthodox church was an unexpected discovery, and testament to the all embracing flavour of the City."

These days it is way more polished but still remains my favourite part of this great city: There are loads of great shops for those you want to buy something not available on the high street, beautiful little cafes and pubs. My favourite bit about the Jordaan is to stroll through the little streets which are residential behind the Westerkerk and get a feel for how the Dutch live. You will find lots of plants and flowers outside lining the narrow streets with benches in front of most houses. The thing I love about the Dutch is that they do not cover their windows with curtains and blinds, for me a sign of being open and approachable."

So, apparently, the Jordaan area was created at the large expansion of Amsterdam in early XVII century as the district for the working class and immigrants. The population increase during the next centuries was enormous, caused by the stream of refugees, mainly English protestants like Fleming, Spanish and Portuguese Jews and French Huguenots. It was a poor district with small houses and slums, every little room stuffed with families and lots of children. Interesting!"

There are so many pretty little streets with the occasional cafe or restaurant. Perhaps, you could also take in the Pianola Museum which is very quirky and the curator is somewhat eccentric!

The Jordaan is a wonderful neighbourhood, originally an area for workers and artisanal workplaces, the poor of Amsterdsm crowded it's small homes and narrow streets. After the war, its inhabitants moved (mostly willingly) from the overcrowded dilapidated and dirty area to new flats at the expanding edges of the city, and it's end seemed assured. But as the families moved out, the hippies and the counter culture moved in, by the 1970s they had won the war agsinst the 'demolish & rebuild' brigade, and since then steady refurbishment and conservation have made the area a vibrant sought after neighbourhood for residents and visitors alike. For some such 'gentrification' teeters on the brink of eclipsing the character of the area, but change is the nature of cities and for mr the balance between preserving architectural integrity and enabling modern life is working, there remain many artisanal and independent businesses, restaurants and cafes, and even s few good watering holes. Given the tawdry tacky nature of some of the city's neighbourhoods and nightlife, it's not unreasonable to be happy that at least one area remains somewhere to enjoy a little romance of the soul, absorb the history of the canals, browse small shops, or even study in an independent canal house hotel. It has interest for all generations all year round, and for me it is still the Amsterdam that the world wishes for. Enjoy."

Life in this part of the city is very lively, with many restaurants, cafes and bars. Eventually, we chose to go to a restaurant. Attention! In Amsterdam, the restaurants serve food until 22.00 in the evening. Thus, although there may be some guests, they can only drink. Fortunately we found an open restaurant. After we finished eating, we continued our evening walk, among the streets and canals of Jordaan that continued to be full of people, having fun, drinking beer and talking, in and out of various places. We really wanted to stay there until dawn, but fatigue led our steps to our hotel which fortunately was in the area."

Oh and have a piece of appeltaart at de Winkel, right on the Noordermarkt. If you're in to vintage clothing, on monday morning, also at the Noordermarkt, there is a big second hand clothing market."

The view from our apartment was beautiful and it was super convenient to get around. The only miner drawback, being on the canal, it was a little noisy a couple of the nights, but we came in late and it didn't really bother us. It may be something that others would want to consider?

Red Light District? Half hour walk, Centraal Station is 15 minutes walk, Dam Square is half hour walk, and when I tried to walk to Nine Street; I got so lucky to get my self trapped in Leidsestraat and Kalverstraat - so there you go!

Amsterdam is one of the best cities in the world and the Jordan is definitely one of the best areas of the city. It is a world apart from the regular tourist areas and will not disappoint. The area has a great vibe with many off beat shops and little cafes to pass the time with the locals over a cold beer and bitterballen.. The canal area and all of the tourist attractions are within walking distance which makes the peace and quiet of this area that much more enjoyable after a long day enjoying the tourist sights.. We are already looking forward to our next visit to the area."

All kinds of good italian foods can be found there. Most of them are good quality. I recommend to walk around Jordaan at night when it's dark. Very safe and romantic. You can jump into one of the boughts if you want to have a break, but I dont recommend that if you are afraid of falling into the canals and looking like an idiot :p"

Its about a 30-40 min walk fae station but you just stick to walking along beautiful canals you should be ok getting there & its doesn't hurt to print a map from google maps for central station to your destination it makes life a lot easier but its a really nice walk up & down to Jordan esp at night when its all light up can be quite romantic if that's the plan. But you will get a decent taxi driver show him your address or phone your host first let them know your gona get a taxi & they will probably give you a taxi nu.So happy holidays"

I used a 1990 (!) pamphlet from one of many previous visits, describing the area's narrow streets and intimate canals. In the last 50 years the area has become popular with students, artists and musicians, and one can still find good cafes and restaurants which are predominantly not dominated by tourists. I am sure the VVV offices might still provide some sort of brochure. If not, just find the area from any map of the city and amble round enjoying the gables, architecture and refreshment opportunities."

Walk back into the 18th century in architecture, shop the shops (including bakeries), and return rejuvenated to the bustle of the central part of the city and Dam Square."

So much to taste you can forget about needing lunch or dinner. The boat was 107 years old and held about 12. This was a 3.5 hour eating and history walk and ride. It started at 11am at a tavern Bill Clinton still goes to once a year for Dutch apple pie. Forget politics he knows good food."

To get a place to live where ther's serenity as well as blooming life, it's tough. But that's what Jordaan is all about. Amazing homes dating to 16th century can be seen in the narrow streets. U can see imitations of cats, puppies, boy ,girl , kind of climbing on the balconies. I still don't understand the exact meaning of this, but I have seen different homes having different things decorated in balconies.The best restaurants can be found at walkable distances in Jordaan.The best thing is the quiet n beauty of the place.

I'd been following the suggested route from a guidebook; having to figure out where I was and where I was headed led me down all sorts of interesting streets and canals.

Lovely area to wander around taking in the beautiful homes plus other quaint buildings and canalsWear very comfortable shoes as the beautiful cobble footpaths are uneven. It's great to just walk with no actual destination as you will see such wonderful sights. Stop all the time and look up down and around but WATCH OUT for cyclists and motor scooters they drive very fast on the footpath and don't seem to give way to anyone. Be careful on crossings too even with the crossing telling you to cross, double check as its not always safe."

DE JORDAAN The name De Jordaan is probably derived from the French \"Le Jardin\" corrupted in the Dutch to \u201cDE JORDAAN.\" What we know is that De Jordaan was intended as a vegetable garden for the wealthy inhabitants of Amsterdam. Especially for the new rich residents of the canals: the Koningsgracht (now The Singel) the Herengracht, Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht which 400 years ago are dug and then constructed and inhabited. However, due to the large influx of emigrants lead to the great explanation of the city and in 1612 De Jordaan whas constructed with homes for workers and emigrants. The oldest residents of this district, De Jordanezen, are a nation apart. They speak their own language, carry the heart on the tongue, are fond of wisecracks, fooling around in Dutch \u201cDollen\u201d love a drink, fond of opera, accordion music, singing and have a heart of gold. The Jordaan is in many songs sung about, songs that are also popular by not Jordaan Amsterdammers. The most famous singers of the Jordanian songs are: Johny Jordaan, Willy Alberti, Tante Leen and Manke Nelis. Their statues stand on the \u201cJohny Jordaan Plein\u201d at \u201cDe Elandsgracht\u201d, corner Prinsengracht. Besides that you should not argue with a Jordanees in his neighbourhood, because then you get direct the whole Jordaan at you. One for all, all for oneFunny is that everyone calls each other uncle and aunt. So basically it seems like that all people are related to each other. A pity is that the popularity of De Jordaan and the enormously high prices of the houses there is almost no real Jordanees people more in De Jordaan. Their place is taken by new, wealthier residents.The Jordaan is great for walking, to get to a brown caf\u00e9, to dine, to shop and to go to the market. On the lindengracht is every Saturday from 09:00 to 16:00 hrs market, on the noordermarkt (North market) market, there is the farmers market from 9:00 to 16:00 hrs and the Flea Market from 09:00 to 13:00 hrs also on the noordermarkt. On Monday there is a patches and vegetable market on De Westerstraat from 09:00 until 13:00 hrs.And if you look closely you can still find a few gems. That, as we call them, the courtyards in Dutch: \u201cHofjes\u201d. I will mention three. The oldest surviving hofje (1614) is the Sint Andries hofje, 105 at the egelantiersgracht. The second is the Huiszittenweduwhof (1650) Karthuizersstraat 21 and hofje \u201cDe Zeven Keurvorsten\u201d (1645) Tuinstraat 197. Oh well, just look around and amaze yourself!Tip! visit a real Jordanees Brown Amsterdam Caf\u00e9, Caf\u00e9 Chris. It's located on the corner of the 1e Bloemdwarsstraat en de Bloemstraat.

The nine street is in the centre of Jordaan, and offers plenty of new boutiques that will keep even the critic busy.My suggestion is to start at the nine streets beginning of lunch, it still quiet and gives you the space to enjoy it... start at the beginning which is closest to Leidseplein, then work your way towards Central Station. The farther you get the quieter it gets and has more cafes this area offers. Check out Frozen Fountain for great Dutch DesignsTenue Denime for your latest fashion apparels"

I knew two things, I wanted to stay in a boutique hotel and it had to have a view of the canal. Trip Advisor rarely leads me wrong, so I went with the number one hotel, The Toren. I simply can not say enough about the hotel or the neighborhood. I'll write about the details of The Toren under hotels, but after having walked many of the touristic neighborhoods in the city, I can say the Jordaan is the most beautiful. It almost feels like it's own village within a city... I would walk a few steps then stop to snap a foto-it's that picturesque! It's charm is that the area is quiet and quaint, and near the Anne Frank House. You can find wonderful treasures tucked away along tiny streets. A must if you're looking for local food is De Reiger, a rustic, lovely restaurant where the food is hearty, savory and served beautifully. If you're in the mood to relax, Koan Float Spa has a personalized Epsom salt bath where you can meditate and relax, an experience unlike no other! There are many local stores for souvenirs and shopping. If you come to Amsterdam, you will not regret staying in the Jordaan area, and especially at The Toren hotel."

If you pass thru the south east side of the city on the bus you will see a much more realistic picture of the ethnic community.

The Jordaan is a certrally located area in Amsterdam that was once working class and poor but was rejuvenated in the '70s and is now a rather chic area and a real tourist attraction.It's very pretty - and very Amsterdam; narrow streets, canals and bridges everywhere. There are a lot of small artisanne shops there now and it really is worth your while to visit. I have a nice personal memory in that I was walking there and seen a small record shop (you don't see so many of them anymore), so I went in and they had some really nice music playing. I asked the guy behind the counter who it was and he said Lizz Wright. I bought the CD there and then and every time I play it I'm reminded of my trip.The Jordaan was also famous for its style of music - old traditional Dutch music; accordions and singing. Some rather famous (national) artists came from there. You can still get a taste of that sound and lifestyle in some of the pubs there. It might be a bit kitchy and perhaps it's put on a little for the tourists but it's still a fun way to spend an evening. All in all, worth including in your visit to Amsterdam."

There is only one gondola operator in all of Amsterdam. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a quiet and romantic tour through the canals of Amsterdam. This was probably one of the best things my husband and I have ever done. It is so peaceful without a motor running. We took our ride at night and could see all of the canal ways lit up. After our boat ride we walked around Jordaan. It has the beauty of the rest of the city and the iconic architecture without the tourist feel. It was so quiet it was hard to imagine the Red Light district only a mile away. Jordaan seems like an area you could actually live in Amsterdam. Do your self a favor if you want to see a part of Amsterdam that is not all coffee and sex shops go to Jordaan!"

Any map will explain you the location, and is very close to the Central Station and the Dam Square.Many small little streets and canals with many little stores, galleries, typical brown pubs and small restaurants. This is my Amsterdam. An afternoon stroll always brings me something new, although I have been there many times. There is always a witty Jordanees available for a chat and a laughter. Fall in a pub and have a beer with the locals. Pay attention to the many hidden \"hofjes\", kinda inner courtyards, with small living spaces, built by the rich people in the golden ages for elderly widows. A charity thing. Always remember to look up at the facades of the buildings, as they often are beautifully decorated. But above all, loose yourself in this fantastic and typical neighborhood."

Therefore, we decided to spend our spare time exploring the area nearby. It just so happened that the Jordaan was located across the canal from Anne Frank's house, so we spent the time wandering around this area and then sitting by the canal, relaxing and soaking up the atmosphere.There was a splendid array of trendy restaurants, cafes and boutiques within the area. We also saw a number of quirky gift, collectors and art shops. However, at this hour on a Sunday evening, most of the shops were closed.After our stroll around the area, we found a nice bench by the canal and spent some time watching the boats go by with groups of people enjoying the warmth and light of the summer evening.We were pleasantly surprised by the elegance and style of this lovely part of Amsterdam and would recommend a visit to the area, for any tourists who happen to be visiting Amsterdam."

From the end of the street is the largest indoor antique mall. The endless cafes infuse your nose with a plethora of smells to invite you in. There's authentic Italian, Thai, Dutch,Coffee shops and Cafes that keep you coming back for more. It's a family friendly area that give a real sense of Dutch culture. The side streets are also not to be missed with also a wide variety of shops. This area is a must see , eat and experience it ,as you too will put this as a favorite!!!!"

Started out a a neighborhood for services outside the canals, where the lesser well-to-do lived in small houses, that followed the original \"sloten\" small water channels between patches of land to keep it dry). The canals were dug to supply extra and cheap transport means to the warehouses of the wealthy traders. The houses were small and had wooden stairs instead of the more costly stone stairs. The (smaller) canals running through the neighborhood were also seen as less attractive then the more \"main\" channels: Singel,Heren- ,Keizers- en Prinsengracht. It grew into a neighborhood for the lowest classes, in the 20/30's of the last century. Riots like Palingoproer (Ealriot) demanded 26 dead. Then Potatoe-riot en Jordaarriot also caused casualties in the dirt poor neighborhood. In the seventies lots of the original inhabitants moved to suburbs like Almere. Their houses were renovated and their place taken by Young Urban Professionals. Now the prices of real estate are sky high and housing is difficult to come by in this part of town, right in the centre."

Don't miss the market on Saturday, plenty of dutch delicacies and cheeses, perfect to pick up items for a picnic. Set up your picnic on the edge of one of the canals and enjoy people and boat watching. Ann Frank House is located here which is a popular tourist destination, unless you already have tickets, it is booked months in advance and by 9.30 am there is a line wrapping around the street with a 3 hour wait time. Definitely a must see and do neighborhood!"

The area is beautiful, with many cafes and places of interest, in a lovely residential area. Close to everything either by walking or taking the convenient tram. From our apartment, we walked to the Nine Streets shopping area, the Anne Frank House, the Bejginhof, the Dam, the North Market. We took the tram to the Museum District, Rembrandt Square, Central Station, all over. Felt like a local and loved our time in the Jordaan."

We've been to Amsterdam a few times and so have done all the main attractions, so this time we thought we'd venture a bit further away from the centre and check out the Amsterdam that people actually live in. The Jordaan was lovely, beautiful small streets and canals, squares and cafes and a real slice of everyday life rather than the hustle and bustle of the main tourist areas. Thriving street-markets and some lovely 'Hofjes', which were/are courtyards and gardens built for the working classes. Most are closed to the public and only open on special days, but if you do find some open, take a peak (but mind you don't annoy the owners)! Would highly recommend getting yourself a map and wandering off the beaten track for the day."

Far more authentic than the Dam or Old Town area and less rammed with tourists, the Jordaan has the Antique Centre, on the western end of Elsengracht and it has many clothes shops to rival the Nine Streets.But beware the two-wheeled killers! Wherever you go on foot in Amsterdam they are out to get you. Just as you thought it was OK to cross because there is a green walking man light - whamm! You end up being nearly run down by single, duet or hordes of marauding pushbikers for whom the Dutch version of the Highway Code clearly means nothing. The pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle lanes of the roads are sometimes split into three - one for cars, one for pushbikes and one for pedestrians.Before you step off any pavement or onto a zebra crossing, do your Green Cross Code at each segment you cross, because cyclists come at you from left. right, or behind you. Then just go for it until you reach the relative safety of the first next bit of raised paving stone that marks the separation of a segment. There is no escape from them. The only real way of getting around Amsterdam unmolested by the hordes of cyclists who've never been taught how to spell the word 'bell' let alone use one, is by armoured car. Be warned :)"

Before going to Amsterdam, I had heard so many good things about this place from all sources including Rick Steves' book/DVD, Eye witness travel guide, and Frommer's guide etc. We did the entire walk in about 2 hours, taking plenty of time taking pictures, listening to Rick Steves' audio that we downloaded to our Samsung SG 4. There were numerous sceneries where we simply had to stop just to soak in unbelievable beauties all around us 360 degrees. Too bad we could not get into Ann Frank house despite owning the Museum cards, due to the outrageously long line. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam to explore this neighborhood if at all possible."

The architecture alone will have you wander the streets for hours not finding two identical buildings, spotting one of a kind decorations and arrangements here and there. You cannot help but wonder what sort of person would live in there.Have a drink in one of the many little bars or just sit on a bench, look at the buildings and people watch. It\u2019s calm and almost tourist free in most parts. I find shopping just out of this world good in this area, as it offers handmade and vintage pieces you will never find anywhere else in the world.

We stayed in a houseboat on Prinsengracht, so taking a wander into the Jordaan was essential, to find food, cash, stamps etc. It's really just a residential area, bordered by canals. What makes it different from the rest of Amsterdam is that it has a quirky, arty, and knowingly trendy feel. There's similar places in England, for example Oldham St in Manchester, Brighton or the gentrified parts of North London where it's an offense to buy anything that's not organic. This place has shop windows full of the stuff that I gladly sent to landfill 30 years ago. This sounds like a negative review, but actually it's a fun place. If you're short on time it's not an essential thing to take in, but if the sun is shining and you've got a spare afternoon to wander about, then this is a good place to do it!"

In the past this area has been a low income neighbourhood and many original dutch folk singers are born here. Now experience this area that - like Nothing Hill in London - has become expensive to live in. But you can eat and drink at a reasonable price at cosy terraces, bars and restaurants. So enjoy your visit!"

Buy flowers, have a sausage, herring or crepe and then by late afternoon enjoy a beer outside if not too cold. Saturdays can be crowded all over the center of the city, and certainly in the Jordaan. But don't let that deter you. Keep a mindful eye for cyclists, stay on the sidewalks. Amsterdam is magical all over, but the Jordaan truly stands out. You won't regret it."

The Jordaan was an area of Amsterdam where the poor people who 'just arrived' in Amsterdam lived or were being 'explored'..... of course most inhabitants made up their mind and left this area, but the real Jordans still feel gruge towards the better off, living in the 'Grachtengordel\" (the better off) or the people of Zuid (South). So they sang together about their unhappiness (tante Leen and Johnnie Jordaan) and suffering in their cafe 's, but started as well making jokes about eachother. Lukely social benefits were given to these inhabitants, and lifes ( housing,health facilities & schooling) improved. Nowadays young parents buy these small houses and the always-complainers/ misusers of the social bennefits are getting less. But the area is getting overcrowed by the tourists through RB&B and the youg couples/parents with too many cycles dumped everywhere. So agian the inhabitants starts to complain/ cry out and I think they are right. They should have the feeling that they live in 'a museum', so they misbehave to clients/tourists sometime. Now you have been warned............but it is a safe and very Amsterdam district with beautiful nice shops, beautiful art galeries and delicious resto's. The inhabitants, the origanals have a special 'language' with many Judiac/Jiddiac words. Jordaan comes from the French word: 'jardin'/garden. Upperclass people from teh canalarea loved to speak French and these were the gardens for the innercity, untill.......many refugees came to the (once?) liberal city Amsterdam."

Every Saturday, the biological and fresh produce market is present. This is something very special to see and taste if you are a foodie! Plenty of cheese to sampled, croquettes to be eaten, flowers to be smelled, and conversations to be enjoyed. Especially a nice visit on a sunny day!

A few streets down you'll find shopping, restaurants, bars, and coffee shops, and with local neighbors out and about all times of day, you can simply ask them to recommend their favorite places.

Life is going on all around you. It's a bit like a calmer version of Greenwich Village, calmer because there is very little car traffic since the streets are extremely narrow and not all that easy to navigate in a car. Bicycles are another matter. They swarm through the streets with little regard (so it would seem) for anyone in their way. It's just the way it is in Amsterdam. My favorite are the cyclists who pedal fast while steering with one hand and doing their iPhone texting with the other. Regardless, the Jordaan is THE neighborhood to stay in Amsterdam so far as I am concerned."

If you do make a point to go Jordaan, make sure you try and find this ice cream place that the locals go to called Monte Pelmo on Tweede Anjeliersdwarsstraat 17 and they make great ice cream for 1.50 euro for a scoop on a cone."

We strolled past quaint inner courtyards, bicycles leaning against ivy-covered walls and a horse & buggy clopping down cobblestone streets. If you're looking for a relaxing respite from bustling Amsterdam, The Jordaan is worth a visit!"

Its actually my favorite part of the City to stay. The only problem with the neighborhood and, in fact with all of Amsterdam, is the fact that its gotten very dirty.. lots of litter and trash everywhere. I cut my foot on one of the many bits of broken glass that are left after outdoor parties along the canals. They really could do with more trash cans and should pick up the trash a bit more often.. Other than that, its a great City.. and the Jordaan is a wonderful vibrant part of it.."

I am Dutch, and sometimes a tourist in my own city,Some way some how me and my wife move on a nice somerday to the DAM, populair as a crosspoint to all kind af interresting places. The palace, red light district, some popular Shopping streets, it always nice. But i like to go a little further, from the Dam, to Nieuwe Dijk, still nice for shopping,so I will loose my wife, because she loves shopping, but i pull her out and take her with me. To the end of Nieuwe Dijk, furhter to the Haarlemmer straat. The less people, more cute shops , and restaurants. Take a coffe, some where, sit back and relax, close to a canal, enjoy some applecake or so. Then go furher, Haarlemmerstraat has some different shops, than all the big stores in the Kalverstraat. Even for a non shopper like me it is fun. Than go to Noordermarkt. It has two parts, the long market, with foods, cheese in many kinds, fresh fried fish, fresh fruit drinks. It something differend and fun. The second part is somekind of green market, and second hand, or antieks. When you tired, wel i was, time for some nice foods, in one of the sweet restaurants.If you have a mood to walk take your parner by the hand, and walke slowly true the small steets and cannals, back to,,,home, or so. I had fun, as a tourist in my own town, and most af all we had a good feeling at the end of the day.Have funT"

Many of the streets are residential and also not accessible to motor vehicles, they have lots of plants in tubs and boxes and it is altogether a very pleasant area away from the main stream area of the city. There are pleasant areas of canal and it is less than ten minutes from the Central Station.It helped us to re-charge after being with so many people for several days. We found one or two cafes on the edge of the area to get a coffee and snack."

It was a wonderful experience and a great tip to see Amsterdam as it once was. Our walk through the district was punctuated with snacks, interesting shops, and life as the locals live it. Our best meal of the day was a simple sandwich of a bun filled with locally made cheese, one that we saw a local purchase in a small cheese shop and an order we copies. A neat experience walking through Jordaan munching on one of the best lunches during our stay. A highly recommended change from seeing touristy Amsterdam to a life lived by the locals"

The Jordaan is the neighborhood bordered by Prinsengracht, Brouwersgracht, Lijnbaansgracht and Leidsegracht (take a look at the map of Amsterdam). Among the canals of De Jordaan, Bloemgracht and Lauriergracht are among the prettiest of the city and many of the other narrow streets offer lots of interesting things to see; just stroll around and \"get lost\". You may even find the 19 hidden court yards behind the facades: beautiful tranquil, green squares bordered by small homes that used to be for the elderly. Look here http://www.tussentaalenbeeld.nl/A60f4.htm if you can't find them by yourself (page is in Dutch but you'll figure the street addresses, just look them up in Google maps). De Jordaan is great for shopping too. Avoid the souvenir shops around Dam and Central Station and get yourself something truly unique from one of the many quirky shops in De Jordaan. And don't forget to visit the food market on Saturdays (Lindengracht) for superb fresh fish, fruits, nuts, bread and veggies, and if you are into it the organic food market on Noordermarkt, also on Saturdays. On Monday mornings there is a street market on Westerstraat; you may find a cool hand bag there or some vintage fashion. Among the many restaurants and bars there is something for everyone. There are over 240 restaurants in De Jordaan, just look here at Tripadvisor. And after dinner, walk over to the Tweede Anjeliersdwarsstraat where Monte Pelmo makes the best ice cream of Amsterdam."

Look for the shop that sells ONLY tooth related items - brushes, pastes, etc. Do not expect to find small clothing sizes here - my daughter is an lithe thing and the Dutch are a bigger build. there are many restaurants and coffee shops too in the area."

Forget the Coffeeshops and the Red Light District, the Jordaan is where it's at in Amsterdam!Many travel guides say that this is arguably the prettiest and most romantic area of Amsterdam and I have to agree. The houses are either on streets facing canals or on pretty little cobblestone-paved alleys. The buildings were old, some of them going back to the 1600\u2019s, and they were all pretty uniform in terms of height and style (loft style, no more than five floors each), but they were all unique as well in terms of doors and windows and brick-colour, and they were all so, so lovely to look at. It is very hard to explain the feeling of tranquility you feel walking the streets of Jordaan. Every hour, you hear the church bells from afar, hundreds upon hundreds of bikes pass you on the street, and their little boats and boat houses floated gently on their canals. On almost every corner was a little caf\u00e9 where locals gathered to drink beer or wine, and on some corners there were coffeeshops where the smell of marijuana wafted out the door and into the street. We spent hours going up and down every street and bridge and back-alley we could find. I could easily spend a couple of days just walking around this area."

You don't feel touristy sitting here and it feels more local than anything else. Jordaan is pretty central and easy to find, and to navigate you simply walk around the grid pattern.

But then, that's real life and you can't just have gingerbread houses.

It was and still is a place where many Jews live. So, it's an area full of history and the Anne Frank's house is in the neighbourhood.During the weekends is crowded, but still interesting to visit. If you can, go to visit the Jordaan during the week, when it's still quite lively populated, but with more room in every place. A lunch and a nice walk and shop with friends during a sunny afternoon is a great program for Amsterdam. Considering that you are lucky enough to get a sunny day in the town.My favourite shop is one from a Dutch designer called Hester van Eeghen, who designs shoes and bags and has 2 shops in this Hartenstraat. The shoes I'm not that fan, but the bags are fantastic. She does different forms and uses colours very well in my opinion. Just prepare yourself for the prices, because her bags are quite expensive."

My husband and me visited Amsterdam in february 2014, we had of course bad luck with the weather, buth this fact did not lower our promenades in this vibrant and jovial parts of Amsterdam.We stayed at The Toren hotel (highly recommendeable), as it's location is next to the Jordaan, our favourite quarter in Amsterdam. I allowed myself a day of power-shopping there, as well as in the 9 streets, which are a bit more upscale, when it comes to quality and prices.The Jordaan is populated with all kind of nations, the shop owners all are extremely friendly and tremendously helpful, offer you a coffee while you shop, are always in the mood for a short or longer chat. You just could spend hours digging around and conversating with the sales people. You'll find all sorts of shops there, from vintage clothes, 2 hand shops, jewelry, antiques, curiosities and of course bags, shoes and clothes. There is literally nothing undetectable. I desperately needed a new pair of tights, the shop lady advised me competently, explained the different materials, I was so grateful for her patience and kindness.On Herenstraat I found an antique shop selling glasses, bibelot and 150-200 years old dutch silver jewelry, that is selled at such incredibly social prices (35\u20ac for an 150 years old silver bracelet from Zeeland). Further on in that street, there is a fantastic bag shop, very expensive to our sorrow, but worth visiting.All sorts of little bistrots with terraces invite you to a break with drinks, snacks and really good coffee. Some coffee-shops (not \"those\" ones ;-) offer a variety of extra coffees and teas, coming from all over the world. The service is always efficient, quick and amiable.As for the 9 Straatjes, it is another shopping paradise. These streets cross Keizers-Prinsen- and Herengracht, you may so explore these great canals and in the same time discover stylish shops, a bit more exclusive as those in the Jordaan. But still: compared to my overpriced homeland or France, you make good deals. Walking over the canals and in the tiny little streets is so pleasant, the dutch people smile at you spontaneously and naturally. Coming from a country, where everyone runs around with a morose face, this was a unique experience for me and made me feel light-hearted.We had lunch in a great restaurants: the Roode Leeuw on Leliegracht. They offer a divine salad, the best in my life and fresh fish, oysters and a monster steak of 850gr. for two. My greatest wish is to find an habitation in Jordaan and live there for the rest of my life. Unfortunately I am surely not the only one, I'll add to the queue..."

Even if you're not looking for a boutique store or organic veggie restaurant the walk itself is worth it. Beautiful buildings peer over tree lined canals, and the odd quirky painting or architecture breaks things up nicely. Worth a wander through anytime, but save your photos for the summer when the trees are in full bloom methinks. Then it's deserving of it's name (Jordaan from the french for garden)"

The area is home to a number of excellent restaurants and cafes and to some interesting shops - we ate there one evening and bought some good items produced by local craftspeople. There are several \"hofie\", hidden courtyards with almshouses, some quite old and all very peaceful.

It is a part of the city where the real full-blooded original Amsterdammers live and stay living.It is a fun, lively, friendly, and historic folks-suburb.The \"negen straatjes\" in the Jordaan is definitely a part one should visit. These are nine streets filled with all kind of nice, exceptional and local shops.It is also apart of the city well known for its \"bruine\" caf\u00e9s, bars and good restaurants.In my opinion it is the best place to shop, eat and drink and meet the local folks."

Think you will enjoy it as well.Every Saturday on the Lindengracht is a street market. Beside the usual inexpensive items you don't need (and some you do) are some things that are just delicious.First we go to a place where you can get a freshly cooked Bratwurst (sausage) in a roll with sauerkraut. or a Freshly cooked ham sandwich. In the winter they also have a Dutch pea soup and in summer fresh Salmon. just great food and you are delightfully filled for 3.50 Euros.From there we go to the first corner (prinsengracht) after loading up on veggies, nuts, and many other goodies and go to the brown cafe on the corner with the best apple pie in Amsterdam. It is nicer in the summer because everyone is outside but in the winter you get to meet the locals who crowd the place all day.Don't believe me Bill Clinton has been there too. and from there. you walk to the other market whose name escapes me but it is less then 100 feet from the apple pie. This market is different because everything has to be natural no additives no preservatives just fresh food.Here we each have 3 fresh and wonderful oysters and load up on the most wonderful mushrooms and fresh goat cheese along with many other delicacies you can only find.On Saturday mornings we don't have breakfast because of the feasts we are about to have at the market. Truly a highlight of our weekends in Amsterdam. And if you don't like any of the things I mentioned am sure you will find others you will.Join the rest of Amsterdam in this wonderful treat. Below it asks when we went but it is such a regular happening for us we go every weekend we are in Amsterdam. It also asks what kind of visit this was. This is for everyone kids old people by yourself or in a group but not a big group."

The canals are and the houses here are relatively smaller to the big canals of Amsterdam (Keizer, Prinsen & Heren) but they provide for a scenic route and they give you lovely warm feelings inside. The Jordaan is scattered with boutique restaurants & shops and the bars are packed with vibrant young Amsterdammers at night. Some restaurants are quite intimate for couples in love and the funky stores are nice to browse through. My favorite clothing stores are the second hand store on Eerste Bloemdwaarstraat: Goshka's Goodies & the 50s clothing specialist store on Eerste Leliedwarsstraat No. 6: Cherry Sue. The markets during the weekend are also wonderful to visit for light & easy bites. They have the organic food market near the church. If you can only do one thing in Amsterdam however please visit Winkel 43 - they have the best apple pie in Amsterdam! Enjoy the Jordaan, it is most definitely a dream come true for me - the place is magical!"

The Jordaan is good for architectural photos as there are not so many people running around.Some folks go out of their way to stay in the Jordaan and rarely move from there. I just don't get it there are many amazing places in Amsterdam, such as the Jewish Quarter, Chinese Quarter the Vondelpark just to name a few.If you want to stay in the Jordaan make sure you are on the Dam side around Westermarket rather than the other side as it gives you walking access to the other areas of Amsterdam."

We also stopped along a superb Saturday market which was selling freshly baked goods, cheeses, meats et al. Next we came to a flea market from where I managed to pick up old currency notes of pre-Euro era. Anne Frank's House too is situated here, be prepared for long queues in case you haven't booked ahead (we skipped after seeing a serpentine).This is a great neighbourhood to see vintage Amsterdam with its forward slanting houses and boat-houses try to get there on a Saturday to enjoy the markets."

For me it was a ceramics studio and a great living space. I miss the people, the bread and cheese, the great transportation system, the elegant architecture and style. I always fly into Schiphol Airport when traveling to Europe. The train system makes it smooth getting into downtown Amsterdam. Efficient, clean and friendly. I used to fly Northwest, now it is Delta, or Continental, or Priceline whomever. Pass through en route to Spain or Italy, and make it a three day stop. Go to a park or coffee shop or a museum.

As typical, Dutch architecture houses line fairly small canals and there are enough restaurants, bars and cafes to sit, relax and people watch. Chanced upon a house with a big window where you can see a couple of \"naked cats\" sleeping (the owners had kindly posted information about these interesting cats too). The streets are quiet but not dead, and as expected much of the bustle was near food establishments. There are not many attractions here as Jordaan seems primarily a residential area, but in Johnny Jordaanplein, which is a small square along Elandsgracht, there are busts/statues of Johnny Jordaan and other popular musicians from this neighbourhood. These were visible while I was walking along Prinsegracht which was also how I stumbled upon Jordaan. Jordaan is an easy detour while exploring the Grachtengordel and while not a critical inclusion to a traveler's must-see list for Amsterdam, it is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours (including a cafe stop). Personally, I also preferred the cafes here which felt less touristy, probably because this place sees few tourists. So it's a nice place to stroll and take a break from the busy-ness of the Amsterdam."

If you are observant enough, you will notice a large hook hanging from the roof of some of the buildings with huge panel windows.

Our b&b was located right off one of the canals so we became quite familiar with this area. During the day we would venture out all over the city, then return to Jordaan in the late afternoon. There are so many cafes and places to eat or to just grab a beer, and the streets are quite lively. On Saturday, there was an open market where you could pick up fresh fruit, meats, cheeses, pastries....we ate these delicious sandwiches. Then we saw that there was a line going in to a corner cafe called \"Winkel\", so my teenage daughter went to investigate. When she stepped out of the cute, cozy Winkel, she had a huge piece of dutch apple pie (and some cold beer for her parents). Let me say, the pie was crazy good. And the Amstel beer was oh so yummy. We felt comfortable and right at home here, and felt completely safe strolling around until late in to the evening."

You'll see that The Jordaan is nestled ammongst the Brouwersgracht (N)/ Leidsegracht (S)/ Lijnbaansgracht (W) Prinsengracht (E) canals. Consider yourself lucky if you have unlimmited timme to explore! There are great little discoveries at every turn - charming little shops and galleries; cafes/restaurants; markets:Lindengracht Market, Westerstraat Market, Noordermarket; beautiful canal scenes plus the mmost interesting street & building facades. The Westerkerk and Anne Frank statue; the mmany distinct shuttered windows on buildings lining the Brouwersgracht; the Brandweer(fire station) are just a few of the landmarks that are easy to identify that you are in the Jordaan. Going east (away from the Westerkerk) along Prinsengracht will take you to Johnny Jordaanplein and it's popular historic Amsterdamer musicians personality statues (pic unavailable). In mmy encounters, mmy immpression of the Jordaan residents is that they are quite friendly!

We skipped visiting the Anne Frank House, however, both having visited it years ago and daunted by the long lines. We attended a concert at the Westerkirk but could not locate the famous grave in the floor. The organ is extremely large and beautiful but was out of tune today so the smaller organ was played. The church is lovely, large and light. The canals and houses are classical for Amsterdam. The views are lovely. There are many quiet streets that are relaxing to walk. Recommend it to get a better feel for the less touristy side of this famous city."

We explored many neighborhoods of Amsterdam (primarily on bikes - far and away the best way to get around town) and the Jordaan felt the most like true Amsterdam. By this I mean for folks that call that town their home, the way of life in the Jordaan felt the most real, lacking the trappings of tourism and hypercommercialism that saturate areas like Centrum.There is no one thing to see in the Jordaan as there is no central hub therein. It's simply a sprawling network of quiet streets and canals lined with hole-in-the-wall shops, boutiques, bars, and restaurants. One of the most serene moments of our exploration came when we happened upon a gorgeous quiet courtyard with a massive old elm towering overhead. Sitting on a bench to watch the world go by we saw folks just going about their days. It was quite peaceful.The shops and restaurants are endless but none are overt or ostentatious. Just charming and tucked away waiting for you to wander by. Everyone was friendly and everyone spoke English quite well. There was a healthy mix of more expensive fare as well as affordable places to grab a bite or find something cute to buy.The Jordaan was best seen from atop a bicycle. Bike rentals are inexpensive and practical throughout Amsterdam (Bike City on Bloemgracht was where we rented from and would rent again). The riding is easy and relaxing and allows for covering a lot of ground.Finally, on Saturday mornings Noordmarkt at the north end of the Jordaan explodes with a sprawling open-air market filled with delicious foods and all kinds of clothing and items to buy. This is definitely worth exploring."

We spent a week in April on a houseboat in the Keisergraacht, on the edge of the Jordaan. 4 blocks from the noise & bustle of the Damrak, & I woke every morning to the burbble of the Dutch ducks nibbling on the seaweed on the hull. The first few mornings I woke up thinking I was in my family's cottage in Vermont. The neighborhood was upscale in a very understated way, quiet, residential, well kept. Literally 4-5 blocks walk brings one to the Damrak, the spine of A'dam, the Centraal 3 blocks to the left & Dam Sq. 10 or so to the right. (with all the noise & crowds that such an axis portends."

Do not look for major retailers here, you won't find them. You will find shops catering to all manner of needs-- from fine clothiers to cheeses, from small art galleries to candy shops, and the many pubs, coffee houses and restaurants. The Canals are often lined with houseboats, the roads with bicycles, and the sidewalks with people at all times of the year, though the warmer seasons are nicest. One word of warning: Bicycles have the right of way almost everywhere, which can be unusual for may pedestrians. Do NOT walk on the bicycle paths. It is akin to walking in the middle of a busy street of cars."

Quirky little shops, cafes, restaurants are all welcoming and the residents in the are reflect the real Amsterdam rather than the tourist areas. Little hump backed bridges covered in bicycles and flower troughs lead you through enchanted Amsterdam, coffee and a sit down are never far away for tired feet. Lovely lovely place to walk and you can get back to the busy bits of Amsterdam in minutes any time you choose."

With his limitations in mind, I chose the Jordaan area to stay. I'm glad I did. Although there are still crowds here and there, it gave us a real taste of Amsterdam without too much over stimulation. When he needed a break, we could find a quiet street cafe to sit and calm down. We stayed at a B&B here too."

The Jordaan is a district of the city of Amsterdam.The most common theory on the origin of the name is as a derivation of the French word jardin, meaning garden: most streets and canals in the Jordaan are named after trees and flowers. Another theory is that the Prinsengracht canal was once nicknamed Jordaan (the Dutch name for the river Jordan), and that the neighbourhood beyond the canal came to be called this as well.Amazing to see are the hofjes (inner courtyards). Many houses in the Jordaan have a stone tablet on their facade, a stone sign displaying the profession or family sign of the inhabitants."

We got lost walking in the neighborhood, walked down narrow lanes and saw quaint shops, not touristy at all. It would be good to experience this neighborhood for those who wants time away from the very commercial & touristy Damrak. We were also glad as the neighborhood brought us nearer to the museums.

Many little restaurants with caracter, not pricey at all, and certainly not touristic at all. We tried the \"Restaurant De Eettuin\" (close to the Ann Frank house) with some typical dutch food. It was no less then awesome! Delightful! Here is the address: Tweere Tuindwarsstraat 10A, www.eettuin.nl. Totally recommended!Many students and artists live here. Easily my favorite spot in Amsterdam. Don't miss the 9 roads: shopping paradise!"

This is what Amsterdam is about, from the grandeur of the canal houses, to the small blue collar workers' houses in the side streets. It has many charming corners, nooks, and new surprises everywhere with plaques and small memorial plates. It is best when walking around (wear your sneakers or walking shoes! Cobble stones everywhere + long walks possible because of the bridges), looking up, a bit of sunshine (lots of people out on boats as soon as it might be a sunny day), a bite and a drink along the way and a mix of quaint and hip flagship stores. The 9 streets (in fact 3 streets, but they switch name after each bridge across a canal) just behind the Royal Palace (Hartenstraat) are known for cool stores and restaurants. Just look around, this is the heart of Amsterdam."

The guide is great in giving you both the directions for finding the \"gems\" as well as gives you the background and history of the places. The Jordaan is full of little cafes where one can sit inside to drink a cup of hot chocolate when it is raining outside or enjoy a glass of rose outside in the sun. It used to be a district for working class but is now the most expensive district in Amsterdam (if not the whole country). While there, don't forget to visit the Noordermarkt (on Westerstraat) in the weekends for the whole buzz, and the textile market (on Lindengracht) on Monday."

The orange from the street lights, reflecting on the canals, and the warm glowing windowns of the cosy dutch bars and restaurants are a delight to see. Take your camera as this will be an area to remember.We didn't really experience the shopping side of this area, but had a few drinks in the bars and ate at Vlamings Brasserie on Prinzengracht. Well worth a visit for a romantic meal.This area is alot quieter, although from the centre you will need to walk past a number of coffeeshops. Don't be put off by these, as the street gets quieter, and then changes completely as you walk further from Central station.Very safe, very romatic and a must when with someone special."

So, unless you are interested in doing research about that, I would leave this out of your itinerary on foot. The only time I would ever go back to the real Jordaan area is to go to one of the markets (the Alburt Cuyp and Waterlooplein markets are the best though not in the Jordaan so I probably still wouldn't go back). Definitely take a canal boat in the canals, though, and they will take you around the famous part of the Jordaan which basically consists of Prisengracht. One single canal/street that contains some pubs and maybe a couple shops and the Anne Frank Huis."

Some of the canals in this area are much more picturesque too such as the Egelantiersgracht.We found that allowing a couple of hours gives you enough time to cover pretty much quite an extensive area of The Jordaan. Once you are all walked out, there are plenty of quaint cafe bars to enjoy a drink or two and have a quick bite to eat whilst watching the world go by too. We stopped off at the Cafe 't Smalle which is on the corner of the Egelantiersgracht and Prinsengracht. There is a very nice terraced area to sit outside too when the weather is nice. There is a good selection of snacks and sandwiches on their menu to choose from. It was in here that I sampled an Old Jenever for the first time too \u2013 anyone who hasn\u2019t tried one I would certainly recommend it!All in all, The Jordaan makes a pleasant contrast to the busier feel that the streets in the Red Light District offers and any visitor to Amsterdam should make the time to explore this area."

It sometimes means you need to double back on yourself a bit, but well worth it.

My wife and I wandered around Jordaan on 2 evenings, soaking up the atmosphere and admiring the canals, the houseboats, the magnificent merchant houses lining each criss-crossing canal and the generally calm atmosphere that pervades the whole of the Jordaan area in Amsterdam. We found plenty going on though, the steets alive with a low-level buzz, people walking arm-in-arm or students having fun near the canals, or just walking their dogs and we spent both evenings eating at excellent restaurants by the canals. The people were friendly (although watch out for the frantic cyclists who ring their bell and expect you to jump out of their way immediately!) and we decided we would love to have a house or flat in Jordaan, which quickly became our favourite part of Amsterdam."

It typifies the local experience with a nice Saturday market (organic near the Noorderkerk and traditional on the Lindengracht). Small Hofjes dot the neighborhood and the history of the Jordaan is remarkable. Stroll the neighborhood and catch your breath before heading back to the tourist zones."

Head west from dam square along radhu istratt,past westerkerk to your right, and you will find yourself on rozengracht the beating heart of the jordaan.in this part of town you won't find stores selling weed tee shirts or clog slippers.what you will find is everyday Hollanders going about there daily business,nothing pretentious here.this is reflected in prices of drinks food etc stop at moeders for some dutch cuisine.then pop across the street to flower power for a joint if that's your thing. Head south a couple of blocks from here(its on a corner)and you will find yourself at sarrein.this is a lesbian bar but during daytime everybody is welcome.free pool table downstairs smoke friendly and cool snacks think hard boiled eggs and chilli nuts"

The most of the streets were named to a flower.\nThe streets are small, and the footpath too, so watch out for bikers.\nThere are some gardens and nice cafes."

Having been there in mid-May it truely was the \"garden district\" as almost every house had a rose or gardenia bush blooming. There were several quirky shops we stopped in as well as visiting the Anne Frank House, Westerkerk and other sights. Away from those sights the neighborhood is not crowded and you get a feel of what it is like to live in Amsterdam."

It is not nearly as busy as some other areas in Amsterdam and you can even find a bench by one of the canals and just sit and relax and observe the happenings around you. Many little shops are seemingly still family owned and just fun to look at."

Peaceful, quiet and serene neighborhood is even more of a delight when viewed on a canal boat. I loved how nearly every house had lush rose bushes outside of every color. Not much in terms of night life, but ideal for an afternoon or evening stroll or bike ride. Even better, it's not touristy at all."

Then I worked my way through the beautiful 9 streets, shopping for presents, clothing, and when i got tired, I found some of the best pancakes and coffee a man could ever dream for in the middle of the day.The Jordaan is an island of tranquility in the midst of Amsterdams bizarre center.

Some of them are hundreds of years old, tilting forward till you are sure they are going to fall. Make sure you stop in one of the famous \"brown cafes\", called such because the walls and ceilings have turned brown from years and years of patrons smoking in them. Charming houses on lovely canals, the kind of place you would want to live in had you the money to do so. The stores that are in this area are one of a kind, you will pay for that privilege, but this is a lovely afternoon walk. Enjoy it."

We went there on a Sunday hence many shops were closed.We were walking quite a lot and once had to take a break on a bench outside one of the houses for some snacks. Shortly after the house owner came back and was friendly towards us (strangers sitting on his bench). Very nice people in Amsterdam."

We stayed with City Mundo in an apartment in the Jordaan distrct, which was very pretty and highly recommended for those who prefer a quieter place to sleep within easy reach of all the city sites. Being a vegetarian, there were plently of choices (check out 'happy cow' online) but our favourite was Green Planet and Bohead (spelling?!). The van Gogh Museum was amazing but would recommend being very careful about pre-booking your tickets online as the door staff refused to acknowledge ours and we spent longer trying to sort it out than we would have in the queue! The Dutch people are very friendly and really made our trip. Have fun!"
