Ancient ruined ramparts support construction that has been added in the last 75 years or so. There is a large church with a wonderful mosaic rooftop. There are interesting streets to wander and shops, but the highlight is the magnificent views of the river, Parliament buildings and Pest."

Really we made our way up here to view the sensational Modigliani exhibition and we were delighted we did because it was a great show. The views over Pest from up here are really good so it is well worth the walk or taxi ride. There is an ambitious programme of re-building proposed so the area can only become better in the future."

You can walk up the hill or if you want to save your feet take the funicular and in just 2 minutes you're up at the Hill. Have a nice walk around and admire the number of buildings with different tastes. You can take a break and sip a coffee or take a snack at one of the coffee shops/restaurants and enjoy the surroundings and tourists going around.Walking by you can visit St Matthias Church, St Stephen's statue,the Holy Trinity column and Fisherman's Bastion besides other interesting places and monuments. You can stop at one of the many souvenir shops and buy your souvenirs."

I walked across the Chain Bridge from Pest at 8 am, and saw the sun shining on the Buda side as I crossed the Danube. I walked to Fisherman's Bastion from the Castle, and the streets were empty. The Bastion was also empty, which allowed for fabulous photos. Later that day I returned with my sister, and the crowds were there in droves. Still lovely, but I was very glad I'd gone earlier so I could experience Castle hill without the crowds. Take the time to stop at a coafe, and there is a post office on the main road that supplies post cards and stamps."

When we were there they had Modigliani on display...The Castle can be reached either using the cable train (a fun thing to do), by Elevator or by foot. Walking up is not easy though, you need to be able to walk several hundred meters uphills in order to try this.Around the Castle there are a lot of attractions that can amuse both adults and children - like arrow shooting in a medieval setup.Walking away northwards from the Castle will take you to the Mathias Cathedral and the Fishermen's Bastion.Be ready to spend at least a whole day in this place, you will not regret it"

Oh, and unless you want to stand in line, just take the 16 bus up the hill and skip the funicular."

A scenic journey to Castle Hill (aka Castle District) generally begins with walking across Budapest\u2019s famous Chain Bridge (\u201cSz\u00e9chenyi L\u00e1nch\u00edd\u201d in Hungarian), and then taking the cable car ride (originally built in 1870) up Buda Hill. The Chain Bridge connects Buda and Pest, and spans the Danube River. An easier way to Castle Hill is to get the bus # 16 which you can get on about 50 metres from the main entrance door of the Four Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace. Of course, there are many other stops on the bus route where one can get on. Since I\u2019ve been to Budapest over 60 times, I have walked up Buda Hill from the Buda end of the Chain Chain Bridge to the Castle District; although it is good exercise, there is little tourist value to the walk. The Castle District (a Unesco World Heritage Site) is home to many of Hungary\u2019s most significant medieval monuments and museums. The attractions include the Buda Castle, the Royal Palace and its many courtyards, the Matthias Church (M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Templom), medieval architecture and houses of both royalty and commoners, winding stone roads, good Hungarian restaurants, cafes, wine tasting in Buda Castle at the Faust Wine Cellar, the Dominican Monastery, the breathtaking view and a fine Hungarian cuisine available at both the Hal\u00e1szb\u00e1stya Restaurant and the certain seats in the Hilton restaurant from which one can have a panoramic view of the Danube river and Pest, various stone-walled caves, and many more exciting things to view. A few of the stores on Castle Hill sell Herend, a world class fine porcelain. I\u2019ve purchased over 200 pieces, some being at the Herend store on Castle Hill, others at the Herend store/manufacturing plant in Herend (a village outside of Papa, Hungary), and other stores in Hungary. Personally I like the animal figurines."

It is a gated area, and although the tourists are many from 11-4, you can wander off the beaten tracks for gorgeous vistas and solitude. We walked everywhere from here - both up and down. However if you aren't into the exercise (we averaged 10 miles a day), you can pay for the vernacular OR take the FREE escalator up - it's open 24 hrs. The Fishermans Bastion charges during the busy tourist hours, but if you are up early or late you can get up there without charge. We were blessed with a free classical piano concert honoring Hungarian and Christian roots one night outside Matthias Chapel (climb the bell tower for a must -see view). We went to the Labyrinth hesitantly, but we're very pleased to find it was history focused rather than Twilight/Dracula falsehoods."

Once you are across, you will see the line for the funicular. To the left of that, you will see some small businesses selling lemonade, etc. Our guide said, if we bought something, and I think everyone needed a drink it was so hot, the receipt would allow us entrance to the WC. This was our pit spot on the tour. Now, the WCs are between the funicular and drink stand and towards the back. I mention this as I am not sure we would have noticed it.To ascend the hill, just past the drink stands is a small street, on the left, walk up there and look for an opening in the wall on your right. If you enter there, in no time, you will be in a parkland setting and will see a dirt path and stairs. Follow either one to the top. You will come out near the National Art Gallery.There's a fee to enter the gallery but the view is free! There's also souvenir vendors and an outdoor cafe. If you stay away from the gallery and head to the right, you will see another viewing opportunity and if you keep heading in that direction, you will find the church, Fishermen's Bastion, etc. Your camera will be going click, click. By the time we finished our tour, we had been up well over 30 hours as it was our arrival day, so we took the funicular down. We were able to get some more photos and it is one of those fun things you do as a tourist.We visited the area three more times on our stay and we just walked up and down using the path I described. It's not a really long walk but perhaps a bit steep for people who are not regular walkers. On the way, we saw a violinist busking and people having quiet time. There's a lookout part way up where you can see the funicular going up and down.We didn't patronize any of the shops but had a quick lunch at Bazaar which was very nice and set in some ruins. Not sure how to describe that area. It's further past the Castle but going away from the church and bastion. I think of it as being south but not sure if that's right. It was found by chance. We found very few people in that area. We were on a walk to the Cave Church and Gellert Hill that day.Finally, if you are interested in visiting the National Art Gallery, which is housed in the big castle building, there's a view from the cupola included in your fee. Wherever you look from, the view is awesome and it most cases, it's free. "

Great to visit for the views from here but again the views can be captured from Fisherman Bastion too."

Castle hill offers much more - the National Gallery. It offers best Hungarian collection of art pieces. Carefully plan your visit. Best and mostly used access is from Clark's square either by the funicular (bit overpriced) or walking up the hill. But during tourists peak hours waiting time for funicular could be rather long."

Enjoy the funicular ride up one way for 1200Huf and then walk back down through the park to grab opportunities for different perspectives of Pest. Up the top you can drop in on Dracula's labyrinth or Houdini's home but we opted for the famous cream cake at Ruszwurm tea shop. If you want to climb the bell tower of Mattias Templom book your tickets early so you aren't waiting around as groups are limited to 25 at a time."

We watched as the bridges lit, then the Parliament and all the Pest buildings one by one as the sun retreated. As the light of the sun faded the light of the city grew more magnificent and we were able to watch it all from a perfect vantage. We walked down to the castle and enjoyed the view from that side. Then we found a lift that took us down a couple floors, steps to another lift and then street level. We walked along the tram line to board a tram that took us home.

We couldn't be bothered waiting in a 30 min queue so we took a wander up the hill to the left only to be stopped from travelling any further due to a wine festival which you had to pay to get in.

There are slopes and steps to walk up; a Funicular Railway and public transport. We took the 16 bus route from outside of the Gresham Four Seasons hotel into the complex. The choice of museums, art galleries, sightseeing and restaurants is very good. Of course there are a lot of tourists, in my view too many coaches are allowed into the complex - I know people have to get there but at one point we counted 9 coaches lined up to drop people off, or collect them. At least they are restricted to one end of the old town, so the main body of the town is relatively light on traffic, just cars and the occasional delivery vehicle, plus the blue public transport buses: 16, 16a and 116."

Castle Hill just may be, next to the outstanding buildings and institutions in Vienna, the capital of the former Austro Hungarian Empire, the largest and the most remarkable monument to local and. central European history. Across the Danube on the Pest Side of the city, one can see another extraordinary building, the Parliament which also originates from that part of central European history when Hungary together with Austria \"ruled\" over a large portion of the European homeland. Today, Castle Hill houses many institutions, restaurants, museums and cultural performance spaces.

I came here in November of 2015 and in spite of being overpriced, it was worth it for the pictures you could get of the city. I came here today and it was a HUGE disappointment. Literally all of the good spots to take pictures were blocked off on castle hill to make over priced restaurants that would not allow people in to take pictures. My friend and I kept walking around looking for a good spot to take pictures and place after place was blocked off to make restaurants that were so overpriced nobody wanted to eat there. We walked up one castle turret to find that it was also blocked and turned into a restaurant. I commented to my friend who was there for the first time- \"I am so disappointed. In November, this was a great place to take pictures. Now, they have turned one of the top tourist destinations into a overpriced restaurant industry. What a shame.\" An old man turned around and looked at me and said \"You are 100% correct. This is terrible.\" There were several tourist groups that I saw who were disappointed that all of the good access points were closed off for big industries to make money on overpriced restaurants. There are many cool things to do in Budapest. Going to the Castle Hill is no longer one of those things."

During your way up you have fine views to the Chain bridge and to the Pest town with parliament and churches.

I like this juxtaposition: the \"people\" knew all the while who had done the work, never mind that a Habsburg led the eventual procession into liberated Buda..."

It's baroque architecture let's you imagine all the stories and adventures it might had seen already and the view to Pest side is absolutely breath taking. There are exhibitions year long and other activities, but if you want to seat down at its walls and contemplate the world, this is a place to be. By evening its lights transforms the place into one of the most romantic spots in all Budapest. The golden lights makes the ambience smooth and luxurious, you become a Knight looking for the princess to kiss. Highly recommended, free to visit the outdoors, not crowded though a tourist spot. Souvenirs available and you can even try the art of archery right by the entrance. Maybe you can hit the heart of your Lady to be!"

If you can make it to the Liberty Statue then you can get a fantastic view for the Danube River and the Chain Bridge. At night, the view is even more phenomenal. Definitely this is a must see."

Castle Hill is reached by either walking up the many paths leading to Castle Hill, the public bus from Szell Kalman ter or, the best option via the funicular at the foot of the Chain Bridge. Located on Castle Hill are the Royal Palace (museum), Fishermen's Bastion, Mathias Church, the National Museum of Military History and many other museums and tourist sites. Scattered throughout are numerous shops and restaurants. Castle Hill provides a panoramic view (and photo op) for Parliament, the Danube River, the Chain Bridge and surrounding Budapest. Be sure to catch the changing of the guard that takes place on the hour every hour (believe starting at 1000). Best viewing point is the small square right by the top of the funicular station. We stayed directly across from Castle Hill at the Intercontinental Hotel and had a great view of the Palace and St Mathias from our large triple picture window."

Our guide had us there before 9 am, so we had no wait, but told us that later it could stretch for over an hour. The ride up is about $5 US. The grounds of the castle are undergoing some renovation, but you can see the original footings. Work is going on around that area but it is still walkable. Start here and walk to the big church and square, then up to the walls for more spectacular views. There are many quaint shops and cafes around the area as well. In the height of the tourist season it gets pretty crowded, so timing your visit to be at the funicular first thing in the morning will make it more pleasant. The gardens are lovely and very well maintained. Lots of places for photo ops!"

Cross the Danube on one of the bridges and then either take the funicular, if it's open, or climb the stairs to the Castle area and just stroll around looking at the beautiful buildings and enjoying the view back to the Pest side of the river. Lots of places to sit and have refreshments and enjoy the beauty of the city."

            "review": "Used a morning to stroll on Buda Hill for photo stops of its attractions. The attractions on Buda Hill were clustered together in 3 areas: the Matthias Church/Fisherman's Bastion, the Royal Palace, and around the Vienna Gate. We visited the Matthias Church (entry fee) which had stunning interiors, but the rest were mainly photo stops as we strolled by them. We walked from one end of Buda to the other end during our morning visit to Buda Hill.Definitely, the highlight of our visit to Buda hill was the square with Matthias Church and Fisherman's Bastion. There was a 1200 Huf entry fee to see the interior of the Church but it was so unusual and memorable it was worth it. Fisherman's Bastion itself was stunning for its fairytale appearance and its panorama views over the Danube towards Pest. We could see clearly the Parliament building, St. Stephen's Cathedral, the bridges, St. Margaret's Island, the city of Pest, and even a bit of Gellert Hill. Being clustered together, the attractions on this square saved us a whole lot of walking time. We allowed 1 1/2 hour for the visit to this square.Another cluster of attractions included those around the funicular landing and the Royal Palace: the raven statue, the Royal Palace now an art gallery and Museum of History, the Palace courtyard with its entry through the wrought iron gates, the Palace fountains and statues, the views over the Danube, and Sandor Palace for the changing of the guard. All of these were just photo stops for us. We allowed ourselves 20 minutes. The fountains in the courtyard were less impressive, less interesting, and smaller than I imagined them to be. At the beginning of June, there were few flowers to make me want to stay longer than just a quick walk by. Probably this courtyard would be sufficiently viewed from the ornamental wrought iron gate. Nearby was the black raven statue. The raven had its wings spread wide with individual feathers visible, and a golden ring in its mouth. Without knowing the significance of the raven to the royal family, one certainly wonders why the bird is given such prominence. The raven was a motif of the royal family and used in their coat of arms as a family crest. It symbolizes King Matthias. A bronze raven was also perched atop one of the shorter towers of Matthias ChurchThere was a third cluster of attractions at the other end of Buda: the Vienna Gate, the Museum of Military History, Mary Magadene Tower, and Erdody Palace. We walked on Toth Arpad Setany to reach this area. This promenade which runs parallel to the walls of medieval Buda had trees for shade, a few benches, and views towards Gellert Hill. This walk was too long with little to see until we reached its end. There were, also, few side streets so we couldn't change our walking route. There were other streets to walk on to reach Vienna Gate so give those a try. The Mary Magdalene Tower was worth the walk in order to see the ruins or footprint of a church and its tower that was once used by both Catholics and Christians for services during Turkish rule. On our way back, we walked along Orszaghaz street which had side by side houses (some very old and noted for their appearance) and shops where I bought some packaged smoked paprikia (1500 Huf). This road led us back to the square with Matthias Church. We quickly located the stairs behind the church at the Fisherman's Bastion that led down the hill to the town at its base. Our stroll and return to the town at the base of the hill took about 1 hour. If visits are required to Buda's museums, the art gallery or even the attraction, Hospital in the Rock, at the base of the old town walls, visitors could use up a day rather quickly. At night the Royal Palace is splendidly lit up along with Matthias Church, Fisherman's Bastion, the Parliament, and other sights along the Danube River. I would definitely recommend taking a Danube cruise at night to see this spectacle. It was a free ride for us on our Scenic river cruise ship. It's easy to get to Buda Hill. Perhaps we could have saved time and energy by taking the funicular from Clark Adams ter to the top of Buda Hill. However, we walked past the funicular to the arched patio area where a ramped path, escalator, and elevator took us to the castle courtyard for free. On our return to the town at the base of the hill, we found that the wide stairs at the Bastion led to more and more downward stairs until we reached the town where I wanted to see the Church of St. Ann. The attractions on Buda Hill had entry fees between 1200 to 1800Huf with the Hospital on the Rock being the most expensive at 3600Huf for an hour's visit."

I've been in Budapest a number of times through the years and have always come up to Castle Hill for the wonderful view over the Danube, Pest, the Parliament, etc. The older district near Matthias Church is pleasant, although it seems to me to have become far more touristy through the years. Shops here are pricey compared to elsewhere, in my opinion. We walked as a family up Gellert Hill and then down and over to Castle Hill. Perhaps a 15-20 minute walk from the bottom of Gellert to the Castle. I was surprised by how poorly maintained the area was. Even within the grounds of the castle, most of the gardens were overgrown, with lots of broken bottles and other trash about. This was surprising, and I didn't encounter anything like this anywhere else in Hungary. The Castle itself is largely a reconstruction, and a flawed one at that. But the view is still amazing and worth coming for. The public buses that serve the area near the castle, connecting it to Ferenc Deak ter, are wonderful. Would recommend this to all, but would hope that maintenance improves!"

            "review": "Disappointing up close. In three previous visits to Budapest I had never made it up the hill here, so on my most recent trip I decided to give it a go. Playing \"Spot the Tourist Trap\" is easy as soon as one steps off the tram line at the local stop, as you spy long queues of British, German, American, and other tourists all queueing in the heat to be ripped off for the vernicular railway up the side of the cliff; meanwhile there is a perfectly accessible stairway and free lift just around the corner. Once you have made it to the top - for either 1,000 Forint or for free, your choice - the views of the city are not bad, but dwarfed in excellence by the views from the nearby Gellert hill. The walk along the wall can be vertiguous, especially with its low walls and sheer drop, which makes it probably the most exciting thing about the top of the palace. The architecture is nice to look at, but no different to most of the other romanticised buildings down in the centre of Pest.Perhaps the biggest disappointment, however, was the museum. It was peak time in the middle of an afternoon at the end of Spring when we visited... And the museum was closed. A simple sign was posted over the entrance saying no admittance today, with no explanation as to why. As a result, the entire rear area of the castle was deserted and felt slightly derelict in comparison to the crowded front. The cafe and ice cream parlous was open, but equally and expectedly overpriced as the vernicular. Because of these reasons, I would say that this is something worth doing just to say that you have been up there; if you have a spare few hours and have exhausted all your other options. Bring your own drink up to the top on a hot day though, and remember that everything you need to pay ridiculous amounts of money for can be done either for free or more cheaply elsewhere."

We only had a few hours in Budapest while we were waiting for our flight home so decided to visit the old town Castle Hill and were not disappointed. The views of Budapest are spectacular and the buildings and grounds were very well kept. We went inside the church for a small fee and were surprised at how noisy it was with various tour guides giving commentaries, which was a shame given it was a church. It was fascinating to see almost every inch of the walls and ceiling were painted, something we don't see in churches in England. We also saw the changing of the guard at the old government building, which was interesting to see, although nothing like changing the guard at Buckingham Palace! The only negative comment we had was that you had to pay for use of the toilet, which only having Romanian currency was a problem. It would have been nice given the amount of money people were paying on food, drinks, ice creams etc in the area for the toilets to have been free to use. We would definitely recommend it and will pay another visit when next in Budapest."

There is also an Jaime Oliver eatery too busy when we got there."

A 300 degree view on the whole city, with the silver ribbon of the Danube, the beautiful bridges and islands, the famous sites, monuments all sticking out of the Pest-side plane. Go for a walk along the 600--years old city walls, stroll the streets of old Buda castle, the cobble stone streets (no high heels!) with remains of the various periods dating back the 1300s. From the backside of the castle area enjoy the view of the Buda side, the soft ondulating hills, greens and some beautiful buildings. Visit one of the many museums or just go for a coffee or glass of wine sitting in the sunshine. Touristic but for a very good reason!"

We managed to catch the changing of the guard which was nice. The actual 'castle' is a collection of buildings on top of what originally was a Roman site. The main building hosts a museum which currently has a Picasso exhibition.

Overlooking a gentle curve of the Danube and a broad view of Pest, Castle Hill has seen thousands of years of history. Well before the Romans, there were settlements in this area, due to the favorable strategic location of the hill, the transportation facility provided by the river and the surrounding fertile fields that provided food. The Hungarian royal family built the Royal residence here, on top of previously built settlements. The Castle Museum provides a unique glimpse at the multiple levels, starting at the top of the hill and going through multiple \"layers\" until reaching the level of the river. It is an exploration not to be missed. The Royal palace at the top offers a Baroque building that replaced several earlier verions destroyed by multiple wars and occupations. Even in recent centuries it suffered damage during the 1848 war of independence, World War II and the 1956 revolution. The National National Gallery is housed in one wing of the Palace. It is one of the most delightful collection of visual arts from the 18th-20th century and well worth a visit. The national Library is also housed here and provides treasures for the literately oriented guests, with documents in Latin, German, Hungarian and other languages, The rest of Castle Hill deserves several hours. Take in the good weather and just walk through the cobblestone streets. Trinity square, Mathias church, Fisherman's Bastion, and the many boutiques and shops in the area provide for an interesting day. Visit the Wine cellar underneath the Hilton hotel to taste a variety of Hungarian wines; enjoy Hungarian pastries at Ruszwurm or Korona. Or just step into one of the many restaurants in the area and explore Hungarian cuisine."

The Castle has a fantastic location; its permanent exhibition is really beautiful; the market in front of the castle was exclusively reserved for local products: what a refreshing idea to support local commerce, handcraft, natural materials, ethical products, good local food; but the biggest surprise: a full exhibition of Pablo Picasso with a hundred masterpieces and more: the whole for 6 euros: 30 seconds cueing to buy tickets, and ample space to see the masterpieces from different angles and go back and forth for full admiration: this luxury seems to be reserved for Budapest (I saw an equally fantastic exhibition of William Turner a few years ago). Maybe you could consider flying to Budapest to see the exhibitions: you would save time and money and gain fantastic comfort, compared to other western capitals."

However, you can tell that World War II did its damage on the palace, as on some of the outside walls you can still see bullet holes. The Cold War didn't help either, as the government didn't restore the palace to its former glory. The result is that the windows were cheaply replaced, and the domes and ornamentation are similar but not as stately as they used to be. However, I do completely recommend visiting this area, as it is a great part of Hungarian history. Just looking at pre and post World War photos of the castle bum me out!"

But I would recommend to go up after 10-11 PM. When everyone goes to sleep, all the tourists are gone, the area is very quiet and intimate. You might can't go into the Matthias church or any other building but you can feel the special atmosphere of the streets. At 1 AM the city turns off the lights of the Chain Bridge, the Parliament and of other monuments and it is really cool to see it from above. It is also worth to see the sunrise from the Fisherman's Bastion. You got to see the whole Pest side and the beautiful colors of the sunrise.Than you can walk down to Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r and you can be in the city with the tram within 15 minutes (since the 4-6 tramline is 0-24)."

Once we arrived at the castle, I couldn't believe the view. You have the left wing, another monument in the center and the right wing. We only saw the left wing- but boy, it was nice! We ate lunch at the lovely cafe in the center and then walked the path down to the Danube. Breathtaking- the greatest MUST of Budapest, if you ask me. And it looks beautiful at night too!"

There are several routes up, some steeper than others but plenty of places to stop and take a breather should you so wish. Once at the top the views are stunning. We were fortunate enough to have very good weather so you can see for miles. It's worth going up there purely for the view. There are plenty of little cafes at the top, shops and a marzipan museum!! We got there in time to stumble across the changing of the guard which was brilliant to watch. The view changes as you move along castle hill so there are plenty of different photo opportunities. If you're in it for the panoramic, I'd also suggest taking a yomp up to the citadel (no funicular this time) as that's situated even higher and you can see even more!"

Matthias Church (M\u00e1ty\u00e1s templom) and Fishermen\u2019s Bastion (Hal\u00e1szb\u00e1stya) are must see. Make sure the weather is sunny in order to take the most of it. Be aware that is a huge complex so plan accordingly your time. We laughed to tears on the transport arrangement back form the Hill to the Gellert hotel where we staid. While we reached the Castle Hill up just fine with Bus No 16, on our way back we asked the bus drivers which bus should we take to continue to the hotel neighborhood. Not only that he clearly said No 18 but he also wrote that to us, and showed as where to cross the street and on which bus station to wait. Well, when we went there, surprise , surprise: on the bus schedule was no bus No. 18 at all. We checked the near ones as well - the same. Than, we saw a tram station and went there in believe that maybe the tram was mistaken with a bus. There one kind gentlemen explained us in fluid English that indeed on that location there is a direct transport to the Gellert Hotel, but it was no Bus No 18, but tram No 56.  So, pleas note that bus No.18 on Hungarian means tram No. 56 on English. He, he, he. We had great time, the Hungarian people, at least the ones we interacted wit, were all warm and helpful. Except some of the taxi drivers, but that is another story."

A little oasis of calm a complete opposite from the frenetic nature of Pest it comes a welcome relief from the sirens, traffic and city life. Castle Hill can be reached by walking up the steep path or road or for the less energetic by the Budav\u00e1ri Sikl\u00f3 (funicular railway) from Adam Clark Square. The Hill, as the name suggests, is home to the Buda Castle, Fisherman's Bastion, S\u00e1ndor Palace (home of the President) and the Labyrinth. The Castle is an art gallery (or it was when we went) Fisherman's Bastion is the best place to get a view over Pest best viewed at night when the Parliament building is lit up. The Labyrinth is strange mixture of historic artefacts, an opera and Dracula. I don't recommend it if you are claustrophobic. Castle Hill is beautiful at night and well worth a visit. During the day there is a market with touristy items on sale near the Castle and there are several restaurants to choose from."

The best way to explore the area to walk up at one of the numerous walkway from the bank of the Danube between Bathyany t\u00e9r and the Elizabeth Bridge. All of the stairs, roads leading up to the Castle Hill. The walkways show a great panoramic wiev of the city at every turn. If you are not up for walking, you can take the \"Budav\u00e1ri Sikl\u00f3\" located at the Buda side of the Chain Bridge, or a bus 16 from Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r or De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r. This is the oldest part of the city there are part of the old fortress, midevial buildings, the king's Palace, Mathias Church, Fishermen's Bastion, musums, underground labirinth, restaurants, shops etc. You can spend a whole day there just walking around and discover something interesting at every corner. A lot of festivals are being held here (Wine, p\u00e1linka, beer, food, craft fairs through all summer long."

It is a museum and an operational area for the country's government's leading administration so it is a good idea to know what interests you the most and when that information is available. - It is an outstanding tour within Europe and characteristic ofEuropean Historical sites; to learn the most from historical developments, art and architectures spend some time to look at the available brochures and historical summaries.

It's 1200 one way, 1800 round trip to save a 5 minute walk up the stairs or a more roundabout 15 minute windy path. If you happen to arrive near the top of the hour, there is a very, very short changing of the guards ceremony at the top of every hour. If you happen to be there then, fine, if not, it's not worth much of a wait. Top highlights of the area are the Budapest History Museum at the south end and the Matthias Church and Fishermans Bastion towards the north end.

It's not difficult or far). Didn't bother with art or museum just looked around grounds. Lot of construction work going on to around this area which does detract a little but not unexpected for type of area.

Every few minutes can be a new experience...Yes, there may be tourists, but hey, who is talking (the place is not crowded though unless there is a big event). If you want solitude (or even if you don't) go and visit the ruined gardens of the Historical Museum, and walk down from there to the riverbank. "

Its obviously used now as offices for something but the whole place had a very unloved feel about it.

Take your time, as there is a lot to see and do, and exploring Castle Hill will need time. If you don\u2019t have much time, visit Trinity Square, Matthias Church (M\u00e1ty\u00e1s templom) and Fishermen\u2019s Bastion.

There's something magical about being at Buda Castle at night, with the lights on and the lights of Budapest illuminating buildings as far as you can see.

Castle Hill really describes the whole of this particular area of Buda and it really is a good day of wandering and exploring, just to look at all of the architecture, sites, and to take time to admire the stunning views. We had a Budacard so decided to make the most of our free bus travel - we came up the hill via the No 16 bus from the Parliament building (near our hotel) which drops you right in the centre of the main square. Just wandering around with a guidebook is a great way to spend the day, as is spending time in the main sites - churches the National Gallery and Museums etc. The only disappointment was the Labyrinths which were ok but not the highlight of the day. We missed the Hospital inter Rock, which we walked past without realising it was there. If we had done that too, it would have been a pretty long, but very worthwhile day!"

The castle houses the National Art Gallery which in turn houses a very large collection of both national and international works of art. We paid about \u00a32.00 entrance fee which was excellent value and the building itself is of great interest. After enjoying a well earned sit down and coffee in the Gallery,s cafe we ventured out and followed the guided walk of the area from our Marco Polo Budapest Guide. This was excellent and took us around side streets of the area to see buildings of historical interest as well as the better known attractions such as the Fisherman,s Bastion Church. The whole area is well worthy of a day looking around and there are many eateries in the area. Expect to pay more for your food and drink in this area but the prices are still good in comparison to UK prices. Beautiful views of the Danube and attractions on the other bank in Pest are seen from here and there are excellent photo opportunities. Well worth a visit."

Due to time and my interest being more of history we chose the latter. Approx \u00a34 each entry here.The museum is a labyrinth of passages and floors taking you from the medieval history of the hill, the city and the archaeological digs that helped re-discover the story of it all through to the more recent years that tell of the German occupation and then Soviet control of the country.I would say we easily spent 90 minutes in all taking in the story and exhibits and it is well worth the visit.Afterwards take a walk around the walls and get a good view of the Buda side and it is chalk and cheese from the Pest side.On a nicer day we could have walked the top of the hill to various sites and statues but alas the rain dictated that lunch was preferable and time to dry out!"

Admission was a little over six dollars a person. We had to take an elevator up from the north side of the hill. Unfortunately they only take on Hungarian currency. Fortunately I found somebody who took my euros in exchange and we were able to go up the elevator and down it's 200 forint each way. About $.70. Make sure you exit on the river side of the museum for a beautiful long walk overlooking the river and Pest."

You can see right over the Danube and pest from the top which looks fantastic during the day and evening more stunning at night. We didn't enter the castle as it was late and everything was closed but you can climb the steps of parts of it and take pictures/ admire the architecture.

While there are plenty of cafes restaurants a footsore visitor can take a break in it is still hard work. We made our visit in late December but we soon learned cold is no deterrent to crowds so I\u2019m thinking crowds in the high season must be of nightmarish proportions. Budapest is full of marvellous architecture and while the view from the Castle across the Danube gives an outstanding perspective of Budapest across the Danube it is not tourist friendly and little signage explaining what you are looking at exists.

The views are spectacular and allow a nice view of both the Buda and Pest sides of the city. It is free to just walk around, but if you are looking for ways to spend money there is plenty to do even on a rainy day. Among other things, there was an archery demonstration and you could pay a couple euro to shoot various crossbows/ bows.

The hill itself offers a spectacular view of both Budapest and the Danube river and I would highly recommend it for anyone visiting Budapest for the first time. On the hill you have access to the palace which now houses the National Gallery, the Fisherman's Bastion and Matthias church amongst others.Once you are on the hill you can capture amazing photos, stop for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee and wander around the small souvenir stands.

The boat trip will take you round the building in the front to take good pictures, only the micro phone quality of the introduction was really poor and the explanations are of such mono tones- it drove us into deep sleep twice!Take tram number 2 to go and visit Castle Hill... the views there is another treat!"

If you go up to the Castle you can go on the grounds and see the views of Pest from there. The actual castle itself is now a museum that showcases art from Hungarian artists and sculptors. I'm not a big museum person but I went anyway and I liked some of the stuff there such as the gothic style church altars."

After a bit of research we discovered we just had to hop on either No 4 or No 6 tram to the end of the line, which is quite close to the Vienna Gate - just a short walk up a hill. There's lots to see inside the castle district, and there's choice of cafes and restaurants and shops. The painted walls and ceilings of St Matthias Church are amazing, for me one of the best things to see in the castle district. It was bitterly cold (1C) the day we visited and so felt the need to dive into places to warm up. We had a delicious pumpkin soup at a small cafe in the area and spent time looking at the local handicrafts in some of the shops. The Hungarian National Gallery is located at the far end of the castle district and is definitely worth a visit. I was not at all familiar with Hungarian artists before my visit to Budapest but was really impressed with the paintings and sculptures on display at the gallery. There is also a small collection of French Impressionist paintings there which I hadn't seen on exhibition before."

This area, with it's cobbled streets and small alleys takes one back to a time long past when there were no autos and life in cities was busting with people walking the streets and conversing with neighbors, doing business outdoors in markets, and young children freely playing in the streets without the concern of crime or dangerous drivers.This area is a must see in Budapest. It is also the quietest and nicest area to stay in as far as hotels go. The other side of the river is busier and more bustling, but if you want to do business in a quiet very high class environment, this is the best area. The same holds true for any family trip to Budapest. This is the area to stay. It may cost a bit more for food, but generally speaking, things there are 1/2-1/3 the cost of a city in the USA, Germany, or the UK.Loved it!"

Buda Castel was not open on the day we were there but we did see changing of the guard and walked around the compound. Really quite beautiful! The architecture is gorgeous to see, especially at night when all lit up. We had the good fortune to have stayed in the Sofitel Hotel in Pest, directly accross from the Castle. Talk about a million dollar view! Fisherman's Bastion another must see attraction. It is a terrace where you will be able to take amazing pictures of Parliamen, the Danube, St Stephens, the Chain Bridge, etc...St Matthias Church's Gothic architecture is simply gorgeous! Built in the 14th century and largely renovated between 1950 to 1970. We did not visit the art musuem within so I cannot comment on that.Buda Castle was closed the day we visited Castle Hill, however we did see a changing of the guard and walked the grounds which we thoroughly enjoyed. Fisherman's Bastion, a gorgeous terrace offered amazing vistas for photo opportunities including St Stephens Basilica, the Danube, Parliament , the Chain Bridge etc....Matthias Church's architecture is most beautiful!!!! Castle Hill is definitely a must see!! Highly recommend a nearby restaurant, Edeni Vegen Etterem."

Especially when you get to enjoy the views and lighted up buildings (including those across the Danube) with little crowding that occurs during the day. There are a number of lovely hotels to stay at (including the St George where I stayed) that are also reasonable. There is a small grocery store and many restaurants as well as all the museums and historical buildings to enjoy. Right at the Fisherman's Bastion is a coffee house which has the most amazing views. Stopping there for a drink is a must. I stayed two nights and wish I had stayed longer. Originally I was going to stay on the Pest side but am so glad I changed my mind. If you are the type of traveler who likes to absorb and enjoy rather than see and flee, then stay on the Buda side on Castle Hill."

There are no palatial furnishings at the castle, a la Vienna or Versailles. Instead, there is a museum. However, it closes promptly at 4pm in the winter, so to get your money's worth for the admission, enter it no later than 1pm. That means that you will have to plan to see all the other parts of Castle Hill beforehand."

Down a winding cobblestone street, up stairs into courtyards with scupltures, a garden, and eventually the entrance to the history museum. There was a really thoughtful combination of old and modern architecture and design which complemented each other."

Greeted by their own changing of the guard when we departed the vanicular we thoroughly enjoyed. The detail up close is lovely and the views back to Pest are fab. The walks along near the castle are very pleasant and relaxing. And the posh cake store not far away certainly added to our visit on castle hill. A definite place to visit whilst in Budapest."

You can walk along the historic Lord's Street to the fisherman's Bastion and St. Matthias church and spend a whole day vowing the various attractions.

The easiest way to get here is by taking bus no. 16 (towards Szell Kalman Ter) from Deak Ferenc Ter and stops in Disz ter. Disz ter is the stop nearest to Buda Hill. Only about 2 minutes walk. Other stops require walking uphill! The whole place is huge and beautiful. You could spend half a day here. The view overlooking the city center from the Castle Hill is just superb. For those who love photography, they could come over during the evening when the Parliament across the Danube is lighted."

Uri utca 24- Behind Matthias Church and Hilton hotel is a Marzipan Museum where you see some fantastic artwork made out of marzipan. Very interesting!- Matthias Fountain, National Gallery cultural must!! - Siklo funicular to get down ( ticket for it at the entry ) from the HillThese are just some of the highlights of this area but allow plenty of time to explore and ask away if you have a question.

There are a number of museums including the National Gallery and other historical attractions like the Matthias Church. There are also often performances of traditional music and dance. One afternoon I was up there with a friend and we followed the sound of folk music to find a group performing traditional Hungarian folk dances. There are lots of restaurants and coffee shops if you need a rest. I was once here with a friend as a summer thunderstorm was breaking up over Budapest leaving us with a rainbow over the whole city for our pictures."

We also toured Hospital in the Rock an amazing structure which played a surprisingly important role during WWII and that which had been updated for a possible nuclear attack much later. The wax figures really brought it to life. The Sights and Bites tour of Budapest offered by Urban Adventures (get Agnes for a guide if possible) is a wonderful combination of tasting traditional and new dishes of Hungary as well as learning about the history and many neighborhoods throughout the city. It starts in a huge indoor market and then trails throughout the city where old and new sights are highlighted. The guide offered many insights into the culture, politics and current life in Hungary. Also don't miss the free outdoor live listening and viewing at the Opera House when an opera is scheduled. The huge outdoor screen and speakers are possibly even better than sitting inside."

The guards put up a show now and again. Continue past the National Dance Theatre, via D\u00edsz t\u00e9r square to the Holy Trinity monument, in front of the Matthias Church and next to Fisherman's Bastion. Go straight away to the ticket office on the square and get tickets for a visit to the Matthias Church tower (great views, but very steep climb). Next (with the same ticket) visit the Church inside. Take a break before visiting Fisherman's Bastion: walk down Szenth\u00e1roms\u00e1g utca some 200 meters and have a coffee (and pastry) at Cafe Mir\u00f3. Head back to Fisherman's Bastion. It can get overcrowded, but the views and the building make it worthwhile. You can get a ticket to visit a small part of it that is not freely accessible. We visited and it's not really worth the fee.Next, walk a few dozen metres into Orsz\u00e1gh\u00e1z u. and visit the House of Hungarian Wines (Magyar Borok H\u00e1za): there's wine tasting and some snacks included.Continue on T\u00e1ncsics Mih\u00e1ly utca past the Hilton (former Dominican cloister). Continue on this street and you arrive at the Vienna Gate, a small church and the beautiful large building of the National Archives. Turn into N\u00e1ndor utca and arrive almost instantly at the Magdalena tower. You can go up the stairs (free of charge).If you next go down N\u00e1ndor utca, and take the first little street on the right (Lant utca), and you arrive at a chill walking promenade (T\u00f3th \u00c1rp\u00e1d s\u00e9t\u00e1ny). It will bring you to the Royal Palace, where you can admire the Matthias well and the large courtyards. If you choose so, you can visit the Hungarian National Gallery, or the Budapest History Museum.Take the funicular back down, or just walk down to Clark \u00c1d\u00e1m t\u00e9r square through the gardens (easy walk).Congratulations, you've had a great time! Count on 4-7 hours, depending on if you visit the museums and climb the towers."

You can easily walk from near the funicular station up a path that will get you to the top in 5-10 minutes. Alternatively you can walk south (left as you face the funicular station) on the flat street that runs along the Danube for about 5 minutes. Immediately after the grocery store in the building with arched doorways, either enter the elevator at the parking entrance and take it up, or walk up the pathway and into the beautiful garden. Once there, you will see a very long escalator that will take you up the hill. The view at the top is worth the effort."

We didn't follow a tour or even have guidebook and most importantly we didn't just look at the main attractions but walked right round Castle Hill then through all the little streets and found another side of this area. Quirky shops, romantic looking hotels and cafes, wine bars, beautiful houses and right in the middle, a startling memorial to the dark days of WW2 when Hungary fought on the German side, specifically, against the Soviets. Outside the ruins of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene on Castle Hill, large boards describe the devastation of Budapest after the war (or the fights as they call it) now I thought I knew my history but I never heard about the Siege of Budapest,a 50-day-long encirclement of the Hungarian capital by Soviet forces towards the end of World War II. During the siege, about 38,000 civilians died from starvation and military action, about 80% of the buildings were destroyed; when the city fell, the victors initiated wholesale theft of anything they could lay their hands on, random executions and mass rape.Years of Soviet occupation then brought it's own terrors.Some reviews have said Castle Hill was a bit unreal, a bit false and that's probably true but then you have to realize that most of the area has been rebuilt after the almost total destruction of Budapest and they've done a great job. Other things about Castle Hill: it has restricted vehicular access so it is much quieter than Pest. However, look boths ways when crossing roads as I saw cars and vans reversing back up the one way streets. You can get one of the smaller buses (number 16) up the hill from the roundabout by the Funicular Railway (tickets from shop near bus stop). The changing of the Guards in front of the Hungarian Presidential Palace (at the top entrance of the Funicular Railway) usually every hour is well worth watching, very interesting footwork!"

            "review": "The Annual Wine Festival in Budapest. Each year in early September the Budapest Wine Festival takes place in one, large area in the Castle District. It spans five days and nights, and visitors can either buy a daily ticket which allows them to enter the festival as many times as they want for one day, or a pass that is good for the entire festival. In either case you are given a souvenir wine glass to be used to sample wine and a pouch that goes around your neck to hold the glass.There are over 200 wooden kiosks set up one, for each vineyard participating in the festival, with about a dozen dedicated to food. Most of the food venues are prepared food where you can buy sausages, sauerkraut, red cabbage, etc. and eat at large, family-style benches. But there are also a few stands where you can buy a variety of cheese, sliced meat, peppers, and olives and have a small picnic at one of the tables set up around the grounds.As you visit each stand you can ask for a sample of the wine, either a small, quarter sip or a larger half sip, generally ranging form 200 - 600 forints. If you find something you particularly like you can buy a full glass to take with you as you continue to stroll. You can also ask for just a taste of wine which will be given to you for free. And you will be able to purchase bottles of wine from each kiosk to take back with you, either single bottles or a sampler pack.The festival is very well organized. There are stands where you can trade you glass for a freshly washed one, places to replace a broken glass, continually cleaned bathrooms and a place to wash your hands. You can spend an afternoon sampling wine, leave the festival, then come back that night to continue with the added bonus of having the lighted city of Budapest below you.If you are visiting Budapest and find that the festival is going on, it is well worth a walk or bus ride up to the Castle District for a visit. The best day is the last one where there is the parade of wine-makers, and local folk singing and dancing. Or, like us, it would be worth planning a visit to Budapest to coincide with the entire festival."

This is the way to see Budapest. The battlements wind up and around through the cobble stone paths and we saw so many older folks walking uphill through the winding paths feeling sorry for themselves. We just wiz pass them on the bikes.Don't pay for a 2 way funicular ticket as you will walk to matthias church and probably walk down from there instead of walking back to the funicular as this walk will take you to the bridge near the Parliament which is on the other end of the castle and battlements."

Further along the top of the Hill is the Maygars church and the Fisherman's Bastion. To see everything you will need at least two days but excluding the museums you can explore the area in just one. Everything is walkable and this part of Budapest feels very different from the flatter, busier & more urban Pest part. Funicular railway tickets, which will take you all the way to the top, are about \u00a35 return and in 30C heat it's definitely worth it as the castle area is hilly and the attractions on a massive hill but you can walk up. Expect a queue and the inevitable slow ticket service. You can walk down at a leisurely pace and buy a single. This side of Budapest ( formally Buda before Buda and Pest became one city) is hilly and green and well worth a days visit if you're staying in the ( formally ) Pest part."

The architecture appears to be mainly 18 & 19th century with the majority of the medieval buildings in ruins, but this is clearly indicative of it's turbulent past.

We were there on a Surday of a Chocolate Festival on the Museum gounds. We just got lucky, I guess. We spent half a day there and had lucnh al fresco at a cafe there. Lucnh was the most expensive of our week ther. It was OK but nothing great. The highlight was tasting all the chocolate at the festival. Certainly a sight seers \"must\" if one is in Budapest"

Hiking up is not challenging, if you prefer you can ride Bus 16 (shuttle-like buses, tend to fill up) which you can catch in the Buda as well as the Pest side. The National Gallery is amazing and huge, one can easily stay there for a few days and not finish seeing all the exhibits. Better to visit when crowds diminish, that is starting September."

You can take the Funicular up if you cross at the Chain Bridge or hike up the excellent trails by crossing Elizabeth Bridge or Liberty Bridge. Visit the church and the Art Gallery on the hill.

The views of the city from here are also fantastic and an added bonus.Lot of photography options here no doubt and worth spending a couple of hours.

The district can be easily accessed using public transportation, various sets of stairs, taxi or car, however you will have to pay for parking. Although a popular tourist attraction, the very short ride funicular railway ride to castle hill doesn't warrant the long lines in my opinion. The area itself is free for visitors but the Matyas Church and Fishermen's Bastion have fees for access to some specific sites. The view of Pest from the bastion is amazing! There's plenty to eat and drink available but for quality fare rather than tourist items, head toward the north end of castle hill near the military museum. There are several quiet, sit-down restaurants there. At the quieter end of the district, have stroll and see the military museum itself. Small enough to keep it fun, brimming with history, and no crowds!"

Now if you are in Budapest, you cannot miss going to the Buda Castle hill area. situated right accross the river, sits the mighty castle up on a hill. you can take a bus to it or a better scenic option is taking the funicular. this will take you right to the castle. once there you can stroll around and take pictures. You will get to see some good views, gardens, architecture etc. The view of the river from the castle is also spectacular. Behind the castle is a place for snacks and drinks. In case you want to sharpen your archery skills, you will find an archery stall at the back area. For a few euros you get to shoot around 6 arrows with a bow. than as you move out of the castle area and walk out, you will come to a nice old bazaar, where you can buy a lot of souvenirs. A good shop to buy is owned by Zsigane Piroska. She will also give you a little bit of discount. Further down the street you arrive at the old church than fishermen's Bastion. Good place to walk around and enjoy the scenic view. a Good place to visit."

The Marriott and the Intercontinental Hotel next to it block most of the view to the other side of the river.Unless you have something to go to up there, I don't recommend going just for the views, there are a lot of better viewpoints around.I was surprised that the cafe at the top was really cheap, expected it to be really expensive because of a special location near tourist attractions."

Integration of the eras is evident in the color, type, and structure of the stone remnants.At the top, the grounds are extensive, lots of statues, a great art museum (Hungarian National Gallery), and truly awesome views. A really fine bronze statue of formidable soldier-King Savoyai Eugen (1663-1736), done by artist Rona Jozsef, was a reminder of the rugged type who fought the battles which shaped Budapest (and all of Europe).There's a cute little cafe not far from the Palace and it seems to be less impacted with crowds like one finds near the Fiherman's Bastion.Strolling near by, pedestrian traffic leads to Sandor Palace, built in 1806, and presently serves as the residence of the country's President."

The hill is full of interesting places to visit. the old royal palace is now the national art gallery and the terrace in front of it offers more great views over Pest but you do feel that every tourist in the city has had the same idea. You can walk along the pretty narrow streets and admire the colourful buildings as you make your way to the Fishermen's Bastion. This is a 19th century folly built to take advantage of the great views toward the Parliament building. It can be rather crowded with tourists all trying to take the perfect photo. To get away from the annoying throng just keep on wandering down the street, past the church and it becomes much quieter. There a few tourists but e buildings are still pretty. There is also the national archives building at the end of the street and near that the military museum. You can loop back a long equally quiet, pretty streets where you will pass several embassies. There are also small restaurants round here that are not too busy even at lunchtime.I would absolutely eco end a wander around the back streets of Castle Hill to get a flavour of Buda and to get away from the madding crowd."

We were in Budapest during 2015 Easter period and on the second day we planned to visit this after seeing Chain bridge and then zero point. We took Bus no 16 from the zero point, just crossing the chain bridge towards Buda side. However the bus originates from De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r near the yellow line metro station and going to Don\u00e1ti utca.There is a funicular service available from that point for going to top of the castle hill area, however that appeared too costly for us as the fare was 1400HUK for return where as the bus fare was 300HUK(as we took a block of 10 tickets)It took 15 mins to reach the top of the hill, stoppage named Dish Ter. We walked along the cobblestone streets and explored the area at our own pace. We visited Trinity Square, Matthias Church and Fishermen\u2019s Bastion . We took lots of photos from the area of river Danube, chain bridge and Parliament and then proceeded to other attractions."

I love to stroll the streets take in the views eat ice cream every few 100 m :). Stop at cafes and just relax. I don't recommend dining on castle hill except for lunch at Var Bistro a cafetiere style place with good food at a fair price. they have a amazing ice cream and coffee shop next to it also. I will warn travelers who have never been bring comfy shoes and be ready to do some stairs (Allot of stairs). You can get a taxi up and just run around the top but I feel you miss many neat shops and sights that way so I encourage you to walk it but please be prepared for it.

So it's no surprise that the highest part of the city, found in this corner of Buda, was the natural site for a defensive castle to be built. These days, the entire Castle Hill district is a tourist attraction in its own right and should not be missed. It's most well known for the Fisherman's Bastion with grand views of the Danube and Pest skyline, Matthias Church, and naturally the castle itself. But what I also enjoyed were the quiet streets that sometimes intersect at odd angles, as well as the old but well-maintained buildings that give the outskirts the air of a pleasant country town. I didn't stay till after sunset but it's seemed a lovely place to have dinner at one of the nicer restaurants.There are several ways to get to Castle Hill, the easiest of which is via the funicular located directly opposite Chain Bridge. I chose to take the route recommended by my guide book - M2 subway to Szell Kalman ter station before walking up Varfok St to the entrance to Castle Hill marked by the stone arched gateway that opened into Bescikapu ter. In reality, it was a little confusing finding the right road to follow after exiting the station and climbing the pedestrian steps as directional signs weren't very obvious, and I did resort to using a map app on my mobile phone to make sure I was going the right way. Climbing the slope in mid-summer was a rather hot slog; on hindsight, I should have taken the #16 bus and saved myself a lot of sweat. After visiting castle hill, I opted to descend via the scenic way by taking the funicular ride."

It was fun viewing the hill from the Danube, and we made 2 separate tour visits plus a taxi ride up to the Budapest Hilton that sits immediately behind Fishermen's Bastion and next door to the cathedral.

The area around the piazza and the Fishermans Bastion within the castle walls is visually interesting. Unfortunately, St Matthias is not on the Budapest card free list, so you have to pay - but not a lot. Transport back down was a problem. We got on a 16a Bus when we needed a 16 - both go from the same stop. This took us down the hill and round to the wrong side, so we had to wait for another 16a, to take us all the way back up again and then find a 16 to take us back down to the Szechenyi bridge."

The medieval district is here as well, we went early to avoid the tour buses. Can either take a ride up on the funiculer or there as multiple climbing stairs if don't want to pay. The church is located here, also they have plenty of places to eat if need a refreshment why you are there."

There is a formal guard at each entrance, and a regular schedule changing of the guard (I think hourly, but definitely at 11:00 am) which is fun to watch with all the pomp and ceremony. The historic structures are interesting, and the view over the Danube and Pest is certainly worth it. If not on a tour, you can take the #16 bus to the top of the hill (steep walk otherwise), or you can stop at the bridge below and take the funicular to the top of the hill (a pricey option). If you walk around the Danube side of the old castle, you can see the medieval foundations and walls which still lie beneath the modern structure. Be sure to pause and take in the several fountains, as they are charming (especially the hunting scene with 3 very intense hunting dogs - if you like dogs, that is).."

Take a walk up to this side of the river for amazing views of the castle district and also the views of budapest and the view of the other side of the Danube. The steps up are steep but you need some good exercise on holidays to fight off the beers and food etc. The castle area is touristy but that's normal. You can't really visit much inside the castle either but it's all good fun. The view over the bridge and to the Parliament on the other side of the river is fantastic. You can take the funicular up the hill for a price if you cant walk up."

About half way up the first section, we noticed this metal structure on the right hand side (like maybe it took you to a museum or something). There was an elevator...so we took it and popped out at the top and saved us the long walk. We saw lots of gorgeous views, a bicycle exhibition of trick cycling, the changing of the guard, the prison that \"Dracula\" was kept in (you can climb down to the lambrinth and see enough without actually having to take the paid tour), Matthias church, etc. As we only had a few hours, so then walked down the hill, crossed over the bridge near the island, saw the Parliament building and the moving Shoes on the Danube monument. A wonderful way to spend an afternoon. We spent maybe a total of 3 hours roundtrip from our hotel, including tons of walking. If I would have had more time, it would have been nice to do it at a more relaxed pace and visiting/touring the actual buildings."

Best time to visit is possibly late afternoon. In the morning most of the tourist groups arrive so it's worth saving for a little later in the day. Taking the funicular railways is fun too.The views are spectacular and it's really unnecessary to spend money to go onto the Fisherman's Bastion when the views are just the same wherever you go. Also a word of advice, pick your footwear carefully for an excursion up here, you'll probably walk a lot further than you anticipated and there are a lot of cobble streets.We particularly enjoyed sitting in the shady beer garden opposite the St Matthias Church listening to a very talented couple on piano and violin playing everything from Hungarian folk tunes, through to operetta and show tunes. Surprisingly soothing. You can also get ham hocks, the ever present guylas and hungarian sausages in a bun, not to mention pastries etc,here if you're up for a snack to keep you from flagging.A note of caution, we had intended to have dinner on Castle Hill before returning to Pest but decided against it after being treated quite off-handedly and almost rudely by waiters at the Arany Hordo Restaurant, 9 Tarnok utca. We also paid more for a beer and glass of wine there than anywhere else during the whole of our visit although their meals didn't appear to be particularly expensive given their location. Buyer beware."

At the the top you can walk towards St Mathias and Fishermans Bastion which are not to be missed. We had a nice reasonable priced lunch in a self service restaurant before exploring the area. There are many interesting artisan shops and ice cream shops along the way. We spent the afternoon there enjoying a welcome seat and a glass of wine before hopping back on the bus back to Pest.

To begin with, the cable cart to the top was overpriced and the queues long, once on the top, although the views were interesting, the whole district seemed to be a trap to fleece tourists, which we had not encountered in other areas of the city. The tourist market sold the usual souvenirs, but the stallholders were friendly. Should I return, I will definitely give this district a miss."

You don't have to spend money here - you can just walk and enjoy. However, if you want to spend, there are plenty of museums, attractions, restaurants, and cocktail places along the route. Word of advice - pay for everything in Hungarian florents - if they offer to let you pay in Euro, it will be a poor exchange rate - and often cost a few euros extra rather than what the actual exchange rate is."

Some people walk the Chain Bridge over and ride the funicular but another option that we did was to call an uber and take it directly to the Hungarian National Gallery. It cost us under $4 US. I feel that the National Gallery is worth your while to view the 15th century winged altars and also learn about the realism painter Munkacsy who lived during the Impressionist era and was more famous than they were during the late 1800's.Walk to Matthias Church and buy your ticket to tour the beautifully ornate church. Make sure you go into the Lorento Chapel and learn the significance. When we were there, the Fisherman's Bastion was free. There are so many beautiful photo opportunities at the Fisherman's Bastion of the Pest side.We ate a wonderful lunch at 21 Magyar Vendeglo which is located a few short blocks from the Hilton Hotel. It is located at Fortuna Utca 21. They have the best weiner schnitzel.The three of us did pre book a wine tasting at the Faust Cellar. It is a small area under the Hilton Hotel. We thought the wines were good, not the best we had in Hungary. It is a fun experience but a person definitely needs to pre book.We did not go to the Hospital on the Rock."

Fantastic View absolutely must see panoramas from this hill, you get to see the beautiful parliament building and Budapest's many bridges and you get to watch as life goes on in the city from the calming look out areas. If you get the chance be sure to try the funicular at least once as it offer great views as well although it is just a short ride, there are sometimes fees to go up to the look out of Fishermen\u2019s Bastion however it is worth the small sum of roughly \u00a32, (although it was free when I visited), on top of the hill there are usually many markets and souvenir stands with many yummy things along the hill, there is also a free bus that can take you up and down from the hill and get you back in to the city although it is very busy so be aware. Buda Castle and its many courtyards host several festivals and events all over the year including an international wine festival, a beer festival, and a folk art festival. (I visited the folk art festival) which was great fun.Additionally if you wish to get around the city I highly recommend the public transport as it is SUPER easy to use such a breeze, you can purchase day/ week cards / even monthly should you need it. You can use for trams, buses and the metro, if you don't want to buy a ticket from the ticket office go find a BKK ticket machine where you can handily purchase tickets in your respective language. Additionally buses metro trams and all public transport have built in screen of up coming stops and conveniently announce where you can change for metros and different popular areas in English and Hungarian, so if you do plan on taking public transport it is all good.To sum it up excellent experience at this attraction."

Once you up keep an eye on your watch because every one hour there is the guard change in Sandor palace just next to the funicular.

Budapest is unusual in that it is a city of two very different halves: Buda which is the ancient castle are on the imposing hill (almost a mountain by some standards) on the Western side of the Danube and Pest which is on the basically flat plain on the East. This means that from high up on the Buda side you get a spectacular close up panorama of Pest. Budapest was a twin capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Hapsburgs made sure it had an impressive array of imperial buildings - it's not Vienna but it's still pretty impressive with an extraordinary Parliament House the match of the Palace of Westminster (not a great Parliament in terms of what was done inside but a great building). Anyway any tour of Budapest has to include the Buda Hill."

Ideal for a morning run (before all the people begin to arrive) and wonderful adventure for you and your significant other to walk and explore. You can ride the funicular up if you aren't up for the ascent--but it really is not nearly as taxing as it may look. Beautiful statues, monuments, governmental buildings adorn this entire area. The view across the river to the Parliament Building and of the Danube River is stunning! It's all free and a great way to burn off a few calories. Don't miss out on this experience."

I was able to view traditional works at a leisurely pace because it was not overcrowded.The food service within was also a pleasant surprise, a contrast to the \"gotcha\" attitude of New York museums The changing of the guard at the Presidential Palace was an unexpected surprise.

The Buda Castle and the fortified old town are strategically located on the top of Buda hill; to reach it, I recommend to go through the Chain bridge and take the funicular (Budavari Siklo), just in front of it. By spending 1100 Ft (about 3.50 Euro) for a one-way ticket (1700 Ft, in case you choose the two-ways ticket), you can reach the square in front of the Castle entry gate.The Castle complex is very huge and many architectural styles (Medieval, Baroque, Modernist) can be noted, since it developed through six centuries, starting from the XIV one.We\u2019ve been there on 1st of January, and Castle and all the annexed museums were closed; nevertheless, we\u2019ve enjoyed anyway the walking paths running around the Castle, getting the chance to delight our eyes with the wonderful views of river Danube and Pest town. The very sunny day (even if freezing) played a quite important role in enjoying our panoramic walking.An arcade passage leads to the Castle backyard, where the Matthias fountain (probably the most photographed subject of the palace) can be found; there, a hunting scene is represented with great realism. Very huge and wonderful is even the inner courtyard, which arcade internal entry sides are decorated by two roaring lions.From the wide backyard area, the old town can be reached through a short walk; several shops, bars and restaurants are there, hosted into the old restored colored houses.Going straight, you\u2019ll find the Matthias Church (it absolutely worth a visit) and adjacent Fisherman Bastion, which gives a view on Parliament and Pest new town.Whether you like to walk, climbing down to the Danube requires just 10 min; once down of the hill, we moved from Danube bank to the Parliament through the Margit bridge. Recommended."

We started out walking the Szechenyi Chain Bridge, then took the Funicular up to the top of the hill. Lots of photo opportunities to be had on this walk. We walked around the Hungarian National Gallery, but didn't go in. Make sure to check out the Matthias Fountain as it is beautiful and illustrates a nice story. There was no water running through the fountain most likely because it was December. Behind the Hungarian National Gallery, we enjoyed a Kurtos pastry from a little stand. Kurtoskalacs is a delicious dough wrapped around a wooden dowel and roasted over wood coals while being turned constantly. If you find them, during your travels, you must try one. They are so very good. Also, in this same area, we came upon a man dressed as a knight selling the opportunity to shoot a bow and arrow, a crossbow, or throw a spear for a nominal fee. My husband jumped at the chance to do this, even though \"tourist\" was written all over it. We had a great time, but I am apparently not a good marksman. My husband fared much better at this and came close to hitting a bullseye. You can also dress up as a king/queen and take a photo here, but we did not do this. We continued our walk and came to the Golden Eagle Pharmacy Museum. I had read that this was a great little museum and we were getting cold. We had an interesting, quick look around with a brochure explaining everything in English.We then searched out a recommended cafe called Retesvar from our Frommer's guidebook. It took us a while to find it, so look for the naked woman statue near the pharmacy museum and the cafe is right down the little avenue. We had some delicious cherry, apple cinnamon, and traditional poppyseed strudels (they call them retes). We also had a little savory pizza-like pastry with hungarian salami. We sat outside in the tunnel-thoroughfare with our strudels and cappuccinos covered in red blankets set out for their customers. The guidebook stated that this cafe makes the best strudel in all of Budapest. I am not sure about that since we had some great strudel, but they sure are delicious.We then went inside the Matthias Church and had a look around. Directly outside of the church is Fisherman's Bastion. Some of the terraced areas were roped off for unknown reasons, but there were plenty of other lookout points. We came upon this area right at dusk and it was nice to see the Pest side of the city start to light up. We continued walking through the area until we found the Hospital in the Rock. We had a bit of difficulty finding the stairs that lead down to the entrance because of some construction clutter. The tour was given in English after a brief movie and was very interesting. We had planned to taking the nice terraced walkway back down to the river to go over to the Pest side of the city, but after emerging from the Hospital in the Rock it was dark so we took the Funicular back down. We were so glad to have spent the day on Castle Hill. We saw a lot, but only scratched the surface. Another great day spent in Budapest."

We walked across Chain Bridge, got the Funnicular up the hill (good fun but be early to avoid queues), visited Fishermen's Bastion (great views) and the museum in the Castle (well worth a visit to learn more about the history of Budapest). The whole area had quite a different feel to Pest."

The section of the castle overlooking the river is pure fairy-tale and a photographers dream since as the sun moves light and shadows charge markedly. As for the rest of the area on the hill top it's a bit boring in the town area but the views can be spectacular on a clear day. There are also some beautiful buildings to explore in the old palace area."

We are all aware that the sights are spectacular in and around here - however I would like to add a few words about the dozens of small craft shops which abound one or two streets over from the main touristy 'drag'. I bought some lovely hand made ornaments - with a twist, original paintings and glasswear, at very realistic prices (although not cheap). Really gorgeous, almost Gormengasty in their difference. Keep up the good work all those of you who strive to make something a little different."

We took the steps and it wasn't that bad. Benches and flatter parts to help you catch your breath if needed.A must-see in Budapest."

The views over Pest are wonderful - especially from Fisherman's Bastion. Matthias Church is almost psychedelic inside and great to wander around. The oldest piece of sculpture in Budapest still in its original place is in here. The old streets of the town are clean and neat and filed with pretty buildings.BUT but but - it's all a repro! The area was devastated in 1944 -5 and only 2 of 200 buildings were still habitable afterwards. It has been recently \"restored\" and looks charming and clean and attractive."

The castle was started to be built after the Tatar invasion in 1241. It was taken (with a trick, without a siege) by the Turks in 1541. It was reconquered by the Hungarians with Austrian help in 1686. The next fights took place in 1848/49. The last siege was in 1945. The castle was (almost completely) rebuit and now houses several museums (the National Gallery, the Budapest History Museum, the National Sz\u00e9chenyi Library). I hope it remains as it is for a long time (hopefully the few remaining ruins will be rebulit). So besides the view of Budapest there are plenty of places to visit on Castle Hill (besides the mentioned museums Mathias Church and the Fishermen's Bastion, to mention a few)."

Seriously, this has to be the best location in Buda to get a great view of the Pest skyline!For all of you that already know that, here's what I have to add:******The Climb: Ok, not going to lie, it was a bit of a hike to get to the top. I want to encourage folks to do it! I went by myself, at about 10:00pm in the freeeeeezing cold (I'm not kidding). I crossed the chain bridge, had some awesome photos of Buda castle on the way. The uphill climb after you get off the bridge is a mixture of steps/incline, I'm a pretty fit person, and I was a tad bit winded by the time I got to the top. Takes about 10 minutes (at a good pace). **Tip for solo travelers, if you go at night, stick close to others that are going up as well, because the trail is a bit dark and surrounded by trees and nature. I probably would have been a bit freaked out if I had to do it alone (maybe I've seen one too many scary movies). But at the top, there will likely be castle guards and random other people, so fear not!*****Don't Forget: DO NOT JUST STAY AT THE CASTLE!! Venture around once up there! The view of the Parliament building is soooo much better if you walk down to the church (Matthias), climb the stairs...you will thank me (check the photos). There are also a bunch of cafe's, pubs and restaurants in the area, but depending on when you go, they may not be open...including the funicular (if you don't want to take the hike, you can take the funicular and cheat). Also, make sure to catch a glimpse of the castle wall that they preserved with the bullet holes in it from the war...it is easier to see (and find) during the day, but it can give you a little bit of insight into what the castle looked like prior to restoration. *****Verdict: To get those photos that will undoubtedly make everyone jealous, this is a must visit location on the Buda side when visiting the city. Don't let a little climb rain on your parade (don't even let rain, rain on your parade), it is absolutely worth it!!"

The tunnels themselves are around 1000 years old and as you would imagine are steeped in history (Dracula was imprisoned here). At first all seems fine, until you can't really see much and the temperature drops and the directional arrows get fewer. I am a grown adult who doesn't scare easily, but it took about an hour for my heart rate to slow after I made it out.Not for the faint hearted, but for 2000HUF (abut \u00a34 by our exchange rate), would say it's a MUST.

Our female tour guide spoke excellent English very clearly and definitely helped to make our visit so very informative and memorable."

Pest looks charming from up there and the atmosphere is great also. many statues, a restaurant and much more. If you walk across the hill you can get down just near the fairy's stop. We did that and took the fairy (included in travel cards) to the other side. From there, tram no. 2 will connect you to major metro lines.During night funicular doesn't work. It takes around 8 minutes walking up the hill (you the staircases for shortcuts). Don't miss it! If day view is great than night view will leave you speechless. Take your camera's tripod and you could take astonishing photos of the pest, the bridges, the ferris wheel and the Hungarian Parliament.Too bad there's no funicular available for those who cannot walk up hill."

We preferred to walk it up and I must say we loved it absolutely - the walk isn't tiring at all and can be easily done in 15 mins max - this is when we had a 5 year kid with us as well. There are roads right till the top and also stairs so whichever you prefer again.Atop the castle are a number of shops, restaurants, bar etc. apart from the museum, president's residence and not too far Mathias church as well.There are a number of look out points made atop the hill from where you can see the entire city of Budapest and click some of the most amazing pics of the Chain Bridge, Danube and the parliament building.A visit to the castle hill is an absolute must, once you are in the city and would easily keep you occupied and interested for at least 1/2 a day if not more."

My friend and I walked for miles on a high walkway that afforded a view into Buda on one side and a veritable parade of the most intoxicating of homes on the other side.

Hike up early, enjoy the views before the sun is baking. While the sun beats down, explore the labyrinth and other indoor sights; have lunch. Wander the streets at a relaxed pace, have a coffee or ice cream. If you want to enjoy sunset up here, perhaps walk up after lunch instead. Must-see, especially if it's your first time in Budapest."

You can climb the hill a number of ways, there's a Funicular railway at the end of the Chain Bridge, or you can walk up the architectural wonder called the Fisherman's Bastion. There are perfect views across the Danube from the Bastion. There are a number of top rate tourist attractions once you are on the hill. At one end St Matthias Church, at the other, the green dome of Buda Castle. The Castle houses the Hungarian National Gallery and the Historical Museum. If you have a Budapest card you can save on entry to both of these. Between the Church & Castle is a large lawn and some shattered remains of buildings obliterated in WW2.

If you have any sense of photography, you could spend hours her alone, taking picture after picture. I spent several hours just exploring, and didn't enter the art museum. That was a factor of time. Between the castle, the church and the town, it was a full visit just to explore on foot. Make sure you take the funicular at least one way. It's worth the ride."

Plenty to photograph between buildings and statues. There is a cable car which runs from the river side too but it comes at quite a cost. It offers some mazing views over the river and the city of Buda. There are quite a few places to grab a coffee and cake, we stopped off at Korona Kavehaz and had some great strudel with coffee."

The first day I walked the path to the top after seeing the huge lineup for the Funicular, the next time I went with my partner on the Hop On Hop Off Bus (great choice). I was told there were 2 options for walking up...one was steps, the other a path. I chose the path as I have joint issues, but found after the first small section, it became steps also for much of the way. I would advise using sunscreen and a hat if walking, and a drink from the shops or vendors at the bottom. The good thing about walking it is you get view all the way which encourages you to go further. It is not well signed, so is easy to find you have followed a path which ends nowhere and you have to retrace your steps...also many places without handrails, especially on steps. Hopefully as they are doing more restoration work, rails will be included. Apart from the history and architecture, the views from the top are stunning and make it worth the climb. Amenities are a bit pricey in comparison to other places. There are cafes/restaurants at the top. You can also walk back down the hill a short distance to the fantastic Fisherman's Bastion area, and from there down the footpath to the bottom again."

To get here you just need to pass through the chain bridge, then you can wait on a long line and go up on the funicular or on the right side you can see some stairs with trees all over. After all the stairs just go 2 times left and you are in the castle, its about 15 minutes, so its way better if you dont want to way for the funicular. The views from the castle are very nice, you can see the bridge's, buildings, boats etc. A really good place to take a panoramic photo."

Most of the tours include a night trip as well and the views of the city lit up are breathtaking. ( TheThey also include a boat cruise as well, so it's really value for money."

The walk from the Chain bridge is easy - just up several flights of stairs to get to the palace and the Fishermen bastion. There was a lot of construction all around the hill at the time of our visit, so we probably did not have the best timing. The grandeur of the Castle hill is undeniable - the Matias church and the Fishermen bastion are one of the best Gothic style ensembles: the only building that is totally out of place is the modern Hilton hotel - it is truly inconsistent with the architecture around it and detracts greatly from the beauty of the whole Castle hill area."

It's less hard to walk up to than the Liberation Monument and the views stretch further down the Danube, allowing you to see the Parliament better for instance, whilst the whole complex has something for everyone. Food, drink, views, history, old winding streets and beautiful architecture, it even boasts an art gallery which, whilst not really for me, I have to say objectively makes the place even better. Simply, on every count, it's a must if you're in Budapest and, steeped in history as it is, is fundamental to understanding the city."

There are many brass sculptures to see most of which have a great sense of drama about them and not just memorials to long since dead and forgotten men.

We took the funicular after crossing the bridge. Round trip was about $7.50. It's pricey, but it was an experience (a very short one). As so many other reviewers have noted, the view from the courtyard is breathtaking. We spent several hours walking around the castle and museum area, but it was so lovely outside we didn't want to visit any of the museums. There are some very nice caf\u00e9s as you make the short walk to Matthias church. You can easily walk down the hill, take the funicular, or the 16 bus if you are heading back to Pest. Don't miss this on a sunny day. The views are great. There are also lots of public toilets in the area that have an admission charge of about $1. I used a couple of them and they were very clean."

Personally, i think the funicular does not worth the money because the funicular ride is less than 1 minute. If you happen to have a ticket for public transport, bus 16 will take you up the hill and stop right in front of the Fisherman Bastion. Walking up the hill took us only 10 minutes (to be fair, we were more like jogging than walking) and if you are travelling in a limited budget, walking is an ideal way to get up the hill. The view from the top of the hill is amazing. You will be able to see the Pest (eastern side of Danube). Watching Budapest from Castle Hill during night time is indescribable."

In fact if you walk around the town up there most of the old building have been there for generations and you can envision life back centuries. There are shops and restaurants in the village. The most exquisite sight though is from the overlook at the back of the castle.

Walking through a small village with restaurants and shops for tourists, you'll come to the church and Fisherman's Bastian and can look out over the Danube River, the Parliament Buildings, and much of Pest.

The view from here is great, and if you have the ability to take panorama shots on your camera/phone, this is the place to do it from for sure.I didn't visit the actual castle as I only had one day in Budapest, but it looks like an interesting place to visit if you have the time and interest. There were some souvenir stands right near the castle which sold typical souvenirs like postcards, magnets etc. Do not feel pressured to buy something that you see here, as there are many other souvenir shops as you walk further into the castle district, and some of the shops are much better priced than these stalls."

We would have liked to try the funicular but there was a long queue - and no point in waiting when we could go for free on the bus."

I would highly recommend taking the funicular to the top! The walk up is doable, but I would pay the small fee to take the ride up. My travelling companion and I did not do any of the tours in the castle, but just walking around was worth going. If you want souvenirs, the little \"market\" (like 10 stalls) behind the castle is good and CHEAP! If you're going to Budapest, it would be a shame to miss Castle Hill. I would also recommend going at night if possible, because the view of the city/bridges with all the lights on is gorgeous!"

Of course, you can take the funicular, that is another interesting, singular experience.I liked the view over the Danube and Budapest and the history surrounding the castle and its role in the second WW. You can still see bombs marks on the exterior walls.It is very touristic and therefore it has that kind of gazebos that make the place look cheap but I guess it is inevitable."

It can be overrun with tourists, but there is so much history here that it is worth going up to walk the streets and look at the buildings or to go one of many museums. Stop and have a coffee and something sweet at Ruszwurm which dates from 1827 and is not only charming, but has wonderful, in house pastry at reasonable prices. The views of the city are postcard perfect. If you want to get away from the crowds, walk along the fortress wall on the west side of the hill. It is a pleasant, peaceful walk where you can experience the area's feeling without the crowds."

The area has many old buildings and narrow streets and includes many of the key historic sites of Budapest. The views from the Castle over the Danube and city are fantastic. The Castle itself is an important art gallery. The area is naturally very popular with visitors and can be very busy with large coach parties arriving constantly.

The views of the Pest side were unbelievably beautiful (both day and night), and the castle area itself was quaint and picturesque. The streets were quiet, with well-maintained houses, restaurants, and other buildings. The best stuff was located right together: St. Matthias Church, Fishermen's Bastion, and the statue of St. Stephen. If you want to go on the upper rampart of the Bastion, however, you will need to buy a ticket at the church cashier's booth across the street. (I do not know the price, as we went up there at night after the ticket-taker had left.) You should definitely be there at night! All the main structures of the city are illuminated and beautiful to see: parliament, bridges, St. Stephen's basilica, Gellert Hill, St. Matthias church, etc. There are a number of good-to-excellent and reasonably-priced restaurants in the castle area as well."

There is a path of stone steps (quite well-maintained although no banister) leading all the way up to the Palace, via a viewing platform - much better than queuing to get up the hill lift!Beware that (as with all of Budapest) many explanatory/information signs are just in Hungarian though, so you will need either a good guide book, or to take part in a walking tour, if you want to know more about what you see.Also, if you're travelling on a budget, I'd recommend bringing a picnic (preferably from an eatery in Pest before you cross the Danube), as *everything* is way more expensive in the castle district - easily double the price for the same food/drink."

The Castle District (Verhegy) is an important historical location upon the top of Castle Hill on the Buda side of the Danube River. There are many attractions found here that make this an area well worth spending a few hours if not the better part of a day during trips to Budapest. Most notably Buda Castle, also referred to as the Royal Palace can be found upon the hill, looking down upon the city and the Danube River. Here you can visit the very good Hungarian National Gallery, Bratislava History Museum and nice grounds surrounding the palace building. Nearby is the Sandor Palace where you can watch the changing of the guards. Further into the Castle District, you will find the very good St. Matthias Church and Fisherman's Bastion, both being amongst our favourite attractions in the city. Many minor attractions, restaurants and cafes can be found and explored atop Castle Hill as well. We enjoyed seeing the Vienna Gate, the ruins of St. Mary Magdalene church as well as the medieval streets lined with colourful buildings and houses. Historic Cafes like Ruszworm Cafe, found near St. Matthias Church, are also worth visiting and you can find souvenir and craft shops throughout the area, including a line of vendor stalls near the Royal Palace. You can ascend Castle Hill via a funicular near the Royal Palace or by simply walking the series of paved footpaths nearby. It is a leisurely approach up the hill and isn't particularly taxing on your legs. A similar uphill approach allows you to access the hill via the Fisherman's Bastion area, this is a nice way to enter the Castle District if you want to start your visit at or near St. Matthias Church. Outstanding views of the city are afforded visitors from several places on Castle Hill. We most enjoyed those found from right in front of the Royal Palace as well as at Fisherman's Bastion. Overall, we enjoyed our time in Castle District during our recent trip to Budapest and would purposely revisit to explore the area further and to revisit some of the attractions here. It is highly recommendable for first-time visitors to spend some time in this area of the city when visiting Budapest."

It is an easy and picturesque walk -- all downhill -- that gives you a different vantage point for Parliament and the Chain Bridge as well as for sights looking back up the Hill. There is no cost for the walk. There are a few stepped areas, so it would be problematic for strollers or wheelchairs. If you have a few minutes give it a try. From the base of the Hill its an easy walk across Chain Bridge to Pest."

Lots of cafes with views here. Beware paying the fee of a few dollars to walk up on to the wall though because if you head to the parliament end you can walk up for free! We then walked down stopping to walk over the Vienna gate and old city wall...down lots of stairs to the river and return...this took about 3 hours with stop at Central Market for a snack.

One year I lived just below Budavar and several times a week would walk up the steps to the Var--often for a Kremest at Ruszwurm, where it was the best. My first visit to the Var was marred by many loud tourists. I left. But this year they were quieter--even the tourist groups were quiet. I liked best wandering around, looking at door knobs and windows, at the design of doors, of the careful incorporation into newer structures of very old elements. Restaurants here are expensive but there is a small supermarket where you can get sandwiches, at Disz t\u00e9r I think. Go inside the Mattias templom to see the incredible imaginative paint work everywhere.... There are cheap souveniers and expensive ones. If you have the time, come more than once."

A funicular railway can take you to the top, for a fee of around 1100HUF (as of March 2014), or you can do as I did and go on foot, a relatively light 5 minute climb up a footpath that gently winds its way up the hill."

There are plenty of kitsch craft stalls if you're into that kind of thing, and even I'm happy to stroll around them when the sun is out and I'm on holiday. The castle itself has been destroyed by war and rebuilt many times, so don't expect a medieval castle.

There is the gallery too but we did not do this so cannot commment we just enjoyed the outside scenery and walking around the area. There are public toilets at the top and in the gallery cafe which you need to pay to use."

We enjoyed two other museums.The views from up there are lovely, even on a cold grey day, there is plenty of atmosphere.First visit: we took the vernicular up. Actually - it isn't that much of a climb, and I would say that you could walk up one of the routes and enjoy it. My guideline is this: if you normally would not want to climb four flights, then take the vernicular up. It is higher than four flights, but that's just my guideline.Second visit: we walked up, and down.Note that the bus/tram/metro tickets don't work for the vernicular. You buy them separately from the cashier at the vernicular entrance. Round trip is cheaper than two one-way tickets."

The other musem interiors are more intact and this is a history of Budapest Museum and the artifacts are splendid and the interiors more original.

There are narrow winding streets lined with medieval buildings that are now souvenir shops. On our second visit, my husband and I were going to see the interior of the castle but on the castle grounds, they had a wine tasting festival. We bought tickets for this and were pleasantly surprised at how delicious Hungarian red wines are. Their cabernets were full bodied with very smooth tannins. We could not finish all the booths as we were beginning to feel our wine. We wanted to buy a case of some of their wines but none of the wineries exported their red wines. The few that did export to the States only exported sweet white wines. So, we just bought 4 bottles and carried those in our luggage for the rest of the trip They also had some food stalls here and they sold Hungarian food. One was like a pizza only done Hungarian style. It was delicious. I would recommend spending 1 full day here or 2 full days depending on how much exploration you want to do."

As the Parliament is under construction, this view is the best you'll get and it's a pretty impressive building!As for the castle itself and the church, I didn't get inside to see them but it's a beautiful area with lots of options for eating and drinking and getting there is pretty easy via funicular, bus or just walking which is what I opted to do! My suggestion would be that, this time of year (winter), you venture up around 3pm so you have the daylight view but then also have a night view of the city below after 4pm...I regretted not being up here to see any of the night views!"

Matthias Church is well-worth a visit if only for the beautiful stained glass windows (1000 HUF admission fee).

The only authentic part of the area is the church of st mathias which has some very nice frescos and a pretty interior worth visiting. That is probably the only paid attraction I would spend and find it worthwhile. Te other attractions are way too inauthentic and not worth the admission fees as there are much better museums outside of Budapest that are a few hours away by train.

As with the rest of the city, there are food and drink vendors catering for every price and taste. One of the highlights of this great city, and access via the funicular highly recommended."

We rode up on the funicular, which was a great way to see the river and the city. It's cheap and right at the base of the hill. Once we got to the top we were treated to great views and broad, clean squares and streets. This area of town is scrubbed clean and so pretty and well-preserved. Lots of great restaurants in the area and on an October evening, not a lot of crowds. After dinner we wandered around some more, checking out the huge church and the Fisherman's Bastion and just gazing out across the Danube at the buildings lit up and sparkling below. So glad we didn't wait till daylight to treat ourselves to this sight."

We saw an exhibit of Chagall's work while there recently and found the exhibit space to be gorgeous. All museums should be that accommodating! The space was large and allowed even a crowd of people to view the works as they deserve to be viewed. Don't miss the pastry shop/cafe on the street leading to Matthias Church!

The use of stone similar to that lining most of Washington, DC's buildings, gives a fresh look to historic buildings and the crenellated fortifications that encircled this part of Buda. The alliance of Church and State is everywhere evident and the omnipresent cobblestoned streets lend not only authenticity but a literal feel to the ambience. The old merges with the new in hotels, restaurants and residences and, if you're lucky, you'll get a glimpse of ultra-private courtyards should the stout doors be opened momentarily. In short, the combination of views and history make this an essential part of your Budapest experience."

In my opinion, it is better to take the funicular because you can relax a bit while enjoying the beautiful views of Budapest as you ride to the top of the hill. Once at the top of the hill, plan to spend a bit of time taking in the different views of the city and taking photos!"

No doubt it is the most beautiful area of the whole city, and for the artistic beauty to the magical panorama that you have the whole city of Budapest.It's a ''must'' getting here and visit this beautiful castle and its surroundings.Reaching it is easy and simple, there are two options, the first one is the faster and easier through the funicular that takes tourists directly up the hill in a short time, the second one (my choice) is following the path on foot, definitely more tiring but I love to struggle when I travel and then passes everything in the background.The journey takes about 10 minutes.Once you get over the show is nothing short of exciting."

It s a wide compound with the Castle, Matthias Church, Fisherman's Bastion and the sculpture of the majestic Turul bird all within walking distance. Great scenic photography opportunities everywhere and there are some stalls selling Hungarian souvenirs as well. In particular, we enjoyed taking pictures of Buda and Pest from the Fisherman's Bastion. The hilly side is Buda scenery, the flat side is Pest, separated by the Danube river. We were there on 11 June 2013 and because the flooding waters have not totally subsided, the Danube river cruises were cancelled. However, that did not spoil our trip there as the walking views were just as captivating."

Every detail was meticulous, including the restoration of fabrics in the Oratory. How sad that so much was razed to the ground during the war, but how wonderful that so much throughout Budapest has been restored to its former glory. How resilient the Hungarian people have had to be throughout its turbulent history. At the Fishermans Bastion we were treated to an impromptu violin performance by two elderly local men, clearly enjoying making their music. What a wonderful treat.We were able to take the number 16 bus from the church area to Pest - me travelling free as an EU senior citizen! ( I don't even get this privilege at home)"

Given how much we'd been walking and how tired our feet, knees, backs were we decided to start out with the taxi ride up and save our energy and muscles for the walk around the top. It was a great decision.The castle was largely destroyed during WWII and the revolution, so it's a modern rebuild that gives you the feeling of what it looked like before. The white stones they used are lovely - it gives it all the feeling of the Lord of the Rings \"The White City\" (or Minas Tirith for fellow geeks) - the City of Kings. Very photogenic reconstructed area. The views from the castle area across to the Parliament and down the river and up the river are fabulous. There are fun souvenir shops, lots of restaurants, and lovely buildings everywhere. We walked the entire length of the hill in each direction and enjoyed all of it. We watched the guards at the top of the Funicular march and change positions. Very cool. We didn't go into the museum but we did enjoy the garden and walking around around it. We rode the Funicular down to save the impact on our knees of going downhill by foot. Then walked across the Chain Bridge and back to our hotel. We spent about 4 to 5 hours (including lunch break) enjoying the whole hilltop. Just delightful. Part of it reminded us of smaller and less commercial version of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. I took lots of photos of the lovely architecture, doors, etc. My husband had the macro/telephoto lens and got gorgeous shots of Pest side of the river as well as of the hilltop. It'll be fun combining and seeing what we got. The walking is mostly on cobblestones so wear appropriate foodwear.Overall: Don't miss this...it's a lovely outing. Allow time to really savor the feeling of the beautifully restored hilltop."

We took the railway because being British we luv these little seaside things! At the top were some soldiers on guard outside who looked very pleased when my daughter stood next to him for a piccy and did some changing of the guard display which was cute! the grounds are beautiful there is an amazing fountain and my son got to try some Medieval Sports,archery,spear chucking etc which he loved. We walked through some lovely cobbled streets where the buildings riddled with bullet holes were still standing along with areas where buildings had been levelled in the 2nd world war bombings! The restaurant opposite it was a lovely place and served a mean egg mayo baguette! You can use the toilet in the restaurant but if you are not eating there it costs 100 HUF .Photo opportunities are wonderful.You can then walk along to the Fishermen's Bastion .Well worth a visit!"

I can't explain it. It seems like you are looking at a postcard. We were lucky, because our Hotel was located right across the street from the church, part of the castle wall surrounded us. It is VERY touristy mind you. If you are not wanting there to be TONS of tourists your best bet it to get there around 7:00am or 11:00pm if you want to take pictures without other people being in the way. Any other time than that there will be BUS LOADS of tourists. This is one of the main attractions on the Buda side of the city. However, it's worth it to plan it out and try to make it at those ridiculous times. Castle Hill itself does not have an attraction fee. If you decided you want to go into the Castle itself or any of the castle's little buildings surrounding the castle you will have a fee. Also, if you are DRIVING there are fees to go up the hill, like a toll. There are no people manning these tolls. I believe you can pay with a credit card."

Food around the place is also more expensive than it should be. There seems to be a rejuvenation program going on which is half finished. It will be very nice when that is complete.

Nevertheless, actually going up to it is not that special of an experience, unless you're really into museums (which is what the castle now is). The views are nice, but the ones from the top of Gellert Hill are much better, and the surrounding shops and streets are much like anything else you'll find in the overpriced, touristy areas of a lot of European cities. And speaking of tourists: Castle Hill is definitely where you'll find them. It's overrun, even in off-months. However, I will admit that the interior of Matthias Church is kind of cool; that's the only reason I'm giving this hill three stars instead of two. When I saw the church, there was a lot of construction going on, but it was still pretty cool and I imagine once the construction is done it will look even cooler than it did then."

Castle Hill offers medieval buildings and Barogue cobblestone streets. There are great views of the city, the Danube, and surrounding countryside. This area was reduced to rubble during World War II and is now restored. While we were there we visited Matthias Catholic Church that we found worthwhile.We also got to watched the changing of the Guards at the offices of the President which was interesting and entertaining."

The colorful, restored buildings are beautiful, the cobblestone streets amazing, Matthias Church breathtaking. But the tour groups jockeying for position can make it a little overwhelming in the daytime, and it is filled with tourist trap shops and museums instead of the more authentic offerings you can find by roaming the Pest side of the city. If you're not with a tour group, try visiting early in the morning before the crowd descends, or else close to sunset for a spectacular view of the Parliament building. Nighttime also is a good time. The church and the Fishermen's Bastion are well-lit, and you can still get outstanding views."

I travelled in March 2012 and Budapest was covered in snow. This was lovely, however, walking or climbing to the top of the hill was quite something. Across Budapest the roads and pathways were kept in incredibly good order by the local authorities, however, the hill side steps to the top were quite dangerous. Furthermore, the walk is not easy going. I witnessed a few people taking breaks while others trudged up step after step. You will be glad to know you can get a cab, or a bus to the top of the hill which will be necessary if you find walking difficult."

It is basically like riding a street car in San Fran, you have to do it. We bought a one way ticket and walked down, which is what I would recommend. At the top you can get your photo taken with some Buckingham Palace style soldiers. Buda Castle is to the left, which is a museum now. The area in front of it has good views of Pest. To the right of the funicular is everything else. The only real things to do is the Cathedral and the Fisherman's Bastion. The Cathedral was being refurbished when we where there, which means you cannot see much of the insides, but it is a cool one. All the insides are painted in a way I have not seen in other European Cathedrals. Fisherman's Bastion is just a castle looking structures with good views of the Parliament. The walk down is not very tough, takes about 5 mins. Overall, I would not spend more than 2.5 hours here, but it is worth seeing."

Other reviewers have told you how to get there by public transport. The Funicular railway often does not run and when it does the queues can be very long. I prefer to walk, to the left of the Funicular there is a path which winds it's way up to the top. Periodically take a break and look around, plenty of spots for interesting pictures, especially on the bridge that crosses the Funicular, if you time it right you can get the upwards and downwards cars in the same pictures. If you have time you should visit the historic Ruszwurm Confectionery at Szenth\u00e1roms\u00e1g u. 7. for a coffee and a cake. This has been open since 1827, has survived 2 sieges and the Russian invasion in the 1950s. Inside is cozy and the cakes are not for healthy eaters ;-) otherwise there are other tourist cafes around but they are not as classy. If you are at all interested in Military History the War Museum is a must, but when i visited 2 years ago very few of the displays have English descriptions. Even so it took me two hours to walk round, which bored my Hungarian girlfriend rigid, but a coffee and cake at Russwurm fixed that. The display about the defeat of the Hungarian 2nd Army at Stalingrad I found very moving. However she loved the Budapest Telephone Museum at \u00dari utca. 49 as she was a telecoms engineer and helped modernise the telecoms infrastructure after Communism finished. If you want to see \"picture postcard\" Budapest, this, and the Fisheman's bastion are a must. But the real history, in my opinion, is to be found in the old Jewish quarter around Dob Utca in Pest where the buildings are mostly unrestored. But that is another story."

From the Palace's terasse you can enjoy amazing views of Pest dominated by Parliament, Danube and its bridges. Don't miss it! What I also very much enjoyed was a walk on the city walls encircling all the castle area. I especially liked the constrast between the views of the very plain Pest District (from the Palace terasses or from Fishermen fort) and the hills of Buda and Obuda you can see from the other side of the Castle hill. And one final recommendation : if you are not extremely tired, there's no need to take the funicular, it is rather easy to climb on top of the hill enjoying the changing panoramas as you get higher..(and the ticket is anyway quite expensive for the two minutes you'll actually spend in the funicular)."

The castle is worth it and the overcity-view too. There's a little market and some restaurants. After all it was worth it. Personally I think this experience is best in summer or when it's snowy."

The view may be a little impeded but the castle itself and the lights of Pest are unbelievable - some of the nicest scenery you will see."

Some might prefer the Citadella view of the city but we disagree. We used the funicular to climb and the price was around \u00a33 (one way). The price goes down if you buy the return ticket at the same time but we decided to go up by funicular and down on foot.Traveling by funicular was the beginning of our picturesque experience. We reached the top quite fast and started enjoying our view of the city right here. It's a shame the funicular doesn't have bigger windows to enrich the experience but it was quite nice anyway.When you reach the top you have the Royal Palace at your left side. The building is very nice and inside you have museums and a library. I wouldn't recommend the Budapest History Museum though. It's not expensive (less than \u00a35) but it's not captivating and has little information in English. I'll write another review for this one.Along the way you can enjoy the streets, buildings and walls along with the stalls with souvenirs.You'll reach a point where you have a nice view over the city, specially over the Pest side, including the Parliament which is a magnificent building.In this area I also recommend you to visit the beautiful Matthias Church. It's amazing!Have a drink in Hal\u00e1szb\u00e1stya and enjoy the view. Quite romantic and excellent to read!It's likely you'll spend a while here so if you need to go to the bathroom along the way there's some but you'll have to pay a small fee. It's so small (around \u00a30,30) that want hurt you. The other option is to have a meal or a coffee in one of the cafes or restaurants around.Don't miss it when in Budapest!"

Fishermans bastion in impressive and the views are awesome but you can save money by walking to other parts of the wall. The architecture is varied and buildings being restored. The Hilton hotel is an eyesore and should be pulled down. There is an underground wine tasting bar but there needs to be more cafes, restraunts and shops to add some atomsphere.

We visited this area on our walking tour and were blown away by the cross-river view of Pest - the Parliament Building looking particularly splendid when illuminated at night. Ironically, this Buda side, which some regard as more upmarket than Pest actually has probably less to offer tourists and the cafes/restaurants seemed to be pricier, with no obvious added value.One venue that we visited which was quite interesting was the 'secret' hospital built into the underground limestone caves. A very interesting history that really began in WW2 but carried on into the Soviet era. It was closed for several decades but reopened earlier this century and turned into an unusual museum."

There are no shortage of icons on the Hill and indeed you could spend the better part of the day up there and not be bored. But the view down over Pest is pretty special on a clear day - and yes they do happen regularly in Budapest.There are lots of small restaurants serving food and snacks (sometimes at moderately inflated prices - but this is a tourist district) and no shortage of venues just to chill-out and relax!"

Also see the changing of the guard outside the President's residence (hats aren't as good as ours), don't forget to read up the historical notes on the bit they're excavating and renovating on the screens and boards. Their is a small market for souvenirs on the approach. We ate at the red coloured restaurant about 150 m from the castle and also the cafe on the corner about 100 m opposite and ate local food.

We used the Rick Steves tour in his Budapest guide book to tour the area and found it really interesting. I don't think we would have got nearly as much out of just wandering around on our own.Funicular was fun. Views were amazing. While we were there a live band played in one of the courtyards to add to the ambience. The area around St Mathias cathedral and Fisherman's Bastion got quite busy with tour groups in the afternoon.We would recommend a visit to Castle Hill."

If you want to take the funicular up to the top you can get off the bus stop at the entrance to the tunnel right across the chain bridge. The funicular costs about 1500 Forint (approx. $7.50) per person round trip and really isn't worth it. Once you get to the center of Buda you will will able to walk around the old town and enjoy lots of sights. There is an open-air Hungarian craft market in the square at Disz ter. It is the only market we found would bargain and they have very nice local crafts. Walk up the hill on Tarnok Utca and follow the sidewalk to find an old look at Buda. There is a Pharmacy Museum that costs 500 forint (approx $2.50) and has a cool collection of historic pharma and an alchemist's lab. The address is Tarnok Utca 18 and is closed on Mondays. Keep going and you will run right into Matthias church and Holy Trinity Square which is the main square in old Buda. You can buy a ticket to tour the inside of the church across the square at the ticket booth embedded in the wall. Cost about 1500 forint per person. When we were there there is so much construction going on inside the church we couldn't see very much so we thought it wasn't really worth the costs. The best part is the architecture and the exterior anyway. Once you visit the church you can't miss Fisherman's Bastien. It is right behind the church. Don't pay extra to go upstairs, the views are the same at street level. Go all over the Bastien as it is beautiful and you can get some great pictures overlooking Pest and Parliament. You will see street performers here and local musicians. Once you see all that there is lots more depending on how tired you are. You can find the 1976 Hilton Hotel, Hospital in the Rock, and the remains of St. Mary Magdalene Church."

The Palace is not open for touring (at least as a palace; it does contain the Budapest History Museum is housed in the palace buildings), but it is impressive and the King Matthias fountain is nice. When we visited in June 2012, the Matthias Church was being renovated, so it was tough to see and appreciate. While there are great views of the Danube from Fisherman's Bastion, I was surprised that in the years since my last visit, a restaurant/cafe has been opened within the bastion, limiting options for viewing if you're not sitting in the cafe. It is for these reasons that I give Castle Hill an average - it's an important, significant sight and one should not miss it. At the same time, there are limitations as described and it is crowded especially in the mornings."

There are numerous museums -- all very worthwhile, the changing of the guards at the Presidential Palace (the parade, with the drummer, is like stepping back in time) and the underground abyrinths -- you can easily spend a day and the evening exploring the area. The sidestreets -- especially Fortuna Utca -- have some very good restaurants. Even though this is a touristy area, the food is very good. In fact, we had some really good pizza at one of the restaurants. One of my favorite pastry shops is the Ruszwurm -- enjoy some pastry, or ice cream with a chilled glass of champagne -- it's a nice way to end a day on Castle Hill."

Be prepared to walk, climb, enter various buildings and ramparts, stroll on boulevards, chat with artists, pick up trinkets, and pay heavily for all tourist attractions. Rising from the banks of a quietly flowing River Danube, the Castle is actually a collection of old structures and vast open spaces. The church with its intricate tile worked roof will enchant a photographer but the history minded tourist may like to know the large extent of restoration in this and other monuments. The old political regime did not necessarily wish to preserve the signs of the aristocratic empires and many buildings were damaged by neglect or the war. Walking along the wide parapets one notices the strategic look out points by which the Castle kept watch over the bend in the river. Tourists today get a panoramic view of Budapest from here. Pretty restaurants open up in the summer so you can chat and take in the views over Hungarian snacks and beer. Even if you don\u2019t have the time to visit other sites in Budapest, you must go to Castle Hill."

It was very interesting to visit a museum to see artwork that I had never encountered in print before. My experience tells me that most art history and humanities courses completely neglect Central Europe in favor of Western Europe. I completely enjoyed the insights I got into Hungarian history and culture through the art. Also this museum has an extensive and wonderful collection of medieval altar pieces that are a joy to view.Also on Castle Hill, of course, are many other sights: Saint Mattias, the Fishermen's Bastion, and the 18th and 19th century \"neighborhoods.\" There are many souvenir shops up there; it's a popular tourist attraction."

We got up there too late to go into the church, but it looks spectacular. We took the cable car up the hill, and there is a way to do it with your subway ticket so it doesn't cost extra. You can also walk up the hill, but I understand it is somewhat steep. The good thing about going later in the day is that you get to see the city from above in the twilight. It was quite lovely. If you have the time, I'd say this was definitely worth it."

After seeing the trolleys go up the Hill and climbing up the steps to the first look-out point, we decided to take a path off to the left side of the hill and just started walking and climbing and had no idea where we will end. There were no tourists around; however, there was a local family (3 persons) ahead of us that we lost somewhere or perhaps they lost us. However, it was a scenic route with trees and foliage on one side and the residential apartment buildings on another. Castle Hill almost reminds me of Prague Castle though has a different charm with the little nooks and crannies with the unexpected view or a dead-end road. I like the mixture of the old and the new architecture. Well worth the trek up the hill!"

Do allow plenty of time for this area dont rush as there s loads of little back streets and corners to turn and find amazing eateries . Arrive hungrey and leave plenty of space for checking out all the cafes and resturants .Again you ll get all the direction s on your guide book which you can buy before hand where you live or buy there in Budapest . I suggest doing some homework before hand and get your bearings and decide before what you want to get out of Budapest . Its such a rich and diverse landscape that initially you ll be a little awe struck and may be like a child in a sweet shop. Enjoy"

The hill and the surrounding neighborhoods afford a gorgeous view of both Buda and Pest, and strolling the tree lined avenues along the wall, or the city winding streets that make up this part of the city, is relaxing and allows visitors to soak up the atmosphere of this part of the city which is one of the oldest parts of the city. The trip is not complete with a visit to the Mary Magdalene tower which is all that remains of the Church of Mary Magdalene which once sat on site but was destroyed in WWII. From the Castle Hill area it is an easy downhill walk through the winding streets and stairways of Buda to reach the Moscow Square and the main tram line (4/6)."

There are some fine sculptures, especially in the backyard. But the main attraction is the view of the river and the part of Pest. Next to the palace the little streets provide an opportunity of a gastronomic adventure"

Reached either by bus, stairways or the funicular from near the west side of the Chain Bridge, old Buda is well worth a visit, despite having been rebuilt almost from the ground up after WWII.There are several charming souvenir stalls and many gift shops in the area as well as important museums, notable the Hungarian National (Art) Gallery in the old Royal Palace. Also there are plenty of cafes and restaurants in the three or four parallel streets which run along the ridge of the hill. We liked the restaurant called Speiz.The Fisherman's Bastion (rather like Sacre Coeur in Paris, but on a tiny scale) is perhaps over-rated as a view point since there are slightly better viewpoints in front of the Hungarian National Gallery.The St Matthias church is also modern, but built in an old style with typical coloured ceramic tiles on its roof. If you are there at the right time, you can see the 'changing of the guard' outside the Presidential Palace, just by the top of the funicular."

The architecture is amazing, the statues are stunning (and I am usually unimpressed by statues), the atmosphere is great and you can choose between the crowded areas and more secluded streets. I wandered around for a few hours and saw the Castle itself, the Labirinth, the Mathias Church, the Fishermen's Bastion and the lovely streets and houses in the area. The view from the top alone is worth the trip."

Take a stroll around the market and go wine tasting if you can!

There is also the ancient St. Matthias church with its frilly Neo-Gothic spire and the Plague Column beside the church with the fairytale like Fisherman's Bastion on the other side of the church. The views of the city across the Danube from Castle Hill are breath-taking and had me taking many pictures.One can spend the better part of a day on Castle Hill.

Skip the tour of the wine cellar unless you have a high level of interest and knowledge of winemaking. The Matthias church was closed to the public because of a wedding, but was still a nice view.

It's not as crowded as during the day and the view with the Parliament building and chain bridge lights reflecting in the Danube's water is great!I'd stay away from the Furnicular, though unless you're really short on time or have restricted mobility. It's much more interesting to take a walk down the stairs near Fishermen's Bastion - as for going up, if you don't feel like walking you can just take the \"Varbusz\" (16, 16A). The bus stop for this route is across Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r metro stop. (Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n square, formerly known as Moszkva t\u00e9r).

The architecture is mostly a re-make of the 18th century styles recreated after WWII. The Halaszbastya restaurant in the Fishermen's Bastion section of Castle Hill was the most romantic and expensive place we ate in. The restaurant overlooked the Danube with the Pest side of the city beyond. The food was remarkedly good. It didn't have to be because we would have paid just to sit and look at the scenery. It even had a three piece combo playing gypsy music! On the other hand, a place to avoid was the Pest Buda restaurant on Fortuna Utca. It was a rip off."

Alot of people go to see the Palace, St Mathias Church and Fisherman's Bastion all of which are very impressive and you are only scratching the surface of all the attractions there are to see. It is like a small village up there with several cobbled streets with nice restaurants and pubs.It was quite busy with lot's of tour buses and I imagine in Summer some people would be put off as it is to busy. However, if you wander a couple of streets away from the major tourist sites it is not busy at all.We spent two full day's there and enjoyed every minute of it."

Be sure to take time and walk the entire area, to get the best impressions of the buildings and community. St Mathias Catheral is excellent. Fisherman's Bastillion is good also. Take time to relax and have a drink while watching the Danube."

            "review": "Great view but too many daytrippers...... We got the funicular up to the castle district and it was a pretty speedy journey. At the top, we simply walked around, checking out the atmosphere. The buildings were pretty impressive but, because we had little time, we weren't able to go inside any of them apart from the Matthias Church and the Hilton hotel.There are magnificent views from both sides of the castle district so it's well worth going up there. However, I would choose the timing of your visit very carefully. We went about 11'ish to discover the area, especially around St Matthias Church, totally inundated with daytrippers off the river cruise boats. Fortunately most people respected the silence within the church itself which was a joy and a pleasure to behold. A very stunning building and well worth a visit. We also popped into the Hilton because of rave reviews we'd read - it's OK, pretty modern, with great views from the restaurant which was closed for a special event. Rather than take the funicular, we walked down the stairs (located by the toilets near to the church) - and it was a very pleasant walk, discovering parts of Buda which normally the daytrippers wouldn't get to see."

The whole area was far more gorgeous than we were expecting. The Palace area is breathtaking - imposing buildings, loveley fountain and beautifull gardens. The Old town area (which - like all of the area - was actually rebult after WW2) is delightfull and manages a real medieval feel. We simply hadn't allocated enough time to see the whole place and expected to spend an hour or two here - it was a bright warm sunny day and we spent 4 ! View down to the Parlaiment building is impressive and indeed the view of the whole city is good.The only caveat is the cafes. We had a small coke / coffee and 2 small cakes - almost \u00a320 ! Loads of extras loaded on already hefty basics so its possibly wise to eat elsewhere !"

If you're a tourist this is one of the main places to go. We enjoyed walking around looking at the different buildings, the view over the Danube and having a couple refreshment stops at the outside cafes. We walked down the hill and enjoyed seeing the Funicular and our walk accross the Chain Bridge back to the Pest side."

            "review": "A Very Picturesque Area - Filled With Character. The whole area of castle hill is a very picturesque with things to see at every turn; For a wheelchair user it is a little difficult as there are so many cobbles and some of the paths/roads are not well maintained so easy to get stuck in ruts or divets. The area near the castle (Royal Palace - National Gallary & museum) is the most difficult to navigate, but does offer some lovely views and some beautiful architecture too. We attempted to go to the museum, however we entered the building and saw, to our left a large flight of steps and although there were several staff watching us, none came to offer advice or help; we decided that we wouldnt bother and left, so if you need access advice try getting in touch direct in advance.The funicular is accessable and either wheelchair user or carer (not sure which) does not pay. We were there at lunch time and saw the changing of the guard which took place at the building to the right as you come out of the funicular station; this was ceremoniously preceeded by a bugle call. Worth it if you are around the area at lunchtime.There are some stalls selling souvineers (quite expensive for what they are) along there also, but this is one of the most cobbly bump bits in that area, and the stalls occupy a little area of smooth path, so it is worth having a look to get some releif from the cobbles for you and your assistant.There are lots of lovely little shops, cafes, etc, but most are either up or down a few steps and with narrow entrances making access difficult.Up at the other end of the Hill is the Fishermans bastion (see seperate review) and Matthias Church, the area between these areas is slightly up hill but not a problem, but the area around fishermans bastion becomes cobbly again, although not as difficult to navigate as that at the palace area.It was a nice area, very picturesque, and if you are not staying in that area allow poss 3 hours to do it all. There are toilets in a few places but I did not see any accesable toilets, however there are accessable toilets in the lobby of the Hilton hotel, so maybe just head there."

It's really one of the nicest spots in Budapest and a must-see for anyone visiting. However, if you are thinking of taking the funicular to get up the hill, be sure to check your change properly before taking it in your hands. We were not given the right amount of change, and when we pointed this out to the cashier, she got angry, repeated the amount the tickets cost, and when she flipped the rotating tray back to us, there were two additional coins there. Her rudeness was also not appreciated, because my sister was very politely and gently saying that the change was too little, in no way was she aggressive, and the lady probably thought she was an easy target. It may not be a large amount of money (tiny, compared to the amount we were overcharged by a taxi at Castle Hill) but I really hate people who try to take advantage of tourists."

It would be more appropriate to call this review \"The Castle District\", as it is known in Budapest.You can take the Varhegy bus from Moszkva ter or the furnicular railway by the Chain Bridge. I normally walk up. No matter how many times we go, I can always find something new to look at. There are the beautiful old houses, posh cake-shops and wine cellars and of course the Castle itself. The Hungarian National Library, the magnificent Matthias Chrurch and the National Gallery can be found here. Occasionally they have wine festivals here as well. There are even archeological sites around.The view from the Castle overlooking the Danube is amazing. Always reminds me of my favourite poem \"... as if flowing from my heart, the Danube was murky, wise and grand.\""

You can also walk up and enter the castle grounds this way. There are also a lot of statues there and the Matthias Church, but this was under renovations when we went. There isn't much to see on the north side of the grounds, because the houses are still inhabited! On the south side, there is the old Royal Palace, which is now converted into two museums. Really nice grounds and really good funnel cake!!"

It was a great walk and there were some neat stone areas along the way (be careful not to fall, there are no guardrails there!). The castle itself is now a museum and we didn't actually go in it, but we did walk around and enjoy the fountains, statues, and beautiful buildings. Once at the top we walked through a main archway and to the right where there were street vendors (one selling 6 different flavors of funnel cakes, yum! We just followed the smell). After that we saw where the prime minister lives, walked along the streets and saw lots of shops and then arrived over at Fisherman's Bastion.It's a really easy walk up the hill, but you could take the funicular if wanted to avoide a climb. We had a lovely time just walking along. Plus it's all free (except the funnel cake)."
