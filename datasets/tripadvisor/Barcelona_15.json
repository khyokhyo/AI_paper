The rooftop was my favourite bit with all different chimneys and good views also. I would definitely recommend this place. With this being on the same street as my hotel I walked passed at least twice a day and although in the mornings there can be a que I do believe this is due to the city tours but in the afternoon and evening there wasn't many people at all and this means you can really enjoy this place and take your time to take in Gaudi's great work.A fan of his or not, for \u20ac12 definitely add it to the list of things to do whilst in Barca."

            "review": "Architecture is Art. Guell commissioned Gaudi in 1886 to create a palace to reflect the industrialist's wealth and status. The materials, design, color, unique architecture and especially the details successfully presented a lavish home for one of the century's richest men.The basement with Moorish arches and massive columns includes a brick, winding ramp from the ground floor entry for carriages to descend to the stables, as well as a practical small open \"courtyard\" for ventilation. The impressive, decorative wrought iron doors facing the foyer are designed so those inside have a view of outside, but it is impossible to see inside! The foyer's wide staircase has raised steps along the side in order to assist those mounting or dismounting horses. The staircase continues upward to the living spaces and includes built in benches along the banisters (reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright), and becomes the stage to admire the astonishing wood coffered ceilings and chandeliers at each level. The wood carved dining room and the musician's gallery are true showcases for lavish entertainment. The organ actually played music every half hour or so during the tour, and discreet doors to the gilded chapel were open. Hidden \"galleries\" made it possible for the lady of the house to attend Mass without getting properly dressed, or more interesting, they were a perfect secret venue for Guell to spy on his servants and guests!The roof terrace with broad city views, displays the whimsical, colorful ceramic tiled chimney caps reflecting a playful sense of humor and novel approach to making art out of something so practical....the sweet icing on top of a very elaborate cake!HINT: The audio guide is included in the admission charge."

            "review": "Gaudi's late 1800's wealthy family home near the Barri Gotic area. Pay attention to the map and street signs when looking for Palau Guell. We were so taken with the sights on Las Ramblas as we walked out of Barri Gotic on Carrer de Ferrah, that we missed the side street on which Palau Guell is located. The Palau Guell is located about 1/2 block down on C. Nou de la Rambla, a narrow street which is almost opposite Carrer de Ferrah and across Las Ramblas. Sidewalk crowd control barriers in front of this Gaudi house indicate which building is the Palau Guell; otherwise we would have walked right by it. Fortunately, there was no line up to enter the house or to buy tickets in the booth next door when we visited on a Saturday afternoon in September without online reservations. The Palau was the 4 storey family home of a wealthy Barcelonean businessman in the late 1800's. Squeezed in now by a bank, a hotel, and modern apartments, the house still retains its exterior splendour with the 2 unusual wrought iron entrance gates probably being its trademark. The interior of the house reflects its 19th Century roots with its use of dark woods, small rooms, lots of stairs, and narrow windows. A very limited amount of furniture is in the whole house and that too reflects the times and taste of the Guell family. One room did showcase some of the chairs Gaudi designed. What was spectacular was the gold leaf family altar set in an alcove which could be closed off by doors when the family held musical soirees in the room. The organ pipes in the central atrium were also an unusual feature in a family home. The audioset which was included in the entry fee emphasized Gaudi's attention to architectural detail in each room and unusual design elements. The one hour audio tour started in the empty bricked basement where the family kept its carriages and storage. Next we entered the ground floor where the family got out of the carriages and walked up a central staircase to the living area. The first floor had a dining room that was roped off, a music room, and a sitting room. The second floor had a number of bedrooms for the 4-5 children the family had and separate bedrooms for the husband and wife. There was just one toilet on this floor. The third floor was the servants' area with kitchen, laundry, and their bedrooms. This upper floor was just one big empty room. Viewing a video here with information on the owner of the house offered a chance to rest tired feet.before climbing the stairs to the rooftop to look at the colorful vents. While several of these fireplace vents still were decorated with Gaudi's original selection of colorful chipped porcelain/ceramic pieces, others had been re-done during the renovation project. These vents could not be seen from street level so I don't know for whom he decorated them. This house is one of 3 Gaudi designed homes that are easily accessible within the downtown area of Barcelona. The entrance fee for Palau Guell is the lowest of the three. After visiting all 3 Gaudi homes, my favorite ones where the 2 on Passeig de Gracia. Casa Battlo and Casa Pedrera have delightful exteriors - eye candy - while the exterior of Palau Guell is more traditional. The interior of Palau Guell is somber while the interiors of the other two begin to show more of Gaudi's unique design characteristics - the use of varying tones of colored glass and tiles, naturalistic forms echoed in woodwork, and remarkable engineering skills. However, I was glad to have visited Palau Guell as it satisfied my curiosity about Gaudi's work and the interior of a home in 19th Century Barcelona."

Built between 1886 and 1890 for the family Guell who advised that money was no object. Gaudi took his patron at his word, hence the ornate ironwork entrances and quality of materials used throughout. The highlights for us were the stables in the basement and the rooftop with its colourful chimneys which are typical of Gaudi. You are allowed to take photos without flash but the lighting does not make this easy. You have to deposit large bags in the cloakroom. We bought tickets online in advance to beat the queues but it was not very busy when we arrived late afternoon. Tickets are for a set entry time but there is some flexibility \u2013 we arrived 15 minutes early and were allowed in. Entry fees are cheaper than other Gaudi buildings but the signposting and audio tour here are not as easy to follow and we gave up in the end. Interesting insight into Gaudi\u2019s early work but if you are pressed for time would recommend visiting Casa Batllo and Sagrada Familia instead."

On an afternoon we decided to visit the Palau G\u00fcell which was one of the first architectural works of Antoni Gaudi who had not only fund a benefactor but also a friend in Eusebi G\u00fcell.The building is fascinating, the entrance with it massive wrought-iron gates that seem to have no weight and which allow you to look form the inside out but not the other was around are an art of its own, not ignoring the marvel of the people who did work for him and transform his ideas to live.The works that have been done in and around the house, the pillars, the wooden ceilings, the window shutters with its intelligent closing and opening system and more are amazing and Gaudi was and still is way ahead of many people of today\u2019s time with his mind and thought breaking ideas.On the other hand, even though a fascinating building \u2013 it is overloaded and if you consider the rooms for the children of G\u00fcell \u2013 tiny cells rather than bright and shiny rooms. Anyhow the whole house seems to diminish in all its sombreness.In my personal opinion, it is a great architectural work, but not for the living."

Gaudi was commissioned to create the structure in 1885 by industrialist Eusebi Buelli i Bacigalupi and construction started in 1886. It was planned to be a multi purpose building with apartments and exposition rooms, and only a basic area 18 x 22 meters was available to construct a glamorous palace. Parts of the facade resemble a Venetian palace and Gaudi decorated the house with impressive wrought iron works, wood, ceramic, stained glass, and stone works. The basement contained the stables for horses and sleeping quarters for servants. The elevated ground floor had working rooms, the library, and administration rooms, plus an entry hall with a magnificent staircase leading to the second floor's family rooms. The Palau Guell has been listed as a UNESCO Heritage Site since 1984."

We had passed this building a number of times as it was close to our hotel, not really realising what was inside, after a trip elsewhere for the day, we called in here on the way back, this was one of Gaudis early projects and is a real gem, the interior is fabulous, the large window at the rear remarkable, but it is the roof of this building which is the winner, the chimneys and air vents are awesome, brilliant for that Gaudi picture that you want. Cheaper than the other sites and well worth a visit, its position close the the Ramblas very handy to drop in."

Audio players outline the facts as you wander the rooms. This is an interesting and colourful home with quite a contrast of sights throughout. The basement stables lead up through to the office and living levels (becoming more opulent as you ascend), then the servants\u2019 level and the roof featuring various chimneys in typical Gaudi style. The view from the rooftop is impressive. The cost is 12\u20ac per person. This is one you should include on your Barcelona To Do list and is probably a better option than Park Guell if you have to choose between them."

Contrary to other Gaudi's buildings, this one is not so popular among crowds (or we just lucked out?), so we enjoyed touring it with audio guides with just few other people. The building is absolutely stunning inside, with marvelous windows. The audio guides are very informative, which was great, as this was the first Gaudi's landmark we visited.

Did not join a guided tour party, instead just listened to the audio guide they give you on entry (hand held device like a phone). The tour works in an orderly way, directing you through the rooms, passages and staircases one by one in sequential order. So because we were first in, we were often the only ones in the room! We had our 5 and 8 year old girls with us, so did not linger on the way, but they really enjoyed it, especially the electronic guide which was very informative. It took us about an hour to go bottom to top. The design, quality, detail, in every room was so amazing. Gaudi was a real genius, and clearly had a very strong trusted relationship with Guell. The last stop is the roof terrace which has some very ornate and colourful sculptures, plus the views around the city are a bonus. We did linger there for a while!"

It's yet another example of Gaudi's genius and, like Sagrada Familia, has much to offer and stimulate the mind and eye.The only recommendation I can make is that if you can, go and try to spend at least an hour or two there (or more!). We were with a tour and our time was limited to about 45 minutes or so and it would have been nice to just wander around the park and enjoy everything without being in a hurry.

It costs 12,90 to enter, students pay less, but everyone has acess to audioguides to better understand the arquitectonic and decorative details of this historic place, as well as the reasons behind its' construction. The detail in some of the rooms is exquisite. Overall this is a nice sight, one to see once you have already seen all of the main Gaudi attractions and still crave more of the marvelous architect's work. Do try to go on a sunny day, or else you will not be able to visit the Terrace."

The roof is topped with the most unusual chimneys covered with colored tiles. I was surprised by the location ,down a side street with no other houses around , maybe when it was built it was more of a neighborhood. I liked that we pretty much had the mansion to ourselves also they had a very clean restroom (hard to find in Barcelona )  I enjoyed that this was a home & as fancy as it was it was not the crazy Gaudi style that you see in some of his designs"

However, the rooftop is more typical of Gaudi's inimitable style.This is a great value visit, it takes about an hour and a half to get around. The audio guide is included in the very reasonable 12EUR entrance price. Another note on the audio guide, the attention to detail is impressive. As well as clear information on each room, there are helpful images on the screen as you go and music composed by contemporaries to the Guell family."

The metro stop is a walk up the hill away. Book online in advance for timed tkts. Take bus times into account when booking. It is about 2.5 miles from Pla. Catalunya, so walkable, but generally up hill. It's is easier to wak back or on to Sagrada Familia. It's Gaudi - in beautiful gardens, what's not to like! The Porter's house has an informative video. Small cafe, serving fresh smoothies and orange juice. takes about an hour for the 'Monumental Zone'."

It is quite different to his other buildings in the city which are much more fanciful, in this building you can see the personality of the man he was designing for. It is very imposing and has a much more serious feel about it. The wood and iron work is astounding, to think that all that decorative ironwork was wrought by hand. They seem to spread the visitors out so that it doesn't get too crowded though we were there early in the summer season so it might get more crowded. There is an option of an audio tour (we did not use this but it might be a good idea to further enhance the experience) We also got to hear a piece of organ music in the music room (not sure if it was being played at the time on the actual organ designed into the mansion or if it was recorded but it was very impressive) Make sure to go up to the rooftop which gives a great view across Barcelona and is studded with Gaudi's mad chimney pots."

We went at lunchtime and there was no queue although there was in the morning. For someone whose own lifestyle was so spartan, Gaudi created the most beautiful and imaginative residences for his clients. The detail and design whether it is in wood, iron or tile is wonderous. From the basement to the roof and every floor in between there is something to marvel at. While we were there a lifelike recording from the organ was played and created a fantastic atmosphere in the music room so that visitors could appreciate the acoustics. Wonderful."

The first Sunday of every month, Palau Guell (pronounced Gway) is free, and that's when we went; we arrived 40 minutes before opening, and were in the second group admitted. If you are purchasing a ticket, it can be done on line on the museum's official site. We loved the house. Not only do you see the beginning of Gaudi's innovative ideas, you see a house you'd be delighted to live in. The audio guide is included in the ticket price (and included in the free admission on the first Sunday of the month), and is interesting and very well done. Gaudi, in this case, was remodeling an existing structure--despite the owner's willingness to tear it down and start from scratch--and had a very limited space in which to work, a townhouse with a relatively small footprint, so the innovations are, in my opinion, even more remarkable, from the atrium-style construction of public areas to the \"bricks\" in the entry-way, which are actually wood to muffle the sound of the horses hoofs as they entered. The roof-top is pure Gaudi and the audio guide explains the reasons for the \"fantastical\" chimneys. Some sources say that Palau Guell is not as good a tourist stop as the more well known La Pedrera, but we found it fascinating, and having seen it (and imagined living in it) made our appreciation of La Pedrera greater--and there's no question which one I'd rather live in: Palau Guell wins. Plan on a couple of hours to enjoy this less-visited Gaudi site."

But Palau Guell won my respect and made me take a fresh look at Gaudi's work.Firstly, I was impressed with his ingenuity. He succeeded in constructing a 'palace' (well, a substantial urban family mansion) on a small and narrow plot. Secondly, I was impressed by his use of materials. The basement level is a horse stable constructed of brickwork columns and arches - but it has the dignity and solemnity of a crypt. The upper levels make use of glass, ironwork, and expensive wood and marble - but you never have the sense that a material has been chosen because of its perceived value. It is all a matter of texture, form, and surface. Thirdly, the building has a remarkable stylistic unity. The style is severe, uncompromising, and rather masculine - until you get to the wavy roof with its colourful glazed chimneys. This building is worth a visit, and it rewards close examination. Make sure you book your ticket in advance."

This seemingly nondescript house just off La Rambla can be easily missed on a casual stroll but make an effort to see the inside and the roof of the building. Gaudi made a huge space within the confines of a small building plot. The touches of his genius is all there starting from the basement all the way up to the roof. The central \"space\" was used as a music hall and has many clever ways to make use of the limited space and light. There is a self guided audio guide that is extremely handy without which one may miss a lot. The roof is also very flamboyant and tiled and the whole thing is \"do not miss\"."

We visited on the first Sunday of the month when entry is free but we would have paid the \u20ac12 entry on reflection. Really enjoyable and informative tour via the audio guide and it is a very impressive building. You do not need to have a prior appreciation of Gaudi or art or architecture to enjoy this.

It's best to read about both before your visit.Palau G\u00fcell is pretty interesting on its own merits - at the least, you can tour an early, Art Nouveau Gaud\u00ed mansion. His genius is evident even in this early design, and it's worth seeing if you have the time. If not, save it for your next trip to Barcelona. However, if you DO get here, be sure to see the roof. And since you're in Raval, go see the Botero cat, which is nearby."

You are IMMEDIATELY taken back 135 years to about 1880. The two main gates allowed horses and carriages in and out of this fantastic Gaudi building. If the carriage was stopping for the night the horses were taken down a spiral ramp to the stables underneath. So we went to the stables and then up floor by floor to the roof with the included commentary machine. With so many ideas constantly springing from Gaudis head I don't know how he completed anything. This was his first building for Mr Guell and their association then went on for a lifetime. Not to miss and near the bottom of the Rambla."

However, while we were on our way to Montserrat in the morning, we realised that the stop (Colonia Guell) to Cripto Guell is halfway along the same line to Montserrat (about 2hrs). Hence we decided to complete Montserrat in half a day and visit this place! It's a small walking town and you can get the map of the place and pay the entrance fee to the church ($7 euro) at the tourist information centre (5min walk from the Colonia Guell train station). To get there, after exiting the train station, cross the road and you can follow the signs / blue footsteps that will guide you along the way from the train station. With the Barcelona card, the fee is $7.20 euros including audio guide. The church isn't crowded (aka more photo opportunities!) as I think most people choose not to visit as it is far out from the city. The map shows you the walking route to the rest of the attractions (that aren't so attractive) mostly old buildings like hospital, private housing etc, I think you can skip those if you don't have the time as its mainly looking at its architecture and unable to go in. Only the church is worth visiting."

There were no long queues waiting to enter and the visitors inside were quite sparse. Surprising really as this building by Gaudi is one of his fairly early works and is definitely worth a visit. We took the audio tour and enjoyed learning about each room. The tour starts with the startling large entrance doors laced with wrought iron which were originally built to accommodate the carriages. From there a paved ramp leads down to the magnificent stables which are light and airy despite being underground. The vaulted ceiling is supported by mushroom=like columns and little details like the watering vat and the unicorn head for tethering the horses, leaps out at the visitor. Upstairs I was impressed by the central hall of the house with its own private altar and organ where the family held services. These were attended by all members of the household from the balconies on the higher floors where the servants stood. The lady of the house had her own private window next to her bedroom from where she could follow the service. In this building the furniture is still in place and this gives a more intimate feeling on how people lived in the house, than in Casa Batllo. All in all, I strongly recommend to visit and explore Palau Guell. Do not miss the terrace and the private terrace garden."

To think that he created this in 1890 during the Victorian era shows how ahead of his time he was. Equally amazing is that the Guell family gave him so much freedom of artistic license.I thought it to be way too over the top. A riot of textures and patterns. I could only wish Frank Loyd Wright could have been with me and gotten his take on it."

Bonus points here for the incredibly detailed audio guide- it made the experience a million times better than if I'd simply wandered through at random.This particular spot stands out in Europe as being a gloriously decorated bit of real estate without being either an actual palace or in any fashion religious [barring the chapel inside, of course]. The detail in every room is stunning, even just in the stables below which remain plain stone but whose layout is surprisingly sleek. Even the ironwork on the outside of the building is fascinating- carefully shaped to allow people to look out from within, but to block the view from outside.A part of me wants to detail the trip through the house according to my multitude of photos, but I will leave it to you, the reader, to discover the building on your own. Go! Enjoy the coffered ceilings and gilded woodwork, the wrought iron and stained glass and ivory inlay. The geometry of the domed ceiling in the center of the upper floor is of particular note as are the Christmas-Trees-On-Acid chimneys on the roof, but none of it should be missed, from the impressive pipe organ to the peek inside the tiled bathroom with its delft-like blue and white ceramic commode."

Buy your tickets a few doors down to the left. Entry is timed, but we got right in on a Saturday morning. There's a small lift (ask someone in a red coat for assistance) for those unable to climb all the stairs. Many of the rooms are unfurnished, but there's still enough beautiful furniture to see what it looked like at one time. On the rooftop are the fanciful mosaic chimneys and some nice views of Barcelona (several steps, no elevator to it). I'm so glad we didn't miss this."

(We missed Casa Vincens and Casa Calvet, as well as El Drac at Finca Guell, but we'll have something to see next time!) The audio tour and signage is as excellent as it is Casa Batllo, and one gets a deeper understanding of how Gaudi solved such practical problems as the noise of horses hooves disturbing visitors and inhabitants of the house, or how a worship area could be incorporated into living space, in beautiful and functional manners. If you enjoy Gaudi's work, grand homes, or interesting and unusual architecture, you should put this place on your to-see list."

Not as fancy as Casa Batllo or La Pedrera but a great exemple of Gaudi's work in a totally different more sober and darker style. Visited on a saturday and there was hardly anyone there. No line, no ticket reservation necessary. How different from the other Gaudi buildings! Entrance price is way more reasonable too. I would recommend everyone to visit and maybe skip one of Gaudi's other houses. Don't forget to visit the roof!"

It's amazing what he could pack into a pack into a \"small\" building that looks relatively ordinary from the outside. From the inside, though, it is anything but ordinary. Looking up towards the ceiling towards the ceiling from the central hall is a \"wow-moment\" and the moment you step out on the roof of the building and see the colors of the chimneys and the sloping \"floors\" you really see the genius of Gaudi. This was no ordinary man and this is no ordinary house. We visited in the middle of March and had to queue for a few minutes before being allowed inside. The tour did not feel crowded and the audio guide was very useful in pointing out the various features of the house and telling the story behind it. You should not miss this UNESCO World Heritage Site if you visit Barcelona."

We also get to see some furniture in a separate exhibition. The rooftop is a delight and shows the beginnings of use of trencandis for the chimneys later repeated in casa batlo and casa mila. Location just off the famous las ramblas and being less well known means less tourists here and a great way of saving time yet managing to see some decent Gaudi work right in the old quarter of the city."

The style used in this house seems to be a bit more austere and dark; the Guells were definitely wealthy people: the quantity of rooms, expensive materials, and the details! These guys had a mini chapel in their main living room, for God\u2019s sake! Make sure you get the audio guide at the reception \u2013 it is free and very useful, it makes the visit much more meaningful. The dome you can see from the main hall is wonderful, you just stare in awe! Although I liked Casa Batllo over this \u2013 much more airy and brighter, with a somewhat more nature-like, organic style - if you are interested in architecture and Gaudi\u2019s work, Palau Guell is definitely a must. The rooftop with the iconic chimneys is certainly an indication of the kind of style Gaudi was going to master later on.

Very interesting structural layout. Do go inside the basement area as it is great to see huge columns that supports the palace. Highlight of the building was the rooftop. Has a lot of stairs so be ready to walk a lot inside the building."

It is as much the attention to functional-detail as well as the design i.e. everything has form and function. It is quite a 'small' house and it is impressive what use has been squeezed out of it whilst still retaining stunning architecture. The audio guide (free) is a bit over the top/gushing but necessary.The house is a bit oddly bare of furnishings (I think a legacy of the building falling out of favour).Initially I was a bit sceptical (i.e. having reached my Gaudi-dosage for the day) but it is very good.

The pictures might not seem as amazing as the other Gaudi buildings, and indeed the interior and facade is generally more normal and less colorful than Mila/Batllo, however there are beautiful sights. Exploring the subterranean horse stables is interesting. The rooftop is the one part of the house that is very colorful and fantastical. There are somewhere around 20 chimneys, each one completely unique. In fact, the rooftop of Guell Palace is one of my favorite Gaudi sights in all of Barcelona. The domed-ceiling is also terrific. Plus, Guell Palace is cheaper than Casa Mila and Casa Battlo and it was also significantly less crowded. Maybe I had great timing, or it is just generally a quieter attraction, but for most of my visit to Guell Palace I felt as if I had the place to myself. A great experience. PS. As a fan of '70s film, I also enjoyed knowing that a scene for the 1975 Jack Nicholson movie 'The Passenger' was filmed at Guell Palace. (A scene was filmed at Casa Mila as well)."

The Palau G\u00fcell appears to be one of the few Gaud\u00ed sites in the city to have escaped (for now at least) being overwhelmed by unrestrained package tourism. You still have to get there first thing, before it opens, and we, naughtily, shot straight up to the top to enjoy unimpeded views of the roof decor, before the first pulse of visitors got there. Probably, the management would not like me writing that, as they have done very precise planning of 'through-flow'; free audio guides are provided, and these act to shepherd the visitors around the various parts of the house, while providing really interesting information and context. Numbers did build up, in the course of the morning, but not to the extent of destroying the experience of the building. When we went, in late spring, there seemed to be mainly Gaud\u00ed aficionados there, and no coach loads of bored teenagers. The top storey is now a dedicated community education space, which is great as it gives a real sense of a living building, not just a museum. Although Barcelona has a scheme allowing locals free access to monuments, The Palace does not seems to be included in that scheme, which is my only quibble. The people of any city should have access to their own cultural heritage."

He was commissioned to remodel the home of the G\u00fcell i L\u00f3pez family. The work was done between 1886 and 1890. The building does not have the genius craziness of the Basilica because it was designed for the needs of a specific family.Regardless, the building has many out-of-the-box features that would be unusual in a home of that day. We spent about 2 hours visiting the place. Included in the price of your admission is a very complete audio tour that describes what Gaudi was trying to do in each room. The place is not one of the main tourist destinations in Barcelona but you should visit it to see what Gaudi could do with an intimate private home as opposed to large public spaces. There have been comments on Trip Adviser about the need to reserve in advance, the long lines to get in and that the place was crowded. We experienced none of this. We walked right up and there were no crowds in the house. However, it should be noted that we were there in October and it may be more crowded in high season. The Palau Guell home is right off Las Ramblas so it is easy to combine a visit to Palau Guell with a stroll along Las Ramblas. That is what we did."

The audio guide is included in the admission price of \u20ac12 (or \u20ac8 for senior citizens of Europe). You will need at least one hour - we spent two. It was closed for restoration during our last visit to Barcelona when we visited all the other Gaudi attractions, but this is the best of all for an intimate view of so many design features - light and space; materials such as brick, stone and wood, iron and glass. Gaudi was fantastic. Don't miss the roof with all the chimneys.Staff were exceptionally good. Special mention to Sheila."

He was a hundred years ahead of his time and was fortunate enough to find a wealthy benefactor who would finance his early works and allow his genius to shine through."

It has the usual Gaudi style but not as colourful as say his Casa Batllo. The building is impressive and has a wonderful roof garden which overlooks the city. You can see Sagrada in the distance. The building was built as a family home for Guell who was his best friend and patron at the time.This building is in a side street off the Ramblas and is easy to get to. Although I had pre-booked for 9.30am in the morning, it was not crowded and once inside, it was easy to walk around. The audio was clear and descriptive.This building is well worth visiting if you are interested in Gaudi architecture and design.Lyn, Brisbane Australia"

However, we're not all that interested in architecture and so to be honest we were a little disappointed. The price was low compared to the other Gaudi attractions and there was an audio guide included in the price. The guide was a little too detailed in places and so we skipped a few of the guide points (here is a antechamber which leads into the main room etc). The building is a house that belonged to the Guell family back in the later 1800s and was clearly designed to impress. However you learn very little about the family themselves as the main focus is the architectural design. I think we have been a little spoiled by the stately home tours you get in the UK where you can see how people lived, whereas this house was empty apart from a few pieces of furniture. Worth it if you're hugely into Gaudi and want to get the full picture of his work, not so much if you just want to see the key Gaudi attractions."

Spectacular building, the stables are an amazing space, compare the same column in the horse area at Park G\u00fcell. I think my favourite bit is still the chimney pots, I know they aren't architecturally important, but they are lots of fun, can you spot the salamander? Great place for sunset views/photos through the pollution. Audio tour is quite good, not over the top gushing like that at Casa Batllo.Absolutely worth a visit."

This building was designed by Gaudi from scratch & has many features characteristic of his work, such as the parabolic arches, distinctive chimneys & idiosyncratic decorative features. There is a good audio guide provided with your entry. The basement and upper story are symptomatic of how Gaudi solved the problems of functional areas in his buildings. In Palau Guell, polished brown stone from the Guell family's estates was used extensively on the interior, which makes it rather oppressive & somber unlike Casa Batllo which is a symphony of light. This building is well worth visiting to see the beginning of Gaudi's ideas in action."

            "review": "Stunning Gaudi creation. Note: Many posted TripAdvisor reviews appear to confuse this single-house attraction, with the large park of the same name -- also by Gaudi. But palau = \"palace\"; this review is for the Guell townhouse/mansion located just off Las Ramblas, closer to the harbor, not the Guell park and planned real estate community (with 2 Gaudi houses) which is rather far across town from this house.I'd wanted to see Gaudi's works since I was a teenager, and this trip was my first chance -- while everyone visits (and probably should!) the Sagrada Familia, I came away from my trip thinking that perhaps this house, just off Las Ramblas near the Gothic Quarter, was in many ways, the more impressive Gaudi structure to me.Built for Gaudi's principal client and sponsor, Guell (of \"Park Guell\" and \"Finca Guell\" and \"Colonia Guell\" -- other must-see Gaudi works commissioned by the same family) this was a private mansion lived in by the rich and powerful Guell family. Guell broke with traditions of the time, for a family of his stature, by locating the house in a run-down, somewhat disreputable neighborhood. It is at times austere and in other ways simultaneously very opulent. Wrought iron appears everywhere inside and out, exceptionally well executed and wonderfully varied. Ornate coffered ceilings mix with polished grey limestone walls and Gaudi's famous catenary arches, all under his clever and creative genius for design. The house is quite vast, spread across (I think) 6 floors, despite the very small footprint of the plot of land it occupies. All the rooms are arranged around a central \"court\" on the 2nd level -- a single, impressive square room used for entertaining, with a soaring parabolic dome that rises and narrows through three more floors to break through the rooftop, admitting sunlight through little cut-outs that suggest stars overhead. The public rooms (mostly on the street-side of the house) are lavish in their ornamentation, but not in any way lavish like you expect in other \"palaces\" of western Europe. Calatalan/Gaudi lavish, which relies on exceptional craftsmanship of often \"ordinary\" materials, such as the wrought iron, wood working, ceramic tile, etc. The private, family-focused rooms (mostly on the rear of the house) are quite splendid themselves, but not nearly as jaw-dropping; simpler in decor and applied ornamentation. Many of the rooms have individual fireplaces, which play an important role in the architect's design, higher up...Besides the parabolic-domed central room, two other stand-out features (of many!) in the house are: The basement level (which housed stables for the coach horses -- coaches pulled directly into the house via a U-shaped driveway at the street level) -- is accessed from the street level via a cobblestone ramp in the house, which the horses could navigate to reach the basement. The rooftop, which is a vast private terrace for the family, turned into something of an outdoor sculpture garden because of the many chimney smokestacks that rise through the roof from all those fireplaces below. Each one decorated and shaped differently from the rest; most covered in colorful, whimsical broken-pottery tile. An excellent audio guide is included with the self-paced tour. Tickets are available online in advance, or at a ticket booth a few doors down the street from the house. I spent 2 hours there and felt rushed (had an appointment elsewhere, or I would have stayed 3 hours!) If you're there to photograph, be sure to take a fast lens; the interior is often in subdued light, making for somewhat dim rooms for a camera to capture effectively."

Gaudi's Palau took over 10 years to restore and is a very interesting place with a lok into Gaudi's lifestyle.it is some 6 stories and it is all stairs; not good for those with trouble walking stairs.Great views from the roof of greater Barcelona. It is located about 1/2 block off La Rambla across from te Hotel Gaudi."

Caution, too, that you may find a Gaudi walking tour only of exteriors of buildings. This is a structure that is all about the interior --and the roof accessible only from the interior.  While the wife of Guell who built this house didn't like to live in it, and I would find it a bit dark and formal, as an early example of Gaudi's work it offers a brilliant introducti into his use of stained glass, pottery shards, delicately carved wood, wrought iron, and endless polished stone. The audioguide, which is included in the \u20ac12 price is well done, includes the narration of the ten-minute film, and offers music that was actually performed in the house.  Note, there appeared to be an elevator for use by handicapped, but I am not sure it goes to the roof. On the floor that held servants quarters, there is now a display about how and when the building has been restored trying to follow Gaudi's guidelines. The craftsmanship of the original work and the restoratis in all the different media is most impressive. Note also the impressive attention given to acoustics, including wooden bricks on the carriageway to temper the sound of horses' hoofs. I haven't yet seen all the Gaudi options, but I would have hated to mss this one. Conveniently just off the Rambla. Metro: Liceu."

This is a wonderful starting place for anyone seeking to understand the early work and influences that created the genius that was Antoni Gaud\u00ed. It is eight floors of an early modernist masterpiece built as Gaud\u00ed's first residential project for his early cheerleader, the industrialist Eusebi Guell. there is a basement built to house the family's horses with its own circular ramp so as to facilitate leading the horses up to street level. There is a roof terrace with 15 chimneys decorated with what were to become one of Gaud\u00ed's trademarks: mosaics of broken ceramics in a variety of colours.The scope of the project was breathtaking and the attention to detail of the interior decor highly impressive. Gaud\u00ed's early style was highly influenced by art nouveau and oriental styles and both are highly evident here.The use of windows, openings and pillars to encourage light and air circulation yet retain privacy for the family that lived here is amazing.Apparently, Gaud\u00ed's graduation report when leaving his university's architecture faculty stated that he would go on to become a genius or a mad man. But, this incredible palace is definitely the work of a true genius."

The audio tour was very informative and I can see what Gaudi was trying to do. It takes quite a while to go round and a constant diet of how wonderful this carving is and how special that light fitting is started to grate on me a bit. I couldn't help feeling things were half done. Either leave the rooms empty and show pictures of what they would have looked like or restore them fully to how they were when the family lived there. There's something depressing about standing in a child's bedroom and the only thing that survives of them is an overstuffed chair. It doesn't give you much of a flavour of the family and HOW they lived in this impressive and highly designed building. They're secondary to the genius of Gaudi. It's hard to see how practical his designs were for everyday living and given this was a family home it would have been nice to have felt that someone had lived there amongst the splendor rather than just stood and admired the architecture as we were doing. Others will love the well designed and unique aspects of this building and I think it's well worth a visit if you appreciate architecture, design or Gaudi. But I'm afraid it just left me cold."

Personally, if you're going to do both Palau Guell and Casa Batllo I'd do them in that order to best see how Gaudi's ideas and technical mastery progressed.

I can't understand how can people writing reviews mix up a house with a park.That out of the way I must say this is very impressive place, but not as \"gaudi\" as other houses available for visit. Maybe it is all the wood which makes it so dark or somewhat conservative solutions on visual elements. Compared to Casa Battlo this very colorless and unimaginative. But still a worthy place if you like Gaudi or architecture."

It is hard to imagine a normal and practical life in this labyrinth of exceptional and beautiful craftsmanship inspired by a strange and capricious vision of geometry and organic design. The ticketing and access process works smoothly to control the crowds. The rooftop 'garden' of chimneys is a highlight, as is the jewel box chapel, organ and the ceiling dome. The joinery on ceilings and doors is sublime. "

This building with all the inspiration and ambition of a very young Gaudi, is a masterpiece and a vision of what to come in his future in architecture and nature.Gaudi had a love for nature and incorporated it in all of his work. The detailed, thoughtfully created ceilings certainly show works of another demention. The mind of a man who at an early age.... thought \" outside the box\". Not everyone were fans of his way of incorporating nature with structural architecture. These buildings and places Gaudi worked so hard to create still stand today with minimal maintenance to any of the structures. He knew what he was thinking and did follow his dreams inspire of what anyone thought.Be sure to look up while inside the rooms of this house, you will not want to miss these ceilings!"

This place is surreal and summarizes Gaudi well, it is kind of mind numbing that he was able to do this in this time frame. He truly mesmerizes with the patterns and shapes and how he uses the space to really create curvature and shadow that captures the imagination. I love to do a Gaudi Day and plan it in advance and see his sites together. The Park, the Apartments, the La Sagrada Familia, and the Palau. It is repetitive in some areas, but he does an amazing job changing pace with each structure and conform the space to his vision. It is a truly unique style and something you have to see in person and walk through the columns and get a sense for how it incorporated the twists and turns of the space into a maze like space of pillars and the grandiosity of the whole process. I would recommend stretching and not working out that morning, other than a nice swim or warm up."

Beware going if raining though, luckily it cleared up later on, but they shut the roof if it's raining for health and safety. The mosaic chimneys are amazing, but even if you don't get a non-rainy day the rest of the house is incredible too. We weren't expecting it, as it was implied that the chimneys were the only decent thing to see when we were told it was probably best to come back when it wasn't raining. Luckily we did come back when it brightened up so we got to see everything, but the house interior is incredible, with amazing ceiling work and some furniture designed by Gaudi too. Definitely worth a look inside, as compared to his other buildings, this one isn't as spectacular from the outside."

As a magician with geometry, and intellectual problem solver, we admire today, his advanced thinking that resulted in solutions to common building design problems that we still face. Like how to heat or cool spaces in a natural way. The importance of cross ventilation and light management in a building, sound and acoustic management as well as structural strength using new methods of load bearing structures based on parabolic shapes. All these ideas were revolutionary when he did them, and are still being explored today. If you get the opportunity, don\u2019t miss going.

I mean its nice but it was built in 1896 - when many of today's modern construction technologies were available . The house was built for a millionaire so budget too was not a problem.. The wood work, layout etc are all nice but not spectacular. I paid 12 Euros to see Palace of Versailles in France which really was awesome and I paid the same amount for Guel's house which was nothing out of the ordinary. Go there if you have 12 extra Euros and an hour and a half to kill or you are really into finer details of architecture or you love Gaudi otherwise you can afford to give it a miss."

The price of admission includes an audio tour that explains a tremendous amount about the construction and architecture of this amazing residence, which we Learned Senora Guell never liked and their family only lived in briefly before Se\u00f1or Guell passed away.Be sure to make it all the way up to the roof, to see the brilliant Gaudi rooftop ornaments which are so colorful and original. Also, on he way out, note the think wrought iron gates that lead to the street that Gaudi has twisted in such a fashion that people on the inside can see out to the street, but not vice versa.

They control the number of people who enter well so it doesn't feel crowded, and it was good value for money. We had a 30 minute return time after ticket purchase, which was acceptable. We felt the audio guide was quite dry, worth a visit if you are really into Gaudi's work, but otherwise try Casa Batllo first."

You get to see the wild roof top, a mini-museum on Gaudi in the attic and an apartment furnished as it would have been in Gaudi's time. The history was dry (no old gossip). We also went on an architectural tour (separately) where we learned the wife of the Palau Guell didn't like the house and refused to move into it until after Gaudi's death."

This is the listing for Palau Guell - a fabulous, grand house just off the Ramblas which Gaudi built for Guell and NOT the park in the north east of the city. Roughly 80% of reviews posted on this listing are for the wrong place.Palau Guell is one of the oldest of Gaudi's works and much less well known and well visited than Casa Batllo, La Padrera or the Sagrada Familla. It's on a side street off the lower Ramblas a couple of blocks south of the Liceu theatre. At \u20ac12 entrance it's a bargain compared to some of the other Gaudi houses and the lines are short and timed entrance on our tickets was for just 15 minutes later.There was plenty of space inside this extraordinary building and the audio tour was mostly well paced and interesting although repeated requests to look at the screen were a bit silly.The house shows a grandeur that's sometimes missed in the later houses in favour of whimsical and quirky touches. The top floor shows designs you'll recognise in the later houses and the chimneys on the roof show that Gaudi was doing weird stuff with vents long before his more popular buildings.Whilst I was dumbstruck by the architecture, I wasn't surprised to hear that Mrs Guell didn't much like living there."

I rated this place 3 stars but I think it is something that visitors to Barcelona should see if they have at least 3-4 days.Let me explain. Gaudi was clearly very creative and thought outside of the box in his design. I don't think his style is always that appealing but this palace of a house is a good example of how he developed his way of thinking about design. And he had great ideas about light that were put to great effect in his Sagrada Familia (which is still under construction many years after his deathThe problem with this house is that they paired an avant garde architect with an obscenely wealthy industrial magnate who wanted no expense spared in the construction of his monument to self. What results is a beautifully wrought but completely over the top example of architectural and design excess. Certain features such as the stable house and the vaulted ceiling in the main hall are clever and visually appealing but numerous little details (overwrought roof with carvings of unique hardwood and pearl inlays, a single room that features stained glass windows depicting Shakespeare characters for some odd reason) indicate to me that this house was really about cramming as much \"luxury\" into a space as possible, not necessarily in producing something that was aesthetically pleasing let alone tasteful.Some of this might be my own personal architectural biases talking and the work might appeal to many others. The space has been preserved nicely and it is something to see for sure, not like anything else I have ever seen for sure."

Perhaps there is a way around that we were not aware of, but as five rather fit people, we were definitely out of breath. I should mention that we went on a very hot day...The park might be nicer if the staff were, too. Instead of being friendly and welcoming, we were told we would have to wait until our turn to enter came. Okay, makes sense, but when we sat down in the only self-service 'cafe', the staff was so rude to us and other patrons, actually patrolling around, making sure we had all purchased something, and speaking not a work of English. This admittedly soured the experience. The architecture and design is nice, but not magnificent. Go to La Sagrada instead if you want to be awed by Gaudi's work."

Furthermore in this case, the audio-guide is really worth listening to: the descriptions are detailed, yet not too long and work naturally with the way your tour progresses.

The monument (the colorful mosaics and structures seen on postcards) is an expression of Gaudi's genius as an artist, engineer and mathematician. One of the most interesting and beautiful experiences in the world. First, entrance to the park is free, but to the \"monuments\" there is a fee, and your entrance is timed. We arrived at 1 pm and our entrance time (they do not deviate) was 330 pm. The two and half ours was barely enough time to walk the park and then sit down grab a glass of sangria and tortilla, before visiting the monuments. Side Note: Bring Cash, sometimes the ticket machines do not accept credit cards and it works faster in the two cafes (one in the park above the monument entrance and the other inside the monument itself.)The park will require a significant amount of walking, with some moderate inclines. There are plenty of people selling water bottles along the path (legally and illegally). Take the time to climb to the top of the small cross at the top of the park, the view of Barcelona is breathtaking."

The entrance fee is reasonable (12 \u20ac) when compared to entrance fees to some other Gaud\u00ed buildings in Barcelona, for example to La Pedrera (20,50 \u20ac) and Casa Battl\u00f3 (21,50 \u20ac). The building is in pristine condition after restauration and the audio-guide is very good. The tour begins from stalls and ends high up in the roof between chimneys that look like some sci-fi tree species in wonderland. It is strange to thing that usually only the servants visited the roof to dry the laundry. Gaud\u00ed used first time his famous arch in Palau G\u00fcell and you can see a lot of Arabic influence in the use of space and light and patios. The most recommended visit to the world and to the endless imagination of Gaud\u00ed."

There are no escalators or long walks to the top so don't let those comments put you off. The house is just off La Rambla and if you were going to see one thing in Barcelona, make it this. Gaudi was a genius in the way he manages to find solutions to problems, creates wonderful view lines throughout the house to other rooms and floors, and uses only the best artisans and materials in his buildings. Almost moved me to tears and well worth every euro."

We arrived at about 18:30 and were able to go in immediatelyWe were already Gaudi fans and were not disappointed - it was absolutely amazing inside! There was lots to see as you seemed to be able to look at every floor and most of the rooms.It is very sparsely furnished and we found this enabled us to look at the architecture and dimensions of the rooms. I particularly liked the roof although, as with many other Gaudi buildings, I understand it may be closed on a rainy day so if looking at it is vital to your visit I recommend you go on a sunny day as we did.I can't find any fault with my visit. It was worth every cent and is definitely my favourite sight in Barcelona. If you like looking at houses and architecture, I guarantee you will not be disappointed!We visited it on the same day as Park Guell and there really is no comparison between the two. The park is more about grand scale external architecture and this is a house. Whilst I enjoyed the park, I felt Palau Guell was much better value for money. I feel very sorry for the staff and management of Palau Guell as almost all of the poor reviews on this site are about Park Guell and not Palau Guell!"

It cost \u20ac24... Perhaps a little steep but a really interesting place to visit and see one of Gaudi's early buildings. You can see where some of his signature architecturally motifs are used early on in his career in the Guell Palace. As well as being another opportunity to see the unique Gaudi architecture in this amazing city, the Palace is also a chance to see how the other half once lived. The Guell family lived here before the Spanish Civil War and the rooms include a basement coach house which has some incredible brickwork, piano recital rooms, tiled bathrooms, lounge rooms and the main concert salon which the entire palace is centred around. The central performing space is vast and spans several floors over which there are mezzanine floors and viewing galleries that over look it. There is also a gold and tortoiseshell guided chapel inside, a full organ and higher performance space for a choir. The main spectacle of the room is the roof which features Gaudi's first use of the hexagonal tile pattern and features holes which at night time give the effect of shimmering stars in the night sky. I am no history expert, I learned this information from the audio guide handset which was included in the price and was really handy in guiding me around the many rooms. I actually found myself looking at things more closely because of the guide rather than just glancing and going \"mm, that's nice\". There is also a roof terrace that can be viewed but was unfortunately closed due to the weather when we visited. If you like your tourist attractions on the quieter side and have an interest in Gaudi architecture, Palau Guell could be for you. It has the Barcelona history and hallmarks of the Gaudi style but is less busy than La Pedrera and Casa Battl\u00f3. In a future visit I would be interested to see how these two Gaudi buildings are different and how his style had developed later on."

If you don't need time/ can't get a ticket for the other part of the park it is still completely worthwhile going, however, the paying section of the park is the famous bit with the mosaics in it. Without a ticket you can see the mosaic bit from the street a little bit. The mosaic section is not expensive but tickets are limited each day. We arrived at quarter past ten and the next available ticket was for 12:30. It was actually easy to spend 2 hours in the free part waiting for our slot but there is obviously a risk of a much longer wait or no tickets at all so I would recommend buying tickets online in advance. The type of art and architecture was appealing to the children so it was a good day out to suit everyone. The shop had some good sticker books for them to make their own mosaic patterns."

First off if you are thinking about visiting the Park and plan to get the metro to Vallcarca, be aware that you are in for a steep climb. Most of the way is via escalator but not all of it, anyone with dodgy legs may find themselves in trouble. Parc Guell itself is indeed picturesque, although it would be if not jammed packed with tourists like me. We wandered around the free bit for a while, and although the views are great and there\u2019s the odd charming discovery, you start to wonder if it was worth the effort. Since we bought tickets online for the paid part we didn\u2019t have to queue for those, thank God, so we were eventually released into the bits you see in all the photographs. Well the immediate area has the longest bench in the world (in the form of a sea serpent apparently) with a great view of the city, which you have to enjoy while all those who have dived onto the bench for photos try to work around everyone else. Down the stairs takes you to the Gaudi\u2019s Tiled Mosaics on the pillared ceiling which holds the aforementioned part up, and the salamander fountain (it might be some other creature, a newt or something) with tiled stairs. All very nice but well\u2026 for a Philistine like me it was just a load of glued crockery and tiles. The best part was the old nursery area to the left when you walk down the stairs; lovely garden and actually quite quiet. The heaving mass of humanity on the stairs didn\u2019t seem to care for this part.The gatehouse at the main entrance contains a very interesting exhibition on the history of the park and Gaudi\u2019s work. A must see this part.All in all worth a visit if you enjoy architectural design and the history of Barcelona, not to mention some great views and enjoyable quiet spots.

So it became wonderful park. The only problem - clouds of people here. So it's a good enough way to buy off line tickets. It costs extra Euro 5,- if you are traveling with Barcelona Days tour (recommended by Trip Adviser). Enjoy!"

We got a taxi to drop us of at the top of the park so we could walk down rather than up! If you want to see both the public (free) and private( fee) parts of the Parc and you have bought tickets, then leave plenty of time before your timed ticket and see the public part first. There are small cafes in both parts. The private part was nowhere as big as I expected hence my review title. Saying that we did enjoy it and the mosaics were stunning. Do watch out for pick pockets. A gang of 3 were feeding pigeons, offering peanuts to people to distract them and then were using that to steal. We saw 2 of them being caught and lead away, while the 3rd jumped a 8-9 foot gate and escaped into the public area. Plenty of taxis at the bottom entrance for those needing it. It cost 12 euros to get back to Ramblas."

It costs 12 Euro pp & is open from 1000- 1730 from Nov-March & 1000-2000 from April to October. It is CLOSED on Mondays, except public holidays & on 1 Jan, 6-13 Jan & 25-26 Dec. The phone number is (in Barcelona, otherwise put the country code in) 934 725 775; email: palauguell@diba.cat; website: www.palauguell.cat It was not crowded when we went (in the morning), but began to get that way before we left. There are lockers inside for your backpacks etc. The whole building is a treasure trove of art/design/architecture culminating on the roof with the colorfully, odd-shaped chimneys. It seemed much bigger on the inside that it appeared on the outside--take your time, there is a lot to see & it is all beautiful...from the ornate stair cases, etched/stained windows, carved ceilings, various furniture pieces/rooms & whimsical/fun chimneys. The roof with all of its enticement also gives a stunning view around the area. Definitely enjoyed this exploration! If you have knee trouble, there are a lot of stairs & even on the bottom floors, the floors seem more like ramps. If you can do it, the roof is definitely worth it!"

How many private homes have a chapel hiding behind the doors of a reception room? This was also the first house in Barcelona to have a basement\" garage\" for the family's horses and carriages as well as those of their visitors? Don;t let the dark, dungeon-like expanses of wrought-iron the at entrance fool you -- capping this building is an orchard of brightly colored ceramic \"trees\" acting a chimney covers -- a Gaudi trademark. Visitors can tour most of the house and get a glimpse of how the Palau family lived while they were there. At the gift shop, I mentioned to the young cashier that it must have been quite something to live in such a house. She agreed, but added that Guell's children didn't like it -- they found it creepy - she said with a smile.This house is located off of the Ramblas,not far from the huge market -- and well worth the visit. When I was there, there were few visitors, so I could enjoy the tour at my leisure."

We had a couple of hours, but found it passed quickly when we went round the outer part of the park, which has plenty to interest you an has many artists and performers, who are keen to please and provided good entertainment.Be aware that the steps around the park are quite challenging if you have any mobility issues, but it is well worth the effort if you can make it.Once inside the main part of the park, you are once again confronted by Gaudi's incredible imagination and his love of curves is plain for all to see. The Monumental zone provides a great platform for viewing the surrounding area and to admire the many mosaic areas set in the seating around the zone.it is 7 euros to get in, you can book online and there is a great little bar across the road that serves up very palatable food at good prices.

Inside the free part of the park, at the top of a hill, there is a very disturbing \"street musician performer\" who is aggressive and loud. When we found our way to the Gaudi section of the park, we were told that it had exceeded its capacity and we would have to wait for 1.5 hours to enter. By the time we got into the Gaudi section, the lines were too long to be able to see the inside of the buildings. We did get the iconic photos from the roof, and the view is very good.

This was built between 1886 and 1890 and was commissioned to Gaudi by an industrialist and politician, Eusebl Guell. Gaudi's project centered around an entirely new concept of space, treatment of light, along with rich decorative details in wrought iron, glass, pottery, stone and wood. All of the rooms in the palace had fireplaces with very unique chimneys for all up on the roof of the palace. A very interesting place with lots of stairs. On the basement level were stables that are very unique. I highly recommend visiting this palace to further get a feeling of Gaudi's work."

He could literally do whatever he wanted and it showed in the luxurios and elaborate interiors of the house. I was able to appreciate Gaudi's form and functionality concept with the chimney tops found at the palace's rooftop. They are really nice and pretty. The trencadis technique is apparent and welldone."

Instead, I wandered around back towards La Rambla and stumbled upon Palau Guell. Figuring it was a sign from Fate, telling me I needed to see at least ONE Gaudi residence before I left the city, I waited behind only one person in line, and handed over a reasonable amount of Euros for my ticket. In return? A wealth of information, a \"free\" audio guide, a long unrushed time to enjoy the residence, and beautiful city views from the top. The quality and amount of detail that went into building this was amazing. The stone-, wood-, and tile-work was gorgeous (and I really loved the basement!)Literal crowning glory of the place though is the roof. Who knew chimneys could be so gorgeous?!Definitely recommend! It's literally off La Rambla, pretty close to La Boqueria, so fit it into your day."

The tickets are time-stamped allotting you a certain window, and depending on crowds, you may have to wait a while before you get in. There is not a lot to do in the park otherwise, once you have walked around and enjoyed the outdoors and the jewelry vendors. Not many conveniently located restaurants nearby to kill time either.

Great views of the house from different angles, the planned route is very well thought out. For some reason, this house is missed off the main tourist guides, bus tours etc so it's quieter than the \"big ones\" but still very entertaining and worth a visit.

This is also where the master begin the journey. Guadi has a chance to design this as a first project. It will look lot different from latter work.

The architecture is heavy & dark. It seems more like a fortress than a home. Very closed in & not much light, this is my least favorite Gaudi building. The stable area is more interesting architecturally than the rest of the dull rooms. The saving grace is the rooftop, here is classic Gaudi beautiful , fun, fanciful chimneys. The video guide is difficult to see the screen is so tiny so you stop looking at it , the narration is uninspired. This is not the first Gaudi building to see, you will be disappointed, it is kind of a let down until you get to the rooftop."

It is very quirky and can quite understand how it must have seemed like madness at the time of construction.

With admission you get a personalized tour via headset which makes the place vastly more interesting.

Anyway this museum is right off the Ramblas and also well worth seeing. The Palau was constructed between 1886 and 1890 for aristocrat and industrial tycoon Eusebi Guell by Gaudi and was the family home before moving to Park Guell. The place kind of reminds me of a Venetian palace as it was planned to be a glamorous and functional Catalan art nouveau mansion with a surface of only 400 m2. The oval portals were the entrance for the horse drawn carriages into the stunning basement where the servants also lived. The elevated ground floor contains the magnificent entry hall with a 17 m. high dome, party and dining room. The second floor with the bedrooms, bathroom and toilet are rather conventional. The roof terrace is more startling with 20 chimney's decorated with mosaics of broken pottery. It also affords a great view of the residential surroundings. Guell Palace became a museum in 1945 and was declared a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1984."

You start off in the underground stables - a work of art in themslves, and climb up through the building through magnificent rooms, all decorated in individual styles relevant to the owner at the time that it was built.By the time that you get to the top of the building you will have an idea what it might have been like to inhabit such a place, but as you look out now towards the rear you are reminded that normal people don't live that way. The surrounding buildings are no-where near as grand with washing hanging off the balconies etc...

We could see much more from the free park area (higher and better views), and can view the walkway (with the salamander and the 2 towers) from the main entrance. There were also some architecture sculptures in the free area. If we are ever in the area again, we will just enjoy it from the free area, the fee was too expensive. But then again if this is the first Gaudi piece you see you may feel \"wow\"ed. It was the last one we saw and we did have a huge expectation. Not that we were disappointed with the architecture, I think the overpriced entrance fee (for the minimal area they covered) spoiled the mood. The best thing I saw from there was the school kids playing soccer when a young boy ran around waving at imaginary crowd and blowing kisses after he scored a goal! Goal Barcelona! :)warning: don't be misled when you buy the combined ticket with the sagrada familia - that's only to the museum in the park, not the entrance fee itself!"

This is actually a palace, and the reason to visit would be to admire the rather quirky, unique and completely-different-from-normal aesthetics/ design of this place. It is fascinating to understand how a simple object like a 'chain' and influence design so much. Gaudi was clearly an enormously gifted architect/ designer, and his genius shines through in almost anything and everything that's contained within or a part of this magnificent building. Take a guided group-tour if possible. Access is open to the public only for some areas and not the entire building, which is acceptable. If you are not a stickler for details, it is also possible to do a quick tour in less than an hour or so. If you are a design/ architecture student, you're likely to ask for an annual pass!!"

I made a quick trip out to Palau Guell while visiting Barcelona last October, and based on some of the photos I had seen I was very excited to see and explore such an interesting park. You're able to see most of what makes this park interesting without paying the tour fee to go into the restricted area. I spent most of my time walking the hillside trails exploring but I finally chose to pay the 7 euros and found myself exhausting this restricted touring area in less than 30 minutes. I'm glad I checked it out but it's not something I'll return to like most of the other Gaudi exhibits."

It is all open, from the basement to the roof terrace, and includes one floor which is now a display area. The quality and ingenuity of the workmanship is amazing. There is very little furniture on display, but with the richness of the decoration, this is hardly obvious and may well be a bonus.

The Palau Guell, located not far from Las Ramblas in Raval, is an early work of Gaudi\u2019s career, a spectacular home for the prominent Guell Family (who later commissioned Gaudi for the Parc Guell in a more outlying part of Barcelona).This baronial residence was designed for and lived in by a family with three young children; father was an industrialist and mother a socialite with artistic aspirations. Money was no object and Gaudi made full use of his freedom to create awe-inspiring spaces using the most lavish of materials. You can see the public rooms of the palace as well as the intimate family areas, including the private chapel, monumental reception rooms and grand stairway, and separate bedrooms for each family member upstairs. How interesting that even these privileged members of the 1% had just one small toilet (exquisitely tiled and crowned with a finely enameled porcelain chamber pot) to share! The roof area, with its many whimsically tiled chimneys, is a sunny and playful contrast to the darker, more formal interiors below.We think visitors will enjoy this early example of Gaudi\u2019s genius that also provides a glimpse into the historic lifestyle of Barcelona\u2019s rich and famous."

I want to make an important clarification regarding the numerous reviews and pictures posted to the wrong location here: \"Palau\" is the Catalan word for palace, not park. This is the same family that commissioned Gaudi for their park, and they chose Gaudi to work on their home as well. After seeing two of the homes on the block of discord (Casa Batllo and Casa Lleo Morera), the Sagrada Familia basilica, Parc Guell, and the Picasso Museum, I would rate this as the next best attraction in Barcelona. It was definitely more worthwhile than La Pedrera-Casa Milo and a nice complement to Parc Guell, but I would only make a point of seeing it after the first five attractions I listed or if you have extra time to kill around La Rambla one afternoon. (You need almost an hour for the audio-guided tour.) The style of the palace is \"neo-gothic\"... It is gloomy inside compared to Gaudi's other delights but some of the details were still very impressive (tortoise shell and gold leaf in doors and panels, Gaudi's typical colorful, festive chimneys, the acoustics he considered when he built the family's chapel and attic, etc.) Overall, it serves as a nice contrast to Gaudi's other work and I found the background on the Guell family on the audio tour to be quite informative, but I wouldn't rate it as one of my top 5 \"must sees\" in Barcelona."

Be sure to walk around the sides and see the curving structures that hold everything in place, not just the large columns.The view, even on a cloudy day, stretches to the sea with all of Barcelona laid out in front of you; Sagrada Familia can be seen too.

We were there around 10:30 or 10:45 AM, and were able to spend time without being jostled by crowds. Gaudi's attention to detail is remarkable, and well worth taking the time to appreciate. We had a guide who was very familiar with the property and was able to point out details that we otherwise might have missed. This suggests to me that renting the acoustic guide will really add to your appreciation of his work. We did rent the acoustic guide for the Casa Batllo, and it was indeed worth it. I suspect that it would be easy to overload on Gaudi's buildings, so we limited ourselves to just three, including of course La Sagrada Familia, although we observed some others from the street. These three buildings seemed sufficient to us, but your interest level may be different."

After visiting Casa Batllo, La Pedrera, and La Sagrada Familia on the previous, \"all Gaudi\" day of our Barcelona vacation, we thought we'd hit all the highlights. Our visit to Palau Guell proved us wrong. We found this building contributed greatly to our understanding of and appreciation for, Gaudi's handling of space, light, and texture. Perhaps because we weren't surrounded by a huge crowd (which meant, incidentally, that we were able to walk right up and obtain entrance tickets), we were able to explore each room from various vantage points, and soak in the ambiance of this stunning home. Our pleasure may have been enhanced by the fact that didn't have the same high expectations we brought to the \"big three\" Gaudi sites--we simple didn't know what to expect. Every corner of every floor, from functional areas like the stable to the private rooms and main social space in the interior, merits attention. \"Breathtaking\" may be an overused term, but you can hear visitors literally catch their breath as they step onto the roof terrace, graced with 20 chimneys covered with ceramic and glass fragments (the trencadis ceramic work so familiar from Guell Park). Palau Guell should not be regarded as a brief detour from La Rambla--it is a destination not to be missed."

OK it is a large terraced house.Lots of effort was put into ensuring there was natural light everywhere and maximising the use of space (the chapel is more or less a cupboard). Consideration was made by Gaudi for the type of materials, built-in features and his favourite parabolic curves. The chimneys on the roof also don't disappoint.This may be a bit of an irreverent review, but the palace feels like it could easily be a comfortable home and is well worth a visit to see an architectural combination of art and engineering."

You now have to pay to get to the central area (despite what your guidebook may say!) and pay again if you want to go into Gaudi's house. Realistically there are some columns, the viaducts (inc Washerwoman) and some fancy mosaic work.It's a nice park to visit, but lots of people hanging around waiting for their time to go into the centre. There are better places which are more convenient to the centre of town to get a flavour of art nouveau"

This one rates #2 in my book right after La Sagrada Familia, with #3 being Park Guell. This house is simply a stunning work of gothic and art noveau style, and each room was better than the last with amazing intricacies with every turn. The highlight of which is the roof top, which includes the beautiful chimneys and an amazing panoramic view of the city of Barcelona. If you can only choose 3 Gaudi sites to visit, skip Casa Batllo and replace it with the Guell Palace. Casa Batllo is interesting, but the Guell Palace is simply stunning. Additionally, it is less visited because it was closed for many years for renovation. Lastly, the price of this attraction is more than half the price of the Casa Batllo, and in my opinion visiting the inside of both - a must see in Barcelona."

The palace, or town house, is absolutely stunning. We rented the audio guide for our tour, and it was well worth it, because each room was a masterpiece of Gaudi\u2019s genius and creativity. Gu\u00ebll obviously wanted every detail of his home to be perfection itself, and he spared no money to obtain the best materials from all over the world. This site is underrated and in my mind is about the finest home I have ever had the opportunity to view."

The street traders are a bit monotonous, but the higher up you get the more interesting their wares and some great musicians near the top of the hill, worth the climb, but not for the less mobile. There is quite a climb to the parc from the metro, but we opted for the exercise/stairs rather than escalator to burn off the tapas and alcohol! But it was hard work at times.

It is NOT the same as the house in Guell Park several miles and a taxi ride away."

Everything about it, every aspect of architectural craftsmanship is uniquely mind-blowing. The expense incurred in its construction must have been immeasurable because nothing is second-rate. You have to allow yourself at least one and a half hours to enjoy this and soak it all up. You will be provided with headphones in your entrance ticket that will guide you through each room and you will probably need to listen to the information about each room more than once just to take it all in.

The devil is in the details: note the floor where the carriages drawn by horses entered; those are not the bricks they appear to be but are cork so as to minimize the noise. Go down to the horse stalls to see innovations & up to the living quarters to bathe in the luxury. Take notice of the reception room with grates around the upstairs floor providing a discreet viewing area for the family before they went downstairs to mingle.

We were so impressed and enjoying the park and information area that we chose to return to the flat, purchase online for a specific time the next day and return.For a hot summer day, we arrived for a 10a time and with much of the park and monument still shaded by location and trees it was a cool and enjoyable morning to see the sights and a leisure pace and a pleasant breeze.We learned a great deal from the shared information, guides and historians onsite. Having thoroughly enjoyed our time at Park Guell we highly recommend this visit as one of our most favorite areas in all Barcelona"

You do need to say you want to do the tour (the one I did was at 2pm and in English) when buying your ticket though - you get a special sticker and a ten minute prior to the tour entry time.Another of Gaudi's wonderful creations and thank heavens for Mr Guell for providing the money to make Gaudi's ideas come alive."

We chose to pay, and out of all Gaudis residential creations, this was the best place to visit - much cheaper than the other locations, and much more to see. After visiting Palacio Guell, there's nothing more to see in a place like Casa Mila (there you can see that turn of the century apartment, that can be seen in museums all over Europe). There's also a small museum inside that explains about Gaudis vision, you'll see this kind of museum in other Gaudi creations (there's one to in the Segarda Familia, but it is quite different). The Photos I added speak for themselves. I recommend taking the audio guide - at most places, they audio guide is a drag, speaking about subjects that are not always interesting, but in PG it is very interesting and to the point. Right near the Rambla, well worth a visit. If you're short on time, after visiting it you can skip other Gaudi residential houses - most of them are (while highly rated here) are expensive tourists traps."

The park is beautiful and the real winners, as is usual for Barcelona is the Gaudi buildings. The place is a tribute to modern urban planning done over 100 years ago. Great place to take children and their guardians will enjoy it as well."

It offers stunning, picturesqure views out over Barcelona and a chance to view some of Gaudi's most famous work. We would recommend you buy tickets in advance for access to the monumental zone, as only a certain amount of people are let in at a time and you are assigned a time zone for when you can enter. In our experience this time zone was quite a bit later than when we actually arrived at the park (around 1.30pm, and we couldn't enter until 4.30pm). But it was well worth the wait and you're free to explore the free bit of the park and take in the views. The Gaudi architecture in the monumental zone is beautiful and intricate, with plenty to see, so we felt it was worth the admission price. As one last tip, we would recommend taking your own food and drinks as the food offered inside the park is limited and extremely pricey!"

Hmmmm - but having got there we decided to get the tickets - HINT - there is a place on the left as you walk back down the street from the main ticket entrance - it looks horrible/ typical tourist signs etc - STOP HERE - great patio / garden and meal out back - if you have to wait this is the place to do it.Other gripes - why pay for the ticket - after doing the tour we realised you can see 90% just by walking round the gardens and around the main entrance towers - believe me - the rest inside is not worth a single dime or a spent minute Next warning- be aware if you are using either tour bus route - the bus stop is on the main street and this place is a long walk up hill in the sun and heat - so those with older / infirm / small kids / pushchairs be aware of this - maybe look at it on the internet instead of visiting and save time / money and grief - if you really must - I mean really really must go - still DON'T"

Use you T10 pass and the bus drops you off right in front of the park!

Also a good feeling for life of wealthy persons home. Visited afternoon in June on Wed, and no waiting/ very uncrowded. Audio guide is free and explained a lot about Guell and why so many things were named after him. Amazing job of restorationI saw a wheelchair get to several floors. It's not totally accessible, but still worth seeing. Note that other reviews discussing the \"park\" are not talking about Guell Palace, but about Guell park!"

The adjoining restaurant is decidedly mediocre, and we were somewhat forced to cool our heels there for over an hour waiting for our time slot to enter the park. There are some well-known sights where everyone has the compunction to take their photos and then you're done.

While Barcelona has many landmarks that other cities can offer (there are better cathedrals in Europe than La Sagrada Familia and marinas with clearer waters than Barceloneta), Parc Guell is not one of them. This park undoubtedly affords you the best views in town and has the most unique architecture you'll ever witness. It's a great maze to get lost in, and the symbol of this park is Guell Palace, which overlooks the entire city. Take the metro to arrive here and walk up a long flight of stairs before you enter the park, but the hike is well worth it!"

Palau Guell has much in the way of fine ironwork, stained glass, paintings, decorative woodwork etc. The rooftop, though not as amazing as Casa Mila, is still worth the climb to the top, with its fantasy roofscape of mosaic chimneys.

If the Sagreda Familia is Gaudi's masterpiece and La Pedrera his tourist trap, Palau G\u00fcell is so far ignored by most of the tourists, and his probably his maddest and yet most classic creation. You enter in a mad cross between an art deco house and a Lovecraftian nightmare, and any Agatha Christie murder story would be well at home.Unlike the Pedrera, you visit the whole house from the stables to the attic and the roof, and I really recommend the Audio guided tour (available in many languages), without which you'd probably miss most of what makes this building unique.Crazy, megalomaniac, and strangely appealing, Palau G\u00fcell is truly one of Barcelona's yet hidden architectural treasures."

Showed up and got the last tickets of the day, paying full price. We technically had an hour in the museum and the audio guide was 40 mins long. So, we should have had plenty of time to see everything with the guide before the museum closed, but the staff pretty much rushed us through closing each floor one by one so that we finished everything in like 35 minutes. It was kind of ridiculous and not worth the full admission price for that. That said, however, it was a relatively interesting house. The main floor and basement are quite impressive, however the rest of the rooms were not really furnished the way I thought they might be had the family been living there. Maybe try to see Casa Batllo or La Pedrera instead if you only have a few days in Barcelona."

The audio guide was very informative, although frustratingly we couldn't access the extra snippets that it occasionally offered us.The main hall in particular is beautiful: relatively small, due to the small footprint available for the building, but perfectly formed. During a recent restoration the existing pipe organ was replaced and occasionally during our visit it burst into life to give visitors an idea of the excellent acoustic of the space and what it might have been like to attend a recital here during the building's heyday."

The last place one would expect to find a magnificent town villa is in the middle of the somewhat oppressive darkness of the Carrier Nou de la rambla. I am pleased,nevertheless,that Mr. Guell decided to build one here and for choosing Gaudi as his architect with complete freedom to creative licence. One can only imagine what it felt like to arrive in a coach and ride through the gateway,to be blown away by the visual splendour and imaginative style awaiting your senses. Stepping out of your imaginary carriage,you would have been bowled over by the amazing,mystical domed hall that rises through the floors,shrouded in darkness,reminiscent of a medieval inner courtyard This is a home of someone at once religious yet avant-garde. The dome was engineered so that light penetrates slightly through minute apertures,creating a star- filled firmament. the living space is more intimate but hardly less grand. Gaudi pulled out all stops here,combining artistic and imaginative innovation with an interesting Arts & Crafts form. The interior has canopies,arched galleries,decorative window glass and wall coverings.... carvings and extravagant furniture fill the inexhaustible creative imagination at play here. The roof is probably the most well known due to its amusing ventilation shafts and biomorphic decorations. Loved this whimsy and imaginative concept,to bits"

If you enter via the free part, follow signs to C 'Olot (Carrer d'Olot) or just look around for the Gaudi mosaic-clad buildings to get your bearings.We found it hard to find the pre-book line so, if in doubt, ask a staff member. In summary, Carrer d'Olot has a big flight of steps at one end, two Gaudi buildings in the middle, and big gates at the other end. Enter via the gates and turn hard left. Also, we came from Vallcarca Metro station, which has escalators up the very steep approach to the park, but not much in the way of sign-posting, so take a good streetmap.Possibly the navigation to the park is more straightforward from Lesseps Metro station, but I've heard the walk may be steeper."

The audioguide is included in the small price (which is well worth it compared to other Gaudi buildings like la Sagrada Familia, la Casa Battl\u00f2 or La Pedrera) and is essential to understand the visit and the use of each room. At first, the palace seems more simple and down to earth than other Gaudi creations, but as you reach the upper floors and the roof, you realize that the style becomes more and more Gaudi-crazy. The palace itself is in a pristine state and well maintained, parts of the roof are in renovation, but nothing too bad. Don't rush past the main room or you'll miss the organ playing every few minutes."

Head phones if you have them with you.The a palace itself is a stunning piece of architecture that you can.

We went early and got timed tickets for an hour later but this was fine as a wander around the Gothic quarter is a perfect way to pass an hour.

It also shows the lifestyle of the Guell family who lived there. As Gaudi's first house, it is not as over-the-top as Casa Batllo, and also does not have the long lines to get in. Located just off the Rambla and not far from the Bari Goti, it is well worth a quiet hour.

These are poems, songs to the unrestrained joy of creating entirely new forms that still somehow seem intimately related to what came before them. They are colour, free of its referential function--pure expressive elements. The fascinating, spiralling vents are abstract sculpture. The undulating benches are serpentine meditations on the flow of water becoming utilitarian joy. No wonder Barcelona justly celebrates Gaudi. He has created the city AS art. Go. Go.

The visit to Guell Palace is a must. If you have to see only one paid site, this is the one. The 12 Euro per person is well worth every penny. Finally the audio aid should be used to identify each space in question. Please do not run it numerically since it will distract you from the beauties of the place.

The visit includes an audio guide, which is great because you get to learn a lot about the history of the place as well as the architect\u00b4s. This Palace was entrusted to Gaud\u00ed by Eusebius Guell, a millionaire in the 1930s. It has the typical touch of the genius, strange and beautiful. The woodden ceilings, the round benches, the corridors full of light. A true masterpiece, one of the many from the Gaud\u00ed legacy. I absolutely recommend it."

My final day in the Catalan centre, I visited the Palace Guell (Palau G\u00fcell) as I read this was one Gaudi\u2019s most famous masterpiece after the Sagrada Familia.With my luggage in hand, and ready to leave the sunny city, I squeezed this visit into my itinerary and I\u2019m so glad I did. Just off the lower part of \u2018La Rambla\u2019 this place is truly an epic achievement by Gaudi. The ticket office is located in the adjacent building and I was lucky as the visit is FREE for the first Sunday of the month! Maybe it was a Sunday afternoon, but the crowds or queue was next to nothing at all.I received a free guide and paid the \u20ac1 euro for lockers, got on my way in this dark mystical yet slightly gothic masterpiece of a tour. The attention to details in the architecture from the ceiling in the rooms to the intricate design of the doors paves an exhilarating journey through Gaudi\u2019s imagination. The organ situated in the heart, which I heard pulse a few of its chord, of the building is an impressive feature but the whole design is just impeccable. To be fair, having not been entirely blown away by the \u2018Sagrada Familia\u2019 I found my respect manifest twofold in Gaudi\u2019s vision and raw capability as an architect. You get to climb right onto the roof top for some \u2018interesting\u2019 designs, I must say \u2013 a bit untoward and not really flowing with the overall feel of the interior. It\u2019s also a contrast to see, from the rooftop, the nearby terrace and how unprivileged the neighbours seem to be living. Take a flash, as the lighting conditions are quite dark and be sure not to miss the cellar which is a bizarre experience in itself.All in all, I am grateful to have listened to my gut and made the effort to stop by. Even from the outside, you get a sneak peek through wonderfully designed windows but the only justice is entering and witnessing it yourself!"

But when you get to the roof you can definitely see some of Gaudi's touch in the chimneas. They are definitely a worth the visit. If you have time I would recommend seeing this palace, but you should definitely see the park or Sagrada Familia first if you're on a limited time schedule.

If you only have time for one Guadi house, I'd recommend this.The first architectural commission for the Guell family by Guadi, designed in his impressive modernist style. You can definitely tell this is the beginning of his architectural journey, the Palau isn't as out-landish as the other houses you can visit in the block of discord.Unlike some of the other Guadi houses you can visit, this recently renovated building allows you to tour practically every room/floor, from the basement stables to the roof. It has a fantastic roof with the mosaic chimneys of Guadi you'd expect. It isn't as colourful on the inside as Casa Batll\u00f3 and as based on form as La Pedrera perhaps a little mor fussy in decoration.Included in the price there was an audio guide, a small 5min video presentation And whilst we were there we got to hear the organ play. In comparison to some of the other houses it is a little cheaper to visit.Within the attic space is an exhibition on construction/renovation of the building, with touchscreen info. Plenty to read if you have the time/inclination."

I appreciate Gaudi was commissioned to design the palace by the Guell family, however for me it was way over the top on the word extravagant. The architecture is of course breathtaking but for me it was too dark and looked a little like an over done funeral home....if you like that sort of thing then you will love it. I am just giving my opinion. Enjoy either way as it is still quite interesting...."

Guell Palace has a problem for some of us - you are wisked by express elevator from the ground floor to the magnificent roof top ... and then you have to step out onto the rooftop. The walls/parapets are waist height and for anyone with vertigo the experience is bowel activating. Once you manage to stop screaming and are led to the stairs to the next level down it all gets a lot calmer since you are now safely inside. So, go there, enjoy but if someone in your party hates heights SERIOUSLY think about buying them a coffee somewhere and leaving them there."

Since it was very close to our hotel, we decided to tour another Gaudi creation. The palace is less than a block off the La Rambla and is not on a scary street. We went in the morning and there were few tourists which was wonderful. The entry fee is 12 euros but there are discounts for students and professors but you do need proof. The audioguide is included in the fee. Guell was a wealthy businessman and a patron of Gaudi. Gaudi was commissioned to build a luxurious palace in a relatively small area boxed in with other buildings in the old part of Barcelona. Underground there are unique horse stables in true Gaudi style. The 3 story central hall is absolutely exquisite. There is more detail in this palace than at the Casa Batlo. The roof is colorful with the different tiled chimneys. I would highly recommend going to this palace. We bought the guidebook in their small gift shop which is very descriptive and a real keepsake."

Somehow we were placed on the stairs and had a lengthy climb to the attic where the tour begins. The attic is not really an \"attic\" but a common user floor for the building occupants. Now the \"attic\" is the museum. On the day of our visit, a high school class came through the building. Again this building has current occupants. The roof is spectacular, not to be missed."

Sure as you'll eat a lot of tapas, when in Barcelona you'll see long queues tailing back from the doors of Gaudi's La Segrada Familia, La Pedrera and Casa Batllo. Puzzlingly, you won't find them at Palau Guell, another Gaudi-designed building that, to my taste, is the best of all his domestic architecture.The Guell Palace is just off the Rambla, a short walk from the Boqueria Market. If anything, it's closer to the main tourist flight path, and therefore more convenient, than the the more famous buildings. There are other reasons it should be higher on the tourist hit list. It was his first significant, complete house design, created in his mid-30s. You can see both the young genius, and the roots of the style that would stretch through his whole career. It's the grandest and most complete of his domestic buildings open to the public. La Pedrera is an apartment building with only one middle-class dwelling restored and open (described in my entry last year), and Batllo is a house that had apartments on upper floors (not part of your tour). Guell is an urban palace, all of its floors and rooms devoted to the life of one family, and all recently restored and laid open for you to wander about.It's wonderful from the very beginning, when you're greeted by sinuous ironwork on the doors and come into a a ground floor that's essentially a big, integrated port cochere. Carriages came in one side, and out the other. Between them an impressive dark marble staircase ascending to the formal door. (Pictured above.) Behind that, a turning space and a circular ramp descending to basement stables, beautiful in their own right for their unusual brick columns.The tour, which comes with an excellent audio guide, takes you from bottom to top. First, the processional entry that brought guests to the exquisite entertainment rooms. Gaudi's naturalistic, modernist style is evident in tendrils of ironwork wrapping around light standards, early appearances of his catenary arches and the strange curves of wood and stone. But there's more traditional Arts and Crafts style here in glazed tiles, faux Medieval carving, stained glass and impressive Arabic-style ceilings. The most impressive room here is the central hall, at least three times higher than it was wide, creeping heavenward with those distinctive arches. Gaudi punched holes in the dome to let light through, used a lot of gold, built in an organ and inset a gold-encrusted chapel on one side behind folding doors. Party space, concert hall and heaven-looking church, all in one.Then you get to clamber up to the family rooms, where the vine-and-leaf inspired decor around the arches of the master suite turns the rooms into an outdoor bower. Though the house is mostly empty of furniture, the recent restoration places photos in many rooms showing what they were like when occupied. Revealing an interesting truth about Gaudi. Stripped down to the bare architecture, his rooms are exquisite. Filled with late Victorian furniture, rugs, pot plants and ephemera, they're just too much. I doubt any other architect has been done such a big favour by having his work emptied of its original furnishings.Any good Gaudi building leads you to the roof. The man was obsessed with bizarre chimney pots, after all, and the Guell Palace offers a riot of colour on a Disney scale. More than anything else in the house, the roof points towards the dramatic departure from the norm that the rest of his work would take. The finials of La Segrada Familia, still under construction today, are here at Palau Guell \u2026 finished 140 years ago."

It is not nearly as well publicized as CasaBatllo, La Pedrera, Sagrada Fanilia or Parc Guell. It is located very close to the Ramblas and Boqueria but not as busy. It is earlier work of Gaudi and gives hints at what's to come in his career. The self guided tour with audio pack is very well done. Good explanations with lots of detail and some pictures. We never felt rushed. You can revisit a room, lots of photo opportunities. While you can touch most thongs, you might be in such awe that you do it very reluctantly. The building is beautifully maintained.One caveat: In the entrance hall you are told how you can see out the door window but not in. If you go to check for yourself, don't get too close to the door - you will set off an alarm like I did. I wasn't hustled out quickly and they were nice in explaining what happened - still scares the devil out of you."

One of the first was the Palau, the mansion for the G\u00fcell family in the heart of the old quarter of Barcelona. This is one of Gaud\u00ed's early works, in an almost austere modernista style. There are no multicolored broken mosaics here, no playful salamanders. It is a magnificent home, starkly beautiful, with a sometwhat somber atmosphere. There is splendid wrought iron work, wood work, tile work all throught the mansion.It is one of my favorite Gaud\u00ed works along with Casa Battl\u00f3.

It's more likea pocket size medieval castle which seems to influence muchof the style of the halls and principal rooms. The ramps downto the former stables are just one touch of Gaudi's ingenuity.Dark wood panelling seems to dominate and no doubt it was what Mr Guell wanted, certainly not light. I guess the strongpoints are the layout between the main rooms with balconiesfor musicians etc. Unfortunately many of the upper family rooms lack furniture. Up on the roof (several floors/ stairs) there's anamazing array of Gaudi's trademark \"trencadis\" styledornamental chimneys and ventilation shafts. "

Each of his rooms is unique and all the architecture is just amazing. There are no straight lines or corners in the entire place.The tour starts with the amazing staircase and ends on top of the roof where you can see his crazy statues and a view of the city in all directions. Mind you most of the view on top is blocked by other buildings. However, it is still nice to look and imagine what this view looked like back in the day before some of the other buildings were built. The tour includes an audio guide. I think it's available in five different languages. One tip to avoid the line, you can buy your tickets online. But they do charge you an extra fee which is around five euros and that includes all the tickets you purchase ( I think )"

Other rooms (where people lived), especially on other floors, are less interesting, so not sure if the price is worth it (although probably it's a must see, if you're going to Barcelona).The palace is pretty much accessible for handicapped, except for the roof. There is a small elevator which can go to all floors, except for the roof. I say 'pretty much', because for some reason they have one step to enter the elevator on the ground floor. Don't know why they made it so, but it means you need help to enter the elevator.The staff there are friendly and helpful, although not all speak English and those who do, have difficulties understanding it."

That was the work of a young man still in his twenties. Nevertheless, if I had to choose between the architectural style at Palau Guell and that of Sagrada Familia, the latter wins hands down. I prefer the graceful lines, the arches, the curves, the light effects at the basilica. At Palau Guell, things are more geometric, robust, muscular, in fact full of testosterone, and a bit dark. To each his own, I guess. All of the above notwithstanding, Palau Guell is a must see, to appreciate Gaudi when he was young and full of energy. Apparently, the visit is free on Tuesday, if you don't mind the mob. We had to pay to get in, and unlike the Picasso Museum and Foundation Joan Miro, you are allowed to take pictures at will."

Of course, there's only a tiny sign at the ticket office so you only discover this when you queued for a while and of course, it's still 12 euros.Without the terrace the visit is quite monochromatic and a huge side of Gaudi's work is not visible as the chimney up there are fantastic and colourful so it is very bad value for money."

A lot of the reviews for this item are talking about Parc Guell, Casa Mila/La Pedrera and Casa Battlo, not Palau Guell - so if you see references to undulating roofs, views etc, bear that in mind.Palau Guell is one of Gaudi's earlier works and is about 100 feet from La Ramblas. It is a large mansion with some amazing details but is not as wild and wacky as some of the other Gaudi buildings. Gaudi designed the building as a home for his major benefactor, Eusebi Guell, and it has only recently been opened for tours.Tickets for the tour of the home are time-stamped - meaning that if it is busy, you may not be able to arrive, buy a ticket and start your visit immediately. When we went, we arrived at 5pm and the earliest ticket we could get was for 7pm. I therefore recommend that you combine your visit with a walk up the Ramblas or a visit to the Boqueria market - grab your ticket to Palau Guell first and if there is a wait, you can go look at other things in the meantime.Once inside the home, your ticket includes an audio tour that will guide you around the home explaining the history and pointing out the architectural details. As noted above, the design is not as wild as some of the other houses but still includes lots of amazing elements that show just how smart Gaudi was in his thinking - from cellars that kept the foods cool to stairways with special steps to climb on your horse or carriage to a stunning wood ceiling. The house has been wonderfully restored including the addition of a new organ which was being played while we toured.As a result of the less wild aspects, I'd say this is more of a location for people interested Gaudi or in interesting design and architecture and may be less interesting for young children."

I had some time in the afternoon in Barcelona and headed straight for this Place near La Ramblas as I passed by this Mansion quite a few times. In the heart of La Ramblas, towards the left as you approach from Columbus Memorial is the Palau Guell. Bang opposite it is a Hotel, aptly named as Gaudi Hotel and all along you can see souvenir shops, all selling supposedly Gaudi works of Art and Design!The entry fee to this place is 12 Euros, which I felt is a little high considering most places have around 5 -6 Euros all around. The entry is also timed, so you might have to wait up in a queue for a while. I was lucky though to reach by 12 noon and by 12:15 am I got in. Once inside, they provide you with a handyphone and a booklet for the tour. You move ahead and there are lockers for you to store your things in while you go visiting the Mansion. Rest, the handphone guides you on its own! Every room, every area is marked and you just need to press the right number in the phone, the audio tour starts talking to you and tells you what you need to look at in every area and also understand its importance. I got quite a couple of shots! The Mansion is huge and spreads upwards floor after floor. Guell really spent a fortune and Gaudi spent no effort in utilizing every last bit of his penny!! Its a great place to start your Gaudi experience and the Palace leaves you with a lingering memory of abstract modernism and you are left asking for more!"

You pay \u20ac8 (2013)for an audiotour of nearly one hour, there is also a shorter version (e.g. for children). The audiotour gives loads of nice info, and you get to walk around in your own tempo, which I enjoy: stay longer in the rooms you like, and maybe skip the duller bits (hardly any.....!). I think the building really deserves at least one hour of your time.There is a lot of intricately decorated woodwork, beautiful arched windows, stained glass inside and outside, and lots more.Every half hour the organ plays a tune, you hear it throughout the building. Be sure to go all the way to the roof at the top of the building, for some lovely Gaudiesque chimneys. From the roof one can see how this very special building is completely surrounded by 'normal' apartments and offices. Weird."

You can see how well this is preserved! 125yrs old.Note the \"chimneys\" and the spires at the Sagrada Familia Church. Come into the main lobby (upstairs) and look to the sky, then do the same at the main alter at the Sagrada Familia. Gaudi had this design in his head for 30 years....The Organ plays every hour and it's amazing, it made me cry it was so beautiful.My question is: where's the showers and tubs? And only 2 bathrooms? If you are staying on the La Rambla, this is only a block off the blvd. Kids get a 1/2 price discount as do single parents. 10E for dad and son."

This former home of industrialist Eusebi G\u00fcell, designed by famous Catalan architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, is spectacular and not to be missed. Unlike other Gaud\u00ed buildings in Barcelona, this one was never packed with tourists when we visited on two occasions, perhaps because its renovation was completed not that long ago and people aren't aware that it's open. The soaring and domed main hall, the elaborate coffered ceilings, the exquisite windows and the fanciful chimneys and vents on the roof are simply breathtaking. One warning: The roof is closed in rainy weather, and it must be seen to be believed, so make sure you visit in good weather."

Of the five essential Gaudi works to see in Barcelona, I would rate this 5th after the Sagrada Familia, Casa Batilo, La Pedrera, and Parc Guell. It is an earlier work (ca 1885-90) which shows some features later used in the other structures but overall is more conventional in terms of materials and design. E.g. the outside is rather plain except for the two parabolic arches and the wrought ironwork.By the way, many of the reviews here are actually for Parc (park) Guell and not for Palau (palace) Guell. TripAdvisor needs to get these reviews into the proper spots. Maybe that is why the Palau rates overall higher on the \"to see\" list. To be sure, it is definitely worth a visit, especially if you're already on La Ramblas. Figure at least two hours. Use the audio guide, otherwise you won't have a clue.The overall structure is surprisingly compact (area 500 sq meters but 6 floors counting the basement) and gives an idea of how the super rich lived in the late 19th century. The floors and ceilings are mostly wood (not the later elaborate stucco ceilings) and stone walls. Very ornate -- not in the sense of the King's palace in Madrid -- but ornate nonetheless. Hopefully, be there when the wonderful organ plays. A bit spooky -- like the Phantom of the opera!The overall plan is innovative and very much like the concepts of shape and lighting later expanded in Batilo and Pedrera. But I won't go into details. You need to discover it for yourself. Even though this is an earlier work, I think many visitors will be better seeing Batilo and Pedrera first because then they will appreciate some of the key elements of Gaudi's genius. I also liked La Pedrera more because it included period furniture and there is essentially a museum in the attic that explains much of his work. So, see at least La Pedrera first and Palau Guell after."

Guell hired Gaudi when he was young and was his major patron. From the front door, the interiors,, the hardware, the decoration, the acoustics, and lighting was designed by Gaudi with a lot detail, substance, and functionality. This is four story structure for a family of five with the bedrooms in the upper floors. It was only used for five years before Mrs. Guell complained and the family moved to a house in Parque Guell. By the pronunciation of Guell is similar to Way."

We selected to buy ticket to get into this Palau Guell instead of the Casa Batlo and Casa Mila (which we just viewed from the outside) and we didn't regret it. The Palace was very well maintained and reviewed the life style of a wealthy man in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The location was a bit hidden and easily missed though."

First of all, there seems to be a bit of confusion on trip advisor between Guell Palace, which is a Gaudi commissioned house just off Las Ramblas, and Parc Guell, which is the unfinished housing development in the Northern suburbs of the city that Gaudi was later commissioned to build for the same family. Guell Palace is one of Gaudi's early commissions and has only recently been renovated and open to the public. Presumably, the fact that it's new to the Gaudi tourist itinerary accounts for the low admission price of 12 euros, which includes an audio guide. This is a bargain compared to the 20 euro plus admission for the other houses. The house is impressive in that it demonstrates the various functions of a central Barcelona town house in the early years of the 20th century - a stable for the horses, a chapel for the family, an office for the industrialist, a venue for socialising and entertaining, as well as living accommodation for the family and servants. The Gaudi style is unmistakeable and the attention to detail remarkable. Overall , though, the house feels quite cold and austere. Maybe its the lack of direct sunlight due to the city centre location, maybe its the lack of domestic furniture. Either way, whilst i admire Gaudi's style, I find it difficult to imagine a family actually living here in comfort, and it came as no surprise to hear on the audio guide that the mistress of the Guell household hated the place! For an example of an art nouveau house that is entirely liveable in, try the Modernista Museum in Novelda, which is a bit of the beaten track but is wonderful and has free admission!"

Antoni Gaudi was such a fascinating and ecentric architect, Palau Guell is a great opportunity to see his work up close. The walking tour is semi self-guided (you are given a hand-held device that narrates specifics of the house) but you can walk at your own pace. The best part of the house? The rooftop: an uneven, colorful display of trencad\u00eds (mosaic of pieces of ceramic). If you don't look up, the house sits almost unassuming on a side street and because we went during the \"off season\", we actually passed the house once before we realized where it was. We were able to buy tickets immediately, but I've heard that during busier times, there can be a line. Overall, a very interesting attraction unique to Barcelona that is highly recommended."

Nevertheless, this is another brilliant piece of work by Gaudi."

Although he built this as a family home for the Guells, it is reported that they did not enjoy living in it (neither would I!). Magnificent and fairly traditional craftsmanship in every room/stairway/ceiling/wall and a few of Gaudi's later trademarks, such as the parabolic arches and the mad chimneys finished in trencadis (broken tiles). Worth a visit on any level, whether a Gaudi fanatic or a casual holidaymaker."

Not too many negatives to speak of, but they're pervasive and affected my overall impression of the tour. Here are my negatives: its a long, boring tour with spotty electronic devices. You're given an electronic device with the audio portion of the tour pre-loaded. You select the audio track number that corresponds with the room you're in or the item you're looking at and hit play. You walk around the palace and continue to go through those motions. There is a LOT of history that they pack into the audio, and for me, it became dry and repetitive. Also, my audio device seemed faulty (my fault for not getting a new one). I couldn't skip tracks. If I tried to go forward, it only repeated the track I just listened to. Halfway through, I essentially abandoned the audio guide. Eh.That being said, the palace is absolutely stunning, showing the intricacies and versatility of Gaudi's architectural style. He built the palace in his usual-unusual manner and also crafted functional furniture into the palace's walls, railings, etc. It really is a sight to behold. The view on the roof is gorgeous, and I feel a trip to Barcelona for the first time would be incomplete without a trip to the roof of the Guell Palace. As you can tell, I have mixed feelings about the tour, but I still do feel this is a \"must see\"."

It's a Gaudi masterpiece so expect brilliance as you won't be disappointed. The complexity and quality of the build is simply awesome and they let you take photos everywhere.

I thought maybe tax was included but when I checked my other receipts, I noticed I wasn't charged anything on top of the listed entrance fees for La Sagrada Familia, Casa Mila or Casa Batll\u00f3. I'm sure (or at least I hope) it was an honest mistake but I'd advise you to double check the total before paying. I was pretty good at checking when it came to restaurants but it slipped my mind to double check when it came to the sites."

Don't get me wrong, this is a World `Heritage site but if you come expecting a Gaudi spectacular like La Pedrera or the Sagrada Familia, you won't get that. Yes, the Palau, built for the tycoon, Eusebi Guell, shows many touches of the master. However, the interior is mainly darker woods (take a few flash photos and you will see how beautiful that actually are), which creates a slightly gloomy effect in places. I am sure he built what his client asked for. But as I said, there are touches of the master that you may miss: the decorations outside the front door, leaf-like structures, and a beautiful living room window. It's worth looking closely and listening to the excellent audio guide. Very impressive and beautifully restored. But just one more thing: Gaudi loved chimneys. When I stepped out to see these, I actually laughed out aloud: I could hear him saying, \"well, I'm sure they will never come up here, so now I can do what I like!\" . Wonderfully decorated chimneys, spectacular 'trencadis' (broken tile) patterns, the lizard sitting motionless (for a very long time !!) on one chimney, and , last but not least, the glorious weather vane in the form of a bat. It might not be top of the list but the Palau Guell is certainly worth a visit if you have the time to see all the works of Gaudi in Barcelona."

The centerpiece of the house was the organ installed in the central room/atrium. Unfortunately the original organ was deteriorated beyond repair and a new one was installed during the renovation. While I was visiting the organ began playing and the music filled the house. They have several times during the day when the organ plays. Try to schedule your visit around these times.

There are some very unusual and beautiful rooms especially the main hall and dining room and the roof has some very interesting Gaudi pinnicales in a range of colourful tiles. This museum more than any other I visited gives a full look at Gaudi's domestic architectural style. It has a nice gift shop. Highly recommended."

The palace has been splendidly restored and can be visited with the help of an outstanding audioguide.We recommend making Palau Guell the first stop on your tour of Modernista buildings because it is an early project of Gaudi. Therefore it provides a good introduction to his work and it will allow you to appreciate how he gradually developed his own unique style.The fa\u00e7ade of Palau Guell is a lot less extravagant than his later work, being dominated by straight lines and lacking colour. However the architect already uses parabolic arches and displays his love for wraught iron with two magnificent entrance gates.The back of the palace is dominated by an impressive bay-window with balcony and on the roof you will find the typical chimneys with ceramics decoration.A second reason to include Palau Guell in your agenda is the wealth of its interior. There is very little furniture on display but the decoration of walls and ceilings in the public rooms at first floor level is simply breathtaking and unseen in any other Modernista building we visited (apart from Palau de la Musica).Among the highlights feature the entrance hall, the piano room, the smoking room, the dining room, the waiting room for guests and the three storey central hall. We advise scheduling about three hours for an in depth visit."

We went anyways since the weather was not great the whole time we were there. The entrance is small and can be missed. Just head to the right after the ticket booth to one of the partitioned lines."

Reopened after an extensive restoration, the home of Gaudi's most important client, Eusebi G\u00fcell, is instructive in understanding the development of Gaudi's style. His use of wood and wrought iron in this home was a new discovery for me, and his use of the parabolic arches at the entrance to allow carriages to come and go without exposing their passengers to the weather is prescient. Gaudi designed this home to cater to the family's every convenience, allowing them to view what is happening in the public areas from floors away, saving them many steps. His fanciful chimneys are a delight and so colorful atop the home."

We went to the Guell Palace on the first Sunday of the month when the entrance is for free. The ticket system is quite clever, at different times during the day (check the website for the exact times) free tickets are distributed at the counter. Those tickets are for a specific time slot so most likely you'll have to come back at a certain time later that day. The biggest plus about this system is that since there are only a limited amount of tickets per time slot the palace is never extremely crowded which increases the joy of the visit. Try to be on time though, we arrived a tiny bit late and initially the guard at the door did not want to let us in. Luckily the staff of the palace is extremely friendly and the lady who had before given us the tickets at the counter recognized us and let us in. When you enter the palace you get an audio-guide for free which gives very extensive information on the whole palace and its numerous architectural treasures as well as the private lives of the Guell family. The whole tour takes about 90 minutes and leads you through every room of the palace (there is no furniture in the palace so it's all about the architecture and history). When we went the weather was not too good so the beautiful roof was closed for visit which was of course a shame but I can't blame the palace for that, safety first.In short, the palace is totally worth a visit and if I would have gone on a regular day I would have gladly paid the entrance fee."

I ended up listening to the entire audio-guide (which I never do), and had a great time wandering through this place. Of course it's personal preference, but my wife and I agreed that we liked this better than Casa Batllo. This is mostly because of the condition of this building. I think it's run by the government, so it's quite well done. The Casa Batllo is impressive in it's own right (especially the outside), but there are still tenants in the building and it's somewhat marred by the mundane exit signs and functional metal rails that I'm sure have been put in over time for practical use."

Even using wooden cobbles internally so that the horses hooves didn't make a noise."

This is the house of Gaudi, and as you would imagine, it is empty rooms, hallways, etc. where he and his family lived--nothing too out-of-the-ordinary. Simply put, you are given an audio guide and as you walk through the house, you key in the numbers that you see as you walk around the room and you can hear about the history and design of the house. I did however like the roof of the house because it felt very Gaudi-inspired where many of the other rooms felt/looked like, well, just rooms. If you are a huge Gaudi fan, a visit to this house would be interesting, but for those guests who are not really into Gaudi, I would choose a different way to spend your time and money."

It's not that the audio guide set is filthy or anything (I'm sure the staff sanitize it regularly), it's just that it can get quite tiring holding the device up next to your ears throughout your visit. So just plug in your earphones (standard 3.5mm audio jack) and just hang the audio guide set around your neck while you tour this mesmerizing place.Just let your imagination take over and simply think Guell Palace is a small compartment of Gaudi's brain which magically became this building. You will realize much of the inspiration for Gaudi's design has been drawn from the shapes and patterns of nature and from the way I see it, it serves as a vindication to mass production. It makes me wonder when did I lose touch and all sensitivity to nature and my surrounding.Anyway, this is one of the attractions which you should go early and go light."

The design of the chapel to make it look like there were stars on the ceiling was fascinating. The chimneys and the undulating roof was very interesting.We were travelling with our three small children and we were pleasantly surprised to find that the audioguide was included with the admission ... even for the kids. AND, they have a kids version of the audioguide with shorter explanations and theres a puzzle they can solve using the touchscreen on the audioguide.

No expense was spared in its construction so it truly reflects Gaudi's vision with curved lines, innovative use of materials, and a fantastic rooftop. Every visitor to Barcelona should visit at least one Gaudi house, and Palau Guell is very conveniently located to La Rambla and the Barri Gotic. Some writers have commented negatively on the cost, but these houses are expensive to restore and maintain, and tourists should bear their share of the cost. It is definitely worth going inside as you cannot appreciate Gaudi's genius just from the facade."

It's an amazing building, full of Modernista (Catalan Art Nouveau) details- and even a huge organ which is played regularly. It's dark and mysterious in parts, with typical Gaud\u00ed touches of curves and arches, gold leaf, dark stone, stained glass (I must say, I can understand that his wife didn't actually like living in it!). The view from the rooftop is splendid.Perhaps my only reservation is that it's not furnished and feels a bit \"unloved\".

And if you like architecture history, this project sets the stage for all his other commissions to come, including the Sagrada Familia. You get to see everything from the vaulted stables to the undulating rooftop. It's a block off the Rambla on Carrer Nou, and well worth the ten euro price of admission (audio tour is included)."

I didn't see the stats on how many craftsmen actually toiled over the details in this magnificent tribute to the skilled use of chisels and saws, but Norm Abram must have been dumbfounded and awestruck when HE first saw it!For sure, put it in your top 10 to-do list when in Barcelona."

The point is that you can't do relevant pictures because the building ios on a relatively narrow street. So, after peaking on the main entrance and discovering that the cue was not long we decided to buy tickets and visit the Palau. It was worth every penny of the EUR 10 price for adults (kids visit for free). You get to know about gaudi's life and friendship with his main sponsor Guell while exploring a representative masterpiece of his creation. It's a luxury residence actually inhabited by a (rich) family so you get to see how Gaudi thought of making their living pleasant and functional.The roof is even more spectacular with interesting slopes and splendid tilled chimneys which are a trademark of Gaudi.Go there, it will be a well invested one hour of your trip to Barcelona."

In 1986 the palace was declared Human Heritage by UNESCO.It was been closed for several years for extensive restoration work at the beginning of this century, but after painstaking work it has now been restored closely to its original.There is a very good itinerary you can follow with the use of audio guides, from the basement whih housed the stables, to the roof with its 20 impressive chimneys surrounding the spire of a dome.There is also an exhibition of the restoration work in the attic (which used to be servant quarters, kitchen and laundry).I paid 8\u20ac as over 65 and my younger wife 10\u20ac.

The house is very dark and has a slightly claustrophobic feel even though it is a very large house. It does not have the inspiring feel of the other houses, its more conservative and in some ways a little ordinary. The chimneys on the roof have the characteristic crazy shapes and mosaic glass tiles of the other houses, but they don\u2019t have the same magic.

It is also a must-see for anyone seeking insights into the life and work of architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed i Cornet (1852-1926), and his patron, the industrialist and polymath, Eusebi G\u00fcell i Bacigalupi (1846-1918). It is one of the great monuments of \"catalanismo\", the insistence-on-being-different cultural pride movement of the Catalu\u00f1a region.We have never seen anything else like this house, anywhere in the world. The nearest comparison in fantasy domestic architecture is the Moller House in Shanghai. Imagine an ornate carved jewellery box constructed of exotic dark hardwoods and elaborately inlaid with ivory, greenstone, marble, agate, and other polished precious materials, with panels of gold, bronze and mica. Extend this image to the scale of a five-storey mansion, give it a protective outer shell of stone embellished with wrought iron, mosaic tile, and frosted and stained glass, and you have something like the extraordinary work of imagination and craftsmanship in Palau G\u00fcell.The house was one of the first big commissions Gaud\u00ed received from G\u00fcell at the beginning of their long association over a span of about 40 years. Like much Catalan modernist architecture, it evokes ambiguity: it is jawdroppingly beautiful, but wildly impractical and challenging to a sense of what most people can live with every day. Its polished gilded gloominess would make an exquisite film set for a Harry Potter movie or a remake of the Addams Family. It is difficult to imagine living in its gloom as a family home, with young children, as evidently G\u00fcell did until 1910 he moved out to a new house in what is now Parc G\u00fcell on the heights above Barcelona. It remained a G\u00fcell family residence until 1945, when it was sold to the Diputaci\u00f3 Barcelona (Barcelona Provincial Council) for use as a museum.The mansion has been meticulously restored in several major projects, and is still maintained and operated by the Diputaci\u00f3 Barcelona. When we visited in February 2012, every one of its five floors above ground, and the cellars, attic and roof with its Gaud\u00ed-typical tiled chimney pots and vents, were open to visitors, and were in prime condition. There was a fascinating exhibition explaining restoration work. Self-guided audio tour units were available. Adult entry per person when we visited was \u20ac8 per person. At the time of writing, the official website for Palau G\u00fcell http://www.palauguell.cat/ (in English, French, Spanish and Catalan) indicates the general public entry as \u20ac10, while the \u20ac8 tariff applies to students, over-65s, and groups.A pleasant and practical 4km \"Gaud\u00ed walk\" route is from La Sagrada Familia via Carrer de Proven\u00e7a to the Pedrera, then southeast down stylish, boutique-filled Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia past Casa Batll\u00f3, through Plaza Catalu\u00f1a and La Rambla, to Palau G\u00fcell in the side-street Carrer Nou de la Rambla. This makes a great leisurely day walk, with a break for lunch in one of the many restaurants or bars in the lower end of Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia or Plaza Catalu\u00f1a. Be vigilant against pickpockets and bag snatchers operating in the busier areas."

Gaudi's first major project in Barcelona for the rich industrialist Guell to have a his beautiful city house just off Les Ramblas (his wife hated it apparently, mine didn't!) You get an amazing tour using audio phones which told you not only about the house and Guadis architecture but also the unique relationship between Gaudi's and his chief sponsor Guell but he was also his best friend!The house has been restored by Barcelona local authorities and in my opinion they have done an amazing job. Probably more incredible for a council run business like this was the very friendly and helpful service from all the guides when inside. Thank you.Once you have been here you will understand most of the basics about Gaudi and can probably skip quite a few other Gaudi tours. It was certainly enough for us and when we visited Guell Park, Sagria Familia etc we just walked around and admired his work understanding how he had done it. Only cost 10 Euro to get in and there was a 2 Euro concession for OAPs and students. Great value."

So, we made the treck down Las Ramblas and over to Palau Guell. It was very architechtually intriguing with extraordinary woodwork and patterns. We paid a couple of euros for teh English audio guide and it was well worth it. Unlike many of the other guides we used during our trip which could be a bit verbose.The best part of our visit was when the organs played, the sound reverbarted throughout the house and it was beautiful.

This time we were really looking forward to seeing the whole building. Our guidebook told us it was open on Monday, but closed on Sunday. Unfortunately, it was just the opposite. We were very disappointed, since we'd visited the Sagrada Familia on Sunday and reserved Monday for Palau Guell. Hopefully we'll have another chance in the future to see the whole building."

This was after we went to Boqueria Market, which was a few blocks away. Just walk down Las Ramblas and take a right a few blocks down. The Palace is a place designed by Gaudi for the Guell family. It truly is amazing to see how the very upper class lived around the turn of the century and to see how the young Guadi was testing some of his theories and techniques that would later be perfected in designs for subsequent buildings. My ten year old daughter very much enjoyed the children's audio tour, and we took the adult audio tour, which is free. The detail of the design and the thinking that went into it was unimaginable. The materials they used were dazzling. The main room of the house, used for concerts and religous services was incredibly moving, especially when the organ was playing. This is a worthwhile stop! It took us about 1 1/2 hours. Highly recommend it in combination with a walk down Las Ramblas!"

Gaudi designed for him his home, the Palau Guell. In this house, Gaudi designed everything, including the stained glass, the furniture, the lighting, the wrought iron decoration, the fireplaces,and the twenty chimneys on the roof designed using trencadis (mosaic of broken tile shards). The building was constructed between 1885 and 1889. Guell wanted to use this house for artistic discussions and acts that he could enjoy with his friends, who were the cream of Catalan society at that time. The grand salon had an organ for musical recitals. From the higher floors, the Guells could observe visitors in the parlor without being seen themselves. The wrought iron bars in the front of the building also allowed one to see the street from inside the house, but not the contrary. The inside of the palace was influenced by Mudejar art. The Unesco designated the building as a World Heritage site in 1984 and the building has recently been restored."

If you're in Barcelona, this is one attraction you must include in your itinerary because personally we found this attraction the best! It is just so majestic and will take your breath away. I dont understand why it is only attraction no. 19 though, it should be at least the top 10. Since we went on a Sunday, it was free so we had to queue for about 30mins because only a limited number of people could go in at one time. But worth the wait. Do get the audioguide as well. You will not be disappointed! Now let the pictures do the talking !"

Opened to the public in mid-2011, this is one of the most beautiful and amazing works by Gaudi after La Sagrada Familia. My husband and I visited it in August 2011 and for the very fair entrance fee of 10 Euros (8 for seniors). It is incredible. If you only have time for only two of Gaudi's works, Palau Guell and La Sagrada Familia are the ones to see. Luckily I took plenty of pictures because I don't have the words to describe this beautiful building."

But at the end of each tour, we agreed that the visit was more than worth the expense. So imagine our dismay when we learned that the Palau Guell was no longer FREE! Yep, now it costs ten Euros to visit Gaudi's first commission located just steps off La Rambla near the Liceu Metro stop.But be prepared for the best investment of ten Euros you'll ever make. The new renovation of Palau Guell is a labor of love and craftsmanship rarely experienced in a restored historic residence anywhere in the world. The self-guided audio tour is included with a comprehensive souvenir guide book in your home language. Admission is staged by appointment to regulated the flow of visitors. Music and video are included in the audio tour as well as the translated soundtrack to an excellent short film...'very high tech. The tour is comprehensive, providing access to nearly every space or a window view into restricted areas. Listen as the house organ (a new installation to complement the original instrument) plays tunes written by the music teachers of the Guell household. Walk the wooden cobblestones faux-finished to appear to be stone, but used by Gaudi to muffle horses' hooves in the interior carriageway. Climb the carpeted stairways from floor to floor and discover over-the-top rooms and original Gaudi-designed furnishings. Marvel at the meticulously restored coffered ceilings and millwork and Gaudi's innoventions. Scale the rooftop and get face-to-face with Gaudi's famous Modernisme chimney stacks. We even lingered in the obligatory gift shop offering tasteful site-specific replicas and appropriate educational souvenirs. This is a great addition to an already world class offering of Gaudi's work in Barcelona. Don't miss this one!"

It is free to get in but we had to wait in line about 15 min before we were allowed to go into the basement, which is the only part that is open. There are several columns down there made out of brick which are cool but if you miss this attraction it wont be a big loss."

You get a ticket and come back 10 minutes before the tour starts where you pay and wait for the guide. The guide gave a guided tour in english starting from the stables in the bottom of the palace to the wonderful Gaudi rooftop.The building is beautiful and fascinating giving an insight into life at the time. You can take photographs but can't use a flash.Well worth a visit - you won't be disappointed."
