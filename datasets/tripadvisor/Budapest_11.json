While having a nice stroll along the Danube admire the splendid buildings such as the House of Parliament, the Chain Bridge, The shoes by the Danube, Elizabeth Bridge, Margaret bridge and many more interesting monuments. You can have a boat trip either during the day or during the night and see the splendid buildings by day and by night. You can enjoy an unforgettable dinner cruise with folklore music. You'll find many cruises beneath St Elizabeth Bridge at many of the dock such as Dock 7 and Dock 11. Don't forget to take a jacket and an umbrella with you because showers will be expected."

We made final payment in September. The third week in October she was notified by email that the cruise had been cancelled. No Reason other than operational changes. They took our money and never sent notice until this week (October 18th 2016). They booked her on a different cruise, different date and the cruise was advertised for less money. After repeated calls and emails the lady that sent her the notice replied she was not answering any emails on this matter. Viking????? More Like Pirates, Glad we found them out before we left. Addition hotel nights (non-refundable) and air fares charged fees to cancel. Beware. Chose a reputable company,"

The included tours were very good. The optional tours were also very good but a little pricey. All the local tour guides are trained and very knowledgeable. One tour that could be done on your own is the BMW tour. The BMW plant is 8 kilometers out of town. Group tours are done by plant employees for 8 Euros per person. Viking only provides transportation and pays for the tour. Taking a cab to the BMW plant and doing the tour would be cheaper. The onboard entertainment in the evenings was a bit disappointing.The flights provided by Viking were not the best. They had two connecting flights each way. We were able to upgrade the flights to one connection by paying an extra $50 each. Overall the cruise was good and we are glad we went."

The negatives: being misled by Viking about arrival times & what & when we would be able to experience each port city.Our Viking voyage turned out to be a BIG disappointment!! At our first port, Erlangen, we discovered that through no fault of Viking, one of the locks along the Danube River was broken. This resulted in spending extra time in Nuremberg then playing \u201ccatch up\u201d the rest of the cruise. The delays caused us to be bussed to 2 destinations, one which took a total of 5 hours! Altogether we were delayed in 4 ports. We were docked in Regensberg for a short time, only to be picked up there. We MISSED KREMS ALTOGETHER!! We did finally catch up, at the LAST PORT, BUDAPEST!! Viking was going to substitute Melk Abbey as one of our excursions, again disappointment, further delays caused us to miss it. Instead we were given a talk by the Program Director about growing up in her home country!! Melk Abbey vs someone telling us about their childhood, REALLY!!!We were looking forward to seeing the Wachau Valley. We anxiously anticipated seeing the beautiful Wachau Valley. Our Costco agent told us the best place to sit & view it which we planned to do. Viking said we would go through the Wachau Valley around 8:00 pm. We did, we passed through in the DARK not being able to see anything because another delay!!!Next was Vienna where we were to arrive in the evening to see a concert and had planned to explore it at night. Again, further delays, we arrived the next day though we did get to see the concert that day. We\u2019ve read about the water levels affecting travel on the Danube causing passengers to be bussed to their destination & excursions. However, we never read in any brochures that we would sail through locks on the Danube. It would be appropriate for Viking to make that clear in their brochures & travel information that this could also be a problem.As Viking has experienced delays because of water levels, my suggestion is that they would have activities like art, dance, photography classes available for passengers while on the ship.Viking was not honest or realistic about the entire trip resulting in disappointment after disappointment! When we were given update information, we were constantly told by Adina, the Program Director, \u201cwhen given lemons, we should turn them into lemonade\u201d!!! We were treated like children. Also, they did NOT want any questions raised because as soon as they finished talking, though hands were raised, they closed the meeting! We paid $6,600 for our dream vacation that never happened & felt we were brushed off by Viking customer service."

Unlike oceanic cruises, there are no medical facilities on board: a doctor may be called at port and you can obtain OTC meds from pharmacies by walking/taxi and hopefully speaking to English-speaking pharmacist. Both my husband/I came down with bad colds. Bad enough that we felt unable to undertake excursions which we had booked online. Viking did not allow us to cancel for refunds. That being said, accommodations and food were superb. It is an incredible experience to float thru historical sites and just take it in."

Having cruised the Rhine section of the Budapest to Amsterdam river cruise before, we were excited to have finally returned to do a tour from Prague to Amsterdam. We had used Avalon waterways for the Rhine cruise but timings on this trip had us try Scenic River Cruises. We had used Scenic many years ago and service and standards were fantastic. We were excited to use Scenic again. What a BIG MISTAKE!The Prague extension was very over priced and we had to endure a day long coach ride in a coach provided by a third party to Budapest. The seats in the coach were simply too small for me. I had to sit side-saddle. I have long legs and big feet but I am only 6' 2.5\" tall. If only this was the issue. Our real problems were only about to begin. Shortly after boarding we were advised that another vessel had hit a lock and there might be some delays. Unfortunately there were massive delays. This was not Scenic's fault but it is what they did next that beggars belief. We were holed up in the small town of Komarno waiting for news. The first whole day we were offered a coach trip into Bratislava. Almost four hours on the same coach for about 1.45 hrs in town. The next offering was to pack up the whole of our luggage and coach to Vienna an ordeal that had those who accepted that required huge coach miles and an approximately 17 hour day. Another coach marathon was offered for Salzburg. Once we were able to sail, our ship simply sailed past all the wonderful towns and cities on the river. We took this cruise because we cannot abide coach travel for long distances for health reasons. Scenic could not CARE LESS. Scenic offered a small gesture of a discount on the next cruise for every passenger. Even though quite a few of us advised Scenic that we could not do the coach, they ignored us. They did not make any real effort to provide alternatives to the coach marathons. We were confined to the ship as it strove to return to schedule. Instead of spreading the remaining days of the cruise between all destinations, Scenic chose to ignore us completely. Further communications with Scenic have been rebounded by the usual corporate fire wall.To really add insult to injury, we did not recognise much at all in Scenic's offerings that justified the high premium price. We were not compensated for the included excursions that we missed. We were not compensated on a pro-rata basis for the extra amounts that we paid for a premium cabin. We flew business class so even our cost to participate was higher, flights booked through Scenic! NOTHING!The talk certainly does not match the walk. Huge claims about PERSONALISED service are simply not matched with actions. Things like a fully stocked and replenished mini bar are really a nonsense when all drinks are included anyway. The so called butler service was of absolutely no value to us. The food offered was quite un exceptional, even when a special request was made in advance at the specialty restaurant, it was totally ignored.We travel to enjoy the journey as well as the destinations, for us the decisions that Scenic River Cruises made turned an unfortunate incident into a complete disaster."

Staff was amazing. Ship was modern and spotless. Meals were outstanding. And, truly, their notion of \"when you board, put your wallet away\" was so true (other than special laundry and spa service which were VERY affordable). All rooms had a balcony that added a bit more space. The room amenities included wifi, music stations on TV when you couldn't stand CNN or BBC anymore (!), walking sticks for shore excursions, bathrobes, slippers, free mini-bar and snacks that were restocked daily, butler service for early morning coffee (or b'fast) and the shore excursions were amazing. and one could do them - or not. It was a \"do as you wish\" vacation. We took it all in as we may never pass through those amazing cities again - but down the Rhine, through canals, across the Danube (what direction were we going??) and lots and lots of locks which were utterly fascinating. each time off the ship encouraged use of listening devices to hear local guides - OR to tap into another program and do you own thing with a built-in GPS! OR get off the ship and hop on one of their e-bikes and explore on your own (again, with GPS) Great local entertainment in various ports - off and on the ship - NO complaints and we're already looking at where we want Scenic to take us next. Looking at Russia!"

The stops and tours in each stop were excellent and well organized. The embarkation and debarkation of this riverboat is so nice and simple compared to the large ocean ships. The staff were all excellent, the ship was so clean and new. The highlights were: cruising through the Wachau Valley (the optional bike tour was also a highlight for my husband), the lunch at a local Slovakian families home, and the meals which were exceptional. Although we were delayed in getting into Nuremberg and this meant we landed about 30 min. from the city, the Cruise Director made sure that everyone got to where they needed to get to by quickly organizing new transportation options."

From the minute we checked our bags in Dallas till we left the river boat 8 days later, Viking did a perfect job! Everything and every place was on time.... I consider it a first class experience all the way. When we arrived at out boat in Budapest our cabin was ready and in perfect order. We had a french balcony which was perfect for us. Our cabin was on the middle deck next to the reception desk. This location is most desirable because it was handy to the dinning room, stairs and just steps away fro the reception desk where you could always get quick and accurate answers to everthigs as well as be first in line to go on tours.,,,,Most handy!The food was very good..........some dishes were better than others. All presented nicely. The service staff was most efficient and very friendly to fill any special request.--Which they did for us on many occasions. Our cabin was well laid out, but small, as you would expect. You get the hang of how to use it by the second day. The bath was quite nice and shower bigger than you expect and very nice. We rarely use the big flat screen TV, but it was there. Fresh bottle water twice a day. Turned down service each evening.The included tours were ok. Only a surface introduction to each city. Extra cost tours were probably better and more culturally in depth. There was a balance between cruising the river and site seeing in the cities. The schedule seemed to very well planned. Wish for more time in the cities....It was our experience that Viking delivered on their advertisement of the Danube River cruise for us."

Cruising on the Danube at night in Budapest was spectacular! May I suggest the second and third week of September. The weather was perfect."

Clearly the city river revolves around the city so any visit to Budapest should include viewing the river, walking along its banks, and river cruises. A daylight rivercruise is a good way to orient yourself so that you can plan your various excursions. And an evening cruise is just stunning as the city and all the buildings are lit. There are many operators and it seems highly competitive so I cant suggest any particular operator. All the cruises we selected included commentary but whatever cruises you choose I suggest one that has individual headphones; we went on a few, some with headphones and one with commentary over loudspeaker: the one with commentary through loudspeakers was barely audible."

Big mistake to drive - the roads are as narrow as sidewalks, cars were parked on the sidewalks making the narrow roads even worse, the traffic was heavy everywhere and parking is limited to only three hours; certainly not enough time to get out and explore the area. While the Danube is a very pretty bluish-green, it is best seen at night when all the lights from the city are lit up - either by taking a river cruise or by sitting on the stairs that lead down to the banks lining both sides of the river.Budapest itself is divided into two parts: Pest side is poor and dirty, Buda side is nicer but still dirty. We had a hard time finding people who spoke English. A few places will take euro but most want payment in HUF. Attractions and views on both sides are same as in other European cities.If you are venturing out to see this famous river, plan accordingly or you will be disappointed."

Thankfully we located the meeting point in advance which turned into a treasure hunt but was a great way to see the area around the Basilica and talk to lots of locals ! If we had been told to find the Theatre as you approach the Basilica it may have been a lot easier and quicker. However from then on, it was very well organised and we went as a large group onto the boat. You are led to your table and some couples had a table to their own, we shared with another couple, which can be a lottery, but was fine. Views at night are fantastic and made for some great photos. Food is buffet style and well presented and good quality and a chance to try local Hungarian dishes. Music was provided by a small group led by an amazing violinist who later worked their way around each table and did favourite requests. Very enjoyable evening and would recommend it if your budget allows."

The walking tours in each port were informative and very good. Really liked the tour in Nurenburg and climbed the Castle at Durstein. Loved the concert in Vienna but it was really a private concert just for our group. The wait staff and house maids were mainly from Eastern Europe and were amazing. Rooms were done twice a day (once a day would have done). We took the bicycles out twice and this was one of the reasons I chose Travel Marvel.The only thing that could have been better was the weather and that was my fault as our boat left 25th April and it was much too cold. I had imagined i would be sitting on top of boat as we cruised down the Rhine. In fact we had to stay inside and just run out for a quick photo due to the cold. You can see from inside the bar area.

We passed by the river quite a few times when we crossed the 2 sides of Budapest \"Buda\" and \"Pest\". Not the best place to visit if you've heard \"The Blue Danube\"."

            "review": "Viking Danube River cruise. Having turned 65, and never having taken a cruise, I was now obliged to do so. My wife and I chose eastern Europe, as we had not been there, and Viking, as it seemed to represent a good confluence of price and quality.We sailed on a one week cruise from Budapest to Passau, with a extra 3 days in Prague. The ship was the Vilhjam and we booked a Veranda Suite.OVERALL: Far exceeded expectations. ACCOMMODATIONS: Our room had a bedroom, small balcony, and a sitting area. The extra space - at extra cost - we thought was worth it, it gave us space to move around. A ship's single cabin is pretty tight. The ship itself was immaculate.FOOD: I had expect dinner buffet every night. Instead, we had a choice of light meals on one deck, which was essentially buffet, or waiter service in the main dining room, which most people opted for. The quality of the food was impressive: poached salmon, chateaubriand, pastas, steak, cheese plates, deserts, etc. During the week's voyage we did not experience \"menu fatigue\".STAFF: Obviously highly trained. Very efficient and friendly without being in your face. Viking knows its clients well [n.b., this is September, 95% of fellow passengers seemed to be north of 50, and 95% were from the US]. One could eat alone or sit with other folks. If you don't like to mix dinner and strangers, you need not be concerned. If you want to make life-long friends, the opportunity is also there. An example of efficiency: each morning when we returned from breakfast, our cabin was made up. It makes you wonder why many hotels insist on 4pm checkin.TOURS: Viking offers tours each day, some like the walking tour are both voluntary and included (i.e., free), others, like a Mozart/Strauss concert will cost extra. Regardless of tour Viking people are present. In fact from when your plane arrives, through the cruise, to getting departure boarding passes Viking has boots on the ground. My wife and I opted for a few short walking tours and otherwise explored on our own. Lastly, no hard sell on the fee-based tours.CITIES: Budapest was a delight and a gem of a city. At night it is lit up on both sides of the river. Bratislava a bit smaller but quite nice. Passau, Germany was an unexpected favorite. You can research the stops on your own. By the way you may also wonder if you can handle the three main languages spoken by the locals. Don't. Everyone speaks English, often better than the guys I work with. Every slogan T-shirt worn by passers-by was in English. And while having lunch in a Prague castle, Roy Orbison was being played in the background.ANY MINUS POINTS? Due to the popularity of river cruises, you won't be alone like Huck Finn rafting down the Mighty Miss. On a few mornings I opened the drapes to reveal another Viking ship moored, literally, two feet from by window. This is due to lack of docking space. But due to luck or good management, most of the time we had either a land or river view.Enjoy."

After a bad experience with an attempted rip-off by a taxi (do NOT use Budapest taxis unless you're prepared to be ripped off or to argue with the driver) we decided to buy hop-on/hop-off bus tours. There are at least two such systems in operation. Sold by individual street sellers. Approx \u20ac24 per person. Not much to differentiate them apparently. The bus tours themselves were great but the best part was the inclusion of two boat tours per person. During the day was excellent (hot but luckily drinks available onboard) but the evening tour past the palace was the best, as the lighting at dusk made for superb photography. These are long boat tours so make sure you have the time for the various itineraries. Well recommended."

Everything was perfect - the ship, the food, the places we visited and, of course, the outstanding staff on our ship,the Viking Gullveig. We spent 4 days in Budapest before we set off on the cruise and it was nowhere near long enough as Budapest is a wonderful, friendly city with lots to see and do. En route we visited Vienna, Regensburg, Passau and ended in Nuremberg. Viking lay on lots of included guided tours at each stop and we only paid for one additional event, the Strauss/Mozart event in Vienna. On board, the main restaurant has tables seating 6 or more, so every meal we seemed to be meeting new people. Will we be booking a cuise with Viking again? Of course we will as this was up there with the best holidays we have ever had."

Just to put it into perspective I saw an advert for dinner and cruise at 40 euro.Let's face it, it's the same river and sites that you see!!!

This was a nice 1.5 hr river boat trip with audio recorded guided tour in English. We could have saved some money if we realized that most of the Hop on / Hop off Tour bus companies (there are 3 of them) offer river cruises along with the 48 hr bus pass. Either way I think taking a river trip is a worthwile way to spend part of the day, as you get to see a portion of the city that cannot be seen except from the Danube. The river area is about 10\u00b0F cooler than the rest of the city, so it is worth brining a light jacket."

After approximately 60 minutes the boat stops at Margaret Islands and allows you to disembark to enjoy the quite park which is close but so far removed from the city chaos. The provide a detailed map of the island and allow re-boarding of a later boat an hour and a half later. The pice of the cruise includes a beverage on the outbound leg as well as lemonade during the return trip. Excellent views can be seen from either of the decks.

On the Pest side of the danube, I recommend visiting the Shoes on the Danube memorial to the Hungarian jews who were killed there during WWII."

The weather was great and except for a minor issue getting the ship up to Nuremberg (we had to start at the first stop in Regensburg, Germany), it was perfect. Viking handled everything perfectly. The free tous are sufficient, but we added an Abby tour (Nuremberg)and the Schoenberg Castle (Vienna). Stops also included Krems, Austria, Passau, Germany. The food, ship and crew were excellent."

There are many private boat tours you can take, some are expensive-some less, but if you intend to stay a couple of days in Budapest I'd recommend you to buy one of the city's public transport passes (24hrs, 72hrs, 7days, etc) because it will also give you access, apart from the land transportation, to the boat lines. Take the boat line D12 which goes all the way from Romaifurdo southwards and have a splendid river tour of Budapest basicly for free. Enjoy."

After years of planning, 5 friends and I finally booked our Budapest to Nuremberg Viking River Cruise up the Danube aboard the Viking Freya. From the very first phone call for information and then ultimately booking to the departure flight - accompanied by a Viking rep, this was an over the top, amazing experience!!! We embarked on this beautiful long-boat in Budapest where we were greeted with great warmth and enthusiasm. Our stateroom, though small, were elegant, comfortable and extremely efficient. The ship was wonderful - with a lovely dining room, lively lounge, library and plenty of nocks and crannies for resting and reading. The top sun deck was beautiful and a wonderful place to take in the charming river sights and a nice cocktail. The food was 5 star - delicious, plated beautifully and always divine!!! The staff was extraordinary. The Program Director was such fun. She added great value and entertainment with fun games, lectures, local information and ship updates everyday. Our port calls were terrific...Vienna, Passau, Krems, Regansberg, Nuremberg and a stunning day cruising the Machau Valley. Certainly there was not enough time spent in Vienna but what was made available to us was terrific. The contracted local guides were knowledgable, personable and helpful. The add on (paid) tours did not live up to our expectations however so far as value and experience. We agree that next time we'll pass on those. But all in all it was a trip of a life time - made perfect by Viking's attention to detail and customer service. As amazing as the ship, the food, the tours, the fun was - the best part was the engagement with the support crew. Everyone of our wait persons, housekeepers, even the sailors, were accommodating, engaging, courteous, friendly and so very helpful. They are the worker bees aboard but were never too busy to chat, fulfill a special request, make every effort to see to our comfort and needs. I will never forget a single one of them. Here's to you Milan and Boyan!!! I, We, will definitely do another Viking cruise again, and again and AGAIN!! These cruises might seem expensive but I assure you get your monies worth AND MORE! Go - now or soon. You will not regret the effort or expense!!!"

Every stop has the option of an inclusive tour for which you pay no extra or a choice of additional tours for which there is a charge.

Embarked in Budapest, enjoyed a cruise up and down the river at Budapest which is beautiful at night. It helped there was a full moon. Called in at Estergom, Bratislava, Vienna, Durnstein, Melk, Linz, Asach, Regensberg and disembarked at Passau. This was a well run cruise with impeccable staff and excellent food paired with wine of the region. There were organised tours available at each stop. Apart from the magnificent Melk Abbey we just did our own thing ashore. The entertainment was dismal ( fortunately only 2 evenings) apart from the delightful musical duo who played every evening. The only flaw in this typically efficiently run Austrian ship was the entertainment Officer - she spoke poor English, gave incorrect directions, looked a mess with messy hair. The rest of the staff were immaculate. Wine was complimentary at dinner and you are allowed to bring your own wine to Lunch The Amadeus Silver has cabins have huge pull down windows - they call then French Balconies. Views of the river are super from here albeit only from one side. The lounges, however, are big and airy and gives uninterrupted views. Will do another cruise with this line."

This was our second Viking cruise having done the Rhein from Basel to Amsterdam in 2015. Great ship, extremely attentive staff (50 staff for 181 passengers). We had suite 302 AA class which was clean, spacious and had all amenities.Buy the Silver pkg ($300/couple) for all the premium liquor and wine you want. Stops and side tours were great especially Vienna and Budapest.Food was excellent with high quality, many options from buffet to menu. Two restaurants so plenty of choices. Easy to meet people, made some friends the first night at dinner and had every meal with them during the trip."

The Hilton hotel in Budapest was very comfortable and central. Easy to get about using the metro (free for anyone over 65 years of age). The guide kept with the group (apart from free time) and even saw us go into Departure Lounge in Budapest Airport. Unfortunately the Airport, although new, sent you into an awful concrete hanger when waiting to board Easyjet plane. There was no where to sit and unacceptable for people over 65 to wait for the landing of the aircraft and cleaning of the plane before boarding."

I was excited to visit cities in Austria and Germany, as advertised in the marketing material. What I found on the ship was much different than advertised. Non of the ports of call were in town; most were at least an hour away from the advertised city, requiring the use of buses. I didn't pay for a river cruise to spend my time in a bus. Viking's marketing is misleading a best.Please - before you book a cruise, verify with the company where you will *actually* dock!"

The Danube provides the best chance for sight-seeing in Budapest, and it can be done cheaply if you try.We tried walking, tram and ferry as ways of seeing the city along the river and found that ferry was best. There are ferries about every half hour during the day that locals use to get to work or go shopping etc. Cost is 750 HUF per trip, so to get value for your money allow plenty of time.We took a ferry from the Buda side of the river directly across from Parliament House and went upstream to the last stop (called Romaii F\u00fcrd\u0151.) this took 90 Minutes The ferry has comfortable seats and air-conditioning downstairs and also has an upper deck if you prefer the wind in your hair. You can buy good wine (HUF200/glass) and beer on the ferry. We drank wine.When we got to Romaii F\u00fcrd\u0151 we disembarked and found a suitable restaurant (there are many to choose from) returning later to out departure point. The return trip took only 1 hour.This trip was the best value day out that we had in Budapest. Do yourself a favour and give it a go if you have the time."

The staff were just amazing, so attentive, friendly, helpful and kind; taking the trouble to remember your name and your favourite tipple! The ship itself was superb, excellently fitted out and spotlessly clean. We had a Veranda suite which was simply gorgeous with a double shower, lovely white fluffy large towels. Hot drinks, water and cookies were supplied in abundance and available 24 hours a day (for no extra charge). The food was excellent, the evening entertainment of a good standard and the majority of tours were fantastic. We chose a couple of optional tours (which did cost extra) but these were truly excellent, except that at times they were a little rushed. Yes, this is an expensive holiday but well worth treating yourself to.The scenery was truly beautiful, parts of the Danube are designated Unesco world heritage sites and were breath taking.Go on, treat yourself.Terry and Gina"

This is the first time my wife and I have had a river cruise with Croisi Europe and it was perfect and will use them again and again. We booked this thru Archers who were great as usual, but MS Beethoven was much better than one could hope for. A comfortable cabin, small shower so whats new and just the best service from all the staff at all times. When you book all-inclusive, you are never quite sure how good it will be. However from day one to the end this was first class. Anything you did not like, you could ask for something else and no problem and great variety. The curise was on time with interesting stops and tours. The free wifi could have been better but I am sure that is down to reception. No kids, fantastic for couples. You are also introduced to others from your country and placed on a suitable table. They made every effort on the entertainment with a puzzel each day and quiz nights etc and even a show which was average but fun. I read other reviews on other companies who are clearly not as good. I can reccommend this company and I and sure the standard will stay for all ships. So book with confidence."

The hotel stop overs were less than acceptable (see separate review on Diehls Hotel),arrived at the boat after a reasonable coach journey, That's when the customer service went to pot, we had booked a drinks package with the tour organisers that we thought gave us drinks throughout, but no, when we ask the rep to query this all we got was put off saying if he pressed this he would lose his job, they were adamant that the drinks package was for meal times only. Lots of argument followed over the next couple of days to no avail, so we just got on with enjoying the cruise.The cruise to be fair was quite good, not as good as our previous cruise on the Rhine with Shearings, that was really great.So back home we raised our concerns over the cruise with the department laughable called customer services. We told of the sub standard accommodation at the overnight hotels, the poor standard of evening entertainment, and the fact that you could not possibly drink the amount of alcohol during meal times that they charged you for (\u00a399 for 7 Days per person).We got in return a letter that failed to grasp the points and the disappointment that we made and felt.So don't be put of River Cruising just make sure you try the best provider."

They always went the extra mile and with a smile every time even though some of the guests were very demanding.You get what you pay for but Viking represents great value for what they do. They are well worth the gratuities you pay but cost this in your final bill.The organised tours in with the package were generally very good but could be more intensive but with Viking you get mixed requirements from a wide audience.We rate this tour very highly but however good it is ,it is far better due to the quality of service on board - and they do this every week of the holiday season!"

We had heard good things of all the cruises:Uniworld,GCT, Tauck, Avalon etc. So we were very particular to see what made this special from all the othershere is the list1. They handled emergencies when we were sick and had the Doctor on board the next day2. The Program Director and Concierge were on 24 hour steroids. Always extremely cheerful,extremely helpful would cater to our slightest whim, encouraged us to do things like 36 KM bike rides, when i had not ridden a bike in 30 years, always pushing to get the very best out of the trip.3. Staff from Hotel Manager to the cabin stewards had 24 hour smiles on their faces, catering to all the passenger whims and desires and believe me when you have 80 and 90 year olds, there are lots of concerns4. Staff to greet you when you left the ship, and there to greet you when you returned.5. There were folks in the 90's doing bike rides, women with walking canes climbing steep stairs to castles and abbeys all the while being cheered on by the PD and ConciergeYes all European Cruises are great, but I don't think anyone would compare to Viking. They go out of the way to make the trip enjoyable and with 26 ships doing the Grand European from Amsterdam to Budapest,they are pros at that and have addressed everything you could possibly need: in our case separate 110volts plugs for my wife and my chargers so there were no conflicts as to who could get to e-mail first"

And then the dramatic show of Budapest at night on the Danube, all the monuments flooded w/ lights, the Parliament dramatically lit, the bridges twinkling w/ lights, people walking the shores, covering the green bridge, sitting up high on the scaffolding, waving to us as we passed under them and the bridge, welcoming us to Budapest. If you are not on a river cruise, try one of the local cruises for the evening. There were lots of ships on the river, cruising up and down. What a wonderful way to arrive in Budapest!"

Cruised up river past castle, Parliament, several bridges. As the hour advanced we turned down river and started seeing all the buildings and bridges being lit up.Excellent headphone narration of sites in your choice of language. Boat was very comfortable. Cruise lasted a full hour at moderate cost. Dock easily accessible on foot. By 9:15PM we were eating gelato in a nearby square. A lovely evening and a good value for the money. BTW, boat is enclosed so this could be done in inclement weather."

In one day in Budapest we: took the number 2 tram from near Margaret Island all the way to the central market (It takes you along the Pest side of the river with great views); walked along the Pest side and stopped at cafes for coffee and cake; crossed the Chain Bridge and admired the views along the river (walk back across the river on the other side of the bridge to maximise on views!); and took a boat trip from pier 7 for a guided tour along the river. What we COULD have done: hired a speedboat; hired a Jet Ski; done a candle lit dinner cruise; canoed around Margaret Island; done a 'duck' boat/bus tour; walked the Buda bank."

First in combination with an organ concert in the cathedral to be followed by a nice dinner while cruising the Danube. Quite a let-down: each guest received a glass of wine and two glasses of water; beyond that everything was on your own expense. Annoying, and the good food didn't make up for this disappointment. So, the next evening we just took a boat again, this time as a free extension of our Big Bus ticket, and we had a ball: food and drinks on our own money, no surprises and beautiful Budapest in nightly illumination.

From the special attention accorded passengers to the excellent food to the brown Danube and its nineteen locks, it was a relaxing and generous excursion. There were many stops along the casual ride upriver, more than enough for everyone: Budapest, Bratislava, Vienna, Durnstein, Melk, Linz, and Passau. That makes four new countries we saw.One new insight for you: we stayed in the cheapest cabin. It had a window that looked out at the duck-level, right at the waterline. We loved this room. At night, the water would gently lap against the boat and we could hear the Danube's gurgle almost speaking to our memories. This room saved us $1,200 on our total cost.I recommend Viking River Cruises' Danube Waltz, Budapest to Passau.In lieu of pictures, here is my poem:Danube Waltz 2016by Craig Parker The Danube River is elegant, brownFilling the senses and soothing the heartIt calls us softly with delicate soundTo praise the beauty and ponder our part Budapest offers a charming retreatAddress olden dreams and heed Europe\u2019s wayGrand architecture with statues repleteJet lag assures you\u2019ll take six naps per day Dank and disheveled shoes randomly strewnSad testament to humanity\u2019s pallPrejudiced citizens viciously tuneFueled by a cowardice born in us all New Bratislava, a lesser-known starArias sang how to live the right wayWhatever your dreams, wherever you areRather than wait, you should do it today Vienna, behold, a marvelous jewelWhere Sachertorte is a delicacyFrequent the sights under Hapsburg's long ruleToo bad the tour guide had COPD Reach Schonbrunn Palace by riding the railsJosef and Sisi were tragedy\u2019s playKing, workaholic and all that entailsQueen, dedicated, who went her own way Bucolic countryside there at the riseRuthless lands ruled by a strong iron willChirping and landscapes caress ears and eyesRichard the Lionheart waits on the hillHail to the Linz cake and Linz SymphonyKepler wrote books here on planets then knownDubious side note of dark historyEichmann and Hitler both called Linz their home Grant each bridge crossed finds a prosperous shoreHope those obscure sins somehow be made rightSay we be happy with riches galoreMay the brown Danube waltz into the night."

The Danube was very full and fast moving, but certainly not blue. Beautiful cruising from start to the grand finale in Budapest. The stops along the way are all wonderful and Vienna is magnificent as is Budapest. Viking fed us so extremely well. We took all our meals in the dining room, as we loved their wonderful servers and service. Meals were exceptional accompanied by excellent wines or beers, some were simply divine. Their longships are spotlessly clean always and are handsomely and simply appointed. No clutter or curlicues anywhere, which felt like an oasis after a day of grand examples of baroque and rococo buildings and art. Not only were we well fed but we were well entertained too. German/Austrian musicians were brought on board on two occasions and performers from the Hungarian State Opera also. An organ concert in Passau and an evening of operatic and ballet performances in Vienna were wonderful. All the staff on board the Viking Gullveig were outstanding. I, personally, have never gone through a lock so I found that part of the trip absolutely fascinating. I would awaken at night and sit out on the balcony and experience the whole process, and while it was somewhat akin to watching paint dry, I loved it. You can reach out and touch the walls of the lock. Day or night, it was so interesting to me. Two things that are not discussed in the brochures are the docking accommodations and procedures. Longships dock lengthwise along the pier and then they stack four next to each other, so that you lose the use of your private balcony while in port and you must exit and enter through all the ships. As each ship enters and settle next to each other they all must discharge their holding tanks thru tubes and the fumes can really be awful. These two distractions would not make me hesitant to take another Viking cruise at all. Viking does not come cheaply, but it was worth every penny. I truly believe they earned every dollar I paid. I thoroughly investigated all the options open to us with other cruise companies before I booked this trip. Seeing those ships and the accommodations along the way, I was not disappointed in our choice of Viking. It was just beyond all my expectations."

It is much quieter in most parts than the Rhine, with more natural wonders. There are locks - large and small, A wonderful way to see a lot very easily. Taking day stops each day in wonderful and picturesque places, ranging from the wonderful Budapest in Hungary, Vienna and Melk in Austria, and passing through a number of countries, such as Bulgaria and Romania. A relaxing and fascinating way to see a lot, whilst enjoying great scenery and learn much about European history."

            "review": "Viking River Cruise \"Danube Waltz\". My wife and I took the Viking River Cruise Danube Waltz with another couple in mid-July and had an excellent time. We don't have a lot of experience with cruises, but have taken one in Alaska and one in France/Italy, but this was our first river cruise. I'd read several reviews before we left, and there seems to be a wide spectrum of opinion out there about river cruising, but our experience was much better than we had expected.We flew from Indianapolis thru Amsterdam and into Budapest, arriving two days before we were to set sail on Sunday. We stayed at the Courtyard, which is fairly central and about a mile from the river. Budapest is the highlight of the trip as far as cities go, although Vienna is beautiful as well, but we had already visited Vienna and the itinerary dictated how long we would be in Vienna, so we decided to get a couple extra days in Budapest on the front end of the trip. In talking with other guests, the consensus was that it's best to take any extra time you might want to take in conjunction with a cruise on the front end of the trip, because when the cruise is over you just want to get back home. The cruise ended in Passau, and we were bussed to Munich for our flight home. We had visited Munich in 2013, and you would certainly enjoy taking the trip the other way down the Danube, spending a couple of extra days in Munich on the front end of that trip. (Going that direction is also downstream....which is faster, and may give you more time at each stop)The food and service on the ship, the Viking Legend, were great and better than we had expected. I don't recall a meal where we didn't have several choices, all expertly prepared and accompanied by generous servings of wine and beer. We expected the servers to be skimpy with the alcohol, but believe me....that wasn't the case. We had a German/Austrian dinner one evening, and you could walk back into the ship's galley to be served...which was interesting and cool. Our room was small, but they have done a nice job of squeezing every inch of storage space out of the cabins. There's ample room under the bed for your suitcases, and more than enough room for your other items. The bathroom is also small, but we have hanging toiletry bags that keep everything up off the counters, so space wasn't a problem. There is a nice hot shower, and at 6'1\" I had no trouble using it, but the drain is some kind of bilge pump that is quite loud and recycles every 10 seconds or so while one is showering. Didn't bother me, but it takes some getting used to. The internet on these ships is notoriously slow, but I didn't think they would be THAT slow. E-mail would go through eventually, but if you're trying to send home a photo or a large file, forget it. You should be out enjoying yourself.....so quit sending e-mail already! The TV is terrible as well. They offer CNN Europe and a BBC channel. They also have a pamphlet-type abbreviated \"newspaper\" on board each morning that doesn't give you much but the headlines. Again, you're on vacation, so quit following the news.The staff were all very good, from our room attendant Sasha, to the activity director David, to all of our waiters which are too large a group to mention. (but Darwin was our favorite)The tours, which for the most part are included in the cost of the cruise were interesting, although I keep telling my wife I've seen enough castles and gothic churches to last a lifetime. Most of the other guests were friendly folks, and most were English-speaking. Of the 188 guests, about 160 of them were from the U.S., 13 or so from the U.K., and a handful from Australia. We were afraid these cruises might be a \"Floating Nursing Home\" as one of our friends suggested, but that wasn't the case either. I'm 63, my wife is 59, and I would guess that we were probably the average age. There were no children under 18 as far as I could tell, and there were a few older people traveling with family members, who were using canes or walkers. Everyone seemed to be active....or were attempting to be active, so I guess that's all you can ask.Our favorite parts of the trip were Budapest, especially leaving the city on Sunday night with all the buildings and bridges illuminated, the walking tour of Pesky Krumlov in the Czech Republic, a wine \"tasting\" we were bused to one evening in Vienna, and the tour of Vienna.It's also quite pleasant to just sit on the upper deck and watch the European countryside roll by. Early in the trip we spent about two hours navigating through the second-largest lock in Europe, which was pretty exciting. It takes 50 million gallons of water to pump the ship up 20 feet to continue on it's way downriver.All in all we had a great trip, our friends who traveled with us agreed and we've already booked another river cruise next October. We're also trying to encourage some other friends to come along. You meet and hang out with nice people on the cruise, but it's also fun to make the trip with another couple, or friends. If you have friends that don't drive you nuts when you travel together."

There are countless boat trips on offer, yet there are also #11 and 12 boats which are a part of Budapest\u00b4s public transportation system and ply the river across the entire city, passing all the monuments and calling on both sides of the river in the vicinity of all the monuments. A single ride costs USD 3, unlimited passes do count as well. By high waters, a northbound (upstream) ride between Pet\u00f6fi and Arpad bridges may easily take close to 1h30 instead of scheduled 45 minutes, yet basic snacks are available on board. Definitely better deal than commercial tours."

We sailed from Budapest, up to Linz, then back to Budapest.The Jane Austin is only a year old, and the public areas reflected this being bright and airy and not worn at all. Our cabin, on the middle deck had floor to ceiling doors overlooking the river and crucially, air-conditioning, a valuable resource as the weather was very hot during our trip. The cabin came with a refrigerator and, unlike many sea-going ships, supplied with free bottled water every day. That may seem trivial but having that every day was a joy.That joy was shown in the crew. From start to finish every member of staff was cheerful, efficient, caring, professional and did service with a smile. Our usual waitress, named Hristina from Bulgaria, was huge fun, and on a night of comedy laid on by the crew, was the star of the show.The food on board was exceptional. Well done to the chef and his team. Lots of choice, hot and cold, an omelette service at breakfast along with juices, pastries, fruits, yogurts and while some of the meals were on a buffet basis, many were table service and all done with total professionalism.Included in the price of voyage were day trips including Esztergom, Salzburg (OK not on the Danube but worth the hour or so coach ride), D\u00fcrnstein, Melk, Abbey, Vienna and Bratislava. We were all wired with earpieces so listening to the tour guides in each of our visits made life easier. My only criticism is that the tour groups (about 45-50 people) were simply too big. Half that number and with extra guides would have been better.All in all I would thoroughly recommend Riviera Cruises. If you want comfort, fun, lots to see and fine food and being looked after by a wonderful team of people \u2013 then look no further."

There is a nice promenade on the Pest side of the river that is lined with outdoor restaurants/cafes. While the river is not dirty, it no longer is the \"Blue Danube\". We stayed directly on the Danube at the foot of the Chain Bridge at the Intercontinental Hotel and had a great view of river from our large triple picture window.

We did not receive any email update notifying us where Viking Legend was docked. The taxi driver wasn't sure and took us to all four piers along the river bank where the Viking ships docked to finally locate the Legend at pier 4 below a decrepit looking restaurant. No Viking personnel was present to help. We ended up carrying them down uneven steps to the ships gangplank. That certainly was a very unfavorable first impression. Passengers we met later in the ship restaurant shared similar experiences and security concerns from being told to leave luggage unattended on the curb side. What helped turn us around by the end of the cruise were as follows:1)The stateroom was spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the towels were large. The housekeeping stewartNeriza was pleasant and hardworking, always striving to ensure our room was cleaned and resupplied several times daily. 2)The food was well prepared and delicious. There was a wide variety of offerings; we especially like the soup (tasty and hot) and the desserts. Most impressive was how attentive, genuine, and friendly Ruth and Dennis, our servers, were. Ruth, especially, remembered all our personal preferences and have them available so we didn't even have to ask for them.3)The shore excursions were nicely organized. The program director made seamless last minute rearrangements and logistics adjustments to accommodate unforeseen changes conditions. We found out he was also an outstanding singer when he performed on one of the nights. The cruise musician played American songs on the keyboard and sang beautifully. On the downside 1) Our room was right below the sun deck. More than once we were awakened at 6 am by someone jogging. We were glad that bad weather caused a stoppage of this activity stopped when the weather got increasingly windy and rainy. 2) Hand sanitation before entry into restaurant was not as strictly enforced as on ocean cruise ship. Just like our other cruises the ship stopped at many cities; some inevitably shine more brightly than others. Our favorites were Budapest and Vienna. It was a better than expected first River cruise experience."

            "review": "River runs through it. From the waltz music, I had anticipated a much different river. What I found initially disappointed. Phenomenal views from Buda Castle did, however, reinforce my opinion of a waterway as beautiful as refrains from an orchestral performance of Blue Danube. The river became more beautiful as I walked along the promenade. The \u201cShoes Memorial\u201d (metal sculptures that represent shoes of Jews shot, their bodies dumped into the river) near the famous Chain Bridge and a dozen other memorials make for a full day of appreciation of Budapest\u2014at no cost! But what caused me to most appreciate the Blue Danube was a night cruise on my last full day in Budapest. I had already visited many of the hundreds of attractions Budapest offers, so I was able to recognize many as the small cruise boat made a roundtrip voyage past these fabulous sites. Pedestrians on Chain Bridge waved a warm welcome as we passed below. The most memorable sights were Parliament and Buda Castle, both bathed in soft light that made them look like the fairyland castles that they are. High on the Buda Hill is Hungary\u2019s version of Statue of Liberty, also bathed in a beacon of light. The Danube is far more than a waterway through a thriving European cosmopolitan city. It is that area\u2019s lifeblood and probably the single most factor that contributed to Budapest\u2019s origins and culture."

We paid for a Juliet Balcony which when we were tied up was a waste of money. The boats were tied up with other boats which meant all you could see was the next boat and had to keep your curtains closed for privacy. They also missed one of the stops Melk which was one we were really looking forward to. We weren't able to leave the boat at all that day. On the last day our cases had to be out of the cabin by 7am and after 9am we were only allowed in the lounge and the only thing we were offered was water.our trip left at 11.30am."

While the cost of the cruise is not inexpensive, the investment was well worth the money. The staff (Captain, Program Director, service providers, shore excursion tour guides and even the excursion bus drivers) are well trained, knowledgeable, courteous and go out of their way to make the vacation fun and memorable. The food was outstanding with a wide array of options and an effort was made to match cuisine with the area we were visiting at the time. The excursions we booked were all outstanding. The state rooms are understandably smallish, but with the amount of time spent there, this was inconsequential. We extended our stay beyond Nuremberg with a 3-day visit to Prague where the Viking personnel continued to be top notch and with us every step of the way. HIGHLY recommended!"

            "review": "Emerald River Cruise from Budapest to Amsterdam. Along with my brother and his wife, my wife and I had planned this river cruise trip for two years. We boarded the Emerald Sky on June 24 from Budapest and sailed toward our final destination Amsterdam and arrived on July 9. The 14 days cruise was spectacular, the views along the Danube and the Rhine rivers of ancient castles and small towns made this vacation an amazing and rewarding experience.The ship: the state room (Balcony Suite) was spacious, provided excellent storage space to enable us to easily unpack and store our clothes, comfortable beds and included a large size shower. The Horizon Lounge provided a wonderful view as the ship travels the rivers; although ample seating is available, some of the chairs were uncomfortable. The main dining area, Reflections, is well divided and provide a variety of seating arrangements, tables of two, four, six and even larger group; my only observation is that because of the ship\u2019s size and the fact that there is only one dining room and only one seating, the room tends to be noisy at times. The Sun Deck area is well equipped with regular chairs and tables as well as lounging chairs you can use whether you wish to take in some sun or lie under covered areas in the shade. Another thing we noticed was the cleanliness of all the common areas and the washrooms. The ship is also equipped with an elevator for people with mobility problems.The food: the dining room is open for all three meals, providing buffet service for breakfast and lunch and a full service for the supper seating. The Horizon Lounge also provides a self-service \u201clite lunch\u201d. The variety of food is well presented, hot and the trays are constantly replenished. The super dining provides a special \u201cchef\u201d meal which varies daily and included Chateaubriand and duck; the desserts were also fantastic. Worth noting that, during our 14 days the chef\u2019s suggestions were never repeated.The service: all of the crew are unbelievably friendly, from a cheerful good morning, asking passengers how their day was going, how we enjoyed our daily excursions and promptly responding to any of our questions or special requests. I would like to acknowledge special people who made our trip special and provided excellent service: Patricia, our Cruise Director, was very well prepared in giving clear and precise information during her daily \u201cports of call\u201d presentations as well as answering all our personal questions concerning extra excursions we had booked; she was constantly available at her desk and she was attentive to hear our comments on local guides when we returned to the ship. Patricia also provided interesting commentary information as we sat on the sun deck and travelled along the rivers. At our final passenger meeting, she provided clear and easy to follow instructions on the disembarking procedure we would have to follow on the day we left the ship. I would also like to mention the exceptional and cheerful service we received from Mohamed and Padlo in the dining room and Eugene at the Horizon Lounge.City Tours: when in port, accompanied by knowledgeable local guides who provided us with historical and on occasion humorous facts about the villages and cities we are visiting. With the exception of two guides, our visits were very enjoyable; I would like to mention Eva, the local guide in Salzburg, who made our visit to the city memorable. If you are looking for a special excursion to enjoy classical music, I would recommend you book the \u201cprivate\u201d (for our cruise ship only) evening concert in Vienna which was held at the Music Theater with a group of young and experienced musicians and singers; the performance was held in the same hall where Beethoven conducted and performed his third symphony. The music of Mozart and Strauss filled the room and made this an exceptional evening to remember.This was our first river cruise experience and we would not hesitate to recommend Emerald Cruise.Finally, I would like to make certain observations that neither the travel brochure nor the Emerald presentation we attended prior to our booking provide the potential clients: the numerous locks between Nuremburg and Amsterdam, a total of 68; although most of them are done during the night, the ship has to wait during the day if the other traffic is coming out or going into the locks; although the weather is uncontrollable, this year\u2019s high water level and the height of certain bridges prevented us from using the sun deck for numerous days during our trip; when arriving in port, it was common for our ship to be parked beside other ships which, depending on your cabin, can block the view in your room and also force you to disembark by crossing through several ships (stairs could be an issue for certain people), at one time we were the fourth ship from the pier; and finally, in some ports we were docked in industrial sections of the cities far from the cities we were visiting, unable to walk to the centre and had to be bused into the city centres."

The whole cruise was well organised and the guides, Stewart and Jill, were first class and very helpful. My favorite city was Salzburg but everyone had a different point of view. This is so different from a sea cruise, the proximity to the river banks, views from the boat, make it a more intimate experience.

We were greeted by Marcos as we boarded who showed us to our room. Turns out he was actually the Maitre D and was a joy to get to know throughout the cruise. The staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. As it is open seating, my friend and I chose to pick different people to sit with most of the time. It was a joy to get to know so many interesting people and hear their stories. My first Viking Cruise was 5 years ago and I would say the average age of the passengers this time was at least 5 to 10 years younger. Oliver, the program director, was ever present, making certain the passengers were well taken care of. With excursions included every day, he had his hands full. Dragan, our bar tender was very accommodating and fun to get to know. The outdoor areas of the boat give everyone a lot of choices to relax. The best part of a river cruise is that you have scenery all the time, there are only 200 friendly passengers, good food with lots of choices and excursions included. The one downside was that we booked a veranda room on the second level but most of the time when we were docked, we were side-tied to a sister ship. I still tell everyone that a river cruise is my favorite vacation! Now if we could only find a way to have less crowds in the ports, it would be perfect."

Down the Pest side and up the Buda side. Nice wide sidewalks on both sides. Great views of the river and the sites on the other side. Nice romantic stroll. The Pest side also makes for a lovely evening walk when the sidewalks and cafes are bustling."

Our travel consultant suggested Emerald Waterways (Evergreen Tours is the Australian agent) as a low cost but good quality river cruise company - she was correct on both counts. This was our first river cruise (although we have done a number of ocean cruises) and we wish to congratulate Evergreen and Emerald for a fantastic experience which far exceeded our expectations. Embarkation was smooth and we were able to board not long after midday and had lunch and all afternoon to unpack and settle in. The next morning, we were taken on an Amsterdam canal cruise in small glass roofed boats which was very good. We were impressed by the layout and quality of the ship (only two years old). The public spaces were excellent but we were unable to use the sun deck when passing under low bridges which meant that we did not use it for a number of days as it is quite a job to lower and raise the safety rails and deck furniture. This is an observation not a complaint as it is part of river cruising.The food was excellent with good variety and good quality. The beer and wine were not cheap house varieties. Breakfast was a buffet style with a wide choice ranging from Continental to hot food with an omelette/egg cooking station staffed by a chef. Lunch was again a buffet with a wide and varied range of hot and cold foods.Wi-Fi reception could be patchy due to the hills and gorges through which the river passed but we were warned of that in the pre-embarkation literature. Not really a problem.The itinerary, shore excursions and tour guides were excellent and we had a reasonable amount of free time on shore. The ports in which we stopped were excellent. The daily on-board entertainment was excellent including the resident piano player/DJ, Norbert, and the Oompah band and Hungarian dance troupe, among others.Not the least important was friendliness and excellence of the staff. We were especially impressed by the cruise director, Ray, who was always helpful, cheerful, knowledgeable and informative and always available. When we had to travel by coach for two days due to high water levels, he was sympathetic and very helpful and kept us informed of what was happening. Also, Maritta, the hotel director, was excellent as she was always cheerful and helpful. In our opinion, they were the icing on the cake! However, all the staff and crew were friendly and helpful.We were very impressed with the effort put in by the head office staff in organising excellent coach transport and 4+ star accommodation when we were unable to continue on the river. This certainly did not detract from our experience as we completed all but one of our tours and did not miss any meals or included drinks. Often the back office goes unnoticed but we acknowledge that they did a great job in keeping us going. Luckily, we were able to rejoin the ship a couple of days before Budapest.Disembarkation was very smooth and as we had a 2 pm transfer to the airport, we stayed in the Horizon lounge and had lunch before we disembarked - sad to leave the ship.We will certainly be recommending Evergreen Tours (Australia) to our friends and would certainly travel again with Emerald."

Nevertheless, we took both a day cruise and a night cruise and it is possible to have different ways of seeing the same sights. The day cruise included a visit to Margaret Island and a stop-off on the Buda side opposite the Parliament building. I bought the night cruise tickets from a young lady who was selling them outside the Intercontinental Hotel for about \u00a317 for two which included a free day cruise the following day. The normal cost of a night cruise is about \u00a327. The night cruise allowed us to see the Parliament building fully lit up which was an amazing sight."

Our tour group of 32 came by and took the 1.5 hour cruise where our tour agency had chartered the entire cruise for all of us, where we could enjoy a sumptuous buffet lunch (with wine) while we enjoyed our cruise along Danube River.It was sunny but cooling when our cruise set sail at about 1.00pm. Once onboard the cruise, the waiting staff handed each one of us with a welcome drink (white wine) and when seated, more wine bottles were placed on our dinning table and soon after, we were invited to help ourselves with the buffet.Honestly the spread of the buffet was not massive but they were all local cuisines and we had the opportunity the taste Hungarian food. Generally, they were quite nice and yummy.As the cruise sailed along the river where we passed by several bridges, from time to time, we went out to have a look at the scenery as the position we were in was in between the Old and New towns (that's why its called Buda and Pest). We saw many lovely buildings under the clear blue sky and what really attracted and impressed us was the Parliament buildings. It was so grand and beautiful.Well, each country is unique and different from one another and just realize that. Do not compare it with other countries as each is unique and has its speciality. Have an open mind and try to learn and adapt in and you will learn to appreciate the beauty and loveliness of what you see and experience.We enjoyed our cruise over lunch as it presented another view perspective of the city instead of looking at it from the top of the hill. We believe that if we were to take the cruise in the evening, it would be prettier with the special lightings from the bridges and building, they should look more gorgeous!"

An amazing holiday.It was decided that my wife and I would take a holiday this year, and after many starts and stops it was decided that we would take a cruise on the Danube.Now I have to be honest, I hate curries and I am a hopeless sailor.The Cruise line that we opted for was \u201cCroisi Europe\u201d It is a French company and has set menu and had optional excursions at every stop that one can pick and choose from. My big worry as I said was that I would not like the food if and if the boat started to rock about on a choppy Danube I would be in a bad way. In reality as far as I was concerned the \u201cMal de mer\u201d never happened.The fact is all the meals were excellent but due to a medical problem I can\u2019t digest alcohol. One of the desserts had this dreaded alcohol but within seconds it was replaced by an alternate dessert. I never had to tell the waiting staff about this again, anything with alcohol was immediately replaced without me informing anybody. It was just like magic.To those that need pampering then this type of holiday is for them. One is watched over like someone very special and every comfort that one needed is there for you. Wine, beer and soft drinks are free and in plentiful supply. If one cared to lounge out on the sun deck, the drinks, tea or coffee are brought to you. As the Euro football was on a big TV screen in the reception area, the bar waitress appeared every twenty minutes with another supply of beer. It is difficult to beat this type of service.All the staff on the ship are truly extraordinary in their attention to details and anything that one could ask for was sorted within minutes. I saw one of the managers, Andre sort out an extremely irate guest that was very much showing his annoyance with him, talking in an aggravated manner. Andre reminded me of pouring oil on troubled waters. He did it with such ease and calmness that within a few minutes the guest went away very happy. I spoke to this man concerned later and he was delighted with the way his problem had been sorted. This is the staff we encountered with Croisi Europe. This sort of thing happens in all sorts of situations but unless you see it personally it goes unnoticed. Andre was ever vigilant and on one occasion I was trying to have a conversation with the Captain who had no English and Andre very unobtrusively offered to interpret for me. He deserves a gold star and well deserves it for tactfulness and his ease of manner with the holiday makers.The staff member that deserves two gold stars is Soninha, the hotel manager. She has five languages in which she is totally fluent in. To me it seemed she never went to bed. I saw her organising a tour at before 06.30 and she was still on duty at 22.30 that night. She looked after the guests so well and yet she was totally unobtrusive. We had a small problem with our room and within two or three minutes the whole matter was sorted.She is the type of manager that every industry needs. It is called \u201cmanagement by walking around\u201d She sees a potential problem and acts. Diffusing a situation. Well, done Soninha you made two people very satisfied with their holiday choice.A cruise on the Rhine is next on the agenda and without doubt we will be traveling with Croisi Europe and hopefully we will have Soninha and Andre looking after us."

I went on a evening boat trip with Legenda Cruises, and it was definitely a highlight of the holiday - I recommend around sunset/night time as the best time to go on one (although Legenda also offers day cruises which include a trip to Margaret Island). The city lights up at night time, and it looks stunning. You can book in advance (expedia has more options than trip advisor, and you can google more), but there's a lot of operators touting their trips down by the Danube - compare them all, as some are longer, include meals, feature shows or commentaries, or are on bigger boats. Legenda had one of the smaller boats (maybe 50 max?), which we preferred, and though the windows weren't particularly clean there were seats out on the viewing deck which were better for taking photographs. We had audio commentary headsets and a video too, which was a bit cheesy, but quite informative and probably good for kids. All in all, pretty great! Definitely a must do for Budapest."

            "review": "Scenic River Cruises, an fantastic company to cruise with on the Danube. We returned in mid-June 2016 from a 3 week cruise travelling from Amsterdam to Bucharest. A good portion of this cruise was on the Danube. Probably the Western European part of the Danube is more interesting and scenic than its Eastern counterpart with small villages nestled on the river banks backed by hills planted, in terrace fashion, with grapevines. Every so often a medieval castle would be apparent on the hillside. The trees lining the river were reflected in the river water like those in a Monet painting. The river was well used with barge traffic and other river cruise ships so there was always some activity like that to watch, or even to wave at local fishermen and campers on the banks, or to take photos of the river ducks and swans which swam in the shallower parts of the river. While the river in this portion was fast running and very brown, there was no effect of its motion aboard the ship. This portion of the river cruise from Amsterdam to Budapest took 2 weeks of sailing. Our journey was not impeded, fortunately, by rising river levels and low bridge heights. The river stayed brown but flowed less vigorously as we sailed into the Eastern European countries. It took 1 week to travel between Budapest and Bucharest along this less populated area. We travelled through the Iron Gorge which was fascinating to see with the dramatic changing width of the river and steep rocky sides. An interesting carving of a man's head - Decebalus - appeared unexpectantly on these rocks as did a monastery and a mid-river castle used for collecting tolls in past times.I enjoyed the opportunity of travelling on this Eastern portion of the Danube on a ship, similar to a 5 star hotel, enjoying good food and comfortable accommodation while being able to travel deep into Bulgaria and Romania by bus for daily sightseeing excursions. We were bused to Varna to dip our toes into the Black Sea and to see a most interesting archaeological museum in the town where finds from centuries of humans living in the area were on display with English labels. We were also bused into the midlands of Bulgaria to visit the popular tourist town of Veliko Varnovo and Arbanassi. Roads to these areas were in good condition - no wash outs, pot holes. In these 2 previous commie countries of Bulgaria and Romania it became evident that the Slavs did not want to be dominated by other people be they the Ottoman Turks or Soviets (don't know how they felt about the Roman occupation) who usually lined their own pockets and kept the people under their thumbs rather than improving the living conditions of the population. While the current governments were reported to be corrupt, at least the Slavs can elect their representatives. We noticed quite a contrast In the Western and Eastern European cities. While the architecture of public buildings at one time had been impressive in Belgrade and Bucharest, today they lack upkeep and many buildings appear to be crumbling and in disrepair. Unemployment rate was reported to be very high with a brain drain as young people left for better working opportunities and conditions in the West. I would definitely recommend the 2 week Western European Danube river cruise over the Eastern portion if one was new to river cruising or combine these 2 areas like we did into one long 3 week cruise. The time on the 2 week cruise from Amsterdam to Budapest just flew by while the 1 week cruise along the Danube seemed to take longer. We thoroughly enjoyed the all-inclusive nature of our ship Scenic Jasper as all expenses were paid up front including the tips of local guides and drivers. We left the ship without paying anything extra. Each day there was an included excursion; we usually opted for the city tour. Local guides with good English speaking abilities, usually university students or older experienced guides, spoke to us through headsets so one could hear their commentary from a distance. Scenic provides a lot of on board information in print form for the sights along the Danube like a travel guide, a map of the river showing the location of towns, and city maps. Add to this the information in electronic form available on Scenic\u2019s hand held Tailormades (audio guides) for info on the sights in the towns, or from the internet with free access, for example, for current weather info. In addition, the cruise director gave nightly port talks in which he informed us of the program for the next day - what we would see and the length of time of the tours. Excursions lasted from 3 hours for city walking tours to full day excursions into the countryside. Rooms were comfortable with real balconies that were enclosed with glass so useable in all weather conditions. The window could be opened for fresh air. The upper deck was used most while in the dock. Here we could sit in comfortable padded wicker chairs or lounge chairs to enjoy a drink, read, use WiFi, do puzzles or visit with fellow cruisers. There was a small pool filled with tepid water as well as a walking track around the upper deck. For more vigorous exercise, there was a small fitness room with several exercise machines on the lower deck. The lounge area provided extra indoor seating to view the riverside from the bow of the ship or close to the bar for drinks service or at the entrance by the coffee machine where one could enjoy reading sample news from national papers or do a crossword puzzle. The library on board is unimpressive but had a couple of mysteries by well known English authors and a few travel books for the areas on the rivers. I had little time to read though. The dining room served breakfast and lunch buffet style but always had a menu to order from as well. Dinner lasted from 7-9 and was waiter served. White cloth tables and stemware were set for 4-6. Food was delicious and looked attractive on the plates; servings were small but many courses were offered \u2013 appetizer, soup, main course, dessert. Steak, chicken, salmon, Caesar salad, and hamburger were available as options to those on the dinner menu. Foods were identified for their allergic components and waiters dutifully helped gluten free diners select their foods. Ages of cruisers on this ship were 60+ with lots of Aussies, Canadians, fewer Brits and Americans. The staff was very attentive of disabled passengers needing help with motorized scooters; elevator was available for those unable to climb the few stairs between floors. Staff was friendly, organized, mainly from the Balkan areas, and got to know our names quickly. The butler even did 1 kg bag of laundry for free.  River cruising is indeed a different way of seeing common European sights. We really enjoyed our cruise and highly recommend Scenic river cruises based on our experience aboard their Jasper ship."

            "review": "AMAZING FIRST RIVER CRUISE ON SCENIC TOURS. This was our first cruise - Scenic Tours \"Gems of Danube\" from Nuremberg to Budapest. First in planning for our cruise, we reviewed costs of various cruise lines. Surprisingly, Scenic was less than Viking but offered more since it was all-inclusive - gratuities, drinks any time, a number of excursions at each docking, butler (loved the 6:30 knock on the door each morning with a fresh pot of coffee), laundry etc. These extras at no cost made the cruise very enjoyable. Our relatives had taken a Viking cruise and after a day on Scenic, their opinion was that a Viking ship could not compare to the Scenic Amber.The Scenic Amber was new ship and fantastic. Cabins are spacious with lots of storage including space under the beds for luggage bags and 20 hangers. The king sized bed was very comfortable and you could change positions of the mattress with a remote control. The \"Sun Lounge\" concept is excellent - essentially provides an extra 40 sq ft of cabin space. You can sit on the 2 chairs and watch the scenery no matter what the weather - if it is raining, keep window up; if sunny open widow so that you have a balcony. Toiletries are top off the line (according to Anne - L Occitane). The crew were very friendly and willing to do anything they could to satisfy you. Meals were delicious and had lots of choices - hard not to gain some extra weight. They have a special restaurant called Portobellos with a 6 course meal. All guests can book it once during the cruise - would recommend they book as soon as they arrive to get the day that is best for them.The majority of the excursions were excellent - especially when the dock was located in the center of town. The best dock was in Budapest where the ship was directly opposite the Parliament Buildings. Some were not - main disappointment was Nuremberg - too much time was spent at the Documentation Centre and, probably due to the rain, the \"Taste of Nuremberg\" was disappointing according to some.The highlight was the night cruise of Budapest in which they light up all the historical buildings. Day and night photos of the Parliament Buildings in Budapest from our ship are attached.One decision we made was not to book the Scenic 3 night Prague tour before the cruise. We felt that the cost of $2600 more per couple was too much. We did the 3 night tour on our own at a cost of $2100 - a savings of $500. We were very happy with the results and for the $2100 we got:- Accommodation at the Marriott Prague - $500 - same hotel as the Scenic tour- Private Tour Company - $800 - included Prague airport pickup on Friday; 4 hour walking tour of Prague castle and surrounding area on Saturday; 4 hour walking tour of Old & New Town and river cruise on Sunday; transportation from Prague to the ship in Nuremberg including a Pilsen Brewery tour on Monday- All other expenses (meals, drinks, souvenirs etc) - $800 - One dinner was at the Zvonice Restaurant located on the 7th floor of a 16th century bell tower 5 minutes from the hotel with the tables surrounding the original bell. Another dinner was at Kampa Park Restaurant on the Riverside Terrace overlooking the Charles Bridge.We feel the Scenic Gem of Danube river cruise was excellent and exceeded our expectations. Our decision not to book the Prague pre-cruise tour and do it on our own was a good one. We will definitely consider Scenic first if we decide on another river cruise."

Enjoy the scenery with the amazing illumination of the city at night. Enjoy the wind blowing thru your face and hair out on the deck. Enjoy listening to the serenade while cruising along the river. You may even be tempted to dance the waltz on deck. Take it. It may look touristy, but you are a tourist in Budapest! Enjoy being a tourist!"

Over the course of seven days, we cruised the enchanting Danube River through four European countries -- from Budapest to Vilshofen -- and enjoyed every minute. We particularly enjoyed that the going was slow enough to allow us to fully take in everything from stunning countryside to medieval towns to cathedrals off in the distance.We docked in Bratislava, Vienna, passed the scenic wine-growing region of the Wachau Valley -- and more. We traveled in November, right as the Christmas markets were beginning to open, and found it to be the best time to avoid the crowds and still stay warm enough to get out and enjoy the sites.The Danube region has been a hub for art, music, opera, literature and more across the centuries. We didn't touch on even a fraction of it during our trip, but having the river as our entry point allowed us to see more than we could have solely by land. Highly recommend exploring this memorable river via a multi-day riverboat cruise!"

Prior to our trip we did not consider ourselves cruise people but now we do. For us the trip was perfect. While, some reviewers have commented negatively on the size of the stateroom we found it to be more than adequate and amazingly functional. The small veranda with floor to ceiling doors made it appear more spacious. The housekeeping staff was excellent. Our cabin was immediately adjacent to the lobby area but we never were bothered by external noises.The food was well prepared and the choices were varied. We appreciated that the entree portions were not supersized. Our compliments to the chef. The wines that were served with lunch and dinner were fine unless you are a wine conessiur. The drinks at the bar were reasonably priced. We still have a hard time understanding why anyone would add on the liquor option. Several nights complimentary sparkling wine cocktails were offered. We enjoyed the more casual dining on the Aquavit Terrace a few times. The beer that was served with lunch and dinner was ok but upon asking my husband found a great dark beer that was available but not offered. Most nights at dinner we ate with a couple who were Vegan and unfortunately their dining experience left at great deal to be desired. They had made their dietary preferences known at the time of booking. The staff devoted time everyday going over their choices but it never really came together. One meal they were presented with a plate of sauerkraut as the entire meal. Unless, Viking intends to reimburse customers with special diets they really need to do a better job.The ports and tours were informative and well organized. Of course some places appeal more to different people and some guides are better than others but getting 190 people around in a peasant and organized fashion was well done. We especially enjoyed the unstructed opportunities to explore the various ports on our own. FYI, our favorite stops were Budapest and Durnstein and our least favorite was Vienna. We can't say enough about the staff. They were always pleasant and attentive. We were stunned when we first boarded to be greeted by the entire staff with Champagne and fresh flowers. Who knew that being the first couple on this brand new cruise ship would result in such a VIP greeting! We were fortunate not to need any medical treatment but those that did spoke very highly of how Viking handled the situation. Our travel agent recommended that we pay the extra fee to have greater flexibility in our flight arrangements. I can't speak to how that works if you don't choose that option but our flights and transportation to and from the airports were flawless.Several reviewers have commented on the situation when you can't cruise due to water levels. I can only imagine how frustrating this would be. I had heard of this happening through friends but I would agree that this possibility is in very fine print in the Viking promotions. Those of you considering a cruise later this summer or fall should be aware that the snows from the Alps feed the Danube and there was very little snow this past year.No experience is perfect for everyone but it was for us and we are looking forward to our next Viking cruise."

You will get the finest views of Budapest's most historic buildings including the royal palace (now an art gallery) the Parliament building and the landmark churches. The river is majestic in its breadth and the city-scape is well preserved, Modern buildings have been made to fit in with the sillhouette and do not dominate.

Etc...it was awesome !!!!! The cruise was excellent the hosts took good care of us. The free champagne and wine was offered as written . We , however ordered a Hungarian champagne , which. I know very well and would recommend strongly...it is pink and called Francois President. The buffet was excellent , had good variety of food. The cruise was smooth and picture opportunities were available also on the top deck in an open area. One need to take a little more money for wine or champagne if required, the tip for the musicians who can play songs at one's request (mostly by violin and trombone) , also souvenir pictures are taken of the passengers and sold in a \"frame\" with souvenir photo of the brig deg etc...nice memories."

            "review": "Viking River Cruise Nuremberg to Budapest. We stayed three days in Prague before beginning our cruise with Viking. Our booking experience was positive and our transfers from the airport to the hotel in Prague were uneventful. No problems at all. We arrived at our hotel, got our orientation and had a free day. We had a walking tour of Prague included which was the best tour Viking had our entire trip. They tend to use Historians and experts to do the tours, not just a guide. We had other tours on our own, but what they had to offer was good. We are younger and being on guided tours with 70+ year olds is just too slow for our pace! The cruise:Once our stay in Prague was over, we were transferred by bus as a group to Nuremberg where the boat was docked. The people transferred from the airport got a chance to visit the town, but we arrived to late to do that. Our walking tour of Nuremberg was great. Our guide was great, but the weather was turning bad...cold and wet!!!We headed off to Regensberg which was a beautiful little town. There were lots of little shops but we hit it on a holiday and they were closed. We went to the Abby by boat. The weather was terrible but the views still amazing. We ate sausage, drank beer, hit a festival with more beer, walked through the town and decided that from then on we would ditch the tours! We, as a group of 10 had more fun without them. The Danube has many locks (about 22 from Nuremberg to Budapest. Most of them are at night but it's very interesting to watch the boat go through one! Our next stop was Passau where we took a side trip to Salzberg where we broke out on our own and saw the beautiful castle at our own pace! We this was a beautiful city. I wish I had been given more time here! Off to Krems. Not much to see here but a good stopping point for the boat to see the Benedictine Abby which was beautiful and interesting. We begrudgingly did this tour as a group because there was little offered. Next it was off to Vienna and this is a city that will take your breath away. We had a horse drawn carriage ride through the city just at dusk when the lights were coming on. It was magnificent. I totally recommend it. For the one hour ride it was 80 Euros. Pricy but really a neat experience. Get the carriage in the town square next to the church. Our last stop was Budapest which was my favorite. This city has so much history! Some of it sad history but it's a glorious city in all of its hidden splendor beneath years of neglect by the Russians. If you take this cruise, take the Nuremberg to Budapest route, instead of starting in Budapest. You spend less time on the boat going to Budapest than away from it due to currents and locks on the Danube!You'll have to read my individual reviews on all the sights to get details. Especially in Vienna, Prague, and Budapest.Our Boat:The river boat cruise is a very different kind of cruise. It's smaller and more casual. You get to make new friends. Our group was large so we had the same waitstaff each day. They were great. Our cabin was a Veranda A cabin which had a balcony on the 3rd floor. The views are not really any better, the cabin size is the same and the price is a bit more. The bathroom is small but very efficient. Luggage can be stored under the bed and out of the way! The closet and drawer space is ample for two on a week trip. Wifi is spotty because it's satellite. Put the phone down anyway. It's vacation time! Bring toilet paper....even the best European toilet paper doesn't come close to our worst! Come equipped to pay at least an additional $400 in tips to waitstaff, cabin housekeeper, and program director. The upper deck is great during times of sunshine and warmth. I suspect June-September are the best months to go! All totaled with 2 extensions on both ends of our trip, souvenirs, extra tours, spa treatments, meals and accommodations, we spent no where near what I thought it would cost. US money goes far in Prague and Budapest! Take this trip before they raise the prices! It's worth i! "

The river flows, or rather meanders betweew Buda and Pest and provides beautiful views, a means of transporting goods and passangers and the opportunity for sightseeing. Staring in the mid 1850s, a number of bridges were built to connect Buda and Pest., All of them were blown up by the withdrawing German troops at the end of WWII. They were painstakingly rebuilt after the war, trying to keep the architectural style of each. The Chain bridge is the most speciaol one, because of its design, its location and its history. There are several islands in the Danube, but the one of interest for visitors is Margit (or Margaret) island. Located between Arpad and Margit bridges, this is a large park, with hotels, restaurants, thermal baths and places for sportts, suntanning and just strolling among beautiful gardens. it is well worth an afternoon. Within easy reach using the streetcar or bus system, it can also be accessed on foot, through one of the bridges."

My friend and I took a delightful 90 minute trip on one of the smaller river cruises with about 25 passengers.It included two cocktails of our choice or three beers. We had lovely generous sized cocktails served as we sat in the sun listening to the commentary on the wonderful architectural and historical buildings bordering the Danube.The trip took us to the Margit Bridge one way then beyond the green bridge the other way before returning to the pontoon where we embarked.It was lovely, relaxed, tasty, informative and thoroughly recommended."

The people here take pride in the lights along this river at night. They light up the buildings all along the river. It is lovely. You can choose to dine on a boat docked on the river, or take a riverboat cruise, with or without dinner included. This you can do during the day, where you really can see more sights and details of the lovely buildings, or at night, taking in the beautiful twinkling lights strung around all of the buildings. I wanted to do both, but time did not allow this. Plus just being on the historic Danube is a treat in itself."

Ama Waterways offer a very high standard of service. food, everything in fact and they could not of done more to make it an enjoyable trip.

So I chose another cruise tour with dinner included, but there are none available on the website. Lastly, I booked directly through the official website of the company by googling the name directly. There were plenty of places left but need to pay in full in Euros. I hope my experience may help some travellers. Besides, when you get the ticket (regardless of which company you are travelling with), you will get the pier number. The pier is rather long between the Chain Bridge and the Elisabeth Bridge and you can't google the exact location of the pier. The location that Google map generated is the mid-point of the pier only. So spare time for walking to and finding where yours locate."

Historically, this really has a lot to do with each riverbank historically being a separate city, but we get to enjoy the benefits of it today in one unified capital. The views across the river are impressive in pretty much every spot, though nothing really beats the view from Pest to the Buda Castle Hill at night. There are many ways to enjoy it, from a stroll down one of several riverbank sections, perhaps with a pause at a sidewalk cafe with a view (for low-key, try one of the spots at the new Balna (\"whale\") center), riding a bike along the bike paths down one side and up the other, or taking to the water by boat. For this, skip the tourist boats and ride the public transport boats, accessible from well-marked boat stops, styled just like the other public transit service (tram/bus) stops. It's a lot cheaper and a lot more bang for your buck."

Having done an ocean cruise before with Royal Caribbean Cruises I was a bit apprehensive about doing a river cruise but I needn\u2019t have worried, it was amazing. I travelled on Uniworld\u2019s River Beatrice along the Danube from Passau Germany to Budapest Hungary.I don\u2019t know where to start; my experience from start to finish was brilliant, from we stepped onboard the staff were so friendly and the service was top notch. From food, wine, entertainment to shore excursions the attention to detail was first class.Food and wine menus daily were from the country you were visiting which was lovely to try lots of different varieties. I could go on all day about how amazing the food onboard was. Daily excursions were planned to tee, with small groups, English speaking guides and comfortable transport. You can do as many or as little excursions as you want.The cabin was a little on the small size but it was very clean and very comfortable. It had all the usual tea & coffee facilities, it had luxury robes and slippers, water and sweets restocked daily, an umbrella, listening devices for your onshore excursions, plenty of stationery, complimentary water bottles and luxury L\u2019Occitane bath and body products. You don\u2019t need any adaptors with you as there are plenty of different universal plugs for your electronics etc.A little tip i would recommend a French balcony cabin it is lovely leaving the door open while sailing along and really stunning sailing into or out of the different towns and cities. Overall, I can\u2019t recommend Uniworld\u2019s River Beatrice highly enough I will definitely be doing more River Cruises and I can\u2019t wait for my next Uniworld experience!!"

There are many Danube river cruises, which may include the cities like Vienna, Budapest, Munich and Prague. If you are in Budapest, you can take a one hour sightseeing cruise on the river along the city with several stops at the main attractions. Some operators even offer lunch or dinner on the way, or you can also find some fixed floating restaurants on both side with live music or concerts sometimes in the night (like on A38) .view is gorgeous in the night from both sides or also from the bridges - worth a big walk along"

The music added to what was a beautiful evening. The ship was really good quality. We were a little worried to start with by some of the reviews and comments in 2013 and the meeting point. But rest assured this is a fantastic and professional trip that is a must to do. Five points to make to help - 1. The meeting point is not the street but the building itself. Go into the building and check in first. 2. After the initial free welcome drinks do not worry about prices. The wine and drinks are reasonably priced and good quality. 3. The musicians played individual requests for you at your table a tip is customary for this. 4.If you have any worries or need anything the staff were so helpful. 5. The ship is large, clean and modern. We had a lovely evening and the lights of the city were amazing with plenty of time to take photos out on deck. Hope this review helps you!"

Despite the boat sailing from a different location we checked in on the quayside and were shown to our vessel for the evening. Our table was read for the 4 of us and we were offered a prosecco aperitif to start before dinner. It was exceptionally well organised and there was constant entertainment from a gypsy trio who could play anything - we were amazed when they came round the tables and we asked if they knew the Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana which they then proceeded to play perfectly! When I wiped my wifes tears from her eyes we carried on with dinner and an endless supply of drink to accompany it. The boat did 2 x 1 hour cruises - one at the start of dinner, and one just before Midnight - the scenes on the shoreline with all the building decked out in lights and constant firework displays were spectacular. We then had gyspy dancers and after the Sylvester meal there was a disco. What a great way to see the Danube and all the bridges and magnificent buildings."

First and in all fairness, the ports and excursions were absolutely breathtaking. We visited Budapest, Slovakia, Vienna, and Passau...an experience I thoroughly enjoyed and will never forget. I would strongly advise taking this voyage on any other line but Viking, as our ship and customer service left much to be desired.We've been cruising and primarily ocean cruises, for over 20 years. And yes we do know there is a big difference. That difference however shouldn't come in the form of \"low quality\" food, accommodations, and customer service.Viking is far from cheap so we began our voyage with great expectations. When we boarded our riverboat, The Viking Sky, we found it to be old, worn, basically dilapidated. A vessel that I am now told has been \"decommissioned\" and which should have been prior to our voyage. We did however, give Viking the benefit of the doubt saying...\"they'll make it up in food and service\" HAH!!. The food was the worst ever, full of sodium to the point of where our feet and hands swelled daily. Thank goodness none of us had heart issues. After our evening meal, if we were hungry, there was nothing to eat...no room service, snacks, nothing...a cooler of water in the lobby was it. We had to go ashore and spend more money satisfying appetites that should have come with our \"high priced\" ticket.One evening at dinner a waiter starting arguing with a guest at our table. Instead of trying to please a customer, this waiter was trying to prove his point and did so while embarrassing the entire dining room. He wasn't the only staff member that exhibited unprofessional conduct and poor customer service during our trip.The complaints go on and on with this awful experience. The reason however that I'm writing this review now...years later, is that Viking recently contacted me concerning a not so nice comment I posted on FB. They asked that I please deal with them directly to see if they could finally at this late date, rectify things from my previous voyage. I was a bit impressed, once again gave them more credit than they deserve and thought perhaps they had changed.Shortly after our cruise we did send letters of complaint and were insulted by the lack of consideration and the fact Viking offered us a \"meager\" discount voucher to take a chance on another one of their overpriced trips. It was offensive. Regardless, when the sweet Viking rep approached me this time, I still wanted to try and give her more than her company ever gave me...a chance to finally do the right thing.Well some things never change...and Viking seems to be one of them. After several discussions, this staff person, who swears Viking is continually striving to be better than ever...basically offered me the same insulting deal from long agoIn closing all I can say is when you're in the business of serving people...every customer should matter as if they're the only customer you have. Viking does a great job of \"impressing\" people with beautiful scenic pictures and stories...yet when it comes right down to it, they truly only want to speak to one of their fans. Some people know a good thing when they see it, some don't. Viking is the furthest thing from good and charges you double the price of any other reputable cruise line out there. It's easy to satisfy when things go well. It's when they don't that you truly see what a company is made of. When it comes to making the wrong right...Viking is all talk and no action. There's another saying too and it's \"Money Talks and Bull Manure Walks\". If you're listening Viking...other things talk as well, like people you have treated poorly and then disregard. In other words...bad news travels fast."

We paid at Dock No. 7 for the Legenda Danube Cruise. A one hour long sail down the Danube offers a magnificent view of both Buda and Pest. About five bridges on the Danube can be seen with all the architectural details. View of the ornate Parliament building from the Danube is spectacular. We also saw the legendary \"boat bus\" sailing on the river ! The audio guide narration was very helpful. View of the Fisherman's Bastion, Liberty Statue, Buda Castle and the Budapest Veil remain unforgettable. The day being bright and sunny we enjoyed the cruise to the hilt. We got down at Margaret Island and explored the place on our own for about an hour and returned by bus to board a tram on the Yellow Bridge to reach the Pest side of the city."

There was no organization in terms of the venue, everyone was crowded into a room to change their vouchers (purchased at the hotel) in trip tickets. From there we had to go on foot pile of 100-200 people to the place of boarding.After dinner we were offered 3-5 kind of liquor/wine for additional charge.In the boat was a little cold so I had to keep the coat in my shoulders.We saw other boat on the river which were very nice and well maintened, look everywhere else but Duna Palota Cruises (Europa)."

My wife, who can find fault with most things, could not find anything to complain about. The organisation was excellent, so you did not have to worry about anything. You were told well in advance about what was planned and always given 15 mins notice to get ready for the day trips/events. We had a cabin with panoramic windows, well worth the extra for the view. As it was so late in the season, there were very few other boats and the highlight was mooring directly opposite the parliament building in Budapest, it really is an incredible sight to see from your room.The food was good, with plenty of choice. We did not have a drinks package, but there was no shortage of wine served with the meals, which was usually from the region that you were in.Never having been on a cruise in Europe before we were amazed by the number of locks, and the size and complexity of some of them - never a dull moment.The cabin was fine, with TV and WiFi, the bed was comfortable.Overall it was excellent, so well done Emerald."

First, the trip from Atlanta through Paris to Budapest was daunting only because DeGaulle airport in Paris is so very time consuming and difficult. Avoid DeGaulle if you can.Arrival in Budapest was very nice, fast luggage retrieval, and a 40 minute ride to the Viking dock. The evening sailaway from Budapest is fabulous - with the golden government building and lighted bridges in full-on lighted like magic glory. Sailing the Danube, Rhine, and Main was sometimes fabulous, sometimes boring. We sailed during late October, so colors along the rivers were fabulous. I've seen enough gray German cities to last. One tour guide said our group looked like the ABC group. Another Bloody Cathedral... or...Another Boring Castle.The Budapest Market has lots of cheap trinkets, but also some very good quality leather goods -- look carefully to sort out the low grade products. Cologne was my favorite city, partly because it was a safe, easy, close walk from the Viking dock to the downtown area which sports all the major name-brand stores you'd expect in the city. And it's right next to the cathedral. So it's a good walk.I took a side trip one day to a winery in a small mountain town - that was worth the trip, with amazing scenery over the valley and vineyards when the bus stopped for a photo op.Nice trip. Viking is all kinds of very nice and accommodating to guests aboard. Entertainment is schmaltzy, but ok. Food is great, as would be expected. Eat some lunches on the Aquavit terrace - it's never too busy to get a table within a few minutes. The tiny, tiny cabins are just barely liveble for space, but oh so nicely appointed. The newly designed bathrooms on the Bestla and Eistla made me want to go home and install all new wood-look tile with Grohe fixtures!Yes... the Bestla AND the Eistla. We booked on the Eistla but did a ship swap (October low water) at Passau. It didn't kill us, and we had a wonderful experience on both these identical river boats."

I can honestly say this is the most relaxing holiday I have ever experienced - just sitting on the boat, seeing the scenery as we passed by was a delight.

What a fabulous cruise mostly because of the serenity of traveling by river and the workings of the staff. The food was fabulous and abundant. Plenty to do onboard and interesting and doable shore excursions, most of which are included in the price of the cruise.Warning: while the Christmas markets are fun, many of the items are imported from China and not homemade as I was hoping to find. Still, walking around and sampling sausage or baked goods or gullwein was fun. Also, the entire area is filled with fog most of the day so you won't get good views of the castle ruins or even large vistas. I believe we saw the sun twice in our 8 days!Still, this is a part of European heritage that you can't find at any other time of year. The bonus is that there are fewer tourists so the crowds aren't bad and it isn't so cold as to be a problem. Much better than the very hot days of summer!Highly recommend Viking ships as they have great balconies and seemed more modern than the others we came across. This is a great way to see many cities at your leisure rather than having to climb into a bus every morning at 7 am! No need to pack and unpack and the opportunity to make lots of new friends!"

Only few minutes from Bratislava, Slovakia toward south east along the river Danube you can find small ferry that goes across the river from one bank to the other. When the new Danube channel was built, the builders did not plan to build a bridge between the northern and southern bank. That's why there is a small ferry which allows pedestrians and cars to get from side of the river to the other. Ferry is free of charge and the ride takes approximately up to 10 minutes. It is a nice trip if you have kids and you can take ferry both ways for free. At the peak times one can expect more cars waiting for the ferry but you can leave car at one of the banks and just use the ferry as pedestrian. Unfortunately, there is nothing more to see there just the ferry but it is a rare opportunity to try something like this in this area."

Our traveling group (\"The Nova 6\") experienced a wonderful Danube river cruise (Budapest to Nuremberg) and land tour (Prague, Dresden, and Berlin) with Gate 1. The seven-day cruise was on the Sound of Music, not the most modern of the river cruise ships (built in 2006), but one that is very well maintained with both the private and public spaces aboard the boat attractive and appealing. What made our first river cruise memorable, however, were the staff and the food. STAFF: Our Gate 1 Tour Manager, Nora, was very knowlegeable about the places we visited and she interacted seamlessly with the excellent tour guides provided in each of the towns and cities we visited. Nora, with her delightful personality, could not have been more accommodating, always doing whatever she could to ensure our happiness and satisfaction (she even ran down the street in Prague to tell us the restaurant where our companions had gone!). Our dining room waiter for most of the trip, Ellia, was terrific. He attended to our every need (including the special and extra meals one of our companions required). Monica, our stateroom staff member, kept our very nicely appointed cabins (we had rooms with full windows that opened; excellent choice) neat and tidy as a pin. FOOD: Our well-traveled group is very focused on quality dining. The aspect of the trip about which we were skeptical was the food. We were more than pleasantly surprised by the remarkable choice, excellence in taste, and attractive presentation of all of our meals on board the Sound of Music. All of us have extensive traditional cruise ship experience across several of the major cruise lines. Our dining experience on this trip matched or exceeded all of them, including service in the ships' specialty restaurants. When Gate 1 launches its new river cruise vessel in 2016, we urge them to match the dining room staff they have on the Sound of Music!In sum, the river cruise experience on the Sound of Music was exceptional. The Nova 6 is very likely to consider another similar holiday. After all, there are lots of rivers in the world!"

The sites from the boat such as Buda Castle, Parliament and the Chain Bridge were magical! The dinner buffet had something for everyone: Appetizer spreads, soup, salad with chicken, pasta salad, caesar salad, corn with red onion and dill salad, chicken paprika, sliced breast of chicken in a sauce, beef, stuffed cabbage, sausage & kraut, fritters, rice, spatzle, mousse with cake, apple and berry strudel, one glass of mineral water, one alcoholic drink of your choice and one glass of champagne. A cash bar is available. The buffet items were cooked perfectly and DELICIOUS! Waitstaffe were so very welcoming, friendly and attentive. The only negative I have to say is that the heating system on the boat was set a very high temperature. It felt like 80 degrees with the heat continually blowing so that took some getting used to."

My wife and I decided to book this cruise after receiving an offer from Viking River Cruises for 2 for 1 free air 8 day cruise from Budapest to Nuremburg. We purchased the optional insurance for 600.00 still a great value. Our cabin was on the lowest level but had a window just above the water line. Viking booked our flights on Lufthansa economy, from LAX direct to Frankfurt and on to Budapest. I was pleased with the airline and service they provided. We were met at the Airport in Budapest by Viking personnel and taken by motor coach to the boat docked at the chain bridge. We were welcomed and shown to our room after a shower we explored the boat.We were told there were 175 people on the boat and never felt crowded plenty of room to spread out. We purchased the silver drink package for 300 euro, we received our money's worth but probably would not do so again since beer and wine with lunch are poured generously. We considered cancelling after reading of low water levels and bad reviews, but decided not to. We were prepared for the possibility of having to switch boats and indeed had to but aside from having to pack and unpack Viking has seemed to have this down. It wasn't bad, they also offered a free excursion to Figaros Wedding which we skipped and free drinks for an hour for the inconvenience. The staff on our first boat seemed better but were still top notch. The tours were mostly walking tours with local guides and were first rate! The food on the boat was very good. We ended up getting to know quite a few people on a first name basis and sat with them during meals often, which surprised us since we really aren't fond of schmoozing. Some people act snobby and acted as if they were first class passengers on the titanic which actually was quite amusing. We tipped according to the instructions we were given which came to 225 euro and were provided envelopes for cash they take dollars and euros. There are no names or way of tracking if you tip or not ? You may also charge it to your credit card when you settle up. Everything went flawlessly until the day before we were to fly home. Lufthansa went on strike and our flight from Nuremburg to Frankfurt was cancelled, we notified the Viking program director and concierge and they said they were unaware of any problems with flights? We assumed since Viking arranged the flights they would provide us with alternate arrangements, not so. They actually never made any announcements or notifications regarding the Lufthansa strike and took us to the Nuremburg airport and dropped us off at 4:00 am, a Viking representative was there who basically showed us to the Lufthansa counter and said good luck. Lufthansa finally opened at 5:15 am and told us we would have to take the metro to the train station and take a train to Frankfurt,(2 Heavy bags in a city/country we were unfamiliar with? Wow, I mentioned someone in our group was flying to Zurich then to the USA was that a possibility and she checked and said yes but it meant we would have to wait 4.5 hours to fly to Zurich and on to LA on Swiss, we decided to take the sure thing and although it was not as nice as Lufthansa we made it home. I am glad we were first in line some people were not as lucky as us. We would still take a Viking Cruise in spite of this and will remember it the rest of our lives."

Viking encourages everyone to take out a cancellation policy prior to booking, but they left all the travelers out in the cold on this one. Very poor management on the upper level..........Ask questions about traditional and historical water levels prior to booking.This cruise should have been cancelled or at the bare minimum offer the customers an option............Viking River Cruise (Nuremberg to Budapest) November 2015"

Although Viking did many things including adding extra excursions to our 8 day trip along the Danube, ending at Budapest, the basic fact is that there are major problems with low water along this route. The weather and water conditions cannot be changed, but Viking was not up front about these issues when we asked and implied that the decision to use buses along part of the trip was a \"day to day\" thing when really the problem has occurred for months. We spoke with other travelers in Prague on other routes who were emailed the day before their cruise that part of it would be by bus. No such email for us.Viking does so many things right that it seems incredible that they would not be up front about this issue. The advantage of seeing Europe via a river cruise is to unpack once and have your room go with you. Packing and unpacking to take a long bus ride for two of the legs was not enjoyable. Please do your research before signing up for this cruise, especially with the Christmas Market season upon us."

Many times employees only work to do their jobs , hopefully receive a gratuity and serve the next trip. We were fortunate to have a staff that cared about you , your memorable experiences, your service and your well being. One the second day they knew our first names and knew what we liked and who was part of our family. Special thanks go to Zoran Ilic and Doru Ifrimesu ( bartenders) they knew what we liked and always said hello and had fresh drinks even when the bar was ready to close they stayed and talked to us. Our waiter at our table - Damir Milijenc, I had an issue with my sole of my shoe . The evening before I spoke to the receptionist to ask for glue, the next morning he knew about it and had glue for me to fix. Plus his service and attention to us at dinner was as good as a fine restaraunt. I have a severe food allergy, panayot Tsletkov, personally ensured my meals were cocked safely and served me himself, his position head maitre d. Above anything I expected or wanted. And finally Beatrix Oliveira, concierge, where do we starts. She knew our family by name on day 1 and knew everything about us so we had an excellent time. She was amazing on how she would always makes sure we enjoyed our trip. If you haven't heard The Danube is low due to a hot and dry summer. Many cruises had to bus the guests between cities so they were able to see everything. We were fortunate to make it all the way down river to Budapest. Buses were used but for only short rides to tour destinations. As you can tell we loved the concept but especially the Viking staff.

The beautifull bridges over the river join to ghether the two major parts of the city.The hilly Buda, with it's old streets, the impressive royal palace, the Church of Holly Matyas and the Fisher's Bastions, which dominate the architectual landscape of the western banc and of course, thr Statue of Liberty, dominating the skyline of Gelert Mountain.On the eastern banc , which is Pest, the most beautifull spot is the Parliament House ( Az Orszag Haza= The House of the Country, if verbaly translated from Hungarian), reminding us very much, the British Hous of Parliament - The Westminster in it' s neogothic architectural stile. The nice recreation island - The Marghit Island, ads its charm to that of the river, with the green parcs,alees, nice hotels and spas.One of the intersting and atractive ways to see and feel the beauty of the city, shuold be a boath trip on the river and if you want to accentuate the romantic side of the charm, do it by night , taking a diner and listening to live music. Surprisingly, do not expect too much, from the touristic buffe menu and you'll not be disapointed.If you wish to have an idea of the good Hungarian kitchen, then go to an Hungarian local restaurant .On this journey, the athmosphere and the landscape are the winners. Add one or two drinks and you'll get a grate feeling and pleasure."

Ditto in the dining room, no maitre'd to seat you, only a few dinner entr\u00e9e choices. very cheap wines served and the very same white wine 7 days in a row.

We took a 9 night holiday with Diamond Holidays which included a 4 night river cruise aboard the MS Serenity during September 2015. To be fair, the boat was fine and we enjoyed the 4 nights aboard.Much of the rest of the holiday was mis-informed. Do not trust this lot. We were supposed to be staying in 4 star Novotel Hotel by the river (with wonderful views of the Parliament Building) for our 3 nights in Budapest prior to the cruise. We were actually put in the Best Western hotel near Kaleti station which was an hours walk from the river and in a dodgy area. Hotel was very poor with dreadful rooms and would hardly qualify as 2 star. Following this we were taken to the boat and had to queue in the pouring rain on the long gangplank to the boat while passengers were checked in. Would have been more sensible to allow all aboard the boat and wait in the dry for check in. This was most uncomfortable for the many elderly people on the cruise. I could mention many aspects of the trip that were found wanting but to highlight just one more - We were told that our final night would be in Frankfurt but on arrival were herded aboard a coach and driven for an hour along the autobahn to stay many miles from the city in another low grade hotel. On complaining following the holiday, we were offered a \u00a3100 voucher off the cost of a future booking with Diamond Holidays, as if this would even be considered! As I say, don't trust this lot. Book elsewhere!"

They transformed our river cruise from Nuremberg in Germany to Budapest in Hungary, passing by Vienna, into a bus tour as the river level was too low.They don t tell you before you leave so that you can t cancel and then pretend that it is a rare occurrence whereas they have been affected by the low water level since August and we travelled in October.Their solution it leave the ship anchored in Regensburg and then bus you around to Passau and Melk so that they can say that they delivered on the destination. Then more busing to Budapest. They then rush you on another ship, which greatly limits the time available to visit Vienna and Budapest, the two highlights of the trip.We simply left the ship, took the train to Vienna so that we would not be posed to this abuse by Viking..I did not want to do a bus trip across Europe. We rejoined the ship later in Vienna and let me tell you that passengers were outraged by their trip..What they also forget to tell you is that most of the time, they attach their ships together in port so that the beautiful veranda stateroom with balcony for which you paid a hefty extra is facing another ship, 6 inches away, or sometimes facing a concrete wall. Did I mention the announcement on the PA system at 8h15 in the morning in your stateroom to announce the next activity.To be fair, food is good, service is attentive and the ships are nice, but as expected small versus ocean liners. Very disappointed by Viking. They gambled with our precious vacation time and we were the ones losing."

You can take a lovely walk along either shore to take in some of the beautiful architecture.At night various landmarks are lit up (st Michael's church, Chaim Bridge, Buda Castle and the Parliament building). It is simply stunning. Well worth taking a stroll after dinner. Taking a boat trip along it is a great way to see the city and you can also dine on it as many of the boats do a dinner cruise."

However, the river was not blue and the water was low from the hot summer draught experienced on the River. Grate 1 Travel however made lemonade out of lemons and provided a wonderful land/cruise vacation. Where we could not be on the river, Gate 1 had luxury coaches waiting to drive us to our scenic tour sights in Nuremberg. In Regensburg we boarded our ship and continued down the river o Passau, Linz, Melk, Durnstein, Bratislava with side tris to Salzburg, Vienna and finally Budapest. Unbelievable castles, abbeys, mountains, valleys, and cities...a trip of a lifetime!"

During our guided tour to Budapest, our tour guide arranged a private dinner cruise on the Danube which she called Budapest By Night. Essentially we rented the entire boat for a few hours so we could enjoy dinner, drinks and sightseeing. The dinner buffet included several tasty Hungarian choices and the local wine was very pleasant. Although the dinner was very good, the view of the city at night was the highlight of this evening! Several landmarks in the city of Budapest, including the gorgeous Parliament building and the bridges spanning the Danube were illuminated spectacularly! I am so glad that we signed up for this very enjoyable evening event and I recommend this attraction to all visitors to the wonderful city of Budapest."

This lasted about an hour first commenting on the building on the RHS and then coming back on the LHS of the river . It was a beautiful sight with all the buildings and bridges lit . We also repeated with a day time cruise (we had four cruise tickets to use) . This was good but not as great as the nighttime cruise . It went around the island as well and lasted almost two hours."

The Danube is by far one of the most enjoyable rivers in Europe to cruise on. It affords us the most countries to visit and its waters are calm and very navigable, even during periods of lower water levels. In eight days we experienced quaint villages and major cities throughout Germany, the Czeck Republic, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary. It afforded us opportunities to tour places such as Prague, Vienna, Saltzburg, Brataslava and Budapest. Truck Cruises is by far the most premium cruise line to offer such an itinerary and we would recommend Tauck as your first choice in cruising the beautiful Danube."

Being the tail end of the season, we booked an afternoon cruise which included a soft drink, tea or coffee. I think there was no more than 20 people on the boat. It is a good way to see the banks of the Danube with a really good view of the parliament building."

We were sitting in traffic on the wharf but it was still enjoyable seeing how the lights of the city started to appear on the water. We decided to take a boat ride and see the city from the middle of the river. It was amazing. All of the turists waved at each other from the boats, it made us smile. We took long walks by the river, visited all the beautiful, famous bridges. We were really amazed by those lions guarding the Chaing bridge and really enjoyed the view around the Liberty bridge. The capital is definitely not capital without the Danube."

Two days before our departure date 21 Sept we rcivd a phone call from Viking Cruises advising that our travel arrangements had been amended due to low water levels on the Danube and that we would now be taken to an hotel in Nuremberg and then for onward travel to our ship The Skirnir. On arrival at Munich airport we were advised by the rep that the coach would now be taking us to Passau for boarding. Passau was our scheduled stop on day 4 of our trip. We were therefore docked there for the first half of our holiday river cruise.Once on board our stateroom was very smart, comfortable and had a great river view. We were very fortunate that we faced the river. The staterooms on the other side faced a damp ugly black wall for four days! At the evening briefing we were all offered a three hour each way coach trip to see Nuremburg....which we declined. We did however except the alternative offer of a visit to a typical Bavarian museum village. Which was interesting and informative.Day three we had a guided walking tour of Passau and enjoyed an excellent organ recital in St Stephens cathedral.Day four there were several alternative excursions offered. We took the one and a half hour coach trip to Regensburg for a guided walking tour. We set sail at three that afternoon. Travelling through the night arriving in Melk for a visit to the spectacular Abby. Back on board for lunch and onward sail through the Wachau valley to Vienna arriving at six pm. Next day as per schedule we had a coach and walking guided tour of the city and an excellent guided tour of the Schronbrunn Palace in the afternoon.We sailed through the night to arrive in Budapest the following morning. We enjoyed an excellent city tour.In summary we had paid and looked forward to a river cruise not a coach trip which is what we feel we had for at least half the holiday. All the staff onboard were excellent. The ship itself comfortable and modern. Food was varied and good. The programme director worked hard to compensate for the lack of cruising. We understand that Mother Nature will do as she wishes but it would have been appreciated if Viking had advised us more accurately and offered alternatives in advance of travelling."

You dock right at the port. Except LJ booked it so that we landed at 8AM and left at noon, giving us enough time to wander around in a bus!! Same with Budapest and Vienna. The only port in which we stayed 8 hours was Belgrade, Serbia- a hole in the ground with bombed out buildings, nothing to see. Ship had nothing to do, so it was boring. When we finally got off, they booked us in a hotel with horrible food and no air conditioning. no laundry facilities either, in Romania, Constanza- nothing much here either.

We told them that we would join the tour in Munich( which we did) but they sent us instructions for joining in Paris.Next day we were taken on a very long coach journey to Budapest to a Best Western Hotel despite the programme of rail and Novotel. The Best Western was badly sited with many groups there - a horrible hotel. The cruise manager was not noted for any explanations ! On arrival at the ship ,ms Serenity, we were kept waiting in the rain for check in (55 people) although it would have been easy to have taken us to the lounge to wait.The silliest thing was \"afternoon tea\" 4 - 4.30 pm. A long table was set up with two waiters to serve so a long queue was quickly formed - the queuing was one of my principal recollections of this tour !Back in Frankfurt, we had a coach journey of an hour to a really dreadful hotel \"Mercure Bensheim\" I promise you that it is NOT a Mercure in the Accor group, then an hour back for the rail trip to London via Brussels. For the part from Frankfurt, we had a really good guide who joined us at Bensheim and organized everything very efficiently The River Cruise Line is to be avoided"

In August 2015 we and another couple went on a Viking River Cruise, Romantic Danube, from Budapest, Hungary to Nuremberg, Germany up the Danube River. This was one of the best vacations we have ever taken. The trip began with a change in flights due to bad weather. The cruise we purchased included air, and when the first leg of our flight was delayed due to bad weather which would have caused us to miss our other flights, Viking quickly rerouted us. When we landed in Budapest 6 hours later then our scheduled flight we were met at the airport and put on a cab to our ship. One of our bags was left in the US and Viking representatives told us not to worry they would take care of getting it to the ship (which it did join us a couple of days later. The service and food on ships was outstanding. I mentioned ships as in plural because the Danube River was so low that our initial ship could not travel fro Passau, Germany to Regensberg, Germany, so we pack our bags and switched ships with the same Viking ship that was going down river in Regensberg. The detour involved minimal disruption, and Viking bussed us to Regensberg (45 minutes) and we had lunch in Regensberg courtesy of Viking. Not one complaint, it was a bit of an adventure, which Viking made up with an open bar that night. We did not have one bad thing to say about the trip, all excursions are included. We felt we had plenty of time to see the cities (we skipped lunch on the ship several times to stay in the various cities. Great way to see lots of Europe without having to pack an unpack."

Getting a boat from north to South is a great way to see the views along its banks (all a World Heritage site) and appreciate its bridges from another angle. My parents family live right long side it and we always take an evening/night stroll when we're visiting. As most tourists choose to take the boat, the walkways along the banks are usually the preserve of Budapest's people and is a popular spot for dates and picnics. Hungary is a nation known for being brilliant at swimming and kayaking because of their river. Try and do either upstream and you'll soon realise why their athletes are quite so strong. It's the heart of the city, so it's pretty unmissable. The Danube is definitely one of my favourite places to be close to."

We had a cabin on the Mozart deck, which was lovely. Slightly larger than an ocean cruise cabin, with plenty of storage for clothing. Exactly as pictured on their web-site. Bathroom well appointed, compact, with walk-in shower. My husband didn\u2019t care for the frosted glass door on the bathroom (shy bladder!) The \u201cFrench balcony\u201d style automatic window was fantastic. The food was great, the staff were friendly and bent over backwards to satisfy our every need. Unfortunately, on the third day, in Vienna, I tripped and fell disembarking the ship (my fault, not theirs), badly spraining both ankles. Off to the hospital by ambulance for x-rays, aircasts and crutches. The Cruise Director sent his assistant to the hospital with us to ensure we were treated well and translate if necessary. Upon my return to the ship, the Hotel Manager offered me a complementary credit for the hair salon, whatever treatment I would like. She also called our cabin at least once a day to see how I was doing and if there was anything I needed. The Maitre D\u2019 brought me dinner in our cabin for the next two evenings as I wasn\u2019t too ambulatory. The elevator wasn\u2019t working when we boarded the ship, but they had it repaired a couple of days after my fall so I could go down to the dining room. Due to the heat wave/drought in Europe this summer, the Danube river levels were too low for our ship to proceed past Passau. Our second week became a bus trip, which was not what any of us signed up for, but we were given the option of leaving the tour \u2013 Lueftner offered a credit for the remaining days of the trip and would pay the transportation of anyone who wanted to proceed directly to Amsterdam and home. The cost of changing your flight home would be borne by the passengers, however. I thought this was a fair offer, all of the fine print provided with the travel documents warned that river levels could affect the cruise. Certainly we were all disappointed, but those that were especially disgruntled should have read their travel docs with more attention.The Cruise Director and his 2 assistants then had to book buses, hotels, restaurants, etc. etc. for the next 7 days. They were exhausted by the time we reached Amsterdam (as were most of the passengers!) but they did an awesome job. So kudos to Lueftner and to Christian and Dahlia and Sorina. The hotels they booked were almost equivalent to the cabins on the ship. The food was hit and miss and not the same quality as on the Amadeus Silver, but any restaurant faced with about 90 customers seated for lunch or dinner at the same time has quite a challenge. Any changes to excursions or routines were communicated well to the passengers. And they run a tight ship \u2013 things happened on schedule for the most part, despite the disruption caused by the river levels. In spite of my fall and the loss of a week of river cruising, I would definitely book with Lueftner again. Their employees from the Captain to the maids go out of their way to ensure that they provide the best river cruise experience for their passengers."

I had been told to expect a marvelous sight but I had no idea it would be this spectacular. The buildings, monuments and bridges are all beautifully lit up. Each building seemed to out do the last. All I can say is wow. My only recommendation is that you make sure your camera is set up properly for night shots before you arrive and stay sober enough to keep it steady."

We purchased our tickets from one of the tourist information points in the city and one of the gentlemen at the stand was kind enough to walk us down to the actual boat itself as we were unsure of the location. Once on the boat, we were presented with a complimentary glass of sparkling Hungarian wine and our ticket entitled us to one other free drink during the cruise. The cruise itself was extremely relaxing and a fantastic way to get acquainted with the city and the main sites of interest. The staff on the cruise were friendly. I would recommend this as the first sightseeing thing to do in Budapest as it instantly gives you a sense of the layout of the city."

When you take a night cruise on the Danube, which by the way is a MUST, you will notice how the city has diligently worked with private enterprise in order to illuminate the two shores of the Danube along with the bridges, into a surreal fairyland light show. It is absolutely captivating, Plus you might even meet some nice people. The only downside on our cruise was the old fashioned, old age home, type music from mediocre bands, lol. During the day the walk along the Danube was nearly as spectacular, the only weak point being a a lack of railing to protect the walkway from a 10 foot precipice Riverside. this right beside a multi-million dollar Parliament for politicians where we saw a contrast between favours for the privileged and the common people ."

We had a good time and enjoyed the locks and the Danube, however...We paid for an upgrade to have a balcony. Do not spend the money for this. Viking double parks the boats so you are about a foot away from the stateroom of another Viking boat. You can't even open your curtains if you want privacy, let alone use your balcony. Our balcony view was of the ship adjacent to us when we were in port (or of the people in the room in the next boat).Also, we don't like bus tours and thought we would see more from a river cruise, be able to get off in tiny vinyard towns, etc. (We believed those ads on TV). But, the Viking cruise is actually a series of bus tours, you just get to sleep on the boat at night. Unfortunately we were there during an incredible heat wave - we were left in towns with 2-3 hours to spend and no ability to go back to the boat to get out of 100 degree plus temperatures. In every town the guides said, \"Get a coffee\". In one town we sat in a church for two hours because it was dark and cool and there were no other options. The heat wave was not Viking's fault, but they did nothing to help.Our other problem was that we were told that the Danube was too low for our boat to make it through. We had to pack all of our luggage and be bused all day to the next port where we boarded a different VIking ship. The crew handled the luggage transfer, etc. well, but it still was not what we planned. We did not plan on having to pack up and move, nor did we want an all day bus ride. And we question whether it was necessary because we met passengers from other boats or cruise lines who had sailed the part of the river that we were supposedly unable to travel. It may have been simplythat there were too many boats for the locks and they told us the river was too low.The first boat we were on, the Jarl, had a wonderful crew. The second boat, the Atla, had a rude and cranky crew. It felt like we had changed cruise lines entirely, not just changed boats. We don't know what that was about, but the final crew experience was very negative. Also, we had paid for the \"Silver\" package for upgraded alcoholic beverages. It became unnecessary on the Atla because they were providing free drinks to make up for the boat change - but they would not refund that portion of the \"Silver\" servcie to us, so we paid for our free drinks.At the end, we had paid for the Prague extension. We had to have our bags out at 6:00 where they sat in the rain uncovered until our 7:30 departure. There were two problems with this. First, the luggage was drenched and as we departed the crew was setting up a tent to cover the baggage of arriving passengers. It felt like they were done with us so our luggage did not matter. Second, we were bused to Prague where we arrived hours before we could check in to our hotel rooms. Viking obviously knew this was the case but did nothing to allow us to leave later, stop and see something along the way, etc. They provided a brief walking tour of Prague upon arrival, but we were all carrying our carryon bags with valuables and there was no provision for storing those securely. Plus, they had one guide and over 60 people.So, nice boat, nice fellow travelers, good service on one of the boats - but we will never take another Viking River Cruise."

One of the best vacations we've had yet; with some caveats. Some advice: Don't book the costly state rooms with balconies (we didn't and were glad) for several reasons: you are not going to hang out in the room, the view is often blocked by double parked boats and when you go through a lock (27) you are not going to like being on the balcony. Save your money for shopping instead. The tours - both extra and included are worth it. Nearly all of our guides were smart, educated people with enthusiasm for their cities and sites. We especially loved Regensburg, a quaint medieval town and of course Vienna and Budapest. I wish we had booked for extra time in Budapest because a day and a half just does not cut it for this lovely and interesting city. Same with Vienna - do some homework ahead of time and pick places you want to see because time is limited.The food on board was fantastic - really fresh with salads available at every meal. Wine flows freely; the staff are spectacular and professional.Had a great time all in all. Worth it."

The later cost about \u00a340 with drinks live music and a good quality four course meal. Both were good and the Danube truly is beautiful - and blue. The night time trip was the best as all the landmarks are beautifully illuminated and the jewel in the crown is the spectacular Parliament building. Highly recommended the Danube is why most people come here and I would love to explore beyond Budapest next time we visit."

Spent a fortune expecting a stateroom with a view only to find on arrival a cabin below deck with virtually no view and being on the port side of the ship every time we docked we looked out on to a stone or metal wall and had virtually no natural light. This made our accommodation claustrophobic. Stateroom was definitely a misleading description.However on the plus side the staff were very pleasant and efficient. The food was well prepared and well presented.The onshore excursions from Budapest to Bucharest were reasonable given the limited time available and the areas where the ship docked. The Programme Director was enthusiastic although his pigeon English was difficult to understand at times. Tour guides were mixed in terms of quality.Insaying all the above we enjoyed our holiday but it definitely wasn't worth the money."

We had a lovely time, made new friends, ate and drank extremely well, saw some fabulous sights and enjoyed many interesting tours but... I am not normally nit-picky by nature but would have to say that at times our cruise felt more like a bus tour with overnight stops in lay-bys. There was a bus from the canal at Nuremberg into the city centre, a bus from Regensburg to Bach because the ship had to move on while we were touring the city and a bus from Vienna to Budapest. Moreover, the practice of double parking meant that the view from our stateroom often extended no further than a stateroom of the ship that had moored alongside, which must have been really irritating for those who had shelled out serious money for balconies. Double parking no doubt means that Viking River Cruises can have more ships on the Danube at any one time but it doesn't exactly make your average punter rush to book another cruise. And I still don't fully understand why it was necessary to bus us from Vienna to Budapest. I accept that the Danube was low and that a bridge was being repaired in Bratislava but this doesn't fully explain why the Viking Jarl was to be found moored by the Chain Bridge only 24 hours later (there had been no new rain).Having said all that I would like to award 5 stars to the staff and the crew who invariably went the extra mile to make our cruise as enjoyable as possible (which it was). The WW2 tour in Nuremberg is an absolute must. We enjoyed medieval Regensburg, a UNESCO world heritage site. The stop at Passau was perfect because we were able to walk off the ship and straight into the town. The baroque splendour of Melk Abbey has to be seen to be believed. The stretch of the Danube between Melk and Vienna is quite wonderful. I would strongly recommend Cafe Sacher in Vienna for lunch, followed by the Batliner exhibition in the Albertina and the optional opera evening (we saw a superb 90 minute version of the Marriage of Figaro) while the waterfront at Budapest has to be the most beautiful I have ever seen."

After our Elegant Elbe River Cruise on Viking was cancelled last month due to low water levels, we booked a Viking cruise on the Danube for December. This cruise has begun terribly. In order to get to Munich from Atlanta, we are having to fly to Houston, which is west of Atlanta, wait for 4 hours at that airport, and then fly for over 10 hours over Atlanta to get to Munich. This is the only flight arrangements Viking could get for us and once again. all they could do was to say us was, \"I'm sorry, but that's the best we can do.\" I want to know why they didn't book our flights as soon as we paid them the money for this substitute cruise. There are non-stop flights from Atlanta to Munich, but Viking can't get us on one of those. And they have us coming back home on Lufthansa, which does not let us select seats prior to getting to the airport on our return flight from Frankfurt. We have to leave Budapest at 6:30 AM, and hopefully my wife and I will be able to sit together for the 10+ hour flight to Atlanta. I do not understand why we are unable to select seats before all the ones together are taken. There's one thing I can guarantee: We'll NEVER take another Viking cruise again. NEVER. Prepare yourself for disappointments if you choose Viking."

It started out a disaster with a main drive shaft breaking just as we were to go on board. I've always said that it is only a stuff if it is not fixed straight away. Well, it was repaired rather quickly. In the meantime we were taken to another one of their boats, The Diamond if my memory serves me correctly and wined and dined remarkably well. On the way up river we called in to many towns and cities and it would take ten thousand words to describe all that we enjoyed. I'll just pick a couple of stand outs. The Deppisch Winery was the only true five star experience of the whole trip. The presentation and entertainment was second to none. You certainly would not expect to encounter this level of food, wine and entertainment in the back blocks somewhere in Germany. These people did more to create an experience that bought every one together in a couple of hours. Check the itinerary of your suppliers and if they haven't got this place on their list, I would ask them why the hell not. O.k, so we went to the Viennese Concert at the Palais Lichtenstein. The orchestra was a stand out but unfortunately the acoustics of the room didn't lend itself to the human voice. There was just too much resonance. The vocalists sounded like they were singing with the 60's rock and roll echo. You go to so many towns and the architecture of the buildings is magnificent but the castles and the churches get a bit much. They give you a lot of free time in these towns and in some you ask yourself, why? There is so much to see and I would recommend one of these cruises. The biggest problem on the Opal we thought was the food. We thought it was reasonably ordinary. Much of the food was centered around a taste that didn't fit well with us and many of the people I spoke to. The entertainment on the boat was a bit ho hum as the one guy supplied the lot apart from the local groups that came on board. He was a brilliant musician but not speaking English there was not a great deal of entertaining done. I thought that we paid for five star and were given four."

It is the best too, presenting the most beautiful view on both sides. Danube has seen many centuries of bloodshed, development, growth, misery, rise and fall of civilizations on it's shores. By the time Johann Strauss composed \"The Blue Danube\" the river was full of pollution and not blue at all. So the composer was questioned about his composition. His response to this was, \"Have a glass of wine and look at the river and you will see how blue it is.\" People were very impressed. Later on Strauss commented, \" Have several more glasses and you can see any color in the river.\""

It was a long weekend and those days I was teaching in AGH University in Cracow, Poland as a Visiting Professor. One of my students suggested me for this trip to Budapest on the banks of river Danube.Buda and Pest are the two twin cities on the two sides of the river. Like most of the tourists, I stayed in Pest in a Youth Hostel in the downtown. However, I spent a good share of my time in those two days in boats on the river. There are different companies who conduct boat cruises on the river. One can choose between cruises on upstream and downstream the river. Some of the tourist Bus companies conducting bus trips in routes covering old monuments of Budapest include a free pass for boat trips or you can buy those separately from the Jetty. I had one of the most memorable Hot Red Wines on one of those boats on the river."

This is truly Nature's relief from the bustle of the city on either side of the river. Across, on the Pest side, was the dramatic house of Parliament. There is the river itself, of course, with the boat traffic that always is of interest. We didn't have time to take a boat ride (There is so much to see and do in Budapest that even 5 days weren't enough to do all that we wanted to.). I recommend taking a boat ride if you can fit it in because the views of both banks from the river would be breathtaking. Budapest is a city of grand architecture and the Danube enhances the scene as it winds along its beautiful course."

            "review": "Viking Danube River Cruise July 2015 - Budapest to Nuremburg. This review is to try to give potential travellers an insight into cruising on the river Danube about things we were not aware of before we left. I am not going to give any negative comments because we enjoyed the holiday very much.Firstly, two days before we departed we were informed that we would not be going on the named long ship 'Tor' but on the 'Var' which is a sister ship and absolutely identical to the Tor. The reason for this eventually became clear when after about three days we were asked to pack our cases to transfer to the Tor by coach because the Var could not continue. This was due to the lack of water in the river, and I suspect this happens most summers. This manoeuvre went very smoothly and we did not 'miss out' on anything. Of course, we missed lunch on board but we had a nice meal in a German restaurant instead. The only thing we missed was the scenery along the river, but we had scenery on land instead, ending up in Regensberg, a lovely place. The inconvenience of packing your case mid-week was a bit of a pain and a surprise, my only concern was that Viking obviously knew about this but did not let us know before we left home. I suppose it was to prevent people cancelling.Another thing we did not realise is that we had to go through numerous locks along the river. Whilst this was not a problem, the high walls of the locks blocked out the light in the daytime, sometimes when we were eating. The rails on the top deck were taken down for part of the journey to enable the vessel to get under low bridges, so we were deprived of the sun except for a small area at the front on deck two.All in all, I cannot fault Viking for food and service and the Bavarian themed night was exceptionally good. The cruise was most enjoyable and the places we visited and guides were exceptionally good. I estimated that 80% of passengers were from the USA and 20% from the UK with about 180 people approximately on board plus staff.The coach trip from Nuremberg took about two hours to Munich Airport at the end of the cruise.Well done Viking."

But my disappointment soon turned to an appreciation of this as a beautiful and integral artery dividing Budapest into Buda and Pest.There are 7 bridges which span its girth in Bp, but my favorite for walking is the magnificent Chain bridge (Lanchid), followed by the Freedom Bridge (Szabadszag hid). Each afford spectacular views of the river and the myriad castles and church spires which dot the banks and skyline. A nice stroll is from the Chain Bridge to the Parliament (Pest side). Along the way. you'll pass the touching tribute of the \"Shoes\"- a poignant reminder that, at one time, all was not peaceful and well in this great city..A nice walk is also on offer on the Buda side which provide great views of the Pest banks and Parliament. Varkert Bazaar (Castle courtyard) is a worthwhile visit where you can grab a cup of coffee before setting out again to visit Clark Adam T\u00e9e (square( to the north where you can ride the funicular train up to the castle after enjoying a sweet treat at the Cukraszda (Took-krahss- dah, confectionary) there.There are many dining possibilities all around but for this I favor the Pest side. The boat, Spoon, offers a delightful dining experience for lunch or dinner with great views. Further south, between Erszebet hid and the Szabadszag hid is a bevy of great restaurants and cafes featuring, Greek (Dionysis Taverna), Italian (Trattoria Toscana) Japanese (Takebayashi) cuisines. I can recommend them all. There is also an Egyptian establishment in the row which I haven't tried yet.A cruise on the river is exciting and memorable. Bring your cameras! For a less expensive alternative, look at the public transportation boats on the Danube (BKK.hu)"

We had the astoundly good fortune to have spent 2 nights cruising back and forth on the Danube, enjoying the light show the entire time. How could it possibly get any better?By far, the show stopper was the glorious Parliament Building, lit up so that I am sure it could have been seen from outer space. That building is so massive and impressive, even in the daylight, but at night ... it is a whole other experience. It takes first place in the prize category for eye candy.The bridges are pretty nice, too, and the whole experience was exciting. Many of the great monumental buildings are lit with flood lights so it seems more like a theme park than a city. It was so sophisticated, cosmopolitan, and memorable. Loved it!"

This bike tour was rated \"easy\" but there were definitely some challenges for novice riders like me. But I enjoyed the riding challenges and there was never any pressure to hurry up or catch up when I rode at a more leisurely pace or in some instances, walked my bike uphill. The tour included a wonderful variety of local, historic and cultural stops and experiences such as watching a horse show depicting the history of Hungary, a stop at a farm for a strudel making lesson, and an introduction and plenty of taste-testing of the Hungarian fruit brandy Palinka at a rural farm orchard where Palinka is made. Our VBT guides were unfailingly helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and generous with their time and guidance. I would certainly make plans with VBT again for bike trips in other locations."

The Danube divides Budapest into two parts: the Buda Hills and the Pest side. These two cities became one when bridges first crossed the Danube. There is tremendous history and monuments and the Castle District on the Buda side and great shops and squares and businesses on the Pest side. The best views of the city, and the Hungarian Parliament are from the river. At some point during your visit to this city, you need to take a dinner cruise aboard one of the cruise lines to truly appreciate the beauty of this city, especially at night."

We chose no dinner, no music, just floating along sitting on the open top deck with our two included free drinks. Lovely, because the city is well lit up, although not in the colours some flyers show you.... It was amazing too sometimes - there were birds circling upwards on the warm air from the floodlights above the Parliament building, and feeding at the same time probably. It's a good idea to find out which sights you can expect where before you go. On the downside, on the return leg, about 20 mins before the end, it was announced that the trip would end on the other side of the river and we could go back to the starting point by relocating to smaller boats. Not what we wanted to hear close to midnight, when the metro is shutting down for the night."

It neatly separates the Buda side and the Pest side of Budapest. Some of the landmarks on the Pest side are the Danube Promenade, St. Stephens Basilica, the Hungarian Parliament. On the Buda side are the Buda Castle, St. Matthias Church, the Fisherman's Bastion, and many others. There are several bridges that connect the Buda side and the Pest side. Among them are the Chain Bridge, Elizabeth bridge, Liberty bridge, and Margaret bridge. Along the Danube is the Shoe Memorial. The boat traffic along the Danube are made up of river cruise ships, harbour cruise boats, barges, and other kinds of aquatic vessels. Watching the ships go by the Danube is a very exhilarating experience."

You can choice from cruise at night or at day or you can choice to have dinner/lunch on board or just a drink. We arranged a cruise at 11:00 am and can say that was fantastic. Big plus is that you can have audio guide in many languages and learn the history of each building you can see. If you have the time the boats are making a stop to Margarita Island, you can depart boat have a walk in the Island and then embark again the next boat for returning back to Pest.Even if we had the cruise in the morning believe it will be even better if you have it at night with the lights of the city giving a better atmosphere."

Be sure to walk at least tow or three of the great bridges over the Danube in Budapest, we particularly liked the Chain Bridge.

The wait staff in the restaurant was very attentive, our basic-level stateroom did not feel at all cramped, and every part of the ship was well-appointed and comfortable, but this segment was the least favorite of our 2.5-week Europe vacation. Much of the journey was spent going through locks and scenery no better than along the Ohio River in the U.S. There was one half-day of truly gorgeous views passing through the Wachau Valley, and there was supposed to have been a night cruise through Budapest that would have been lovely but was cancelled. The official word was that bad weather prohibited \"all but essential river traffic\" that night, but while we were docked, there must have been at least fifty sightseeing boats passing us by on the river. The actual reason may have had more to do with the Viking exec visiting the captain and senior staff that night than the heavy storm which passed through a couple hours earlier. Maybe he wanted to get back to his luxury hotel in Budapest.Some of the optional excursions were disappointing, and when we cancelled one we had previously booked, we caught a little \"attitude\" from the staff. Toward the end of the cruise, we opted out of the included excursions as well, preferring to sightsee on our own. I think we are about 10 years younger than the Viking target demographic, and we would have preferred a little more activity. It was still a very pleasurable trip, and I am glad we did it, but I doubt that we will do another Viking cruise in the next decade."

The many bridges across the river allow you to cross at your ease and numerous companies offer cruises up and down the river. If I had to recommend a time to go see it, it would have to be at night. The boats lit up along the river are gorgeous but nothing in comparison to the castle, the citadel and the Parliament as well as the Gellert baths. These buildings light up the night sky and I would thoroughly recommend a cruise after sunset. Just remember to bring a jacket with you onto the boat because even though it may feel warm before the cruise it can be pretty cold out on the deck while the boat is in motion."

First off, I want to say that the only reason that they are not getting a 5 rating is due to the booking process through Viking and NOT the river cruise itself. If I could just rate the River cruise portion and all the staff (especially our Program Director, Susi) on the ship, I would give them a 5 PLUS PLUS. We did the Prague to Paris route (you can also do the reverse), where we spent the first days in a hotel in Prague, then were taken by coach to Bamberg, Germany, where we boarded our ship. The luggage and boarding process went well, despite a couple of tardy passengers on our bus. The accommodations on the boat were nice. Not luxurious (keep in mind this is a Riverboat and not an Oceanliner) but very nice. The beds are designed so that you can put your luggage under the bed. There was also plenty of storage for my husband and my things. The food was wonderful, the tours were well managed and organized, and the staff was terrific. We were also very lucky in that the average age on our cruise was lower than most ... being about 50, so we had a lively group in the lounge / bar area after dinner. The excursions are included, with a few extra excursions you can pay additional for if so desired. Our group (we were a group of 5) decided on just one of the extra offerings and it was wonderful. They also did a good job of giving the guests options (when they could) for a Highlights tour (which moved faster through the same areas, and allowed for extra free time), a leisurely tour (which was great for those that moved a little slower) and then the regular tour. Since our group did have a pretty big age spread, this helped to group the passengers based upon abilities. Regarding the booking process (we booked directly through Viking) I would suggest booking your airfare and any extra days you may want to add on your own, then coordinate with Viking once booked. Viking's airfares are very reasonable, but are only for coach, and you don't know which airline you are going to be on. Any upgrades on flights to Business Class or First Class seem to be a hassle for Viking and you likely won't get them, regardless of you status with whichever airline they choose for you. They will credit you back the airfare portion of your booking. Also, if you want to add extra days to your trip, book them through the same hotel, and coordinate with the hotel, the two reservations (you will have your own and Vikings). If you do add days, you will lose your transfers to and from the airport through Viking. (they will credit you back this money, as well.) This was also not a big deal. We were able to coordinate a car service through the hotel and it was more convenient and less expensive than going through Viking. I highly, highly recommend the Viking River Cruise. It was an amazing trip and we saw such beautiful places, history and views all throughout Prague, Germany, Luxembourg and Paris. I would put it up there as one of our best trips ever, and we travel a LOT."

The cost we thought was quite affordable, and the memories of course - priceless. Highly Recommended."

My wife and I have never taken any cruise after watching giant cruise liners disgorging hundreds of sightseers at various ports around the world. However we decided to \"take the plunge\" and book a river cruise along the beautiful River Danube. We opted for the 2 nights pre-cruise in Budapest followed by 3 nights post cruise trip to Prague. The booking was made in London nearly 12 months before our voyage. We booked on Viking Prestige because the dates were what we required (wedding anniversary). We choose an upper deck stateroom. ( I would not recommend a main deck room as it as small windows and is at water level). The V Prestige is diesel electric driven o there is no engine noise or vibration whilst cruising.I informed the booking clerk that my wife had a severe food sensitivity to MSG and she said she would make a note of it. I thought nothing more of it until shortly after we boarded the maitre d'hotel sort us out, and discussed the evening's menu with my wife and determined which courses would definitely not contain any bought-in sauces that may contain MSG, Flavour enhancers, E621 etc. This attention to detail continued every morning of the voyage. 5-stars for attention.The meals were \"free seating\" in the restaurant on the second deck and there was also a smaller restaurant on the third deck. We met some interesting fellow travellers at meal times. The choice of courses was wide and all was well prepared and presented. The cruse director, Anthony, was knowlegeable and gave a great lecture on Strauss before we arrived in Vienna.The daily trips were well organised and the guides informative and spoke excellent English.Our stateroom (cabin) was well designed and not cramped at all.The design of the cruise was good although personally I would have liked more time in Vienna and/or Strasbourg. Vienna is my favourite European city having visited it several times in the past. Strasbourg is on our list for a long weekend break.Would we do another cruise? probably but not exceeding 7 nights as I was \"churched out\" by the end of the trip. Viking are planning a cruise on the Mississippi in 2016/7 which will definitely interest us."

Although the name may conjure a waltz tune in your mind, the beauty lies in what is on the banks of the Danube. The buildings in Budapest especially the Parliament building at night is a magnificent sight. Outside of Budpest, the Danube is surronded by farmlands and vineyards as well castle up on the peaks of mountains. It is almost impossible to take a bad picture of the surrounding unless you are out of focus."

The lower ones on the main level, had a very small window at the waterline. The staff on our ship were amazing & the food was great. There are less than 200 passengers so it was quiet & very nice. If you want a good deal, wait until around March or so & you should be able to get free airfare. If possible go early to Budapest & stay longer in Amsterdam.

The river portions of the city on both sides have been beautifully restored and maintained, and the views from the River were superb. We've been on different parts of the Danube, and she never fails to please. In the Budapest Danube, there is a long island in the middle that is put to much use for the denizens of the city. What appeared to be tennis courts, running/walking paths and athletic fields were all being used by lots of people, and there were also plenty of trees and flowers blending them all in. Budapest's famous bridges were lovely to glide under.We'd have paid more than we paid for the on-off bus tickets for this freebie! Being on the Danube is re-living history, and no one should go their whole lives without seeing her at lest once."

The food and staff service was excellent but the itinerary included cities in which the stores and certain public buildings were not open.

I had no access to INTERNET on the boat but AMA advertises there is internet in all of the the cabin's on their promotional Youtube.

Having heard so much of Danube river cruise, my group of 4 decided to get 1st hand experience of the Danube river cruise. We bought our tickets from Duna Palota, from a mobile booth opposite central market, and opt for cruise with drinks only on the upper deck. When we bought the tickets, we asked, and were assured that we will be assigned to a table of 4, as we wanted to be seated together. Unfortunately, it was not so. When we boarded the cruise, we were each given a welcome drink and directed to the upper deck. Once on the upper deck, you got to find your own seats, and all the tables were partially occupied (all tables setting were for 4). We were not able to get a table for our group of 4 as assured - what a disappointment. Seats arrangements could have improved.There were 3 musicians to entertain you throughout the 1 1/2 hour cruise, but we would prefer if commentary of the major buildings / sights can be aired over the PA system instead.As for the view, it is nothing to shout about. If you had done some sightseeing of major attractions and strolled along Danube during the day, you are more or less repeating the scenes during the cruise. As it was summer, we didn't get the chance to see the night scene."

We say many new sights as we traveled through Budapest on the hop on hop off bus to different points of interest. Budapest is a magnificent city combining old and new Europe with the Danube running along the coast. Some points of interest were Hero Square, Dohany Synagogue, the Opera House, Parliament and Fisherman's Bastion. Viking River Cruises was running the show and delivered 100 percent. The picked us up at the airport, arranged for transporting our luggage and fed us well. We were on the Maiden Voyage of Viking Vidar running from Budapest to Amsterdam. We did the pre and post tours which Viking arranged tours lodging food and provided the shleppers. We sailed down the Danube to Vienna, ate weiner schnitzel, apple strudel and drank local wine. We were in a new port daily and the guides and tours did not disappoint. Traveling through sixty seven locks, visiting churches ,opera houses , museums, palaces, castles, having lunch at local restaurants was a great experience. Slovakia, Austria Germany and Amsterdam were our stops along the Danube, Main and Rhine Rivers. Visiting many coffee house and wineries along the route added flavor to our trip. Learning about the different cultures and histories of these countries held our interest. We had daily briefings from The Cruise Director, previewing what we were to do the next day, whether it was a musician on board, a glass blower or cook, we were thoroughly entrenched. Meeting new people from different parts of the world, eating different food daily and touring was great. Vikings staff is first class as there was nothing they wouldn't do for you. I would rate this a five star operation and first class all the way."

We were attracted by the prospect of seeing a series of 'bucket list' cities without having to waste time and energy packing up and moving on for each place. What we experienced certainly achieved that and was an excellent compromise between relaxation and sight-seeing. Viking aren't the cheapest but the operation is super-slick, the staff really look after you and the food is plentiful and high quality. Wine, beer and soft drinks flow freely at lunch and dinner and there is even bubbly at breakfast if you're up for it. For us that was enough but there is a premium drinks package if not and the bar is available to supplement the freebies. Service levels on the boat probably benefit from the American clientele and the tipping culture ( a suggested Eur14 per person per day) which adds around \u00a3150 to the week for a couple but the result was better service than we've had in many 5* establishments. We arrived at a different place each day and were always provided with a tour, all good. Additionally we did the BMW factory at Regensburg and the WWII tour at Nuremburg - both optional extras but well worth it.Room-wise we had an upper deck stateroom with a small sit-on balcony but no separate sitting area indoors. The balcony was useful when traveling between stops during daylight. The room had sufficient space to walk round the bed and a decent shower/loo cubicle, so, as you'd expect on a boat, not huge, but nicely presented and cleaned/refreshed twice a day.All in all a good trip and a method of exploring the planet that we'd consider using again."

In this review, I'll attempt to suggest the best ways to view the Danube as it meanders through Budapest. We approached Budapest on the morning of our last day of the cruise. My wife made the mistake of staying in the state room, which afforded views on only one side (in our case, Pest) of the river. I went up to the sundeck to witness the splendor of the Parliament Building, the Chain Bridge, the Citadel and the many Beau Arts, Gothic, Baroque and neoclassic buildings that define Budapest. But the real treat was our river boat's taking a special nighttime, hour-long cruise that highlighted the lighting that bathes Budapest after hours. To the sound of Strauss' Blue Danube, we sipped champagne, toasted our new friends and took pictures to capture the ambiance. Note: The Danube is not blue. It's a muddy brown, but that doesn't detract from the sights along its banks."

If you\u2019re already there, both places need at least half a day to look around, so don\u2019t venture upon to do it on the same day.To try to know a river a bit better, you have to navigate it.

The boats have headsets at each seat, the audio is available in several languages, and you control the volume. It's a great way to get an overview of Buda and Pest and to guide you toward figuring out which of the marvelous buildings you might want to tour. Just do it!"

Food was fine, nothing fabulous but no complaints. Service was great. We sat at the same table - no reservations but we always got to the dining room a few minutes before dinner to claim out table because we loved our waiter, Darwin. Our stateroom was spotlessly cleaned everyday.Inclusive tours were wonderful and we were well-taken care of. The only con and it's a big one is that Viking docked along side other boats and in once case we were between boats at most of the ports which rendered our veranda useless because we were literally 12 inches from the other boat's veranda. If one wanted to, you could easily climb over the veranda and on to the other veranda. You could see clearly into the other cabin. We had to keep our sheers AND curtains closed to have privacy. Internet/wi-fi access generally was terrible and only in a few of the ports it was okay."

Danube River is the second longest river in Europe. 2860 km long it passes through 10 countries of Central and Eastern Europe and 4 capitals (Vienna, Budapest, Bratislava & Belgrade). As it's navigable, it's always busy and offers a lot to local communities, especially after the construction of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in 1992, it became the link between North and Black Sea. At the same time it's beautiful and romantic too. In Budapest it's the main tourist attraction. 8 bridges over it and the impressive buildings in Buda and Pest form the perfect panorama. At night when everything is cleverly illuminated, you stay speechless.I had visited Budapest before, many years ago.But this time I had the luck to be on a cruiseship and arrive to Budapest, late in the evening. The weather was good, no rain, a little bit chilly but who cared! I had the best panorama ever. I'll never forget the feeling. We passed slowly under the bridges, one after another, with new buildings on both sides of Danube, everything illuminated. A feast for the eyes. If you find yourself in Budapest but without a cruise, you may enjoy the river and the panorama on small boats, even during the night. You'll never regret the cost. During the day, walking at the Promenade (Duna Korz\u00f3) it's a must. From one bridge to another, from Buda to Pest, you'll enjoy the views and discover very interesting attractions. Or take the funicular, in front of the Chain Bridge (Buda side) and visit the Castle district to see the river and Pest from above. From Gell\u00e9rt Hill you'll see the river and Buda from above. Think it over and decide!"

The service on the ship was superb, the meals excellent, the cabin comfortable. On a River Cruse I expect a small ship experience, and booking with Viking I was prepared for 190 guests (the boat capacity) at each stop.The problem is that Viking had another ship following the same itinerary as us. So when we arrived at a stop (daily) the ships would dock to each other. So to reach the shore you had to move through another boat. Worse, it meant that instead of 190 people at each of the small towns, there were at least 380. This meant 8 busloads of people traveling to small towns, where, quite frankly, the town was overwhelmed.But that was not enough! On one day there were 4 Viking ships at the same stop. 16 busloads of people! Terrible. Most of what could have been a beautiful day in a small village was spent in line waiting for a rest room- the only one in the small town. On another day there were 3 Viking ships at the same stop.The Viking buses each packed in 48 people. This meant they were uncomfortable, with seats very close together (think airline seats). The towns we stopped at were beautiful, but mostly small. If they only did not have 5 Viking tourists for every resident, they would have been great. My recommendation is to travel on another cruise line, and look carefully at the capacity of the boat. If the capacity is over 140 people, think twice. Also, avoid a big cruise line for your river cruise. If you make sure they only have one boat on a particular river, then you will have a great experience!Viking could take care of this by staggering their ships by a day or two so there was never more that one ship in any town at the same time. Of course, this does not apply to the huge cities like Bucharest, Belgrade, or Budapest. By the way, we added days to Bucharest and went to the Black Sea. Again, although it was wonderful to be there, we traveled in a small bus with 18 people, completely full. Very uncomfortable. Viking should use a larger bus for this excursion.We also added Prague to the trip. Here, Viking did a great job on the transfer from Budapest to Prague. Although there were about 90 people, Viking had us travel on 4 large buses, so there was plenty of room. However, the buses traveled in packs of 2, so at every stop there were long waits for a bathroom or for food, because 45 people were all doing the same thing.In summary, Viking needs to make this a small ship cruise by only allowing one ship on each itinerary. Until they do that you would do well to choose a smaller cruise line."

We purchased the tour with VIATOR and the company that coordinated the activity was Hungaria Koncet Kft. The cruise coordinator was Mark Fekete.We loved it!. Usually, when you go to a city river cruise that includes lunch or dinner, the problem is that you will likely have to decide where your attention go to, the meal or the view. Mark and his crew figured a great solution to this: The ship does two passes over the attractions, so you can first have your lunch and then you can admire the beautiful Budapest landmarks or vice versa. This is very important because a visit to Budapest without admiring the monuments from the Danube will be frankly incomplete.The lunch consists in a very generous buffet. The menu is very good (I really liked their Goulash!) and one drink (soda or beer) is included and there is a bar where you can purchase additional beverages if so you desire.We highly recommend this tour."

Never would have thought about doing a river boat cruise, but was offered an opportunity to join a friend and the experience was AMAZING! Many people hear more about Viking Cruise Lines for riverboat cruising, but AmaWaterways goes above and beyond and delivered the most amazing experience. While I was traveling with friends, I can see this as more of an experience for couples or small group of friends. The staff and service were impeccable! The ship was modern and the perfect space. It's basically the same size of ship that Viking uses, but take approx 30 less passengers. Instead, AmaWaterways makes room for a gym, and small massage area and a small salon area. Price includes meals and alcohol during meals (wine and beer), and most excursions. Everything was well planned and executed. I look forward to taking another river boat cruise again in the future, and will make sure it is done on a AmaWaterways ship. Truly and amazing experience. Traveled on the Danube River through Germany, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary. A beautiful journey."

Sapphire On The Danube. by Morris, SwanageHome | Cruise Reviews | APT River Cruises | Travelmarvel Sapphire | Sapphire On The Danu...  awardsSapphire On The Danube.Overall Rating: 5 0 views Cruise Line: APT River Cruises Cruise Ship: Travelmarvel Sapphire Destination: River Danube Reviewed By: Morris, Swanage on 29th Apr 2015 We booked this river cruise as a first timer for all of us - we travelled with my wife's 2 sisters and their husbands, after I had succumbed to a 2 for 1 offer through Cruise.co, and sold it to the rest of the family. The APT site doesn't say too much about the Sapphire, and I was a bit anxious that I might have persuaded others to a second class trip. However, this was certainly not the case! Our bargain deal was the result of locks being closed on the Danube, so that we had to make the last 2 destinations by coach - but it didn't really matter. We flew by BA to Budapest, and then joined the boat - staff were really welcoming, and the boat is extremely comfortable. Our cabin was the best we have yet encountered - plenty of space, a very comfortable 6ft wide bed with room to vanish our cases underneath, and a very nice bathroom with a glass door shower and room to move. The big difference between river and ocean cruising is that we had a full width glass patio style glass door to look out of, rather than a porthole or small window - lie in bed and watch the ever changing river bank drift by. All meals were excellent also, in a pleasant dining area, and with dinner offering a minimum of 4 courses, with a main choice of meat, fish (including pike and char) or veggi. They are not niggardly with the inclusive wine either - refills throughout the meals ( I have heard that other lines are less generous). Our stops each day included Bratislava, Vienna, Durnstein, Linz, Regensburg and Nuremberg - tours were well organised in parties of 20-30, with excellent guides and vox boxes so that one can keep up and hear all the details. Enormous thanks to the Cruise Director Herbert Hutter, who arranged all this, and who also helped me personally with my suitcase which BA managed to misplace when we flew, but which eventually caught up with us in Vienna! We were very taken with the whole experience, which will certainly make us want to go river cruising again in the future - friendly, high quality and fun!Times cruised before: 3-5 Sailed: April, 2015 Age: 65+ Cabin: Outside Occasion: Family holidayQuality of FoodOnly one dining area; all meals excellent, with a chef cooking fresh omelettes in the mornings, and an excellent choice at dinner5 EntertainmentA good range of evening entertainment, including an Oompah Bavarian band and an Aussie singer/guitarist5 Shore ExcursionsAll shore excursions were excellent5 StaffOur waiter Marta and wine waiter Milly were excellent, and nothing was too much trouble5 Children's Facilities0 Onboard ActivitiesA riverboat, so no casino/shows etc. Good cabin television service.4 CabinsYes!

The boat we were on was a rather large one, which was good as there was a decent sized group of people. The views from the Danube itself were great, especially as it was becoming dusk/night and the lights of the sights came on. It really is a dazzling view! The buffet dinner was good. They offered a variety of Hungarian cuisine, including cabbage rolls and goulash. We received 2 included drinks- a welcome drink and some wine with dinner, and you of course had the option to buy drinks separately. The live music was also rather good!It was a fun night out and a good way to see the sights, especially at night and capture some different photos. I would recommend doing a Danube dinner cruise!"

It really is hard to get lost, there are lots of landmarks, I like to watch for the Ferris Wheel, or Parliament. It is an extraordinary walk, with many lovely cafes and landmarks. Buy a metro pass, if you are in town for 3-5 days they are a great value and give you access to all city buses too. You will eventually find a bus or a tram or a metro line, and your way back to the Danube. It is a great way to explore the city- when you buy your coffee ask questions, the staff will help you"

            "review": "Viking Cruises Danube Waltz. We just returned from a Viking River Cruise, Danube Waltz. We added the 3 night Prague and 2 night Budapest stays. The Viking staff were all very knowledgeable, professional and very courteous. I just wanted to give a little insight into the Viking experience for those of you considering booking with Viking. First, the air was not paid for by Viking until very close to departure. This means that you cannot reserve or pay for advance seating until very near to departure. Their choice of flights and connections are not always what we would choose for ourselves. Of course, American Airlines canceling our flight the morning of our trip, had nothing to do with Viking, however, I would never have booked the flights they chose to book for us to begin with. If you choose to do your air with the Viking \"special\" air package, there is no upgrading allowed. When our flights were canceled and changed, I advised the Viking people immediately of our change in arrival plans and was told that they would do all they could to have someone meet us upon our new arrival time. As I was giving them 15 hours notice, I would have expected a more favorable reply. They did meet us with no issues, but it left me a bit apprehensive through my entire flight. Our transfers and baggage upon arrival were all handled quite well. Arrival and check in at the Sheraton Prague was smooth. The staff at the hotel were helpful and very friendly. The hotel was a first class hotel with an amazing breakfast full of local foods, cereal, eggs to order, breakfast meats, fruits and the most delicious choice of breads I've ever seen at a hotel. This was not a luxury hotel. The rooms were well appointed with a large bathroom, shower only, heated towel rack and the normal amenities. There was a safe in the room as well as a hot pot to make instant tea and coffee. The rooms were very clean. They had free in room wi-fi as well as a work area in the lobby. The hotel is in a good location, near the underground and a strip club right next door! All the advertised \"included\" tours are city tours. There are no great tours included with the package. We chose an optional tour to the Terezin Concentration camp for 40 euro pp. It was a full day tour that should have been 1/2 day and 1/2 the price. Lunch was included and was good, but they really had to stretch to make this a full day tour. We all agreed the guide was simply wasting time in the end to make this a full day. She had plenty of time to let us shop at the local square, but chose to drive us around the streets, park and have us walk up a steep hill just to see the view, which was nothing to speak of. We were all a little disappointed with this excursion. In the evening we chose to take the Folklore excursion for 50euro pp. This was a very enjoyable evening with decent local food and good local entertainment. As this was the second day of the three day Prague add on, it gave us a very good chance to meet and get to know the others that would be on our cruise. On our travel day to the ship, we arrived into Passau very late, just in time for dinner. There were a few delays along the way, but it was a fairly enjoyable 3 hour drive. The scenery was beautiful and very well narrated. The Viking tour guide was full of information and passed around quite a bit of her own literature along the way. Our luggage was immediately delivered to our cabins as we were the last group to arrive to the ship, there were no other groups in the way. My luggage arrived broken, and I was not very pleased with the first response from the Viking crew member who suggested maybe it arrived broken! I was very quickly aided by the ships hotel manager who had it fixed and returned to my cabin in a few days. We had a balcony cabin on the second (middle) deck. Cabin 225. The cabins on this ship, (Viking Var, long Ship) are the smallest cabins I have ever stayed in, and I have taken approximately 22 voyages. This was, however, my first river cruise. The cabins are appointed like any other cruise ship I have been on. The toiletries are a little better, L'Occitane. Other than that, there is nothing at all I could find that would make this cruise as expensive as it was. EVERYONE on this deck was complaining about the noise. The water and toilet system runs through pipes over head. It is the MOST annoying and obnoxious sound. This noise was non - stop throughout the entire cruise!!! We heard many people complaining about it at the desk and it was even referenced when the Cruise Director was asking us to fill in our comment cards at the end of the cruise. He asked that the crew not be judged for the \"possible noises we may have heard during the cruise\". I am totally convinced this is an issue with these \"new\" long ships and that each and every one of them must have the same design flaws. The only people on the ship that did not complain about the noise were those on the upper deck, 3. I tried to keep an open mind and not judge too harshly, but for this very reason, I would most likely never take another Viking Cruise again. If I do consider it, I would only consider a cabin on the upper deck.The food on the ship is a step up from the mega ocean cruise lines in the United States, but certainly not as good as the specialty restaurants offered for additional fees on the mega ships. The Viking staff did a good job of getting meals out to 160 people, but most meals were served warm. The coffee was never hot and the drinks were always warm. The best coffee was served from automated machines at the aquavit lounge. Breakfast was quite good, with eggs cooked to order and trays of sausage, bacon and other breakfast items. The milk for cereal was always warm and although pitchers were labeled cream, I'm sure they were not. There were options of a buffet or cooked to order from the kitchen. There was a continental breakfast offered on the upper deck each morning. There was always a good selection and choice for lunch and dinner. Good Wine was served for free with lunch and dinner and they were VERY generous with it. There was very little entertainment on board. I think there were two nights where they brought on local talent to entertain. There was absolutely nothing to do on the ship while on board other than read or watch the scenery. This was not really a problem as nights usually ended early. They made you depart on tours each morning by 8:30am. There were two afternoons where we cruised during the day. Other than that, there was very little time to actually see the banks of the Danube while cruising. Most cruising was done during the evening and overnight. The ship goes through quite a few locks to acclimate to the different water levels. They did not tell us about that before the first one an it can a little scary at first. It seems Viking had done some polling and discovered that people do NOT like all the announcements. So, they have chosen to make as few as possible. This means you very rarely know what is going on. None of the announcements broadcast into your room, so if you are not in a public area, you won't hear what few announcements they do make! The small, intimate setting of the ship really was quite enjoyable. We got to meet and talk to almost every guest while on board. We met a core group of people that have now become great friends and we all hope to vacation together in the future. Our two night Budapest extension was a nice cap to our trip. I would definitely recommend it. Viking placed us at the Le Meridien Budapest hotel which was horrible! They call this hotel luxury, which it is not by any means. The lobby was wonderful and had all the charm of an old luxury hotel. The rooms were huge but very, very old. There was no air conditioning in the room or anywhere else in the hotel. The bathroom has no outlets, but it did have a heated floor to add to the overall room temperature of 90 degrees! The location was very good, right in the center of everything. The breakfast was okay. They offered a lot, but again the coffee was not hot and all the milks and juice were warm. The waffles were put out in a stack and were cold. They were not friendly and almost seemed as if they were annoyed to be there and have to serve you. In general, the cruise was very nice. In my opinion, there was NOTHING about this cruise that warranted the $11,000.00 price tag. It was nice to have Viking take care of all our transfers and hotels, but definitely not worth the price tag. I realize that there are limited choices for this type of cruising, however, there were many other companies we saw along the river that seemed to mirror the Viking ship we were on. I think Viking's marketing budget is what makes it popular, not their product. I would definitely look into the other options available before booking my next river cruise."

            "review": "Romantic Danube Itinerary on Viking Freya. Our itinerary for a group of 12 started out with a 3-night stay in Prague and then boarding the Viking Freya in Roth, Germany for a 7-night cruise on the Danube with a final destination of Budapest, Hungary. We chose to take the trip in mid-April because we added a stay in Amsterdam (on our own) to experience the spring tulips. We were extremely fortunate that we had the best weather possible. The week before we left, it was cold and even snowy on the Danube. We were also lucky that the winter was not bad in Europe so the locks were open and able to be navigated. Some posts complain that their cruises ended up being land tours. That's something that spring departures face and there is nothing that can be done about that. Check with your travel agent on details and for the best times to book your cruise.Although experienced travelers (I am a travel agent myself), this was the first river cruise for all of us. There were some definite distinctions between ocean and river cruising and some similarities as well. The obvious are one unpacking, meals included, short stays at each port. The biggest differences are that the small group makes it much more intimate; there is no open ocean to contend with; and, our river cruise experience was much more active than any ocean cruise we took.If you take the Nuremberg to Budapest itinerary, keep in mind that you depart from Roth, Germany so upon arrival at the dock you may be quite disappointed and question the location. But, not to worry, you're on the canal until you reach Passau. If you have more than four people in your group, I would suggest you not try to eat meals together at one table. I believe our larger number made it difficult for the kitchen and waitstaff to get everyone's dinner to the table hot and we had some complaints over that. The ship does not take reservations or hold tables for guests, but we ended up getting a large table every night and I think it would have been better if we hadn't.If the extra price for the French Balcony is affordable, I would suggest going for that over the window only cabins. However, you literally spend very little time in the cabin so whatever you are comfortable with price wise you can make work. Window cabins are on the lower level. The cabins are comfortable with good showers and water pressure and the ship is kept spotless.You can have breakfast and lunch on the terrace if you want something lighter and dinner is served in the dinning room at 7:00 pm. There is a newsletter delivered to your room with the following days activities, information on the day's destination and times just like on an ocean cruise. Coffee, tea and cookies are available throughout the day. Water is provided before each excursion. Beer, wine and soft drinks flow freely during lunch and dinner and if you are not married to a specific wine or brew what is served is usually local and sufficient. Anytime other than meals, beverages are at your expense, but the price is not exorbitant. We did not take the spirits package and for us that was a good decision.I personally found all the food quite good. I would not consider it exceptional, but I enjoyed every morsel. My only comment is that I would have liked to see a little more local food served.I was very surprised at how active the cruise was. Every day there is an included tour, most of which offered a leisure version for anyone who was concerned about too much walking. We like to see and do as much as possible, so we took advantage of the regular tours. Then there are optional tours - at least one a day - that you can take as well; or, stay on the ship and relax; or, go out into the villages/cities on your own. The optional tours are extra (usually about $49 per person). I would have preferred to know what they were before we left so that we could have planned better, but you are briefed the day before and then must sign up that day.The tour guides were by far among the best I have ever experienced. Kudos to Viking for selecting the best of these very knowledgeable professionals. It is suggested that you give $2 per person per tour guide and $1 per person per driver for every tour you take, so plan that into your budget as well. Gratuities are shared by the staff and for a 7-night cruise it amounts to about $100 per guest as suggested. If you have an exceptional server or bartender or cabinperson, you can certainly give them a little more personally.For our ship, we couldn't say enough good things about Cruz in the dining room and Ben and George in the lounge - absolutely wonderful and made our trip that much more special.The staff, including the Captain and Head Chef, were very accessible and would often appear in the dining room or public areas. There seemed to always be something going on. The staff participated in a game show for the guests, there were three nights with musical entertainment and lectures and informational segments on several occasions.Going from Roth to Budapest requires traveling through over 25 locks. When they ship arrives at a lock at night, it can be a bit bumpy and one night the engines seemed to grind quite a bit. But, other than that, you seem to just float along in relative calm.If you take all the tours, there isn't a lot of time for shopping which can be a little disappointing, but then it depends on what you want out of your trip. On this itinerary for the optional tours we totally enjoyed the visit to Weltenburg Abbey and the Bavarian Cruise, Anita, our concierge, booked an evening concert for us in Vienna that was one of the highlights of our trip. (Viking was offering an opera evening which we chose not to attend.) We also went on an excursion to the Thermal Baths in Budapest, which was much longer than necessary. I would suggest doing this on your own.Make sure to spend some time in the Village of Melk if you can - I would love to go back myself. Once you leave Melk, you start to travel through the Wachau Valley. Make sure you get a drink and a chair on the upper deck with your camera ready and enjoy some amazing scenery!!!There were a few docks where we tied up adjoining sister ships - so what??? We got to meet a few more people as they walked through our lobby or we through theirs. The demographics for river cruises are people over 55 and on our ship there were about 3 or 4 couples who were in their 30's. They seemed to enjoy it just as much as the rest of us. All in all this was a great experience and I think Viking lived up to our expectations and in many instances surpassed them."

Budapest airport was easy to navigate and the information desk and public transport ticket office were very helpful. Get a map there. It was easy and cheap to get a ticket on public transport to the city (bus 200E from outside the terminal to the last stop, then on the train to wherever your accommodation is - need two tickets - one for bus and one for train). I found the public transport system to be excellent - very short waiting time for trains, easy to understand maps and convenient stations. Buying a ticket around the city is easy as they are all the same price for a journey (bus or train). Orientation is pretty easy as well as the Pest side is flat and Buda hilly, the river runs north south and the bridges are all different and identifiable. Take a free walking tour (triptobudapest.hu) to get great tips about the city and culture. I took the general tour, jewish district tour and communism tour and they were all excellent - locals showing their city. Just leave a tip at the end of the tour.My favorite locations were Buda Castle - fantastic views of the river and the Hungarian Parliament, the Fisherman's Bastion - almost fairytale turrets, the walk along Andrassy Avenue to Heroes Square (take the underground train one way for the underground heritage experience), the eclectic range of buildings in the city in various states of disrepair, the bath houses (can get very busy in the evenings) and of course the bridges and river. You can walk to most places (take decent shoes) and probably should as the food is great (traditionally highly calorific). Try the gulyas!"

The river was murky and running very fast but then it was March, its a long river and would be carrying lots of rainwater."

It was very useful to know the water-tram tours on Danube are covered by the day (24, 48, 72-hours) tickets.I would say that travelling from one end to another is a perfect experience as it allows seeing both Buda and Pest from the river because the boat is zig-zagging and stopping on numerous stops and it gives you a perfect opportunity to enjoy the best views. It is very convenient on both good weather - enjoying fresh air and rainy days as well - good alternative to staying half the day in the cafe or walking in the rain. The whole trip can be wel over one hour but you enjoy it taking pics and sipping your wine or whatever you brought with you. In warm season visiting Margit island will be a must - they call it lungs of Budapest. Very interesting and affordable!"

The boat had a lovely atmosphere and we felt like we were on a nighttime adventure. The dinner buffet gave us the opportunity to sample all of the Hungarian dishes that we had heard about (potatoes paprikash, chicken and dumplings, goulash, cabbage, etc). It also had some more familiar options for those who are less adventurous (chicken, fish, grilled vegetables, lots of different types of salads) - though I recommend at least trying some of the Hungarian items so you have some idea of what to order when you're in a sit-down restaurant later on in your trip. After eating dinner, we really enjoyed drinking a glass of hot mulled wine while bundled up on the outside deck looking at all the bridges and government buildings on the Buda side. A dinner cruise is a great way to experience the Danube! Especially without having to fight other tourists and sightseers for the best view of the river in the daytime."

No trip to Budapest is complete without a trip on the river danube.By day it is a really nice trip,lot's of interesting sight's and a good insight into the history of this wonderful city.Go by night when every major building is illuminated and you really see the beauty of this city.There are a number of cruiser's to choose from,set tour's ,hop on hop off tour's,and cruise with a meal and a drink, again superb.If you enjoy taking photo's,you will be in your element.I myself think the night cruise is the best,more interesting,but either way a trip on the Danube is a must do while on holiday in this great city."

Even if it's just to walk there and see food vendors set up in a square, making you look down streets or alleys you might no know existed. The river views may not be as beautiful as other cities, but its cool to see a city splayed out along the river. You get to see the juxtaposition of the old and new played out in the buildings and architecture played out on the rivers edge. I love looking at rivers in cities and getting to see what was, before modern automobiles and planes, the lifeline of goods and transportation."

If you get inclement weather and can't take advantage of the top deck for the cruising part, it won't be much fun.The big attraction of a river cruise is to see so many towns and cities along the way, sometimes two a day. If you're into cute little towns, a Rhine river cruise will not disappoint. It can be like an adult Disneyland. We loved all the cities along the way, and in our opinion the best was saved for last...Budapest. If you can stay there an extra day it would be well worth it. And Budapest at night is one of the best parts of the trip.'We may take another river cruise someday if that's the best way to see more towns, but not until we've exhausted all the ocean trips we want to do and the ports of call that are of interest to us."

We pre booked an evening river cruise with Hungaro Concert via the Budapest by locals website *(which I found really really helpful - just google it). Our booking was for cruise, dinner, drinks and live music, and at around \u00a330 a head we thought it was a very good deal. The cruise included a welcome drink, a free bottle of water and 1 other free drink, but extra drinks were not expensive for city centre prices. The meal was a buffet and included a good range of food, although it was a bit of a free for all as you only get 90 minutes on the boat and some guests feel it is an opportunity to eat as much as possible. Bit there was plenty to try and it was a decent meal.The music was wonderful 0 a 3 piece group, 2 violins and a double base and they played a range of music from classical to more modern tunes and some Hungarian folk. . The night was wonderfully clear and the lit up buildings were just stunning. You had the opportunity to to the top deck any time and take photo's which we chose to do several times and we got some beautiful results, but ot was also just nice to sit downstairs and enjoy the view as it went past. They do try and sell you extra's - a photo of your table printed and in a presentation booklet which we bought (about \u00a36 and it was a lovely photo) and CD's of the music which we didn't buy. There wasn't too much of the hard sell, but it was there. This trip was one of the highlights of our stay, It was amazingly romantic and special and just a lovely way to spend an evening and see the beautiful city of Budapest. Highly recommended."

Crime is so low that you never have to worry even at night about getting accosted. The boat restaurants are okay, but pricey, and are there more for the location than the cuisine. I prefer to eat dinner at a popular Hungarian restaurant near the Chain bridge, a place like Borkonyha (very hard to get reservations since they won a Michelin star), Tigris, or Cafe Kor, and then stroll across the bridge or, staying on the Pest side, along the water to the Parliament. That are is also beautifully lit up at night."

Daytime trip offers an open panorama going up and passing the Parliament and other famous buildings. If you need romance an evening trip is best. You will be masmorised by the lit up bridge's, Halaszbastya, Matthias Church and the hundred of tiny lights on the hills. It is simply sublime.Boat trips are offered day and night and the length and activities are varied too.You can take just a short trip going up to the end of Margaret Island and back again, or you can choose going all the way up to Visegrad or Szentendre, both places are magnificent. Have a good lunch, wonder around on cobbled street in the old part of Szentendre. The time of year will determine your choice. Spring and Autumn are the best but having said that the New Years Eve are something to remember till the rest of your life. The latter is pricey, but you will have everything. Wine, food and entertainment throughout the night.Whatever your choice is it will be a memorable experience. Enjoy your trip on this majestic River!"

Along one side you have the Great Chain Bridge, shoes on the river danube and Parliament. I'm not sure whats on the other end because well I didn't go there! There was already so much to do. Walking along the river outside the Parliament towards the shoes memorial, you can get some great shots along the river. There are a few bench's to sit down and enjoy the sunshine (when it comes). The entrance to the river at the parliament has a little cafe with wifi so you can spend a while there, grab a coffee and walk along the river. All in all an excellent experience."

The cities from Budapest; with all of its magnificent architecture lit up at night for Christmas, to Melk and Passau and every city in between, left you speechless. The Christmas Markets just got better and better. The weather was warmer while there than it was in Georgia. Our ship experience was 5+ star, with an enthusiastic staff, comfortable nice rooms, excellent cuisine, great wines and other libations, and a ship filled with enjoyable people. The tours arranged by Viking were outstanding and allowed you to see the main attractions in each city visited. This was the best cruising experience I have ever had."

Our trip was over Thanksgiving week and we traveled from Nuremberg Germany to Budapest Hungry. We had been on one other Viking riverboat cruise and were familiar with their new Longships . Much to our delight the Odin was as nice as our previous cruise on the Rinda. Our room was one of the nice suites, and having a separate room to relax and entertain our travel companions was a treat. The suite was very comfortable and kept very clean. Let me commend the staff on our ship. They were absolutely fantastic. From our delightful housekeeper Julia, to the Hotel Manager Kornelia and Radim our Program Director. I must also give the Executive Chef Andreas the highest of marks. He took such pride in his food and would visit each table after dinner to hear our comments of the meal. At breakfast each morning he would place a homemade cookie on our plate just for a sweet addition. He was a delight. We had fun with all the staff that we became acquainted with and they all did as much as they could to make our trip enjoyable. The fact that we only had 81 passengers on board to their 52 staff members probably helped with the immediate service we received. We sat at the same table each evening and felt really spoiled by our wonderful servers. The tours were very well conducted and we enjoyed all the towns and villages we visited. Only problem we have with Viking is their advertisements of \"all inclusive\". This seems is a bit of a stretch. You are encouraged to tip your tour guide, bus driver, and the staff on board at the end of your cruise. Your free drinks are only included during meals. To me that doesn't really represent \"all inclusive\" Other riverboats we have traveled on also include a small coffee server in the suites. Not on Viking, unless you are in their executive suite. Perhaps that seems a small thing, but such a nice addition when you have spent the extra $$ to secure a suite. All in all this was a wonderful trip. Thanks again to the staff on the Odin."

The Gate 1 - 9-day Danube River Cruise offered on Travel Zoo was such a steal, it could not be resisted. What a perfect way to spend the Thanksgiving holiday. It was everything I hoped for, and more. Starting at the beginning, Kimber made our reservations. She was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. We got the flights we wanted, with just one transfer in Newark, where we already met new Gate 1 friends. When our group gathered in Munich, an immediate bond was formed. The transfer to the ship took nearly 2 hours, and gave us welcomed \"nap time\" on the bus, after such a long flight. As we boarded The Sound of Music, we were served soup and pastries as a welcome treat. And that was just the beginning.The tours...included and optional....were fantastic. The tour operators were quite knowledgeable. Some were very entertaining as well. Of course, the sights of Nuremburg, Regensburg, Passau, Salzburg,Melk, Vienna and Budapest were amazing....outstanding! The food was delicious and there were plenty of choices for everyone. Beer and wine was served with dinner, and it was included (a bonus!). The on-board LOCAL entertainment was great....just wish there was more of it. The Christmas markets were a bonus as well. The most important aspect, however, was the friendliness of the Gate 1 tour managers, the Sound of Music Staff....waiters, housekeeping, front desk, etc., etc., local guides and bus drivers. All in all, it was a very rewarding and pleasant experience. Did I mention FREE WiFi.The one regret we have is that we were not able to take advantage of the opportunity to extend our trip on either end....Munich or Budapest. But that only means we'll have to return. In the meantime, we have two more trips booked with Gate 1....Turkey & Greece....celebrating special occasions. There is no doubt about it.....it's Gate 1 all the way for us. You can't go wrong with them."

We spent 15 wonderful days being spoiled on the Scenic Crystal travelling from Amsterdam to Budapest and have nothing but praise for the boat and it's crew. Special mention: Zoltan (Leonardo Di Caprio), Regina, Anita and Putro. Marin our cruise director is a 24/7 wonder! I don't think he had time to sleep from the minue we met him in Amsterdam until we departed Budapest. Scenic take care of passengers well before and long after arrival at embarkation and disembarking from the boat by providing a day room in excellent hotels where passengers waiting for transfers can rest, have a snack, explore the city they are in and fill in time until being transferred to boat from airport and vice versa. Scenic staff are still in attendance during this hiatus.The all inclusive fare really is all inclusive. There is absolutely no need to spend a cent on the boat or the tours. The ship is pristine the food is great.Of course the scenery is breathtaking and the tours with experienced guides are very well managed with lots of choices of where to go, what to do and see. With so much going on we found we needed a \"day off\" just for my husband and myself so we waved the other passengers off and had the boat to ourselves for several hours. Of course the staff were still there for us as we relaxed and recharged our batteries.Autumn is a spectacular time to visit and the Christmas markets are in full swing by the end of November.River cruises and ocean cruises cannot be compared. They are such different experiences but both are wonderful ways to see the world. Having a familiar base, staff, bed and restaurant to return to each night really enhances our holidays.The final highlight was the night cruise through Budapest. What a perfect was to end a 5 star holiday."

The views are excellent and the impressive buildings you see from the water should not be missed. However choose your operator carefully, i bought my tickets from a street vendor, which was working under the auspices of \"Budapest Tourist Information\". A lot of comforts and extras were promised but never delivered. The tour operator i used was Kossuth Museum Ship, easily identifiable because it has a black and white funnel. We were seated on the top deck at very basic pic nic tables and chairs, the carpeted deck was filthy and worn, the drinks were poor and expensive, the music was modern and very loud, but the worst thing was that throughout the entire cruise there was ZERO explanation of what we were passing, what we should be looking at or any kind of history, even though they advertised a full tourist guide in 37 languages!!!. Since taking this journey i have found out that other operators offer everything i expected, so choose carefully."

On the Pest side, tram #2 runs alongside the river and it's a good alternative to walking, particular if it's cold and/or wet. One of the great attractions by the side of the river on the Pest side is the Hungarian parliament and the riverside walk takes you right past it. Good views can also be gained by crossing the river by one of the city's bridges. Try the Margaret bridge and use it for visiting Margaret island in the Danube, which has several parks and restaurants."

Nice to have done it anyway."

This is a must for all visitors to Budapest, because so much takes place on both sides of this great river -- on water, on the banks or a bit further away. This is where the heart of Budapest thumps and pumps and its blood flows. I walked from Liberty to the Chain bridge at night on the Buda side and during day walked the Pest side. Simple things are sometimes difficult to describe accurately and must be experienced. First it is the beauty of the river and the bridges and historical buildings that dot both sides. The joggers, cyclists, romantic walks keep the side walks on the river banks busy. On the bridges you will find young lovers drowing themselves in alcohol and ciggarettes. All very quite and peaceful. The river breeze is very soothing. I have walked many great river sidewalks, but I am sure the Danube is one of the best. You will do well if you carry some drinks and snacks with you as the immediate side walks do not have eating places for hawkers. For this you will have to side step a bit. Be careful of the walking lane vs the bike lane. Bikers are careful but at times very fast. Renting a bike might also be a great idea to cover all the bridges at a faster pace. Bike rentals are nearby, but may be closed in the evening. Some hotels carry bikes for rent. Bring a camera as the are great night scenes and day photo ops."

Musicians played at the start and at the end ... OK. No atmosphere. Overall a boring experience. If you really must do this, buy a ticket for upstairs where you can see the beautiful buildings lit up at night. Or walk along the Danube - for free - you'll see exactly the same. Sorry, folks, I simply loved every minute of exploring Budapest, however, this can really be missed. :) (With all due respects, there might be other cruises/companies that are worthwhile).

It's beautiful at all times of day and night because of the way sunrise and sunset hit the historical buildings on both sides of the river and particularly at night when the most important buildings are illuminated. The bridges add their own charm with their twinkly lights. It's magical and romantic. The promenade on the Pest side is lovely with cafes and flower planters lining the river. It's a great place to sit, and watch the world go by. There is one other incredibly moving monument that is right at the river's edge near the Parliament building. It's the Shoes on the Danube Holocaust Memorial. It is a sculpture of shoes that the victims would have worn before they were chained together and shot into the river to perish. It is one of those monuments that really touch you in ways you cannot imagine."

Well located. We bought a Budapest city card on line and picked it up at the Tourist Bureau minutes away. It was centrally located so the metro lines all converged here as well as the Trams etc. Very easy to walk around. We could have just bought the Transit pass without the museums but it was no fuss or bother. Metro very easy to use.We visited St. Stephens Basilica where the \"Holy Right is kept .For a small fee you can visit the view area via a lift ... great views of the city.Next day took metro to Hero's Square & City park and visited the Castle. The SZURKEMARHA festival happened to be on that SundayWe walked down Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue and visited the Opera... A must take the tourWalked down to the Danube and found the \"Shoes on the Danube\" moving site.Next day trip to Buda castle but a wine festival was on so could not enter.No problem walked around the area.We took the Funicular up the Hill and Back ..not included in the City pass even though it mentions it!St Matthias church a must see and the Fisherman's BastionNext Day had a full day tour \"Puszta Great Plains and Kecskemet Day Trip from Budapest\" with Viator. Booked it on line.Good break from walking around. Different. Friends had suggested it.Our last day we took the Tram to Liberty Bridge and walked across to Gell\u00e9rt Baths and Hill We visited the Cave church and walked up the Hill to the top .Needed several rest stops. View is worth it. Easiest way is take Bus up to the top of the Hill and then walk down!Our last night we went to Budai Vigado - renewed theater in Budapest. The Hungarian State Folk Ensemble performs here. must do while in Budapest. We reached it again by Metro.River Cruise the next Day well organized by Avalon. Pre-paid excursions we goodWe went to the Opera night in Vienna. that night on arrival and was Happy we did.We walked around Vienna next day afte a included walking city tour.Visited Saint Stephen's Cathedral anther worthwhile visit. Also visited Hofburg Palace, Sisi Museum, Imperial Apartments and the Imperial Silver CollectionThat night we had a Special presentation on the Wachau valley.problem with river cruise is that you don't have much time viewing the River. But this part most were up on deckNext stop on cruise was D\u00fcrnstein. We did a walking tour some did a bike tour to Melk.Sampled White wine and Apricot ScnappsNext stop in afternoon was Melk . What a beautiful place. Another must see!The following day we had a full day excursion to Disembark to do a all day tour of the Salzkammergut lake district in Austria (First stop Lake Taunsee at Traunkirchen , Lake Wolfgangsee,St. Gilgan and last Mondsee . Well worth it but so were the other offered full day excursions. A matter of choice.Next day was Regensburg Germany & we went on the Danube Gorge and Weltenberg Abbey tour in the morning and a included city tour in afternoon.Feasted on Saukraut, bratwurst sausages and beer at the Historic Sausage Kitchen. Paid by the Cruise.Last day on to Nurenberg visited the castle for view. Not enough time with the tour. Wished I had seen the Deep Well and Sinwell Tower inside.I booked my own Hotel In Prague at the Sheraton . Avalon bused me to their hotel Intercontinental and I took a taxi .Again I had Picked up my Prague city card and did a city tour that day by bus included with the card.Easy to walk around. Sheraton was at Charles square easy access to transportaion. but we mostly walked to the old Square. Yhe new city hall tower was near the sheraton so we walked up the stairs for the view anda small price.Toured the Old square. Palladium shopping and Korva shopping area. Look for stores displaying Global Blue Tax Free Shopping signage in the window. The tax free site Global site was in the Korva shopping mall but still had to claim the discount at the airport. That went easy.We visited Prague Castle,Karlova Crystal where i tried my hand at Glass blowing. Also booked a a haunted underground tour by lamplight. This was ok but funWe had breakfast buffet at Sheraton in the Am and was shocked at the 75$ price tag. The following morning had coffee at Mammacoffee with croissant for 10$The last day bused across the Legion Bridge. Then took the Funicular to the TOP. It was included with the Prague card.Lots to see up top. Observatory was not open but went up the \"Eiffel Tower\" superb views. We visited the House of Mirrors then walked down the Hill along the Hunger wall.Stopped for a Brew at the Monastic Brewery. Then visited the Strahov Library. A msut see. Look at the books in the corridor and read the description. Real wood and lichen and moss on the covers. Amazing. Also visited the Museum of Minatures well worth the small fee ( Eiffel Tower on a Cherry Pit!)picked up some chocholate near the Golden Star restaurant at steps going up to Prague Castle. We then visited St. Nicholas church in Lessr town Square.. Another good vistWe then walked across the Charles bridge excellent.Our last night we went to the\" Mozart Dinner' at the Grand Bohemia Hotel in their Boccaccio ballroom.Booked this on line. of note is that the doors open to let you in off the street at 7:00 not a minute before. So the line up was outside. This was my wife's best night. She even got a rose. We had a Front table for 2 wit hthe 3 drinks included. The best option.Any way this was a great Holiday 14 days total."

The architecture on the banks is impressive and the views from either side are amazing. Luckily, in mid-December, there were not many people on the Pest bank.

Lots of information on the cruise arrived with our reservation confirmation, however ambiguous info on meeting point at Munich airport caused a bit of confusion. Eventually met by representative and transferred to ship (Emerald Sky). Lovely friendly welcome on board by the Cruise Director and Hotel Manager and the ship was stunning. Our cabin (Owner's Suite) was excellent - lots of space with a walk-in wardrobe, and 2 inboard balconies. Beautiful bed linen, with a pillow menu and very comfortable bed. Night and day cruising ensured maximum time ashore at the many beautiful towns and cities. Our first impression was that the holiday was rather more organised than we would have wanted. Many of the tours started at 8.30 am. OK for many people, but one of our main holiday requirements is relaxation! However, we accepted this, and, of course, the choice was ours whether we joined the many excursions, or not. So that is not a criticism of the holiday, merely a personal observation.I would compliment the whole crew who were most attentive and helpful to my husband, who is reg. blind. This particularly applied to Ross and the other waiters in the Restaurant who were absolutely wonderful, nothing was too much trouble for them. Possibly only slight criticism was the d\u00e9cor of the ship. It was very beautiful, with lots of glass, mirrors and very shiny floors. However it was very difficult for my husband, with very limited sight, to get around without walking into something (too many reflections).Would definitely recommend this holiday. An excellent way to travel through 4 countries, visit many beautiful cities, traverse seamlessly through many very large locks, enjoy the gentle passing of the panorama, and all with the minimum of effort."

We travelled a lot and always made our own arrangements but decided to join. gate 1 on this vacation. we got an excellent price with Gate 1 compared to a lot of the more familiar cruise line and we were a bit hesitant at the beginning as we are from Canada and have not used their service. We booked this trip well in advance. The flight arrangements were good, they have a live agent if u have questions. The Sound of Music was not luxiious but it was clean, staff were friendly and polite, 3 meals were excellent and provided plenty of choices. We had a room with panorama window and it was very comfortable and clean. The Danube was amazing and we enjoyed going in the small town. The tour manager from Gate 1 was helpful and friendly and both the crew, gate 1 staff worked so hard to accommodate everyone. We feel we need to give more as tipping at the end of the trip as everyone on board is so friendly and tried so hard to make their customers happy. In US servers demand to be tipped 15-20% and sometimes we feel they don't derserved it as they feel it is mandatory. with this cruise, we feel more than happy to be generous in tipping as we got such good service. Gate 1 made everything so smooth and I will definitely travel with them again."

The scenery along the river is spectacular and the small villages are wonderful to visit and explore. The larger cities, Budapest, Bratislava, and Vienna offer wonderful history, art, architecture, and food experiences. We didn't stop at every village, but some of the historical sights took us back to our childhood tales of Robin Hood, because Richard the Lion Heart was held for hostage in the castle above Durnstein, Austria. The ship offered a marvellous way to visit and view the countryside. The towns offer real local experiences, unlike cruise stops on the Caribbean.The only disappointment was that the Danube is NOT blue...it's greenish-brown.An unforgettable experience!"

There were six of us and we all met in Budapest prior to the cruise which I would recommend doing. Budapest is a beautiful city and so much to see. From our first step onto the Viking Njord, we were greeted by crew members and did not worry about one thing from that first moment to our disembarking the ship. The ship was modern, clean and sleek. Our cabins were a little larger than an ocean liner and our bathroom definitely was a step above. The ship only has about 140 cabins so it was comfortable and not overwhelming. The food was great and portions were just as they should be. The selections were enough and always enough fresh food available. The crew were wonderful. Everything worked smoothly and any problems which did occur were taken care of immediately. The included tours were worth it and provided a chance to see the towns that we were visiting. My only two comments on what to improve on: the bed pillows need to be upgraded but this is a small nit in the entire package. Also, I wish there was a way to have more time in Vienna. Not sure if this can be accomplished. Overall, I felt that they did a fantastic job and would definitely try another Viking River Cruise. I would recommend this River Cruise to anyone."

You will have a cosy evening by taking a cruising trip with dinner and good wine and enjoy one of the evening sightseeing cruises, which are combined with a sound and vision show. You will see the illuminated hills, palaces, the beautiful Parliament, the bridges, such as the historical Chain Bridge and finally to finish your evening program with the Blue Danube Waltz, which will whisper in your ears, any time you remember this fantastic tour on the Danube. If you have more time, you can take a boat trip to the picturesque small town of Szentendre, or further to see the basilica in Esztergom in the North and the picturesque Danube Bend. If you are interested not only in sightseeing, gastronomy, photography, but also in literature, on the Kossuth Square, close the Parliament look at the statute of J\u00f3zsef Attila, one of the most excellent poets of Hungary and recall his beautiful poem: \u201cA Dun\u00e1n\u00e1l\u201d (\u201cBy the Danube\u201d)."

Viking has the poorest management of any company we have ever traveled with - we are shocked at their lack of interest in their customer once they have your money! Please do NOT book with Viking! They rerouted our original flight reservations without informing us and we ended up arriving in Paris an entire day later than originally planned. By the time we arrived it had been 48 hrs since we had been in bed. We complained but were told they didn't realize our flights had been changed! Are you kidding me? We even paid extra to have Viking take care of our flights - what a joke! We had been on a waiting list to upgrade our cabin for 6 months, and called regularly to check on availability of any upgraded room, at any cost. When we were boarding the ship we asked the current status of our request and were told that they didn't the fair way to give the available upgrade cabin to someone, so they just gave it to the first person that boarded the ship and asked for it! Again, are you kidding me? We were on a waiting list for 6 months, and the person they gave the cabin to was never on a waiting list. Talk about pitiful management, they are beyond belief. We were given wrong information about where to meet at touring destinations, what time to meet, where to find ATM's, etc.... When we got back to the states we filed another formal complaint on line and received a phone call. After explaining all that happened to us we were told that there was nothing they could do for us except give us a voucher for $1,000 off another Viking trip. What? Why would we ever consider traveling with a company so incompetent? Really, please believe us when we tell you, STAY AWAY from VIKING!!! Save yourselves all the agony of dealing with a company that dimply will take your money and run away with it!"

Castles, churches and quaint European towns, what is not to like. Of course in Budapest, the Danube is central and essential to the city. The City was built around the Danube as a shipping route and Strategic location. Both the Parliament and the Royal Palace sit facing the River and are all lit up at night so it really is spectacular to see especially as we sailed into the city at 10:30 PM. It is harder to stroll along the Danube as the riverside promenade is at times interrupted by roads, tram lines and cruise ship terminals. As well, sections are very rough with uneven cobbles. Oh, BTW, the 'Blue Danube\" from the waltz no longer exists, it is now more mud brown or grey. Still a lovely river."

You can decide to either do it in one of the expensive cruises which also give you lunch/dinner tours or you can decide to do it on the super cheap BKK boat services the D11, D12 lines on which the day passes work fine on the weekdays. Either ways you will love it.The river has a different feel during the day and night so if you can you should try and do a ride during the both the times. During the day especially on a clear sunbathed day everything is sparkingly gorgeous and during the night with the lights on the city looks so sparkling.The trip towards the Elizabeth Bridge is probably the exciting one as compared to the one towards the Margaret Bridge unless you were on a longer 2-3 hour cruise to the Sentzendre for instance."

Viking Legend folks did a fine job on our Danube trip, but still prefer staying in one place/exploring that area leisurely/doing day trips. With cruises u stop at a port, do a several hour whirlwind tour, then back on boat for dinner. Not enough time to explore place, shop or enjoy different dining experiences, etc. As an example, spending half a day in Vienna was disappointing.While my wife would likely give higher grades for this cruise, we both agreed if we do it again we would be sure to do it with family/friends. Each dining experience (3 times a day) we had to join a new table of strangers. That is OK on occasion, but finding the comfortable dining partners that many times was a little stressful.While in the US I am usually a pretty good tipper (20%), Viking asks u to tip the entire ship staff, whether u were serviced directly by them or not. Viking made it easy (one \u20ac500+ tip at end for all), sometimes I wonder whether the employer, not just Viking, should be paying these folks better, rather than relying on their customers to make up the difference.Food was pretty good, especially breakfasts, but not as much fun as discovering new restaurants/ambiances.Having said all of the above, if cruises are ur thing (good if personal mobility is an issue for example), then Viking is a very good choice."

It was bargain bucket and took about an hour to commute but the staff were friendly and very accommodating. We got used to the train ride and where to stop for pizza haha. The owners of the Hotel were very good to us. They give good advise and directions of how to get around Budapest and places of interest to visit and restaurants locally as well as in Budapest that you could use. They allowed us to use their internet. Breakfast was about five Euros at the time.(This was 2009). Some locals looked at us strangely, probably not used to seeing people on holiday who are of African heritage. But other than that, in Budapest everything was fine.There was a restaurant that they recommended around the corner. It was great, relaxed and fairly priced. I cant remember the name though but i will upload some pics.Amongst the other places we visited and enjoyed was Szechenyi Baths and Pool. Biggest in Europe.Tip: Go early so you can spend the whole day.It was amazing outdoor pools and variety of saunas and indoor pools. Best ever!The day river Cruise on the sea was great, calm. You obtain ear phones with a choice of languages to choose from, for the guided tour of this historical city. It was about two hours in length. I saw some great views from both sides of the boat and the sea was calm enough, although I took travel sickness tablet, it seemed very smooth. We passed Parliament building and other important buildings and statues. The ride captures the city's history. It was unlike any other boat tour I experienced. We also passed many bridges on route.

We have always been impressed by Riviera, having done six previous holidays with them, none of which were river cruises. Again, they get high marks for organisation, accommodation and quality of Riviera representatives. We have always found our fellow travellers to be interesting and good company and this was true to a large extent on this holiday but, unlike other holidays, the average age of our companions was twenty years higher than my own!We had a Standard, Diamond deck cabin which had a small, perfectly formed bedroom with sliding doors and a juliet balcony. The ensuite was very good, a large shower, plenty room for toiletries and a good makeup mirror! Food onboard was very good at dinner, with at least four small courses. A system of free seating is operated, tables cannot be reserved for small groups. There is a small restaurant to the rear of the boat where reservations are accepted though. Lunch is a buffet. I don't like buffet meals and ended up having more or less the same salad on every occasion we had lunch onboard. We were given a packed lunch on the day we visited Salzberg, I'm afraid I gave mine away to a beggar, who I am sure would've enjoyed it more than me! All members of the crew were very friendly and helpful and we enjoyed the show they put on for us one evening in the bar; very amusing!The cruise started in Budapest, where we started in the evening, a stunning city and worth seeing illuminated at night. The view from the boat during the first couple of days of cruising was mainly a tree lined bank and our first stop was Estergom which was very unappealing and quite depressing in atmosphere. The next day, Bratislava had more to offer but things really improved as we got into Austria, in terms of view from the boat and places to visit! Durnstein, Salzberg and Vienna are fantastic destinations with plenty to do and see.Speaking to our fellow travellers, I would say that perhaps a Rhine cruise would've suited us better, so we might think about that in fifteen years time!"

Booking was easy enough as we got our tickets only the morning of the cruise. Directions to the meeting point were challenging and we were lucky to see the group crossing the street and asked if this was the tour. Exhilarated that we connected, we were led through one fancier looking ship to cross through to another that was less fancy. Directed upstairs with a glass of champagne (or juice) to sit at tables, it was cool and what views! We could open the windows and a handful of people were able to sit in the limited space out on the deck. The boat took off as planned and a waiter came up to take additional orders. I ordered a bowl of ghoulash soup which was very tasty. It came with two thick slices of bread and was very reasonable and satisfying. I'd read a number of unhappy reviews on their website discouraging purchasing the meals for the trip, so we ate dinner long before the cruise. Our glass of wine followed and we had a good time enjoying our leisurely jaunt up the beautifully lit Danube. For some reason we thought water came with our ticket and asked for it. The waiter was very kind bringing our ticket agreement back up so we could see our trip did not include water and then he comped us two bottles of water.anyway! Sweet! We wanted to tip him, but he never returned as someone else came to take our money for the soup. The trip ended at just about the right time for me. One hour and half was enough time on the River. Great tour! We will look for more Viator tours where ever we travel!"

We arrived late at some stops and early at others. Although the crew did try to compensate, it left us constantly feeling hurried. We also felt there simply was not enough time in each location.We felt Viking provided poor communications about the amount of walking involved and little if any alternatives. This was not a problem for us, but we did see others with this issue.We found the buffet breakfast and lunch mediocre at best, the dinners were excellent, although portions are extremely small. The dinner wait staff seemed undermanned with.long delays serving. Possibly due to the high passenger count. We had no complaints with the wait staff, there simply was not enough of them.On board entertainment was a piano player and a few games.Overall, did not feel the trip was worth the price."

The food was very good. Many selection to eat healthy if you chose to. We did not care for the Open seating. We traveled with a group of 7 and each night one person had to line up at the dinning room to grab a table. The tours and excursions are great ,the head phone system me it nice not to be in herd walking you can spread out. I would book Avalon again but do not waist your money on a fancy room. Your in your room so little to enjoy to the view if your not parked next to another boat looking at that. The laundry service on the boat is very reasonable to take fewer clothes and have them washed. Also bring sweatpants for lounging, a insulated coffee cup to the 24 hour coffee and cookie bar. One of the best things to do is pick up local wines and beer as you go. You can enjoy them up on deck or in your room. They charge a small cork fee at dinner and you can't bring it in the lounge of course. But if you have it in your insulated mug they don't know what's in it.....

We had spent 4 days in Bucharest prior to our joining Viking and found a lovely boutique hotel in Old Town called the Rembrandt. . Nothing fancy but wonderful location and the staff were ever so helpful. It was given a good rating of hotels to choose from in Bucharest. Upon arrival at the Radisson we were helped by the Viking staff located in the lobby. We were instructed to have our bags outside our rooms the following morning by 6:30 am. We did so and went to breakfast but upon returning around 8::45 am bags were still outside our room. Had a driving tour of much of Bucharest that morning with a stop at the Palace Parliament for those desiring to do an inside tour. We had already been on that tour during our stay prior to the cruise, so we got a walking tour of Old Town instead. We were all given a walking tour of a Village Museum. . Lunch was at a local restaurant that made us feel a bit like cattle. Way too many people, and loud, and quite hurried. Not a pleasant experience. Once on the Rinda we went into our AA Cabin Suite. Very nice accommodations and we were happy to get settled in and unpack. Our friends who were traveling with us were able to visit with us each evening in our separate living room which was a real plus. The Viking Rinda longship is a rather new ship put into service 2013. Attractive with modern d\u00e9cor. This is our 3rd. riverboat cruise, but 1st. with Viking. The cruise we chose was to the eastern block areas we had been unable to tour in the past. We found the excursions very educational and enlightening in many ways. Only problem we found was they seem to try to cram too many sites into a day, and way too many people per guide. Sometimes as many as 48. There were afternoons when we would return to ship with only 40 minutes or so to clean up from the day and change clothes to be up for the evening briefing at 6:30 or 6:45. We felt very rushed and we weren't the only ones to make mention of this.. You don't have to dress fancy for the evening, but you often do feel you want to possibly shower and clean up a bit for the dinner. As for the wait staff and the food, both were exceptional. We chose to sit in the same area each evening and became very close and friends with our servers. Travel Tip.... All tables are 6 tops and more and open seating. We chose to send one person ahead 15 minutes prior to the meal if you desire to select the same waiters. One thing that stood out was the Captain was missing in action most of the week, to the public, including the Captain's Dinner. He was introduced to us at the beginning of the cruise and that was it. Very different experience from that standpoint. Twice on the ship we had to up and available at 6:30 am. Once for a customs check, which I guess was understandable. The second was to have our bags out precisely at 6:30am the final day as it was a safety issue to have the hall cleared. We left the ship around 9 and all bags were still outside our rooms. Some of you may be very early risers and this is not a problem, but for those of us who are on vacation and not really happy about 3 mornings, including the Radisson Blu, of Very Early Risings, it was a somewhat irritating and seemed to be unnecessary. Overall our experience was positive. However we have discovered that Viking's \"all inclusive\" is grossly inaccurate. Unlike other cruises we have been on, the only thing you get for upgrading to an AA suite is a pair of slippers and cheap robe to use. No coffee pot, no soft drinks or wine / spirits and no laundry included. Laundry cost is obscene. Then there is the \"recommended tipping\". Most Company CEOs would not get the salary rate recommended. For example, the cruise we were on was touted as 10 day cruise, but 3 days were in hotels with breakfast only provided. The tipping guide suggests tipping rates for all 10 days... you were not even on the boat. We did individually tip our wait staff and we did provide a proper tip for the general staff and tour director, but not as large as the suggested. As we checked out we noticed a minor revolt among the people as they were asked if they wished to add the tip to their bill. All 10 of the folks in line with me said no. All 15 in line with our travel mates said no. We felt they deserved tips but not as Viking suggests. Especially when they tout \"All Inclusive\".Very unfortunate for the staff.Viking boats are extremely quiet and functional and the staff is excellent. We felt special on our cruise as we celebrated our 51st anniversary with an evening to remember.We would recommend Viking, but suggest you plan to be nickel dimed for the bus driver, tour guide, beverages (except coffee and tea), laundry, and bar costs. Other lines on similar routes with true all inclusive rates that at first glance may seem higher, but a check out would be competitive. The ability to have a coke zero or glass of wine or a beer other than at meal times more than makes up the difference in price.Hope this helps you choose with a little more info as you search for your cruise.cheers,eeg3"

Our driver was there with his sign as soon as we entered the terminal. Whisked us off to our hotel in Amsterdam the Movenpic. We did the pre extension. The hotel is very nice, though they could provide viking guest with priority entrance to our rooms, after travelling sitting until 3:00 waiting for a room is annoying. However if the weather would have been better it probably wouldn't have mattered. The walking tour the next day was fantastic we had Klauss, he's amazing! Boarding the viking Eistla was...wow. It was more than I expected. The \"light lunch\" was great, salad, sandwiches, pasta salads, really quite a bit of food. Free flowing wine and beer! The whole trip exceeded our expectation. The staterooms are very nice, small but efficient we had a balcony so that was nice. The showers are great. The staff are fantastic, from the cabin stewards to the dinning room staff. We were likely enough to have Goran, Martina, Lucas and Seta! If you have them your in for a treat! The food was amazing five star all the way! I'm not sure what some other reviews complain about but I guess you just can't please some people...we had some on our cruise. Rude people really. I would go on a viking river cruise and we are looking into the ocean cruise for 2016. Highly recommend it, although have to say make sure you go on the new long ships as they are fantastic!"

You can walk on the riverside, admire the views from the bridges and take a boat ride to see the city from a different angle. The views at night are specially recommended as the main buildings are all lit upand look lovely with nice reflections in the water.The city transport service also runs boat services, which is a great bargain alternative to the overpriced tourist trap of tourist lunch and dinner cruises. The local tourist offices work on commission it seems, because the girls were very keen for me to book on these cruises but did not tell me that if I just wanted a simple trip down the river I could use the public transport boats. These boats have twic decks with great seats and tables with linen covers for sitting nicely - I saw several people had brought food and drinks to enjoy while cruising. They have toilets and food kiosk on board. Best of all, if you have the 24/48/72hour travel card you can use this on the boats for free rides. The bboats can be boarded from several piers."

Until 3.10 we were contained on a moored boat until the scheduled boat arrived and after the disembarkation of the previous load, were allowed to board. The bilingual commentary was unimaginative and robotic and the English version was barely decipherable and spoken with a strong Chinese accent. The tour we were given was the alternative tour to the one we had bought. We were returned to the dock at 4pm more or less 45 minutes after setting off. We tried to redress this with the less than charming staff who met us on the gang plank. Their only justification was that all tours were subject to modifications, a word that was clearly displayed on their billboard.They were deeply unpleasant and we a saw a side to Hungarian people that up until that point we had no inkling of. The whole issue was shabby, upsetting and rather reminded us of the Marchioness disaster. This was the only thing that marred our otherwise fabulous stay in this delightful city."

The streets in Buda were clean enough to eat off of and people were genuinely friendly; not \" uppity French\" friendly where they take your money because they have to. We stayed right on top of the Danube river. Plenty of places to sight see on both sides of the Danube in Budapest. We could have spent another 2-3 days easily. From there we traversed north and then west through Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria, & Germany. Paralleled our ship on a bike ride from one port to another one day. (should be in fairly good shape to do this even at only4-5mph) and saw the countryside from a different view. Visited local wineries and churches. Dropped in at the cemetery location where the Sound of Music\" filmed. Wonder what ever happened to Rolfe? Speaking of wondering, why are the Danube ships built the way they are? I mean they only hold 130-170 people. You don't have to travel very long to gain the knowledge to this answer. Traveling on the boat meant connecting with a lot of people; most of whom you'll recognize by the 4th or 5th day as being off your boat and if you let yourself float around at \"feeding time\" you eventually settle in with a core group you'll interact with. Can't vouch for any other ship, but ours was always kept spotless, and the crew was overly accommodating. Food was abundant at all meals as was the unlimited wine, beer, milk, and pop (colas). Thank goodness for the top deck running track to walk/run off all those extra calories! The trip gave you ample time to sample the country side not only with your palette but also with your cinema tonic acumen. Evenings on the ship had entertainment of some sort several days although this was not the highlight of the trip. This after all was not a cruise where you are stuck in the ocean, this is a destination excursion on a giant water taxi. You do a lot of walking, shopping, walking, eating; walking, sightseeing, and did I mention walking? Not that some people didn't skip several of the free excursions to relax on the boat. Several of the excursions also accommodated handicapped or walking impaired groups. With all the countries in the European union, travel between them was uninterrupted and smooth. From the portion of the iron curtain on display and Holocaust death camps to the palatial views and scenic countryside, history reaches out and shakes you by the scruff of the neck. This trip has a lot to offer everyone from serious historian or religious romanticist, to the transient existentialist. Once again, I can only speak for AMA Waterways on this ship, but corporately speaking they seem to know what to do and how to do it. All timing seemed well scripted and almost not enough time to spend on some of the excursions for us real fanatics on the trip. I'd do this trip again if not for the fact that I have other \"bucket list\" travels to do."

The meals were beautifully presented and offered lots of variety and were augmented by 24 hour \"cookie stations\" for those so inclined. We found that the included day trips were interesting enough that we didn't need to buy the extra excursions and all of our tour guides were friendly and knowledgeable. And, speaking of friendly, the crew of our boat were outstanding in both service and personalization. River boats have the perks of the their big brother ocean cruise ships, ie the floating hotel aspect, but are far more intimate and easier to get around on for those of us at a certain age."

We quickly left for a second boat and got a better deal, sitting at the front at a table, so the only thing we were looking at was the view. Upon stopping at Margaret island we were deluged by dozens of people coming back from a day there and heard the complaints of another dozen or so who couldn't get on, but had queued for an hour for this boat. Don't do it - organize a boat trip by going at looking at the boats when they depart."

After years of \"doing our own thing\" with the Rick Steves books, we decided to let someone else take care all of the details. We went with Viking on the Danube River, starting in Budapest, ending in Nuremburg. Our ship was the Viking Delling. It was such a relief to unpack just once, and not have to run to catch trains/planes/buses from one city to the next.Our boat was so clean, you could eat off the floors. The state rooms (cabins) were well-designed. There was storage everywhere, so we never felt the room was small. Besides, other than sleeping and showering, we spent very little time in our cabin. The (queen) bed was very comfortable. All of the public areas were very tastefully decorated and comfortable. 24/7, you could go to the coffee bar for tea, coffee, cookies, etc. The lounge had smaller groupings of seating areas so you could sit with a smaller group of people to visit. And, a piano player for \"gentle\" background music. One of the best parts of the trip was getting to know other people from around the country. The food was excellent. There was always something on the menu that appealed to us. For dinner, in addition to a couple of daily specials, chosen to offer a taste of the local region's cuisine, you could always choose one of three standard offerings. The wines (complimentary) were of very good quality-- not the usual wine-in-a-box stuff when you get when wine is \"free\".The tours were thoughtfully planned, and all of the guides spoke English. There was even a \"special\" version of each tour--the \"leisurely tour\"-- for those who might be a little slower at walking. Viking thought of everything: one day, we had some rain, and they provided large umbrellas for everyone.The activities director provided on-board afternoon/evening entertainment that tied in with the city we would visit the next day. A cultural submersion, if you will. We also received a newsletter each evening, reviewing what was going on the next day.To be honest, I can't think of a negative thing to say about our experience. We look forward to booking another river cruise as soon as we can. Considering what it would cost to stay in hotels, hire tour guides, pay entrance fees to various attractions, transportation from one city to the next, transportation within a city to do sightseeing, possibly rent a car, pay for meals in hotels and restaurants, deal with the stress trying to figure out other languages... we felt the cost of the Viking cruise was very reasonable."

Just to make our stay more interesting, we decided to see Budapest from a side which we have never done before. There is a regular boat cruise which goes up and down on the Danube and it has stops on both sides. Such a stop looks like a bus station, with time table, maps and everything. Boats are not so young, but with powerful engines and both interior and deck space. Usually in good weather the deck space is not enough, everybody wants to stay there.Going up on the river is nothing special, but going down implies some interesting maneuvers, in order to dock the ship, as during docking it will always turn it's nose against the water flowing direction. Due to the fact that not only the things you can see on the riverside but also the ships which you may see coming and going near you , the overall experience is marking it's spot on the personal memories list, both for adults and kids. For enthusiasts who want a little bit of adventure, I recommend the boat-bus, which , seen from the distance, can give you the shivers while going into the water and then cruising upwards on the Danube. Next time I'll definitely try it."

Best to book ahead but in June it wasn't necessary - you could just turn up at the office near the landing stage half an hour before it left and buy a ticket on the spot.It takes about 90 minutes to Esztergom, and if you come back by hydrofoil too it gives about 6 hours in Esztergom for sightseeing, lunch, etc - a lot more than you'd get if you were travelling by boat. On the other hand, in the hydrofoil you're closed in a noisy metal tube, sitting in seats halfway between aeroplane seats and train seats, unable to get out. There are windows, and a television screen showing what's ahead, but you get nothing like the romantic view of the Danube bend you'd get on a boat. The Esztergom hydrofoil also stops in Visegrad. From Budapest to Visegrad takes about an hour.For times, ask Mahart (36/1-318-1223 for English speakers) , In June, the hydrofoil left Budapest at 0900 and started off back at 1700, I think. It should be possible to get the hydrofoil up to Esztergom (tickets are sold one way or return), then a bus back to Budapest, maybe stopping off somewhere on the way. If that sounds a good idea, check bus-times first. The baslica in Esztergom's built on a hill, and it can be a nasty trek, especially if it's a hot day or you aren't too fit. If you'd like to arrange for a taxi to meet you when you arrive in Esztergom and drive you up, there are telephone numbers for two taxi firms on the Eszterghom hydrofoil landing stage - 06 30 / 309 01 05 and 06 306 340 403."

The included excursions were well organized, enjoyable and informative. Overall I was very pleased with the trip. The only significant negative is the extra charge I paid for a balcony room. At all the ports, ships were double parked so you looked out your room window directly into another ship; making the balcony useless. Since most of the travel was at night, the balcony was not much use when the boat was moving. This is not a Viking issue, I noticed all the different cruise lines had the same issue. I would use Viking again due to the quality of the service of the staff."

I don't want to talk about the food as we are still trying to shed some weight we gained trying different dishes. The variety of food was amazing. Our first night on the ship was while it was docked in Budapest and the view was amazing, the weather was perfect and we enjoyed each and every day on our cruise."

If you are staying in Budapest and buy a multi day bus and metro pass you can use it to catch a boat on the river that acts as a bus.We took the no2 tram down to Petofi bridge the caught the boat up to Arpad bridge at the top end of Margret island,the trip took about one hour as the boat pulls in at several stops.You get great views of the city and all the bridges on the trip but there is no commentary on the boat,as we had seen most of the sights on land this did not matter its just a good way of seeing the sights from the river."

After coming back a from excursions a couple of days when it was a little chilly, they would give us warm cups of tea or warm washcloths. We felt very catered to. The only down side, and this was only because it was chilly and rainy, is that there is only one room to be in other than your cabin.

My wife & I took the night-time cruise at 10 PM on Monday 5/12 with the cocktail option (no food).Assembling & getting started was hugely inefficient. The meeting place was on a street beside the Four Seasons where folks started to gather even before the 9:30 starting time. After the group was complete, we all walked several blocks to the pier (to which it would have been easy to go directly...). After boarding, my wife & I went upstairs to the aft, open-air fantail area so we could be outside with unobstructed views.Once we were underway, the illuminated buildings, statues & bridges were beautiful, but there were far fewer that one might have thought. The boat took a long loop north to the Parliament Building then south to the Liberty Bridge & back to our starting place. Without any narration & dreadful champagne, the tour was - for a while - visually engaging, but then it sagged & dragged.We're glad we did it, but in our opinion the tour operator should improve the assembly process, add English narration (& perhaps other languages with headphones), & decent drinks."

The Impression was a new boat and we started the tour in Prague. We were so pleased with the Captain, the Crew and all of the organization for our trip. Our tour had a complication with the river being too low to cruise which obviously can happen. We ended up by staying longer in Passau Germany than expected but I would have to say the cruise line did everything possible to make up for that issue. They bused us to all of the sights we had reserved for touring and paid for a concert in Vienna on their behalf. I am sure every cruise line has river issues but I was impressed with how accomodating Avalon Tours was. The food was good, it got even better as the cruise progressed and the entire crew whether it be the main reception area, the crew on the Impression, the Cruise Director and ours was Andrej (can't say enough about how great he was) made our stay well worth it. River cruises on the Danube can have it's problems. Two years ago a river cruise line had to cancel and refund everything due to high water. We were lucky, we just had two days in Passau Germany (a delightful town). This was my first river cruise and I highly recommend Avalon Tours from my experience. We went with a group of 8, met many others, had some wonderful experiences, would have booked earlier to get a cabin on a higher floor (we were on the first floor) but it didn't change our trip in the least. I was impressed with Avalon, don't know about others. If you get Andrej as your Cruise Director, you will be pleased. Can't vouch for the river levels on the Danube!!"

We had a bit of time prior to the departure of the cruise and were able to see some of the sights of Budapest. The evening views of the lit-up bridges and town were spectacular, as we sailed away on our adventure. In May 2014, we spent a couple of days in Budapest and enjoyed a walk along the river. Although there is a lot more traffic on the river than there was in 2007, we were still able to appreciate its beauty and significance.

Daytime one is good - nice freebie! - goes quite a way down the river past the island and all the way back. pretty basic facilities on board. the one at night was a different story - was marketed as lovely dinner/music cruise so thought it would be relaxing - it is very nice to see the buildings lit up at night so worth the trip but was hard to find the boat to start with then when we did board it is all quite rushed as it doesnt go for very long - so get on, welcome drink, then wine then dinner and music then off - all fairly quickly. We could tell that they must have had another cruise right after ours so they were keen to get everyone off quite quickly"

While the boat is beautiful with excellent service and many interesting included excursions (although some are extra), future passengers need to be aware that many companies have added and are adding new boats to this river (and many other European rivers) on a regular basis. This leads to double and even triple side-by-side docking of boats. We were not happy to look out the window of our suite (for which we had paid a premium) and find we were looking directly into the bedroom of another boat only inches away. This happened several times at various ports and also necessitated climbing through one or more boats on occasion to get to shore. In addition it led to very crowded conditions in many of the excursion cities, since the boats of all companies seem to follow the same schedules - we saw folks from several Viking boats, other AMA boats, Uniworld, Tauck and several others. We found the same conditions on a Viking cruise of the Rhine last fall. While there is much beauty to enjoy on the Danube, the river cruise industry may be killing the goose that laid the golden egg."

But at night when we returned - it was nothing short of fabulous! The city lights just make this place look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I've been on other European rivers at sunset such as the Rhein but nothing compares to this"

It is not blue, however. Black and shiny at night, silvery with ice in the winter, lined with sunbathers and fishermen when it isn't too hot! A walk along the Pest or Buda quai (the Duna Corso) is a good way to begin, and then visit Margit Island in the middle."

The grand palaces lit up. to be honest i enjoyed it more than the eveing cruises in amsterdam or even paris.Simply gorgeous and quite romantic.fair warning it could feel really cold on the river in march. Even though the weather was night during the day..at night the windy river can be quite chilling. IMO wear a thick coat and enjoy the view. AThe light will warm you up easily.I bought a hopon and hop off ticket...so entrance to the cruise was free. Matter of fact we could cruise as often as we wanted. Glad we chose evening one.Remember during high seaso..boats could be packed."

Everybody tells of how wonderful it is taking a ride on the river either to or from the Danube Bend so we had to do it didn't we?We decided to take the Mahart Passnave boat service back to Budapest from Esztergom after using the bus to get there in the first place. The bus from Ujpest goes through Szentendre and Visigrad on the way to Esztergom giving you frequent glimpses of the river but in reality it isn't a particularly interesting or rewarding ride but it is considerably shorter in time than using the boat as it pushes upstream.We chose a Sunday to do the trip which was maybe a mistake as Esztergom seemed 'closed' when we got there. Maybe a combination of Sunday and it being the middle of May gave everywhere an almost deserted feel and look.The, rather old looking, Mahart boat is scheduled to leave for the downstream journey at 4.30pm but didn't get away for some reason until nearly 5pm. The river was still suffering from excess water, together with tree trunks etc, being washed down from somewhere upriver so much so that Belgrade and Bosnia downriver had been suffering some horrendous life taking floods. I'm assuming that this floodwater had tainted the river making it most certainly a million miles away from being the Blue Danube is it normally described as. More muddy brown.The boat was comfortable enough without being what you could call comfortable! It looked and felt old and neglected and I won't even start and describe the toilets on board.The trip was disappointing because the river was the muddy brown mentioned earlier and it was flowing very fast with not very much to see on either bank.It was a day out but not one I could recommend to others unfortunately."

We decided to use a company called EUrama for the sightseeing cruise, departure Dock 8A boat terminal near the Elizabeth bridge. The ticket is valid for 24hrs & is advertised as a hop on hop off boat tour priced at 3000HUF, approx \u00a38.50, which to me is great value for money. If you stay on the boat the round trip lasts approx 1hr. We bought our ticket from the docking station because I wanted to confirm that the same ticket was valid for both the day & night cruises, the very pleasant sales girl said it was and advised us to arrive in good time for the evening trip as they are very popular. The day tour was very pleasant, we managed to get two seats at the front of the boat giving us the perfect view & ideal for photo taking. The audio guide, over a loud speaker, is in English & German & gives a brief overview of the main attractions. We did the round trip choosing not to get off at Margaret Island. Came back in the evening for the night cruise and must say it was stunning to see the city by night from the river , an abiding memory of our holiday."

I presumed it was mis communications until the guy came to tell our group off for swapping a still water (given on table) for a sparkling one. Just no need for this attitude when working in the service industry....why? It did not spoil the beauty of the River of the chilled experience of dining on the Danube...just tainted it a bit.

However when we took an evening cruise on the Danube through the cities of Buda and Pest a feeling of awe washes over you. Each and every one of the castles and the parliament building and bridges and statues are lit and highlighted to their best advantage and show to be art in themselves. There is a pride and glory about the way the city is shown that exudes a greater time and mentally brings you into that era. We sat on an open deck, with a drink in hand, sailing along the Danube as one phenomenon led into the next and all the hype and history began to make sense. The boat rides take only an hour and there are boats doing this every 20 minutes and are well worth it. I see in my mind the effect of the Danube at night much more than viewing the sights during the day."

Many of the elderly paying passengers had to stand or miss out on briefings and could not get pre dinner drinks due to the agents taking up most of the bar and surrounds. I am writing a full account to the MD Paul Moroney but need to get this note out to warn other potential cruisers. There were passengers who had traveled with Scenic up to 6 times before but they were shocked at the activities of the agents and the lack of action by any one of the management team on board.

That floodlit wonder may very well be the most beautiful urban structure I have ever seen at night. (If there is a better-looking one in my future, this will do just fine until then.)

Boats leave about hourly, so the trips were very convenient for our schedule. The two cruises must be taken within 24 hours of each other. An audio recording in English and German was played, pointing out the various sights and giving some useful background information about them. A cruise on the Danube should certainly be taken.

I would highly recommend the Hop-on Hop-off buses (we used the red ones, though blue and green are available) The red buses have 2 routes which take in all the major sites and include both a day river cruise and a night river cruise and give 2 days travel on the buses. Really good value (around 5000 forests each if i remember rightly)"

One of our best holidays ever, our boat the Scenic Crystal was magnificent ,nearly new, the crew were the happiest hardworking bunch you could ask for, nothing too much trouble. The choice of food was exceptional as was the quality. The choice of wines, spirits and beer was superb. Facilities were fantastic with a main dining room plus two specialist high end dining areas plus a cafe for light bites.The excursions were thoughtful, varied and usually provided a choice. The highlight for me was a meal in a family home in Croatia, wonderful food, home made plum brandy and wine.Our journey included stops Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria ending at JWMarriot in Bucharest, Rumania.The really best part the cruise was all in, not a penny extra! All food and drink 24/7 all gratuities, not even a charge for the Champagne I Drank at breakfast.Very highly recommended !"

            "review": "Danube River - Dividing Buda and Pest. The Danube is a major river in central and eastern Europe that is the second longest waterway on the continent. This river cuts through the centre of Budapest separating Buda on one side of the river and Pest on the other. A popular way to enjoy the Danube is to take a boat cruise along the river, allowing you views of the attractions on both sides of the river. There are quite a few companies offering these services which you can find online or by visiting the Budapest Vacation and forum pages here on Tripadvisor. Similarly, there are floating restaurants mooring in the Danube that you can visit for an interesting dining experience. Floating hotels are available as well keen to try something very different. Another way to enjoy the Danube is to walk one of the many bridges that cross the river, linking Buda and Pest. The two that we enjoy most are Chain Bridge and Liberty Bridge. Chain Bridge is excellently located in the heart of the city centre area for Pest and just under Castle Hill on the Buda side of the river. Liberty (Freedom) Bridge is further south, linking the two sides near the famous Gellert Hotel on the Buda Side and Spa and the Great Market Hall in Pest. For very nice views, you can walk along the Danube Promenade or even take the famous yellow Tram Line 2 along the river. This affords nice views of the river and Buda, allowing you to see Castle Hill and its attractions on this side of the Danube. For best views of the Pest side of the river, you can make the leisurely climb up Gellert Hill or make your way Buda Castle or St. Matthias Church and Fisherman's Bastion where you will be richly rewarded with stunning views of the river and the Pest side of the river. Views of the gothic style Parliament building is gorgeous from up here, especially on clear days.In the end, much of what Budapest has to offer is found near the Danube so you are very likely to end up on or near the river at some stage of your holiday. Just have your camera ready so you can snap a few pictures of the Danube and the beautiful city buildings and attractions which line its banks."

            "review": "Viking Christmas Market. I am going to be much more critical than is warranted because I want to point out the limited downfalls of Viking. Overall, we would rate this trip an 8-9 out of 10 so we liked it and would do another. I think it important to research what type of cruise you want to do. Viking does a much focused type of cruise with a very set schedule. It\u2019s kind of like going on vacation where the first day, you just relax and say \"I am on vacation\" and don't fight it. Viking can be very very set in their ways and for the most part, they do all they can to make this a good experience. However, if you want something out of the ordinary, like upgrade your room, schedule a airport transfer or if you want to tip with anything other than Euro or US$, then they are not flexible and it can be irritating. They could work on that a bit. Our cruise was a Christmas Market Cruise and we did everything and more than we had hoped to. We booked our own airfare only because we did not know better. Viking works best if you use all of their services and if you confine your trip to what they offer. If you book airfare with them or extended stay, then they will make sure they meet you at the airport and take you back. One caution however is that you must remember that there is no such thing as a $199 air fare that they tout once in a while. It is simply that Viking is subsidizing part of that cost so they do not discount their room, which they very very very seldom do. When you book your air fare through Viking make sure you look at the flight times and layovers. That $199 airfare will most likely get you stuck in an airport for a few hours or a longer flight home so just check the details. We ended our trip in Passau, Germany so for 95% of the group, the trip was over and they needed to go to Munich airport for their flight back home. While I suspect not normal, one couple had to get up at 2 am to catch their bus. Let me explain. The drive to Munich is 2 hours so they allow 3. They schedule pickup 1/2 hr prior to that and then you need to be at the airport to 2-3 hrs ahead of time. If you have a 7 am flight, booked for you by Viking (can you say $199 air fare?), then you get the idea. On our trip, we booked our own airfares and were able to screw up our own schedule by allowing a 4 hr layover in Amsterdam so you need to get involved. You have to remember that you are in the middle of the night when you get to your first layover so my advice is to pick a flight to minimize layovers and look closely at departure times and where the airport is. Doing this will greatly improve your experience. The other somewhat irritating issue is tipping. Viking being an American/Swiss company asks you to partially subsidize their costs and tip at the end of the trip. Its the American way. It was interesting watching the Tour Director and others encourage tipping in Europe where there is no tipping. This is completely up to you but they do lay on the guilt trip for you. Something I felt amusing is that they will only accept tips in euro or US$. If you are to tip, a great way to get rid of the misc currency, from Hungary for example which is not euro, is to leave that as part of the tip. NOPE, we only accept euro and US$. I never had anyone tell me before when I was giving money away that they wanted it only in certain form. Viking could work on this.Now the good part. There are only 170 or so people so this is not a 3,000 person Princess Cruise so you need to rethink this. With only 170, they can plan pretty well. I liked the single dining experience. We had time for Happy Hour and usually a brief talk about what was going on the next day in the Lounge and then you had 1/2 hr or so to make your way to the dining room. I would rate the food overall 7 out of 10 which I think is pretty good. If you are a picky eater, look closely at the menu and you will find a C\u00e9sar salad always available with Salmon or chicken on it or some other dish so look and ask. We purchased the unlimited bar which probably was not worth it $150 euro or $200US each but it did boost the level of the trip. We ordered a bottle of wine off the separate list each evening and had a few cocktails before or after the meal. It was nice not putting yourself in a position of wondering how much it was. On the other hand, if you can eliminate worrying about the cost, then I think you could drink as much as you want for less than the $200 per person. A bottle of wine was about $30. A typical day started with a pretty good breakfast that started at 6 and went to 9AM. You can get a European breakfast of cold cuts and cheese of a Texas breakfast of eggs, bacon, ham, sausage etc. You get the idea. Following breakfast 6 days out of 7 is the tour of the day that is usually included in your booking fee. They do have a couple of side trips like an opera (that only 50% thought was good enough to warrant going). Most tours have a guide who wears a microphone and broadcasts a monologue as they walk. Each room and person is provided a devise to listen (make sure you charge it every night) This works very well. The walks are not that difficult and normally Viking, after the first day, formulates a special tour group for those that do not want to or cannot keep up and they do it gracefully. Given that this was the Christmas Market Trip, we usually had a tour of town and then back to the boat which was almost always close to the market or you could easily walk. Trying to figure out where to spend your time was never a problem. It was a bit cold so we always looked forward to getting back about 4 for happy hour and talk to other guests about their experience. Always about 5 or 6 the tour director would come in and have a presentation about the next day\u2019s trip (always something you want to do) Following was open seating dinner but within a couple of days you started to know people and which ones to sit with and which ones to avoid if you know what I mean. .Not very often did we need to avoid anyone but we did form a little group that sat together each evening so the conversation was not ever strained. Especially with two of the ladies that loved to shop. At one point, one of the ladies had to buy luggage in town just to bring back to the ship what she bought.Let me summarize my suggestions for booking with Viking. If you can do all of the booking with them, do it however make sure you look at the times and discuss when you need to be off the boat. Consider arriving a day or two ahead to get used to the time change. If you arrange your own air travel or decide to extend your trip without Viking I highly suggest you make your own arrangements. We wanted to go to Munich to meet some friends and booked a Transfer from the ship to the airport. Viking wanted $150 euro each for this but we bought it. We only had one day in Munich so we wanted and early transfer and were told by Viking a number of times that their guests are first and they will take us when they have time. We canceled with a $30 fee each and rented a car for $100 euro and had a wonderful drive. Viking takes care of its own and after that you are better working it out yourself. Bottom line we would and will take another Viking Cruise but will not leave the travel details to them as it should be. You need to watch out for yourself"

We had booked a dinner cruise on the Danube for our final evening in Budapest & it was perfect.We were asked to meet fellow diners at the Budapest Palace (just behind the Four Seasons Hotel) & from there all walked together with our host for about 5 or 6 minutes where the boat was waiting just by the Chain Bridge.Welcomed on board with a glass of champagne & led to our table. Very well presented & not cramped at all.Live music played throughout the cruise giving it a lovely romantic atmosphere,The views were spectacular which ever side of the boat you were on so everyone could enjoy the magnificent buildings all illuminated showing off their splendour, Food was buffet style & plentiful comprising of salads, goulash soup, several hot dishes, breads & deserts. The dinner included 3 drinks - champagne on arrival, wine or beer plus water, You could purchase more & the prices were very reasonable.Once you had finished your meal, you could spend time on the outdoor upstairs deck.All staff very pleasant & helpful & even organised a taxi to take us back to our hotel when as the cruise was coming to an end.Do this cruise & you'll love it as did we"

The beauty of this city at night was so much more than any of us expected, and everyone in the group found it breathtaking. They light up all the buildings (and the historic architecture is spectacular) all along the Danube for several miles, and this includes the many bridges that cross the river. I could never do the experience any justice in trying to describe it, but I can tell that you should NOT miss it if you have the opportunityWe had a perfect September evening for the trip- pleasant temperature and perfectly clear skies. A light jacket or sweater was all that was needed for being out on the upper deck to observer the city from the boat. The timing couldn't have been better.Our dinner cruise included delicious local fare in a large buffet on the lower, enclosed deck of the boat, along with drinks. Once we had finished eating, everyone went up to the upper deck to view the city. By that time, darkness had settled in, and the boat began to turn around for the trip back to the center of town. The large, impressively elegant buildings and bridges were brightly lit, making them pop out of the background of the night sky.. and this went on for miles as we leisurely made our way back down the river. n fact, many of us noticed that what we might have thought were very bright twinkling stars were actually birds (presumably white gulls) dancing and diving overhead, reflecting the bright light that shone on the buildings. Again- I can't do this justice. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this evening that everyone in our group found unforgettable."

The trip (about an hour) was great for photo shoots, even though I am not particularly good at photography. On the return leg we were able to disembark at a pier close to our hotel. I would recommend the trip"

Staff on the ship were wonderful and the food was great. Special thanks to Jan our cruise director. Bikes provided by the ship were top notch. Bike all day at a nice pace with frequent stops for sights, beer and wine. Biking was all on paved paths and 80 % downhill slope. Vineyards, vistas, castles, history, super architecture, fruit trees everywhere and nice people. We packed our lunches each morning from the buffet and stopped for picnics and at pubs. Nightlife on the ship and shore were a lot of fun. If you don't feel like biking on any of the days, you can watch the scenery go by from indoor or outdoor decks. A hot lunch is served to those on board. This was one of the best vacations my wife and I have ever taken. Strongly advise that you do some biking before the trip to condition your butt. It's not your legs that will betray you on this trip."

This might help you make note of the places you want to visit while there."

We did not get coveted outdoor seats but noticed many people coming indoors toward the end of the 1hr tour, the river is quite chilly at night, wear a sweater. The narration and accompanying video were well produced, informative and was well timed with what we could see out of the floor to ceiling windows. Both sides of the boat seemed to get great views with historical facts. We enjoyed this evening cruise and the choice of wine, champagne or water as a final activity to our weekend in Budapest."

Cycling vienna to budapest along the danube! We arrived at our first hotel The Austria Trend Donauzentrum in wien at about 10pm Europe was having a heat wave and it was incredibly hot this hotel had no air conditioning but did supply a fan thank goodness. We had all the information, maps, hotel vouchers etc waiting for us at this hotel. The following morning was the welcome meeting and bike pickup the guy was very helpful and made sure all bikes were ok for everyone arriving so late we had no time to look at the maps so had no idea really where we were going but off we went. It was hot hot hot! But off we set for our next destination the Hotel Marc Aurel in petronell-carnuntum we kept going wrong the maps were not clear but it was lovely along the river eventually after doing an extra 10k we arrived again this hotel had no air con but found a fan on request otherwise lovely hotel. There wasn't much happening here and for me not the best overnight stop would of preferred somewhere livelier. T he next morning on to hotel park inn danube in bratislava we were getting the hang of how the maps pieced together now and found today's cycling much easier the hotel was wonderful it had air con and bratislava was really worth the visit and needed longer there. Next morning on to hotel lajta park in mosonmagyarovar hungary again wonderful hotel lovely place to look around and would of liked longer there. Next day onto hotel klastrom in gyor for a two night stay loved it here.next day onto the hotel gottwald in tata probably the best hotel we stayed in it was a bit out of town and after a days cycling in 39degree heat (that temperature taken in the shade) we did not feel like getting back on our bikes to explore the tow this was my least favourite days cycling it was all on the road! However that night there was a special function within the hotel gardens we were offered places and had a great evening so well organised we were sat with bikers that by chance we had met only the night before at the previous hotel. The next day disaster struck we had such a good night the previous night we didn't go to bed until 2.30am and so was late getting up and late getting out luggage down for the 9.00am pickup for transfer to next hotel and everyone else's cases had gone! After a minutes panic I called the number we had been given in case of problems. The man from saddle skedaddle said he would come back and get them and by the time we got to the next hotel Bellevue konferencia e's wellness hotel in esztergom the cases were waiting again lovely hotel to get to it we had cut through vineyards at top of hills beautiful countryside but finished up on the road. Our final days cycling to the hotel gellert in budapest this was the furthest distance at 80k but also the easiest the weather cooled a bit with a thunderstorm and rain for a short time making the temperature much more bare able the hotel was grand but old fashioned not particularly my taste but the service was excellent. Budapest again definitely not enough time for such a magnificent city. I would thoroughly recommend a cycling holiday with saddle skedaddle we are considering another we have learnt a heat wave is not a good time because it makes easy distances seem ridiculously long and prevented us from exploring the area en route just the places we stayed. We have also learnt to book an extra night at the key places for us that would be Budapest tata gyor bratislava and possibly esztergom seen some lovely places stayed in great hotels most had pools or spas and the company really made sure it went well. Anyone planning this kind of holiday for first time might see if they could get a preview of the maps."

They told us that we simply needed to go to the office with our receipt and our boarding passes. After we checked in we went to the office, but they needed to see the actually stuff we had purchased which had been checked. We also were not told and they had no idea that there was an 8 Kg weight limit on items brought into the cabin. Thus we had to check our carry ons. Everyone we noticed was in the same \"boat\" and all were furiously opening cases and removing jewelry and other valuables to take on board with them.

Although the Danube isn't as blue as the famous song \"blauen Donau\" might make you to believe, the sides of the river through Budapest are build up with fabulous majestic buildings. Even if you walk the river sides and cruise the Danube during the day, do not pass by the opportunity to enjoy a night time cruise on the river. The buildings are lit up and their golden shine reflects in the water. Absolute best time is starting after sunset when the sky is multicolored and ending in dark. The night cruises take about one hour. There are plenty of options to choose from and you will be given ample chances to investigate those options as representatives of each company will approach you whenever you get close to the Danube. We found Dunayacht to be the cheapest and best value. If you use the daytime Dunayacht to visit Margaret Island, you should know that only every second boat, that is every two hours, the boat will dock on the island. So if you stop, you only have a boat back two hours later. The Dunayacht sells snacks and drinks on board, but is not a party boat, so it is nice and quiet."

As I hummed Strauss' \"Blue Danube\" on riding to town from the airport, I learned from the driver that on its best days the Danube is green. During our stay, however, it was brown, no doubt due to the recent record-breaking floods. As the second longest river in Europe, the Danube is a busy waterway with barges from many lands competing with passenger ships for priority in berthing and transiting the locks. We could sit for hours watching the river traffic. And so we did on our cruise from Budapest to Amsterdam. The Danube separates Buda from Pest and is crossed by several bridges, which also provide wonderful views of the river and the city."

There are many operators selling river tours and dinner cruises. You have to work out which is the best value for money as they are not cheap.There is a public water transport service which will take you up and down the Danube and we used this service with a 72 hour transport pass.A walk along on of the many promenades in the day or night is rewarding or just sitting on a garden seat under a shady tree and watching the river rolling on.

There was ample food to go around and the selections were adequate. While there was no one dish that stood out as exemplary, there was no shortage as the food keeps coming out of the kitchen. It is like any other regular buffet with champagne. Waitpersons were all very attentive, filling our water glasses as needed.After dinner, we were advised by our tour director that we could go up to the upper floor so we can have better view of what this evening cruise has to offer. She was right. This ordinary dinner cruise was enhanced and boosted by the spectacular view of The Parliament and other lighted buildings at night. It was the highlight of the evening! What a sight! This somehow balanced the exorbitant price for such an ordinary buffet."

Be aware though that the standard cabins are to be avoided at all costs unless you enjoy an airless dark room below the the waterline. You should also be aware that the average age of the passengers is probably over 75. The bar is deserted after 10 at night! We took the Silver drinks package which was not cheap at \u20ac150 each but was well worth it, certainly the bar measures were not small! The best direction is def Nuremberg to Budapest as you finish your cruise in a beautiful city rather than the last day on an industrial canal.The food was spectacularly good and there was always a choice if you didn't fancy the main menu items. The beer is standard continental lager (cold, fizzy and fairly tasteless) but the wine with the meal was good even if they did serve the white wine at room temperature, horrid!The cruise was perhaps a little lacking in nightly entertainment and one night we were treated(!) to a lecture on the EU which put most people immediately to sleep. The Europeans were not interested and the Americans didn't understand it. The excursions were well guided but be aware again that you will see so many Churches and little else. Oh for a visit to a brewery or winery or indeed anything that was not a church or monastery.Don't bother with the organ recital, it is very loud and the choice of music awful.Vienna was the highlight without a doubt."

It was a wonderful experience from start to finish. Uniworld is definitely a cut above Viking, everything was included and taken care of seamlessly, from shore excursions and walking tours, to wine and beer at lunch and dinner. More about our experience can be found on Cruise Critic as well as on the Uniworld web site.The cruise starts in Passau, Germany and ends in Budapest. Cruising the Danube was a wonderful way to visit the Christmas markets in four countries in only 7 days. When we docked, we were always in the historic part of each city as the river flows right through the center of town. In Budapest, the Danube separates Buda, the hilly portion, where the Castle District is located, from Pest, where the terrain is flatter. Although the Danube River was not beautifully blue in the middle of winter reflecting the cloudy gray skies overhead, it was very scenic with great views passing through quaint villages especially in Bavaria and Austria. We saw the famous Chain Bridge of course. In both Budapest and Vienna, the gorgeous panoramic views of the city with cathedrals and buldings floodlit at night, was a sight to behold. And each Christmas Market was unique to the area featuring many hand-crafted specialties not to be found elsewhere."

It makes a very cheap river cruise, as a single ticket costs only 450 HUF (\u00a31.50), and they also accept holders of 24-hour public transport passes. Look on the tourist maps for stops, which are marked on the river banks with a modern 'bus shelter' with timetables and a 'bus stop' showing a D.

The journey was lovely and included two free drinks which came as a pleasant surprise as we weren't told of this when we booked! Poodling along on the beautiful Danube with a glass of red in hand is highly recommended! Commentary excellent and very educational telling the story of Buda and Pest. This is a definite to-do when in Budapest, in fact it should be compulsory!"

There are many historic buildings that serve as a wonderful backdrop as you go up and down the Danube in Budapest. You can do this either by boat, there are many great boat rides some with meals others just sight seeing boats. There is also a cool option of taking Tram #2. This tram basically rides up and down one side of the Danube and you will be in awe of how pretty it is, and the price is around 2 euros to take the tram. Great option day and night."

All of the staff on board the Amacerto were top drawer and you wanted for absolutely nothing. Meals were amazing by executive chef Gino, rooms were very modern and kept spotless by very friendly staff and everyone was open and approachable up to and including the Captain, Jan de Bruijn. There was loads of room on board even though it was winter and nobody was using the top deck. No need to sit in your room at all. The excursions at each port were very well laid out with top notch guides and the staff on board provided maps and all the information you could need if you wished to set out exploring on your own. Once in Prague we still had the attention of the the cruise manager Korana who made sure everyone got to their excursions and made their connecting flights when it was time to leave. I highly recommend this trip as Europe has so much to offer and the staff of AmaWaterways will ensure you have the time of your life."

Took the one with no extra drinks or food, just cruise itself from 'hop on hop off' tour - for two tickets we paid less that 5000 HUF for 1h long cruise. It started at 5 PM so we had a beautiful view of Budapest at night. Also we got audioguides - languages that can be chosen are (as far as I remember): hungarian, british english, french, russian, german, polish, italian, chinese and japanese but those two were messed up - chinese number is 21, not 20 and japanese is 20, not 21 (or the other way but it shouldn't be a big problem).Really worth going :) there are also more expensive cruises but including lunch, dinner or even romantic cruise for 2 people with massage, dinner with music, champagne and plate of fruits - no matter if you are single, in relationship or have a family, everyone can find something for him/herself"

            "review": "Christmas time cruising not up to expectations. We took the AMAWaterways Christmas Time Cruise from Budapest to Nuremberg. Our dates included 19-27 Dec and we looked forward to seeing a different Christmas Market every day as the on-line information indicated. Well, once aboard we were informed that most Christmas markets closed on 24-Dec which actually turned out to be generous as they actually begin closing on the 23rd. And we also overlooked the fact that Central Europe in general closes down on Christmas eve so not only were the Christmas markets closed, so were all the other stores. We did enjoy the Budapest markets and the ones in Vienna, but other than that we saw no other Christmas Markets and since the 24th, you can't even buy aspirin in town because even the pharmacies are closed up tight. You can correct our oversite by taking the same cruise route in reverse from Nuremberg to Budapest the week earlier. The second reason to consider a different cruise is that we are still on the cruise right now, but we have been stuck in Passau for the last two days. The river rose a couple of days ago and we have been dockside ever since because we can't get under the bridges. I am not sure how to avoid this issue, but it does affect your holiday. The cruise line is providing bus service to the ports of call that we were scheduled to visit, but today's trip was a 2.5 hour (each way) bus ride to Nuremberg followed by walking tours in the town. We just couldn't get fired up about spending 5 hours in a bus. We are enjoying a relaxing day aboard ship, but it's not too different than being at home so we are disappointed.The positive notes are that the AmaCerto is a brand new boat and is well appointed with a courteous crew. The food is good and the cabins are small but efficient. Beds are comfortable and overall the boat is quiet and comfy."

If you want to take the cruise but not spend a ton of money on a lunch cruise with tourists eating bad goulash and drinking bad Tokaj wine, here is the best way: catch the water taxi going UP river at Boraros Ter (the tram will drop you off there) - make sure you go in advance and check the hours (and make sure you ask if it is the right boat as there are many). You can then sit on a boat with chairs on the deck and cruise all the way to to Aquincum for the equivalent of a few US dollars, and then back (you have to pay another ticket though). It is important to get on the boat at south as Boraros Ter in the \"high\" season because the boat gets full quickly and it has a maximum capacity. Late afternoon is an ideal time to do it."

At first we headed away from the sites and were surprised to find we were being asked to get off at quite a distance on the Buda side when we got on at Pest... but the pilot, who spoke English, informed us he was indeed going back and all the way to Margit Island, we just had to pay another 400 each :) So, for 1600 for two we had a charming \"cruise\" and took some fabulous photos at dusk and got off very close to the tram terminus. In our view, much more what we had in mind than paying 2100 each for a cruise at night."

We arrived in Munich, Germany on Oct 28 and had pre-purchased transfers to the boat the MS Sound of Music, in Nuremberg. At first it was a little difficult finding the tour guide, but after asking two people at the terminal building we found the restaurant meeting place. The ride from Munich to Nuremberg was about 2 1/2 hours (due to traffic). Having failed to find any reviews on the MS Sound of Music we were a little concerned at what we might find...however we were very pleased with the ship. The ship was built in 2006 and is well maintained, clean and comfortable. The cabin staff prepared our cabin well. The dining room staff were exceptional....the first night I was asked if I had any food allergies and told them \"onions\"....it was amazing that anywhere I sat for a meal and whoever served me knew about the \"onion allergy\". Now that's great service! The food was very good, but not elaborate. The breakfast was repetitive, but they did have daily specials. The tour manager and tour guides were very good and well educated in the areas that we visited. We did purchase 2 optional tours.The age group of the guests was 55-80, but we brought our daughter and son-in-law (low 30's). They were by far the youngest people on the boat. Actually, they were referred to as \"the kids\". But they had a great time and really enjoyed themselves. We made several friends on this cruise. Everyone was exceptionally nice.Anyone concerned about the Gate 1 Danube River Cruise should be at ease...you'll have a good time and the cost of the trip is a bargain. This was our second Gate 1 Tour (Egypt 2009), which was also very good and well worth the price. We also used Viking for China and feel that Gate 1 is the better bargain."

Interestingly, the Hungarian aerobatic pilot, Peter Be\u0161enji, flew by plane turned upside down under a bridge, and since then it's a standard attraction that is running on the \"Red Bull\" races. Beside the bridge is a monument of marble in the form of zero and a so-called. \"Zero kilometer\", a place where all distances are measured in Hungary.The next bridge is the \"Erzesbet hid\", built 1903rd , but it was the Germans destroyed the 1945th, the current version was built in the 1964th The simplest, but no less beautiful is \"Szabadsag hid.\" Connects the public bath \"Gallert\" in Buda with the largest shopping mall in Budapest. \"Petofi hid\" has long been the most southernmost and most heavily traffic. However, building the \"L\u00e1gym\u00e1nyos hid\" the bridge, which is the latest in Budapest, that has changed.This bridge will leave you breathless.

Just returned home from our Danube cruise ( Amalegro )and overall it \"exceeded expectations\" which we were told is the Amawaterways objective when we arrived. It wasn't just lip service we are happy to report.My wife and I have been on 3 Mediterranean cruises ( Celebrity and Princess lines) over the past 6 years, which we enjoyed very much. This was our first river cruise. We liked the smaller scale and more relaxed, casual feeling.The ports of call were all interesting. Some capital cities, some small towns. Something for everyone. We were traveling with our parents, who had a different energy and mobility level then me and my wife but we all enjoyed ourselves at our own pace. They provided a \"gentle walkers\" group at most of the excursions, which worked out great. They also provided us with a wheelchair for the excurions which were more on foot, just in case we needed it. We had some concerns about the quality of the food, but we found the food very tasty and there were lots of choices. Having the wine included in the meal every night at no extra charge was also a big plus and saved us quite a bit compared with the larger cruise experience. We found the onboard entertainment generally good. Some better than others, but nevertheless fine for relaxing in the lounge. We opted to do a few days in Prague on our own before the cruise, which worked out good for us and we would recommend it. Prague is a beautiful city. We can't comment on the pre-cruise packages that Ama provides. We really enjoyed the two bike tours ( incuded at no extra charge ) if you get the chance to do it.Not strenuous and very scenic. Having the bikes available at every port at no charge was a nice benefit.We did not go on the \"optional\" excursions so cannot comment, but all the included excursions were very nice and it was nice that it was not an extra charge like the larger cruise lines. The rooms were nicely appointed, clean, and well maintained. Beds and bedding were very comfortable. Small, like most cruise lines rooms are, but certainly not unusually so. We enjoyed having the sliding glass door \"French Balcony\" in the room since we did not opt for the full balcony. The entire ship was kept clean and we are a bit fussy on this issue. One small frustration was that the in-room entertainment system could have been better. Limited t.v. channels and just a few movies. Maybe they will expand that in the future if they get enough feedback. Internet service was also very spotty and could use an upgrade. Small irritations in the overall scheme of things. Our trip ended in Budapest, which is a big city, and lots to see and do. We would have enjoyed another day or two on our own there, or returning for a couple more days in Vienna, which is also an amazing city, but had decided to head for home when the cruise was over. The travelers on board were about 40% American, 40% Canadian, and 20% others from around the world. We met some very nice folks and hope to keep in touch. All in all we would definately recommend it to family and friends if you like a casual, but active, experience."

If you buy the 7 days public transportation card (not the budapest card that lasts only 3 days and is more expensive) you can use every public transport , ferries included (not in we!). Ther are about 5 or 6 stops long the danube for ferries 11 and 12 and you can go from south to north ferries terminal in about 1 hour- 1 hour and half (the return is a bit faster). Ferries are a bit veru old and with rust but if you get a chair free you can enjoy the travel and the best thing is that is free! We used them to make an afternoon tour but we use them also to move ourself during our stay. SInce you are in your vacations you have not to run fast from place to place...and why not doing it witha a good panorama? They runs about every half hour and they are clearly signed if they are going \"down\" or \"up\" the river (don't look at the direction where they stop because the stop is only on the right side of the ferry so also the south direction ferry is in the same direction of the north one when they are stopped)."

The river cruises (with dinner, sometimes even a show) are very touristic (what else), but you can take one of the regular \"river buses\" (boats which make part of the city's transportation system) and see the embankment..

Especially for those who are visiting Budapest for the first time, we would highly recommend spending at least an hour right at the beginning of your trip on a cruise on the river Danube to sit back, relax, and enjoy amazing view on the 2 banks of the Danube - you wont regret it! We were recommended by our local friend to book a cruise with the official cruising company: the Mahart, and you can buy your tickets by the booth close to the river around Vorosmarty Ter. Beautiful views of the Parliament building, Castle hill and various bridges will captivate you as you bask in partial sunlight (or moonlight!) with the cool sea breeze in your hair. Headsets were provided to us with english commentaries, and there were options to buy refreshments on board. We really enjoyed the brief introduction of the history of the country and buildings provided during the cruise. We feel that it is equally stunning to take this cruise in the day or night time as the night view of the city skyline is also really beautiful. Enjoy your ride!"

We took the night tour, which is a real treat. The distant castle was lighted up in the dark background, reminiscent of fairytale. The most inspiring experience is seeing the parliament building in a gilded shine. The staff members are all multilingual, speaking English, French, German, Russian, Spanish and Japanese. BTW beverages were severed on board. Interestingly only Czech not Hungarian beer is available, if you ask for an one."

The crusie is a short one (1 hour) and many restraurants are nearby for dinner. Day two, a 10 PM cruise with fabulous illuminated buildings is NOT to be missed.

But my experience is that it is even more beautiful when taking a cruise down this lovely waterway at night.Just imagine: on a balmy evening with the water calm and the evening breeze brushing your face, you will gaze at the buildings and landmarks that are lit up on both shores aginst the darkened sky like gems on a black velvet cloth. As your boat lazily pass under all the famous bridges that are now serene and devoided of tourists, marvel at their different architectural styles in the warm inviting glow. Let your eyes feast on the statues under the bridges that are visible only when you sail by. Raise your glass to the sweet Budapest night sky and say to yourself ah, this is life. "

Four of us took the night cruise on the Danube in the first week of July. Food and drink was definitely average as was the service. There was no music and the overall tone was one of cash cow syndrome. While this is to some extent the norm at this type of place, it could certainly improve by adding more of a local touch to the experience or by handing out some type of material to read on the panoramic views and so on. As it was, the crew of the boat was just as tired of the whole affair as were we and we were glad the trip was over."

I booked this online before I left home hoping it would be as good as it sounded - spectacular views, great traditional food and music, and wine. What a disappointment! The group did themselves no favours from the start. They said meet no later than 6.30pm for a 7pm start at Duna Palota. Well after that time, they were still accepting people coming in for bookings, while those who were on time waited in the street with increasing impatience. When they had their numbers they led the group through the streets down to the river to board the boat. Why couldn't we meet there? A glass of warm bubbly was offered on entry. When seated, another glass of wine was offered. I took a glass of warm, very poor quality, almost undrinkable white wine. I then ordered a bottle of beer which was also warm, served by an unfriendly waitress who seemed to consider how I dare question the temperature of the beer. The buffet was particularly ordinary with tasteless food, and not enough dessert for all. Judging by the amount of hot food left over, people went straight for the dessert. The bain marie was so hot that a serving spoon left in a tray was so hot that it burnt people. The cruise itself was pleasant, but due to the fact that it returned by 8.30pm when it was still light, the wonderful lights of the buildings on the banks of the Danube were not seen. The gypsy music was adequate, but we had seen a violinist the previous night who made his violin sing. By normal standards this was an expensive dinner, and therefore by Hungarian standards, it was outrageous. They asked us to fill out a feedback sheet at the end - guess what we said!"

The river separates the hilly part of Buda with its castle and Matthias church from the flat part of Pest, with the Parliament buildings and St Stephen's Basilca.It really is a photographer's dream. Get there in the morning to get the sun on Buda and return in the evening to the Parliament illuminated by the rays of the setting sun, then take a pleasure cruise at night to watch both sides, superbly illuminated, while drinking a glass of Hungarian wine. A perfect day!"

We got back from our Viking Romantic Danube cruise yesterday ( 23rd June, 2012. )The staff worked very hard to make our experience a success.The chef was a legend ( in his own mind ) and the food was satisfactory and slightly below what I personally would regard as good. Fruit was poor, bacon incinerated and the deserts exhibited spray can cream at times. The lobster was a meagre joke !The boat ( Viking Odin , three months old ) which Viking euphemistically call a ship ! experienced some teething troubles with the engine and this compromized the schedule,.It meant more coaching and less cruising and through circumstance led to a long day in Nuremberg which many found unacceptable.The lift did not work for some of the time. The TV movie services did not work for most of the trip.On the Thursday morning at 6-30 , water pump failed cutting all water/sanitation sevices on the boat.This meant that some people did not want to go to Nuremberg on Friday ( they could not have a shower ) and some decided to go who didn't want to rather than face the lack of toilet amenities.. We stayed and had a great chill out cruise time on board seeing the huge canal locks up to Nuremburg.Water was fixed by 1-30 p.m.This is not a rant or moan as we enjoyed our holiday and mechanical/electrical failure can happen. We enjoyed a Mozart evening concert in Vienna which is a \"must go\" feature of the trip. There were lots of American passengers on board and as I have not met Americans before it was very interesting and good to meet them."

Many of the city's famous and noteworthy monuments are located along the Danube, from the Parliament, to Central Market Building on the Pest side, to the churches with their towers and steeples on the Buda side. The bridges connecting the two banks are well worth walking across, with rewards for the walker or climber on the other side. Walking across the Szechenyi takes you to the Castle Hill. The Szabadsag leads you to the Gellert Hotel and the Citadella Hill, and the Erzsebet leads to the Gellert Monument and Hill. Margaret Bridge takes the visitor to the heart of Buda, or to Margaret Island. There are many restaurants, cafes, and hotels, along the Danube in downtown Pest. On a more literal level, the Danube is a great avenue to explore---by boat. Cruises allow tourists to tour the city and her islands, or else to take excursions to nearby towns along the Danube such as Visegrad, Esztergom, and Szentendre. During holidays and for special events, party cruises conduct tour groups around the city for fireworks displays and celebrations. The August 20 State Day Celebrations are a great time to see fireworks from the Danube. Regardless of what part of Budapest you are in the Danube provides something of interest for visitors."

It was just 1.5 hrs so you basically had to eat really fast. The musicians played a couple of tunes, then came around to your table to play - for a tip..... Yes, the views are nice by night, but you get the same views taking a pleasant walk across the Chain Bridge. Overall, not worth the money. Loved Budapest though!"

The four in the center are the most impressive.The bridges aren't only impressive but the views also and on the warm days they offer afree refresh. My advice choose for the chain bridge, cross it walking and take your time toenjoy the views of the Danube, Buda and Pest."

Above the deck of the cruise, we had an opportunity to take great pictures of the Parliment house, the Buda Castle and other night scenes of Budapest, braving the cold. Coming from a tropical country, it is an eye-opener to see ice sheets on the river and ice-breaking when the cruise passed through the river. The cruise lasted about an hour and half.

The lights on board were dimmed as we set off and we viewed the banks of the river through the clear roof and sides of the boat. Many ot the buildings were floodlit, even though it was January and not the tourist season, so it was a beautiful sight A film was shown on a screen and a commentary relayed through headphones in a choice of lots of anguages. Unfortunately the recorded commentary wasn't in synch with the boat so it didn't always describe what we were looking at. A \"free\" glass of champanski was included in the price (just under 5000 HUF each adult) and another drink offered as well.For me it would have been better if a live person could have pointed out places of interest as we passed rather than having to listen to a dramatised story and be distracted by the video screen - but that would be impossible with so many languages on board."

We took the 'Hop On Hop Off' bus tour for 4500 HUF each (about 15 euros: It includes on the clock bus tours of Buda and Pest, with multi-language information. It is worth it), and the price included a cruise on the Danube. The views of Budapest are certainly very beautiful and unforgettable.Tip: Take the cruise just prior to sunset, you'll have a feel during daytime, and then you'll see Budapest after sunset, which is truly amazing, especially the Parliament building.

The Danube always held people's imaginations in Budapest and I am no different.With the Pest side being flat and the Buda side being hilly, you can have a good time whether you like steep hills or not. You can walk on the promenade and look at the big hotels, universities, the Parliament or the National Theatre. It is forever changing. You can safely check out the big floods in springtime which claimed so many lives over the centuries. Alternatively you can marvel at the Christmas lights in wintertime. In high summer you can join the Budapest plage or the Sziget, the music festival.I used to spend quite a lot of time on benches by the Parliament where Attila Jozsef, the great poet is contemplating on the steps.\"... as if flowing from my heart, the Danube was murky, wise and grand.\" On a more sombre note, you can see symbols of the Jewish population shot in the Danube during the war, by way of abandoned shoes in some parts.The National Theatre is also quite interesting.The bridges however are fascinating. There is a myth that bridges are haunted by all the people who killed themselves on their first night after opening.(Much publicised by Janos Arany, the poet.)"

The central part of Budapest, which the tour covers, is not that large, so it seems like the boat goes a bit slowly. I think you could really do this tour in about half the time...but at least there is champagne to drink which makes the time go by! I think it is a bit pricey (18.50 euros)....at least compared to the similar cruises in Paris...although again, they do include 2 drinks, so it probably works out about right. The commentary (at least in English) was a bit hokey. After having said all that though, all in all, it was a nice trip and I would recommend it."

We wanted to take a boat cruise to see the city from another perspective but found that if we took a boat to Margaret Island & back rather than opting for the 1 hour tour (with guide in many languages plus welcome drink etc) it would cost 1/3 of the price.We took the boat from pier 5 on the pest side (there is a large ticket office there with information). It was 900 HUF return (instead of 3000 HUF for the 1 hour cruise) and went around Margaret Island and back every 2 hours dropping off in 2 locations on the Island. Some people stayed on and used it as a cheaper cruise option (it took about an hour in total there and back) but we got off and strolled around the Island for 2 hours (you can stay longer depending on what boat times you choose). The Japanese garden there is very pretty. There is also a water park but I dont know how much it would cost. The 2:45pm boat is the latest one to get if you want time on the Island and then catch the last boat back. The Island is connected to the main land by bridge so you can always walk back.If you are not bothered about the information/guided talk they give you on the tour cruises then this is definitely a good option & great to combine it with a stop on Margaret Island."
