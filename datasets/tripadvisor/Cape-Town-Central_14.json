From the beach you can look out into Table Bay as well as look back down the beach at Table View and Milnerton."

It\u2019s a bit of a distance from the city centre and the beautiful beaches on the Camps bay /Clifton side, which are generally wind protected. You just can\u2019t beat the view of Table Mountain from here. Be warned, that if the South Easter wind is blowing (the famous summer wind), you are going to be blown away on this beach. It\u2019s a personal choice, I would go for the view, the kite surfers love it. Public transport (Myciti bus) from the city centre is easy, you just leave the main bus hub in the city, to the main bus hub in Table view and connect onto Blouberg for another perspective of city. Things are different as is any \u201chood\u201d of Cape Town."

The beach is flat and great for a walk or a run. Sometimes it's a bit too windy and I would suggest to ware something warm just in case. Dogs are allowed and mine always has fun there, chasing the waves. It looks like the place is good for at the wind surfing too. You can find a few restaurants around for breakfast or brunch."

You get a wonderful view of Table Mountain, Leeukop (Lion's Head) and Seinheuwel (Signal Hill). Enough restaurants to choose from, for every taste. Do try the pizzas at Blue Peter! Although you can get to Blouberg by public transport, I would recommend using your own car, so that you can explore the area."

In this case, you get the added bonus of having the Table Mountain right in front of you too.

The hour long taxi journey at 5pm was worth it because the view looking back at CPT and Table Mountain is as good as a post card. The promenade where the frame is has loads of bars and had a fantastic pre-weekend vibe about it. All of us agreed that we would have been disappointed if we hadn't made the effort to go hang out here."

This beach should be renamed Selfie Beach as most everyone coming to this beach takes a selfie or 2 from this beach! Great soft sand, streches for miles. Avoid it on the south easter days (you know it is blowing when the mountain has a thin cloud over the top!) Very pet friendly as long as your dog is on a lead and you clean up after your doggies mess. Stunning sunsets over the beach and awesome little bars along the beach to enjoy watching the twinkle of the lights as dusk sets over the city."

The area attracts the wind at times and is great for the wind surfers with the colouful and their photogenic foils.

It was so entertaining watching many of the surfers. Some of them would catch a wave and the wind at the same time and they would become airborne and soar over the waves for several seconds.

To get there turn off of the R27 at the Dolfin Beach Hotel and drive to the information centre carpark. Most days there are hundreds of kite surfers - there is Kite Surfing lessons and kit hire across the road. anywhere along Blouberg beach is THE best angle to photograph Table Mountain. There are restaurants across the road if you need to eat but I suggest you drive further(about another 2km - it's signposted) to Eden on the Bay at Blouberg's Big Bay. At Eden there is one of those Yellow frames with the gps coordinates through which you can take a shot of the mountain. Big Bay has surf board and wetsuit rentals if that is your thing - the waves can get big but there are plenty of days for a novice to try their hand at surfing. All along the road to Eden and at Eden itself are eateries of varying descriptions - all the food is yummy so there's no one that stands out for me. The beaches are clean, ablutions are dotted all along the Blouberg coast - some of them are locked because they were being used as sleeping quarters for vagrants and hangouts for druggies (urghhh) but the ones at the main beaches are kept open and safe. The best swimming beaches are Small Bay, the Beach opposite The Blue Peter and the beach at Big Bay - the lifesavers clubhouse is at Big Bay. Swimming elsewhere could be dangerous unless you are a very good swimmer because of strong currents. When you park your car don't leave anything valuable visible in the car - that will just invite an opportunistic thief to break into your car. There are usually mounted and motorized police patrolling the entire beachfront to keep the area safe."

The Strand is a wide walkway, used by joggers, walkers, cyclists, dog walkers, indeed everybody - young and old. The beach is easily reached by means of gaps in the fencing and wooden slatted pathways, and the sand is soft and warm - ideal just to sit and look out to Table Mountain to the left and Robben Island to the right. It's quite breezy along there, which makes it ideal for kite surfing and surfboarding, both great to watch. There's a kite surfing school just up the way. By day it's lovely - felt very safe - and at sunset it's just superb. There are plenty of eating and drinking places just across the main road. I yearn to return."

It is also the perfect location to catch a few semi-good waves but mostly for kite surfers though.Or catching a good tan in peace and quiet. Dog friendly as well, so you can bring your pooch along to enjoy the waves with you! Parking isn't much of a problem, you'll just have to find one along the beach stretch. The ones closest to the local shops like Steers, Primi, Pakalolo, etc are always the first to go.

The eventuality was we came to live here 12 yrs ago, The walks on the Beach front are fantastic. The surrounding areas are beautiful. The cafes and restaurants are varied and boast some of the most magnificent views in South Africa. Excellent coffee shops and great coffee...Carluccis, Eden Cafe and Izabellas have super coffee... There is still an unspoilt feeling surrounding the Beach front area from the initial beach front right through to Big Bay.. All types of waterss ports are available including a great following with the Kite surfing community. We urge you to visit and experience this fabulous venue."

When I last returned I found a huge amount of building work had gone on not always to the standard that I really felt fitted in with the surroundings.There is a balance to be struck between the power of the scenery and people's desire to live near the sea and I don't think they've got it right here.One visit I find sandy dunes, the next visit I find a collection of identical two bedroomed houses each with their own miniature gardens with the original landscape destroyed.Cape Town is a victim of its own popularity but don't let me put you off, there is still much to see. For those who have not visited before, you do need a hire car because things are not compact and there is no public transport system that we would understand in Europe. Car hire is cheap enough and the standard of driving fairly good. The only proviso is I would never drive at night if I can possibly help it. This applies more in the country than in the town."

You can also see Robbeneiland in front of the beach. And you can drink or eat something in The Blue Peter at the Beach. When it's good weather you can sit outside."

At the outset, let me caution you: Blaauberg Strand is NOT for the casual swimmer. The surf is rough. Also, Cape Town has a cold side and a warm side (sea temperature), and Blaauberg Strand is very definitely on the cold side. You will not swim here, even on the hottest day! But apart from the great views, Blaauberg Strand also offers an expansive beach that is magical to walk along, literally for miles if you wish. There are good restaurants, and just sitting on the bech or walking along it are rewarding in their own right. It is also a mecca for surfers and kiteboarders"

The sun can be really intense and it is easy to get sun burnt. This with a howling wind, make you feel like you've been through a dessert blizzard when you get back your hotel.If you wear a Hat, sunscreen, sunglasses, you are all set."

A few nice pubs, restaurants making the most of the view, but nothing too sophisticated. So, if you want to see the locals having a good time and to take that perfect pic of Cape Town nestling below the mountain, Blouberg is worth a visit.

About three/four miles short of it you come into a very newly built up area with high rise flats and eateries and a huge amount of parking - think it may be called Table View. Here you also get excellent views of Table Mountain - probably just as good as Bloubergstrand.There is adequate parking in Bloubergstrand and its outskirts - plenty of car guards around and R5 is well worth paying. Plenty of seats to take in and admire the famous views across the water to Table Mountain. It is a nice walk along the beach which is obviously very popular with locals. There are a couple of nice restaurants and an ice cream van which does a good trade. I did find the constant hawkers to be a bit annoying but then I suppose it is a tourist spot.Overall it is well worth a visit, if only to actually see the view of Table Mountain that you see on so many postcards and calendars."

Lovely in Summer to play in the rock pools and on the beach.

Many little coffee shops , eateries off the beach to come and have breakfast while watching the sea even the Blue Peter Hotel close buy where you can sit on the grass and have a sun downer on a hot summers evening overlooking the sea & Table Mountain in the distance.

The sands are white and clean and the classic view of Table Mountain across the waters must be the most photographed view in South Africa. You will most certainly earn bragging rights by getting a photograph of yourself on Bloubergstrand Beach with Table Mountain in the background! People go there for 3 things - the views, the sunbathing and the water sports. The waters are cold (you have to go in with a wetsuit) but this does not seem to stop the hordes of adrenalin junkies getting into the water and doing their thing - it is apparently one of the top spots in the world for kiteboarding.The amenities are good - lots of showers and grass to lie on. There is a little tuckshop at Big Bay which sells enough to keep you at the beach if you get peckish, and the beach is patrolled by lifeguards. There is a lot of development on the go to upgrade the facilities so I can only imagine it getting better.The restaurants and b&b's in the area are also very good and all-round it is a wonderful location to spend a few days.Well worth a visit."
